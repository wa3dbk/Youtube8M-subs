00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
that it is so so high I've just pulled

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.450 
that it is so so high I've just pulled
out<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> tiny<00:01:53.170> bit<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.590> left<00:01:53.770> but<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.310> can

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
out a tiny bit to the left but you can

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.580 
out a tiny bit to the left but you can
still<00:01:54.700> see<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.119> height<00:01:55.450> of<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.659> shot<00:01:56.020> it's

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
still see the height of that shot it's

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.950 
still see the height of that shot it's
really<00:01:57.159> really<00:01:57.490> high<00:01:57.670> when<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:58.000> comes<00:01:58.180> in<00:01:58.360> so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
really really high when it comes in so

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.469 
really really high when it comes in so
landing<00:01:59.860> capabilities<00:02:00.759> were<00:02:00.939> really<00:02:01.240> soft

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
landing capabilities were really soft

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.450 
landing capabilities were really soft
once<00:02:02.290> it<00:02:02.439> lands<00:02:02.619> it's<00:02:02.799> kind<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:02.979> runs<00:02:03.190> pretty

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
once it lands it's kind of runs pretty

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.160 
once it lands it's kind of runs pretty
softly<00:02:03.960> expecting<00:02:04.960> about<00:02:05.049> 200<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:06.270> 220<00:02:07.270> 225

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
softly expecting about 200 and 220 225

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.990 
softly expecting about 200 and 220 225
yards<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.679> carry<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.160> those<00:02:09.640> two<00:02:09.819> at<00:02:09.940> the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
yards a carry and those two at the

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.620 
yards a carry and those two at the
moment<00:02:10.149> are<00:02:10.390> averaging<00:02:10.690> at<00:02:10.780> 222<00:02:12.269> let's<00:02:13.269> see<00:02:13.540> if

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
moment are averaging at 222 let's see if

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.150 
moment are averaging at 222 let's see if
we<00:02:13.750> can<00:02:13.900> get<00:02:14.019> on<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.319> green<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.800> see<00:02:15.069> how

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
we can get on that green to it see how

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:25.370 
we can get on that green to it see how
it<00:02:15.280> reacts

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.530 

so<00:02:26.380> that's<00:02:26.530> landed<00:02:26.830> pretty<00:02:27.730> good<00:02:28.090> again<00:02:28.330> just

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
so that's landed pretty good again just

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.720 
so that's landed pretty good again just
on<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.720> front<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.110> green<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.500> time<00:02:29.739> but

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
on the front of the green that time but

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.360 
on the front of the green that time but
still<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.269> can<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:32.230> high<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:32.860> as<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.220> comes

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
still you can the high on it as it comes

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.740 
still you can the high on it as it comes
into<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.790> shot<00:02:34.000> it's<00:02:34.209> really<00:02:34.510> stopping

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
into the shot it's really stopping

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.120 
into the shot it's really stopping
pretty<00:02:35.080> quickly<00:02:35.319> which<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.590> great<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.010> think

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
pretty quickly which is great I think

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.559 
pretty quickly which is great I think
that's<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> good<00:02:36.519> attribute<00:02:36.670> for<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.180> fairway

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
that's a good attribute for a fairway

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.620 
that's a good attribute for a fairway
wood<00:02:37.780> 4<00:02:38.019> hybrid<00:02:38.440> sorry<00:02:39.180> with<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.239> black<00:02:40.390> face

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
wood 4 hybrid sorry with the black face

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.180 
wood 4 hybrid sorry with the black face
and<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.870> silver<00:02:41.170> finish<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.590> makes<00:02:41.799> it<00:02:41.980> look

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
and the silver finish it makes it look

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.490 
and the silver finish it makes it look
if<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.790> wanted<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.299> look<00:02:43.450> just<00:02:43.780> at<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.110> silver

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
if you wanted to look just at the silver

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.140 
if you wanted to look just at the silver
it<00:02:44.590> kind<00:02:44.769> of<00:02:44.799> looks<00:02:44.950> like<00:02:45.040> an<00:02:45.280> iron<00:02:45.400> if<00:02:46.030> you

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
it kind of looks like an iron if you

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.789 
it kind of looks like an iron if you
just<00:02:46.480> looked<00:02:46.720> at<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.900> silver<00:02:47.230> itself<00:02:47.500> that

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
just looked at the silver itself that

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.860 
just looked at the silver itself that
might<00:02:47.950> invite<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> lot<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.180> people<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.660> feel

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
might invite a lot of people to feel

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.850 
might invite a lot of people to feel
like<00:02:49.989> they're<00:02:50.110> trying<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.350> hit<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.709> in<00:02:50.799> a

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
like they're trying to hit it in a

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.819 
like they're trying to hit it in a
different<00:02:51.010> way<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:52.120> see<00:02:52.690> you<00:02:52.989> know<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.350> lot<00:02:53.620> of

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
different way I see you know a lot of

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.110 
different way I see you know a lot of
players<00:02:53.980> who<00:02:54.160> will<00:02:54.310> get<00:02:54.400> hybrid<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.000> not

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
players who will get hybrid and not

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.390 
players who will get hybrid and not
quite<00:02:55.750> be<00:02:55.959> sure<00:02:56.109> how<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.350> hit<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.709> some<00:02:56.890> suit

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
quite be sure how to hit it some suit

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.849 
quite be sure how to hit it some suit
hits<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.790> like<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:57.940> hybrid<00:02:58.470> fairway<00:02:59.470> wood<00:02:59.620> some

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
hits it like a hybrid fairway wood some

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.740 
hits it like a hybrid fairway wood some
suit<00:03:00.100> hits<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.579> can<00:03:00.760> iron<00:03:00.940> more<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.690> think

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
suit hits it I can iron more and I think

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.420 
suit hits it I can iron more and I think
with<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.410> looks<00:03:02.680> wise<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:03.070> gives<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.340> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
with that looks wise it gives you the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.650 
with that looks wise it gives you the
option<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.910> visualizing<00:03:04.690> both<00:03:05.019> which<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.380> good

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.030 

just<00:03:12.670> love<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:13.850> hike<00:03:14.800> watched<00:03:15.800> when<00:03:15.950> it

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
just love that hike watched when it

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.220 
just love that hike watched when it
lands<00:03:16.360> one<00:03:17.360> bounce<00:03:18.460> stop<00:03:19.460> I<00:03:19.760> mean<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.990> that

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
lands one bounce stop I mean that that

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.550 
lands one bounce stop I mean that that
very<00:03:21.830> is<00:03:22.130> very<00:03:22.190> appealing<00:03:22.850> for<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.960> hybrid<00:03:24.410> that

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
very is very appealing for a hybrid that

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.230 
very is very appealing for a hybrid that
once<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:25.070> can<00:03:25.220> get<00:03:25.460> up<00:03:25.550> there<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:25.910> then<00:03:26.000> start

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
once it can get up there and then start

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.130 
once it can get up there and then start
right<00:03:26.360> one<00:03:26.510> more<00:03:26.630> then<00:03:26.780> we'll<00:03:26.870> have<00:03:26.960> look<00:03:27.050> at

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
right one more then we'll have look at

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.140 
right one more then we'll have look at
the<00:03:27.200> averages<00:03:27.580> we'll<00:03:28.580> see<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.730> kind<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.030> have

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
the averages we'll see I kind of have

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.520 
the averages we'll see I kind of have
far<00:03:29.360> this<00:03:29.480> is<00:03:29.660> go<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.050> and<00:03:30.230> some<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.470> the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
far this is go in and some of the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.930 
far this is go in and some of the
numbers<00:03:30.800> on<00:03:30.890> screen<00:03:31.190> there<00:03:31.430> but<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:31.610> can<00:03:31.730> see

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
numbers on screen there but you can see

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.120 
numbers on screen there but you can see
just<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.750> trace<00:03:33.050> there<00:03:33.320> how<00:03:33.530> high<00:03:33.770> these<00:03:33.830> are

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
just the trace there how high these are

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:41.080 
just the trace there how high these are
going<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.190> would<00:03:40.280> very<00:03:40.490> much<00:03:40.610> put<00:03:40.970> that

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
going and I would very much put that

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.220 
going and I would very much put that
down<00:03:41.270> it's<00:03:41.510> going<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.660> be<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.780> little<00:03:41.930> bit<00:03:42.080> left

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
down it's going to be a little bit left

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.170 
down it's going to be a little bit left
and<00:03:42.740> very<00:03:42.980> much<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.370> put<00:03:43.520> that<00:03:43.640> down<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.090> the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
and very much to put that down to the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.480 
and very much to put that down to the
fact<00:03:44.390> that<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.630> weight<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:46.190> head

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
fact that the weight and that the head

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.570 
fact that the weight and that the head
gets<00:03:46.730> quite<00:03:47.090> stretch<00:03:48.050> back<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:49.220> really

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
gets quite stretch back it really

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.860 
gets quite stretch back it really
doesn't<00:03:49.820> like<00:03:49.880> it<00:03:49.940> stretched<00:03:50.390> back<00:03:50.540> quite<00:03:50.840> a

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
doesn't like it stretched back quite a

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.720 
doesn't like it stretched back quite a
bit<00:03:50.960> it's<00:03:51.860> got<00:03:51.980> one<00:03:52.130> more<00:03:52.280> slightly<00:03:52.460> better<00:03:52.670> on

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
bit it's got one more slightly better on

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.340 
bit it's got one more slightly better on
that<00:03:52.970> I'm<00:03:53.060> going<00:03:53.210> to<00:03:53.240> tell<00:03:53.690> one<00:03:53.870> hour<00:03:54.020> that

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
that I'm going to tell one hour that

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.790 
that I'm going to tell one hour that
wasn't<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.590> great<00:03:54.680> shot<00:03:55.720> but<00:03:56.720> for<00:03:56.930> even<00:03:57.440> not<00:03:57.770> a

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
wasn't a great shot but for even not a

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.440 
wasn't a great shot but for even not a
great<00:03:58.070> shot<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.370> still<00:03:58.550> traveled<00:03:58.910> relatively

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
great shot it still traveled relatively

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.390 
great shot it still traveled relatively
well<00:03:59.630> so<00:03:59.840> forgiveness<00:04:00.170> level<00:04:00.620> it's<00:04:01.130> quite

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
well so forgiveness level it's quite

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:10.810 
well so forgiveness level it's quite
high<00:04:01.640> on<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.880> ranking<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:09.430> again<00:04:10.430> watch<00:04:10.550> once

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
high on the ranking and again watch once

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.000 
high on the ranking and again watch once
it<00:04:10.970> lands<00:04:11.150> on<00:04:11.270> the<00:04:11.330> green<00:04:11.570> if<00:04:12.530> it<00:04:12.650> gets<00:04:12.830> there

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
it lands on the green if it gets there

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.320 
it lands on the green if it gets there
yep<00:04:15.400> just<00:04:16.400> run<00:04:16.549> out<00:04:16.640> a<00:04:16.670> little<00:04:16.940> bit<00:04:17.060> but<00:04:17.209> it's

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
yep just run out a little bit but it's

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.590 
yep just run out a little bit but it's
that<00:04:17.570> potential<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.560> London<00:04:19.549> stopping<00:04:20.420> pretty

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
that potential of London stopping pretty

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.210 
that potential of London stopping pretty
quickly<00:04:20.840> well<00:04:21.500> I<00:04:21.590> say<00:04:21.739> I<00:04:21.770> will<00:04:21.920> just<00:04:22.070> put<00:04:22.190> it

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
quickly well I say I will just put it

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.680 
quickly well I say I will just put it
down<00:04:22.370> to<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.580> fact<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.060> head<00:04:23.300> is<00:04:23.450> quite

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
down to the fact that the head is quite

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.650 
down to the fact that the head is quite
stretched<00:04:24.320> back<00:04:24.560> towards<00:04:25.010> this<00:04:25.070> end<00:04:25.250> I<00:04:25.660> like

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
stretched back towards this end I like

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.010 
stretched back towards this end I like
it

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
it

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.110 
it
it's<00:04:27.230> got<00:04:27.380> good<00:04:27.680> attributes<00:04:28.669> to<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:28.940> it's<00:04:29.090> a

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
it's got good attributes to it it's a

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.270 
it's got good attributes to it it's a
good<00:04:29.240> looking<00:04:29.510> Club<00:04:29.930> it's<00:04:30.440> got<00:04:30.560> good<00:04:30.800> visuals

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
good looking Club it's got good visuals

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.330 
good looking Club it's got good visuals
it's<00:04:32.020> this<00:04:33.020> is<00:04:33.140> likes<00:04:33.320> a<00:04:33.440> non-adjustable<00:04:33.919> it's

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
it's this is likes a non-adjustable it's

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.250 
it's this is likes a non-adjustable it's
just<00:04:34.520> got<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:34.790> the<00:04:35.390> cavity<00:04:35.870> in<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:35.990> back<00:04:36.140> with

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
just got the the cavity in the back with

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.390 
just got the the cavity in the back with
the<00:04:36.320> rib<00:04:36.470> cage<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:37.040> help<00:04:37.190> with<00:04:37.310> stability

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
the rib cage in to help with stability

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.900 
the rib cage in to help with stability
the<00:04:37.940> slit<00:04:38.150> behind<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.540> face<00:04:39.370> very<00:04:40.370> nice<00:04:40.700> I

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
the slit behind the face very nice I

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.340 
the slit behind the face very nice I
like<00:04:41.060> it<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:41.270> lot<00:04:41.480> let's<00:04:41.870> have<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:41.990> look<00:04:42.110> at<00:04:42.200> some

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
like it a lot let's have a look at some

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.350 
like it a lot let's have a look at some
of<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.470> average<00:04:42.710> numbers<00:04:43.040> so<00:04:43.610> we<00:04:43.700> can<00:04:43.730> see<00:04:44.300> how

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
of the average numbers so we can see how

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.680 
of the average numbers so we can see how
it's<00:04:44.480> performed<00:04:46.030> so<00:04:47.030> you<00:04:47.120> can<00:04:47.240> see<00:04:47.360> there<00:04:47.510> just

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
it's performed so you can see there just

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.060 
it's performed so you can see there just
on<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:47.900> screen<00:04:48.020> we've<00:04:48.470> got<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.740> average

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
on the screen we've got the average

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.760 
on the screen we've got the average
carry<00:04:49.370> distance<00:04:49.520> at<00:04:49.820> 217<00:04:50.600> which<00:04:50.630> is<00:04:50.960> about<00:04:51.140> but

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
carry distance at 217 which is about but

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.700 
carry distance at 217 which is about but
right<00:04:51.950> for<00:04:52.220> a<00:04:52.250> 20-degree<00:04:52.700> say<00:04:53.120> about<00:04:53.500> 220<00:04:54.500> so

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
right for a 20-degree say about 220 so

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.409 
right for a 20-degree say about 220 so
maybe<00:04:55.520> whether<00:04:55.700> that<00:04:55.880> Heights<00:04:56.150> just

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
maybe whether that Heights just

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.030 
maybe whether that Heights just
subtracted<00:04:57.140> a<00:04:57.200> little<00:04:57.410> bit<00:04:57.500> of<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.650> distance

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
subtracted a little bit of the distance

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.520 
subtracted a little bit of the distance
spin<00:04:58.970> numbers<00:04:59.270> are<00:04:59.360> about<00:04:59.510> 4000<00:05:00.320> pretty

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
spin numbers are about 4000 pretty

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.050 
spin numbers are about 4000 pretty

again that more down to me rather than
the<00:05:14.600> club<00:05:14.930> it's<00:05:15.380> a<00:05:15.530> forgiving<00:05:16.040> Club<00:05:16.310> that<00:05:16.460> will

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
the club it's a forgiving Club that will

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.579 
the club it's a forgiving Club that will
offer<00:05:16.790> lots<00:05:17.120> of

offer lots of

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.609 
offer lots of
let's<00:05:19.249> say<00:05:19.539> higher<00:05:20.539> handicappers<00:05:21.319> lots<00:05:21.499> of

00:05:21.609 --> 00:05:21.619 
let's say higher handicappers lots of

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:23.679 
let's say higher handicappers lots of
forgiveness<00:05:22.099> so<00:05:22.909> I<00:05:22.939> think<00:05:23.089> it's<00:05:23.299> gonna<00:05:23.419> if

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:23.689 
forgiveness so I think it's gonna if
