about<00:00:10.230> two<00:00:10.559> weeks<00:00:10.590> we<00:00:11.429> got<00:00:11.610> another<00:00:12.000> package

in<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.690> mail<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.349> figured<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.250> could<00:00:14.370> just

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.939 
in the mail so figured we could just
open<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.630> monster<00:00:16.080> up<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.410> see<00:00:16.529> what<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:16.770> got

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
open this monster up and see what we got

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.340
