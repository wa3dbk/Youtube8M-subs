anyway in order to start I have put on
new<00:00:18.980> strings<00:00:19.280> because<00:00:19.930> these<00:00:20.930> strings<00:00:21.410> are

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
new strings because these strings are

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.950 
new strings because these strings are
probably<00:00:22.880> about<00:00:23.120> around<00:00:24.110> 23<00:00:24.500> years<00:00:24.650> old<00:00:25.960> now

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
don't want to make the video on these

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
bottom one right here it is loosened and

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.050 
bottom one right here it is loosened and
the<00:00:42.440> rest<00:00:42.620> of<00:00:42.740> them<00:00:42.829> are<00:00:42.860> tightened<00:00:43.280> what<00:00:43.940> you

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
the rest of them are tightened what you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.080 
the rest of them are tightened what you
do<00:00:44.180> is<00:00:44.270> you<00:00:44.360> unloosen<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:45.020> right<00:00:45.200> there<00:00:45.500> and

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
do is you unloosen that right there and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.420 
do is you unloosen that right there and
then<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:47.329> loosen<00:00:47.690> this<00:00:47.810> top<00:00:48.079> part<00:00:48.430> which

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
then you loosen this top part which

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.020 
then you loosen this top part which
turns<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.880> key<00:00:50.150> and<00:00:50.620> it<00:00:54.399> loosens<00:00:55.399> everything

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
turns the key and it loosens everything

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
turns the key and it loosens everything
so<00:00:56.570> what<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:56.780> do<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.200> have<00:00:57.380> the<00:00:57.560> UM<00:00:59.050> you

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
so what you do is you have the UM you

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.630 
so what you do is you have the UM you
have<00:01:00.200> the<00:01:00.320> eyehole<00:01:00.680> pointed<00:01:01.070> right<00:01:01.250> at<00:01:01.280> you

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
have the eyehole pointed right at you

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.620 
have the eyehole pointed right at you
can<00:01:02.090> go<00:01:02.210> right<00:01:02.390> there<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.110> eyehole<00:01:07.509> should<00:01:08.509> be

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
can go right there the eyehole should be

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.330 
can go right there the eyehole should be
like<00:01:08.960> 90<00:01:09.200> degrees<00:01:09.350> from<00:01:14.170> there<00:01:15.170> we<00:01:15.259> go<00:01:15.380> 90

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
like 90 degrees from there we go 90

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.940 
like 90 degrees from there we go 90
degrees<00:01:16.639> from<00:01:16.819> where<00:01:16.880> you're<00:01:17.149> doing<00:01:17.389> it<00:01:17.950> okay

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
degrees from where you're doing it okay

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.349 
degrees from where you're doing it okay
it<00:01:19.100> can't<00:01:19.310> be<00:01:19.429> down<00:01:19.579> that<00:01:19.789> way<00:01:19.939> you're<00:01:20.090> up<00:01:20.209> this

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
it can't be down that way you're up this

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:21.609 
it can't be down that way you're up this
way<00:01:20.509> it's<00:01:20.659> got<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.810> be<00:01:20.899> 90<00:01:21.139> degrees<00:01:21.170> that's

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
way it's got to be 90 degrees that's

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.959 
way it's got to be 90 degrees that's
that's<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.429> proper<00:01:22.700> ritual<00:01:24.670> let's<00:01:25.670> see<00:01:25.789> if<00:01:25.880> I

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
that's the proper ritual let's see if I

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:35.130 
that's the proper ritual let's see if I
can<00:01:26.060> get<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.420> go<00:01:26.479> through

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.610 

anyway<00:01:37.600> what<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:38.630> will<00:01:38.840> do<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.170> can't<00:01:39.500> do<00:01:39.590> it

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
anyway what I will do I can't do it

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.500 
anyway what I will do I can't do it
one-handed<00:01:39.950> I'll<00:01:40.550> pull<00:01:40.910> this<00:01:41.090> all<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.450> way

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
one-handed I'll pull this all the way

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.430 
one-handed I'll pull this all the way
through<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.080> this<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:42.740> this<00:01:43.810> low<00:01:44.810> E<00:01:44.840> string<00:01:44.990> is

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
through and this is this low E string is

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.400 
through and this is this low E string is
perpendicular<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.060> nut<00:01:47.270> then<00:01:48.050> what<00:01:48.290> I<00:01:48.320> do

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
perpendicular to the nut then what I do

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.490 
perpendicular to the nut then what I do
is<00:01:49.330> I<00:01:50.330> tighten<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.780> bottom<00:01:50.930> part<00:01:51.260> right<00:01:51.470> here

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
is I tighten the bottom part right here

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.940 
is I tighten the bottom part right here
and<00:01:51.890> that<00:01:52.040> holds<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.400> string<00:01:52.670> in<00:01:52.820> perfect<00:01:53.950> after

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
and that holds a string in perfect after

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.040 
and that holds a string in perfect after
I<00:01:54.980> do<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:55.160> then<00:01:55.610> I<00:01:55.700> cut<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.120> to<00:01:56.810> about<00:01:56.990> a

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
I do that then I cut it to about a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.900 
I do that then I cut it to about a
quarter<00:01:57.260> of<00:01:57.440> an<00:01:57.560> inch<00:01:57.650> short<00:01:57.920> like<00:01:58.100> like<00:01:58.700> right

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
quarter of an inch short like like right

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.910 
quarter of an inch short like like right
here<00:01:59.210> here<00:01:59.750> and<00:01:59.780> here<00:01:59.900> and<00:02:00.200> then<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.800> just

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
here here and here and then I just

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.130 
here here and here and then I just
tighten<00:02:01.370> this<00:02:01.430> up<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.820> then<00:02:01.880> I'll<00:02:02.420> go<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.960> do

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
tighten this up and then I'll go and do

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.480 
tighten this up and then I'll go and do
each<00:02:03.380> corresponding<00:02:05.020> string<00:02:06.020> until<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.860> get<00:02:07.460> a

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
each corresponding string until I get a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.330 
each corresponding string until I get a
new<00:02:08.450> one<00:02:08.649> now<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.679> happening<00:02:10.010> when<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.310> was

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340
