00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.150
 and high-profile updates begin to speak 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.759
 almost three years before the release 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.740
 and sometimes even earlier and usually 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.169
 not groundless and rumors of real 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.060
 information from developers keep track of 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.630
 all this simple man in the street is not always 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.000
 easy 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.850
 if you are one of them specifically for 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.800
 You created a rubric where I clean up 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.469
 accumulate facts already known and 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.450
 also share your expectations 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:45.550
 regarding the upcoming project today 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.550
 tom clancy's the division patient 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.309
 new this one that french publisher this 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.129
 always events are not always so 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.860
 awesome how are you waiting for him but still 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.659
 event in the case of divisions I implement 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.330
 developers at least half of 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.119
 promised she still risks becoming 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.640
 a hit given that this is also mom 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.159
 project wait sekula to work on 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.039
 mistakes are unlikely to have a place 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.140
 actions will be new york more precisely one of 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.360
 its manhattan island pieces 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.880
 but nobody excludes the possibility 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 adding rest in the future that's not 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.729
 I can understand why everyone is so attracted 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.520
 the notorious big apple every second 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.860
 a movie or a game about apocalypse or some 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.440
 invasion necessarily happens 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.280
 new york is all from sincere love for 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.460
 megalopolis 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.950
 or vice versa from fierce hatred sits 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.130
 imagine such a director fucking new york 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.289
 hate this trash a-ah-rave to i 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.929
 her with the land of her new movie 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.629
 although it's possible the whole thing is that this 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.259
 the city is the main symbol of freedom 

00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:02.640
 for americans and destroying it 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.470
 the creator hope to squeeze out 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.660
 of americans 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.539
 genuine tears of sorrow but something i 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.000
 distracted let's go back own where weights 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.400
 what exactly is this 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.980
 the game is positioned like him 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.489
 third-person MMO shooter in the open 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.489
 the world 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.910
 There would be more elements of the rating RTS 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.950
 add and get a full deck judging 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.410
 on the gameplay video look all 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.819
 just stunning and it's not 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.800
 only about the graphics from which 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.370
 involuntarily ssysh boiling water 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.160
 as well as about many other elements but about 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.400
 all in order and first in line 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.260
 goes the plot more precisely with this because how about 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.709
 the plot itself is not known practically 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.750
 nothing to be thrown into the near future 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.710
 nothing foretold trouble as suddenly 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.410
 the black 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.630
 Friday is it they have a day of mad discounts 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.820
 so if someone does not occur courses 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.310
 so black events that word 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.180
 black is beginning to be associated with 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.030
 something bad 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.890
 fucking racists so here are the reasons 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.080
 the appearance of this terrible virus is not 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.480
 simple accident and someone's evil intent 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.680
 on the one hand everything seems to have begun 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.170
 as a government experiment 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.170
 which by the way was implemented in 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.950
 reality 14 years ago just sort of 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.200
 make-believe 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.330
 on the other hand the destruction of financial 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.060
 center of the country could hardly enter 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.880
 plans of officials so either there was 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.740
 some conspiracy or a banal mistake 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.960
 reasoning and guessing can be infinite 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.810
 better wait for the release 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.420
 but somehow the virus was launched a 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.090
 scientists began to count at first 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.150
 day overwhelmed all the hospital for 2 all 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.730
 closed for quarantine at 3 falls stock exchange 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.270
 4 lost electricity and water and 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.880
 the shops are all empty 5 people person 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.490
 the wolf and the former are ready to kill their neighbor 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.310
 only five days to civilized 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.590
 man to roll on evolutionary 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.720
 the stairs to the very bottom at least 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.000
 This opinion is shared by the developers 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.260
 interesting to come out in real life 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.120
 There are willing to experiment 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.040
 so here we have to play for so 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.200
 called members of the strategic 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.210
 divisions of the motherland something like 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.630
 specially trained sleeping agents 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:21.049
 peacetime leading ordinary life per hour 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.490
 x we get a task to clean up 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.150
 Of course there is nowhere and without any 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.550
 conspiracies 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.980
 so all this nonsense with a virus is wrong 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.220
 as simple as it seems someone hey well 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.570
 and we rake in the general plot is still not 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.090
 the strongest side 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.070
 oh well at least the fact that in all 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.760
 troubles are not to blame for the evil Russian 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.970
 warms the soul if not the plot then what 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.600
 then for the division so interesting in 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.670
 first as we said earlier graphics 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.220
 snowdrop really strikes of course 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.060
 we may well be deceived hi 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.280
 watch dog 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.920
 but if you imagine that this game will be 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.470
 look exactly like what they showed 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.600
 on the stands in front of the developers can 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.330
 take off your hat 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.840
 lighting reflection animation all 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.990
 looks just awesome following on 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.550
 that you pay attention to ubisoft interface 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.530
 generally like such experiments 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.930
 remember at least splinter cell 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.630
 conviction where the job and other text 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.380
 projected onto the walls here have gone yet 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.010
 farther 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.120
 players are equipped with special lenses 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.030
 formative extra reality 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.570
 that kind of minimized hololens from 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.380
 T-shirt in general maps projected straight 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.290
 around us 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.600
 window skill on wristwatch + all 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.100
 around can be scanned in the same manner 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.040
 looking dogs considering that the yard 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.880
 2050 it was not without 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.790
 high-tech items 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.940
 and everyones there self-guided grenades and 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.400
 autonomous turrets and flying drones in 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.880
 the general setting provides good room for 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.100
 fantasy after all division still mom 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.650
 so many rightly can 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.590
 wonder what to do there 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.960
 sociopath without friends question more than ever 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.570
 important and the developers have on it 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.360
 the answer in the game is planned to be realized 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.970
 automatic partner selection system which 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.979
 will pick you ally 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.080
 comparable to your skills and yes 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:25.110
 it turns out to be alone playing too 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.590
 possible but we all know that this is not 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:32.220
 as interesting as I said earlier 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.919
 there will be rpb component but no 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.110
 rigid divisions into classes although 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:39.090
 depending on the skills pumped each 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.760
 the player will play his own role 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.490
 so far nothing is clear what's up with the inventory 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.190
 according to the developers, it accommodates in 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.770
 yourself 72 hours of supplies like this 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.680
 gameplay unknown unknown yes 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.240
 okay another interesting gameplay 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.450
 element which is worth mentioning 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.460
 support the application and a companion 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.710
 this is not just a primitive application with 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.020
 statistics or maps of some kind 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.390
 using this application it will be possible to 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.940
 fully participate in the game in 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.880
 the quality of drone drones from renders 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.730
 nehily such help here highlight 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.800
 there shoot down the claims 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.900
 event developers all over the game 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.730
 the world will evolve depending on 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.100
 actions and decision players 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.170
 how it will be implemented is still unclear 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.910
 may be doing fractionation 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.400
 maybe for clans 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.430
 one way or another the balance of some forces in the end 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.490
 will solve a lot in general for the division 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.630
 currently judging because to us 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.330
 demonstrated and promised 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.250
 looks extremely tempting truth in 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.980
 it may end up completely 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.320
 not what we're waiting for but let's treat 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.660
 to the game as optimistic as possible 

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.620
 at least before the release, but we'll see 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.560
 what yes how 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.230
 Well, that's all I tried for you 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.250
 team time video game script 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.250
 Vladimir Skrynnik 

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:01.920
 montage alexander sword read text 

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.270
 Dmitri Zubarev do not live one life 

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.700
 live by many 

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.770
 play games watch a movie and listen 

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.020
