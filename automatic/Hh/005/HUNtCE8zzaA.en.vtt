00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
and when you get on it as I did it does

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.569 
and when you get on it as I did it does
halt<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.900> this<00:02:36.560> one<00:02:36.799> I<00:02:37.099> think<00:02:37.219> the

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
halt and this one I think the

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.580 
halt and this one I think the
supercharged<00:02:38.180> v8<00:02:38.450> starts<00:02:38.959> at<00:02:39.049> around<00:02:39.230> 80

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590

see<00:03:33.590> these<00:03:33.739> sensors<00:03:34.099> on<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.280> top<00:03:34.519> are<00:03:34.669> all

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
see these sensors on the top are all

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.729 
see these sensors on the top are all
part<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.120> dynamic<00:03:35.569> suspension<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.260> this

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
part of the dynamic suspension so this

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.439 
part of the dynamic suspension so this
thing<00:03:36.979> has<00:03:37.189> several<00:03:37.760> levels<00:03:37.909> now<00:03:38.180> it's<00:03:38.359> a

thing has several levels now it's a

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.300 
thing has several levels now it's a
Range<00:03:38.659> Rover<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.079> it's<00:03:39.229> off-road<00:03:39.709> capability

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
Range Rover so it's off-road capability

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.629 
Range Rover so it's off-road capability
still<00:03:40.669> need<00:03:40.939> to<00:03:41.180> be<00:03:41.560> legendary<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.919> it<00:03:43.069> is<00:03:43.340> and
