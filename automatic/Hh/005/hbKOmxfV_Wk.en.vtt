this<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> glitch<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.160> how<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.339> get<00:00:23.490> all<00:00:23.699> six

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
this is a glitch on how to get all six

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.300 
this is a glitch on how to get all six
perks<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.679> survival<00:00:25.679> you<00:00:25.769> keep<00:00:25.919> this<00:00:26.099> in

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
perks in survival you keep this in

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.179 
perks in survival you keep this in
transit<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.759> but<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.839> just<00:00:28.080> did<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.039> in

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
transit to but we just did this in

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.290 
transit to but we just did this in
survival<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.910> make<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.150> bit<00:00:30.269> easier

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
survival just to make it a bit easier

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.020 
survival just to make it a bit easier
but<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.079> possible<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.619> transit<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.850> just

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
but this is possible in transit it just

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.250 
but this is possible in transit it just
probably<00:00:33.180> might<00:00:33.360> be<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.510> bit<00:00:33.660> harder<00:00:33.900> but

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
probably might be a bit harder but

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.660 
probably might be a bit harder but
