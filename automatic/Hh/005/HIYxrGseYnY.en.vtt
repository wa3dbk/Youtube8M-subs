special<00:01:29.890> moves<00:01:30.040> are<00:01:30.130> very<00:01:30.340> expensive<00:01:30.700> so<00:01:31.240> if

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
special moves are very expensive so if

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.740 
special moves are very expensive so if
you're<00:01:31.710> using<00:01:32.710> your<00:01:32.950> coins<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.640> build<00:01:34.630> your

you're using your coins to build your
fighter<00:01:35.020> I<00:01:35.790> suggest<00:01:36.790> that<00:01:36.940> you<00:01:37.090> might<00:01:37.420> want<00:01:37.660> it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
fighter I suggest that you might want it

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.980 
fighter I suggest that you might want it
moves<00:01:38.080> first<00:01:38.500> before<00:01:39.039> you<00:01:39.160> do<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.430> parents

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
moves first before you do the parents

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.719 
moves first before you do the parents
settings<00:01:40.990> just<00:01:41.680> so<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.070> can<00:01:42.190> you<00:01:42.460> know<00:01:42.520> keep

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
settings just so you can you know keep

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.670 
settings just so you can you know keep
the<00:01:42.880> move<00:01:43.060> from<00:01:43.149> one<00:01:43.539> I<00:01:43.899> don't<00:01:44.410> know<00:01:44.470> how<00:01:44.619> the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
the move from one I don't know how the

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.020 
the move from one I don't know how the
hell<00:01:44.979> they<00:01:45.130> came<00:01:45.310> up<00:01:45.460> with<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.729> different

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
hell they came up with the different

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.670 
hell they came up with the different
values<00:01:46.450> for<00:01:46.509> things<00:01:46.840> i<00:01:46.960> don't<00:01:47.140> i<00:01:47.289> don't<00:01:47.380> know

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
values for things i don't i don't know

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.109 
values for things i don't i don't know
why<00:01:48.660> ratings<00:01:49.830> line<00:01:50.830> move<00:01:51.160> is<00:01:51.490> more<00:01:51.880> expensive

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
why ratings line move is more expensive

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.260 
why ratings line move is more expensive
than<00:01:52.950> fireball<00:01:53.950> okay<00:01:54.430> ever<00:01:54.580> again<00:01:54.670> we<00:01:55.060> have
