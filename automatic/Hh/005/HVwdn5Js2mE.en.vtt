 first chance I'll start tomorrow 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.030

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.800

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.270

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.770
 ordered with the one sign I hope 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.460

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.950
 yes and I need now first completely 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.860
 dignified a snowman here sets me 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.310
 on my jet ski or around 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.630
 crisis area these forces fall to her 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.410
 See, that is very fast, I am that 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.280
 first died 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.920
 and yes, I can do it at all 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.240
 not the role that's why it's mine 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.200
 very first excuse that is now 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.960
 news for this event and well I was 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.890
 yes quite well with my game and we 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.430
 just run through against 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.430
 maybe that helps already killed 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:33.830
 I'm still a child beaten 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:37.300
 with the help of the mucus I am very 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.300
 stupid that blinded yourself 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.310
 yes that was a quick round that was 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.470
 also the first two 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.270
 warm up and if it is the same now 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.770
 everything goes on in the third one 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.420
 decisive round then you become 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.970
 show how I dominate with that 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.430
 controller can handle so right up 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.770
 so now we are in the second round 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.710
 I do not want you to excuse it 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.440
 ensures that now always died that 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:14.060

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.930
 on the way and definitely more 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.910
 so to speak, the revenge is up now 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.610
 A lot and I will do that here 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.930

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.670
 Now I have something properly unpacked what 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:39.170
