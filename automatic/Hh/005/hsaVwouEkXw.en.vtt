00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.160 

all<00:00:01.920> right<00:00:02.159> here's<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.550> tube<00:00:03.240> works<00:00:03.570> blue<00:00:04.200> tube

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.170 
all right here's a tube works blue tube

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.660 
all right here's a tube works blue tube
actually<00:00:07.170> I'm<00:00:07.500> not<00:00:07.589> sure<00:00:07.649> if<00:00:07.980> if<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.280> company

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
actually I'm not sure if if the company

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.580 
actually I'm not sure if if the company
is<00:00:08.700> blue<00:00:08.970> -<00:00:09.150> or<00:00:09.510> if<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.719> company's<00:00:10.110> tube<00:00:10.349> works

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
is blue - or if the company's tube works

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.760 
is blue - or if the company's tube works
but<00:00:10.860> it's<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.190> RT<00:00:11.960> 904<00:00:13.490> made<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.639> USA<00:00:15.770> preamp

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
but it's the RT 904 made in USA preamp

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.609 
but it's the RT 904 made in USA preamp
I'm<00:00:17.640> assuming<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.210> guitar<00:00:18.330> preamp<00:00:18.960> I've

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
I'm assuming it's a guitar preamp I've

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.070 
I'm assuming it's a guitar preamp I've
got<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> hook<00:00:20.070> through<00:00:20.430> my<00:00:20.670> carving<00:00:21.330> Bel<00:00:21.480> Air<00:00:21.750> in

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
got a hook through my carving Bel Air in

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.380 
got a hook through my carving Bel Air in
the<00:00:22.140> effects<00:00:22.890> loop<00:00:23.130> because<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.939> didn't<00:00:24.180> think

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the effects loop because I didn't think

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.689 
the effects loop because I didn't think
it<00:00:24.510> sounded<00:00:24.779> very<00:00:24.930> good<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.380> front<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.949> but

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
it sounded very good in front of it but

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.509 
it sounded very good in front of it but
through<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.119> effects<00:00:27.480> loop<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.960> actually

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
through the effects loop it actually

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.549 
through the effects loop it actually
adds<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.730> nice<00:00:30.080> effect<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> amplifier<00:00:33.559> it's

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
adds a nice effect to the amplifier it's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.569 
adds a nice effect to the amplifier it's
got<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> boost<00:00:35.100> bypass<00:00:36.950> and<00:00:37.950> they're<00:00:38.129> both<00:00:38.280> foot

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
got a boost bypass and they're both foot

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.709 
got a boost bypass and they're both foot
switchable<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:40.879> it's<00:00:41.879> got<00:00:42.059> controls<00:00:42.480> for

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
switchable and it's got controls for

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.510 
switchable and it's got controls for
Drive<00:00:43.280> contour<00:00:44.280> bias<00:00:45.860> master<00:00:46.860> volume<00:00:47.039> high

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
Drive contour bias master volume high

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
Drive contour bias master volume high
low<00:00:47.789> or<00:00:48.180> high<00:00:48.660> mid<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.020> low<00:00:49.430> EQ<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.680> you<00:00:52.680> know

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
low or high mid and low EQ and you know

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.180 
low or high mid and low EQ and you know
and<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.430> believe<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> has<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.980> some<00:00:55.980> kind<00:00:56.160> of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and I believe it has a some kind of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.910 
and I believe it has a some kind of
preamp<00:00:56.550> -<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.090> 12ax7<00:00:57.809> or<00:00:58.590> something<00:00:58.859> like

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
preamp - but 12ax7 or something like

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.779 
preamp - but 12ax7 or something like
that<00:00:59.120> alright<00:01:00.120> here's<00:01:00.420> my<00:01:00.829> bel<00:01:01.829> air<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that alright here's my bel air on the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:18.610 
that alright here's my bel air on the
clean<00:01:03.000> channel<00:01:03.390> without<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.309> blue<00:01:05.309> tube

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.370 

and<00:01:19.620> then<00:01:19.800> I<00:01:19.950> hit<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:21.660> blue<00:01:21.840> tube<00:01:22.080> which

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and then I hit the the blue tube which

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.160 
and then I hit the the blue tube which
is<00:01:22.410> everything's<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.310> about<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.660> on<00:01:24.810> five<00:01:25.140> or

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
is everything's on about it's on five or

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.450 
is everything's on about it's on five or
her<00:01:25.740> straight<00:01:26.070> up

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
her straight up

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:45.700 
her straight up
twelve<00:01:26.910> o'clock

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.580 

I<00:01:45.970> don't<00:01:46.970> know<00:01:47.030> if<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.210> comes<00:01:47.420> across<00:01:47.590> over

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
I don't know if that comes across over

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.719 
I don't know if that comes across over
the<00:01:48.770> mic<00:01:48.979> but<00:01:49.220> it<00:01:49.400> adds<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.820> lot<00:01:49.970> of<00:01:50.500> high-end

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
the mic but it adds a lot of high-end

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.590 
the mic but it adds a lot of high-end
shimmer<00:01:52.930> I<00:01:54.369> don't<00:01:55.369> know<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:55.550> just<00:01:55.580> sounds<00:01:55.880> it

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
shimmer I don't know it just sounds it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.000 
shimmer I don't know it just sounds it
doesn't<00:01:56.900> it<00:01:57.020> improves<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.470> quality<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.860> the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
doesn't it improves the quality of the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.730 
doesn't it improves the quality of the
amp<00:01:58.130> quite<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.640> bit<00:01:59.140> sometimes<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.530> has<00:02:00.710> a

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
amp quite a bit sometimes it has a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.649 
amp quite a bit sometimes it has a
little<00:02:01.159> bit<00:02:01.220> too<00:02:01.430> much<00:02:01.610> high-end<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:02.540> I've

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
little bit too much high-end so I've

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.770 
little bit too much high-end so I've
been<00:02:02.840> turning<00:02:03.259> down<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.650> high<00:02:03.890> as<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:05.509> will<00:02:05.659> do

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
been turning down the high as I will do

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:36.640 
been turning down the high as I will do
now

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.230 

and<00:02:37.650> usually<00:02:38.430> I'll<00:02:38.550> turn<00:02:38.730> up<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.880> drive<00:02:39.210> a

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
and usually I'll turn up the drive a

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.230 
and usually I'll turn up the drive a
little<00:02:39.600> bit<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.900> maybe<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:41.040> about<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.790> don't

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
little bit to maybe to about I don't

00:02:42.240 --> 00:03:30.800 
little bit to maybe to about I don't
know<00:02:42.300> two<00:02:42.480> or<00:02:42.510> three<00:02:42.630> o'clock<00:02:46.700> like<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:49.820> oops

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.960 

and<00:03:31.810> let's<00:03:32.620> see<00:03:32.980> sometimes<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.549> lot<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.760> little

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
and let's see sometimes a lot a little

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.600 
and let's see sometimes a lot a little
bit<00:03:34.239> more<00:03:34.540> or<00:03:34.870> hurt<00:03:35.080> it<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.739> drive<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.430> on

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
bit more or hurt it the drive is on

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.440 
bit more or hurt it the drive is on
about<00:03:36.730> three<00:03:37.629> o'clock<00:03:41.459> which<00:03:42.459> would<00:03:42.640> be<00:03:42.790> I

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
about three o'clock which would be I

00:03:43.450 --> 00:04:18.310 
about three o'clock which would be I
don't<00:03:43.840> know<00:03:44.220> seven<00:03:45.220> or<00:03:45.280> eight

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.580 

it<00:04:19.320> adds<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.910> very<00:04:20.910> nice<00:04:21.299> tube<00:04:23.720> sound<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:25.440> the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
it adds a very nice tube sound to the

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.150 
it adds a very nice tube sound to the
amp<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.220> it<00:04:26.760> gives<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.419> nice<00:04:27.830> treble<00:04:28.830> boost

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
amp and it gives it a nice treble boost

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.340 
amp and it gives it a nice treble boost
but<00:04:29.760> also<00:04:30.260> you've<00:04:31.260> got<00:04:31.500> all<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.800> bass<00:04:32.010> -<00:04:32.490> so

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
but also you've got all the bass - so

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.850 
but also you've got all the bass - so
it's<00:04:34.350> just<00:04:34.470> without<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:35.430> after<00:04:35.790> you<00:04:35.910> use<00:04:36.120> it

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
it's just without it after you use it

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.050 
it's just without it after you use it
for<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:37.889> little<00:04:38.070> bit<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.580> then<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:38.850> turn<00:04:39.030> it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
for a little bit and then you turn it

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.810 
for a little bit and then you turn it
off<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.419> amp<00:04:39.630> sounds<00:04:39.990> kind<00:04:40.260> of<00:04:40.460> flabby<00:04:41.460> and

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
off the amp sounds kind of flabby and

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:51.250 
off the amp sounds kind of flabby and
dead<00:04:42.270> or<00:04:42.600> something

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:05:19.440 

here's<00:04:52.260> with<00:04:52.350> it<00:04:52.440> on

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.030 

all<00:05:20.450> right<00:05:20.660> and<00:05:20.810> then<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.050> you<00:05:21.860> can<00:05:21.950> get

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
all right and then the you can get

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.920 
all right and then the you can get
different<00:05:22.190> tones<00:05:22.430> out<00:05:22.700> of<00:05:22.760> it<00:05:23.000> by<00:05:23.180> adjusting

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
different tones out of it by adjusting

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.120 
different tones out of it by adjusting
the<00:05:24.290> contour<00:05:24.920> and<00:05:26.200> the<00:05:27.200> bias<00:05:29.260> you<00:05:30.260> can<00:05:30.470> get<00:05:30.710> a

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
the contour and the bias you can get a

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.710 
the contour and the bias you can get a
little<00:05:31.550> more<00:05:31.700> with<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:31.910> bias<00:05:32.180> you<00:05:32.540> get<00:05:32.690> a

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
little more with the bias you get a

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.630 
little more with the bias you get a
little<00:05:33.080> bit<00:05:33.230> squeezed<00:05:33.830> a<00:05:33.860> little<00:05:34.040> bit<00:05:34.280> more<00:05:34.490> of

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
little bit squeezed a little bit more of

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.450 
little bit squeezed a little bit more of
a<00:05:34.930> that's<00:05:35.930> sort<00:05:36.320> of<00:05:36.410> trevally<00:05:36.890> boost<00:05:37.100> out<00:05:37.340> of

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
a that's sort of trevally boost out of

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.010 
a that's sort of trevally boost out of
it<00:05:38.950> but<00:05:39.950> I<00:05:39.980> usually<00:05:40.400> leave<00:05:41.090> those<00:05:41.270> pretty<00:05:41.870> much

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
it but I usually leave those pretty much

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:51.460 
it but I usually leave those pretty much
straight<00:05:42.380> up<00:05:42.410> I<00:05:49.120> guess<00:05:50.170> overall<00:05:51.170> it<00:05:51.290> just

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
straight up I guess overall it just

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.330 
straight up I guess overall it just
makes<00:05:51.650> it<00:05:51.800> sound<00:05:51.980> like<00:05:52.160> you've<00:05:52.460> got<00:05:52.700> your<00:05:52.910> amp

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
makes it sound like you've got your amp

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.320 
makes it sound like you've got your amp
cranked<00:05:55.340> up<00:05:55.510> pretty<00:05:56.510> loud<00:05:57.490> and<00:05:58.490> then<00:05:58.790> it<00:05:58.940> gives

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
cranked up pretty loud and then it gives

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.380 
cranked up pretty loud and then it gives
it<00:05:59.480> a<00:05:59.540> nice<00:05:59.660> clarity<00:06:00.230> and<00:06:01.090> you<00:06:02.090> know<00:06:02.180> like<00:06:02.360> a

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
it a nice clarity and you know like a

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.150 
it a nice clarity and you know like a
treble<00:06:02.840> boost<00:06:03.050> but<00:06:03.350> again<00:06:03.650> you<00:06:03.770> don't<00:06:03.920> lose

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
treble boost but again you don't lose

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.210 
treble boost but again you don't lose
any<00:06:04.760> of<00:06:04.850> the<00:06:04.970> bass<00:06:05.180> so<00:06:05.740> it's<00:06:06.740> a<00:06:06.830> pretty<00:06:06.980> cool

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
any of the bass so it's a pretty cool

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.280 
any of the bass so it's a pretty cool
thing<00:06:07.840> there<00:06:08.840> and<00:06:08.900> I<00:06:09.170> the<00:06:10.570> the<00:06:11.570> case<00:06:11.780> for<00:06:12.110> it<00:06:12.200> I

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
thing there and I the the case for it I

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.900 
thing there and I the the case for it I
made<00:06:12.710> that<00:06:12.860> it<00:06:13.040> didn't<00:06:13.220> it's<00:06:13.400> just<00:06:13.580> a<00:06:13.700> rack

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
made that it didn't it's just a rack

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.230 
made that it didn't it's just a rack
