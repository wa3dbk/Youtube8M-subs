poetry<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:58.080> my<00:00:59.080> is<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.320> I<00:00:59.530> well<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.400> first

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
poetry and my is it I well the first

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.219

reason<00:01:00.940> is<00:01:01.089> because<00:01:01.150> I<00:01:01.510> really<00:01:01.659> love<00:01:01.900> poetry

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
and I feel like one of the things that

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.670 
and I feel like one of the things that
poets<00:01:04.839> do<00:01:05.229> is<00:01:06.330> they<00:01:07.330> already<00:01:07.900> take<00:01:08.440> into

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
poets do is they already take into

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.230 
poets do is they already take into
consideration<00:01:09.280> all<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.520> things<00:01:09.700> that<00:01:09.909> I<00:01:09.940> add

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
consideration all the things that I add

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.530 
consideration all the things that I add
so<00:01:11.140> they<00:01:11.500> pay<00:01:11.799> attention<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.340> pacing<00:01:12.880> they'd

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
so they pay attention to pacing they'd

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.200 
so they pay attention to pacing they'd
pay<00:01:14.049> attention<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.500> rhythm<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.880> know<00:01:16.000> they

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
pay attention to rhythm you know they

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.030 
pay attention to rhythm you know they
they're<00:01:16.869> doing<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.260> lot<00:01:17.380> of<00:01:17.409> things<00:01:17.710> that<00:01:17.890> I<00:01:17.920> do

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
they're doing a lot of things that I do

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.219 
they're doing a lot of things that I do
yeah<00:01:18.729> so<00:01:19.030> what<00:01:19.150> happens<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.600> that<00:01:19.630> you<00:01:19.990> either

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
yeah so what happens is that you either

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.890 
yeah so what happens is that you either
fight<00:01:20.680> against<00:01:21.189> it<00:01:21.369> or<00:01:21.790> you<00:01:22.090> follow<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.659> if<00:01:22.810> you

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
if you follow it sometimes it feels like

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.530 
if you follow it sometimes it feels like

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
this idea a long time ago

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.350 
this idea a long time ago
one<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.220> things<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.610> could<00:02:30.790> do<00:02:30.970> with<00:02:31.330> a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
one of the things you could do with a

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.630 
one of the things you could do with a
piece<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.660> music<00:02:31.960> in<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.110> concert<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.680> dedicate

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
piece of music in a concert is dedicate

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.560 
piece of music in a concert is dedicate
a<00:02:34.000> certain<00:02:34.660> amount<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.140> time<00:02:36.000> not<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.240> making

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
a certain amount of time not to making

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.540 
a certain amount of time not to making
people<00:02:37.870> do<00:02:38.080> things<00:02:38.110> or<00:02:38.560> feel<00:02:38.860> things<00:02:39.190> or

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
people do things or feel things or

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.300 
people do things or feel things or
manipulate<00:02:40.510> them<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:40.840> any<00:02:40.990> way<00:02:41.080> but<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.100> just

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
manipulate them in any way but to just

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.560 
manipulate them in any way but to just
use<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.240> time<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.510> give<00:02:43.810> them<00:02:43.990> permission<00:02:44.470> to

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
use that time to give them permission to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.060 
use that time to give them permission to
hear<00:02:46.570> something<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.170> have<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.500> hearing<00:02:47.800> of

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
hear something and have that hearing of

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.650 
hear something and have that hearing of
that<00:02:48.250> thing<00:02:48.520> affect<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.120> way<00:02:49.240> they<00:02:49.450> thought

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
that thing affect the way they thought

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.740 
that thing affect the way they thought
about<00:02:49.810> themselves<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:51.180> another<00:02:52.180> problem<00:02:52.450> that

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
about themselves so another problem that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.480 
about themselves so another problem that
I<00:02:52.870> found<00:02:53.140> with<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.470> Philip<00:02:53.950> Levine<00:02:54.100> which<00:02:54.400> I

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
I found with the Philip Levine which I

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.250 
I found with the Philip Levine which I
think<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> problem<00:02:55.000> for<00:02:55.360> poetry<00:02:56.110> in<00:02:56.230> general

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
think is a problem for poetry in general

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.280 
think is a problem for poetry in general
but<00:02:56.650> also<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.180> particular<00:02:58.720> problem<00:02:59.110> with

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
but also is a particular problem with

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.090 
but also is a particular problem with
this<00:02:59.520> poet<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:02.260> really<00:03:02.590> pays

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
this poet is that it really pays

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.990 
this poet is that it really pays
attention<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.390> flow<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:05.140> ideas<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:06.640> really

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
attention to the flow of ideas it really

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.060 
attention to the flow of ideas it really
is<00:03:07.150> about<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.480> sort<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.900> muscular<00:03:08.560> heavy

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
is about the sort of muscular heavy

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.250 
is about the sort of muscular heavy
working-class<00:03:12.070> delivery<00:03:12.970> he<00:03:13.750> tooks<00:03:13.930> all<00:03:14.140> the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
working-class delivery he tooks all the

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260 
working-class delivery he tooks all the
time<00:03:14.470> about<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.670> combination<00:03:16.210> of

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
time about this so the combination of

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.440 
time about this so the combination of
like<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.600> steel<00:03:16.960> sound<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.970> industrial

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
like the steel sound and the industrial

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.320 
like the steel sound and the industrial
sound<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.930> then<00:03:20.710> this<00:03:20.950> huge<00:03:21.310> discovery<00:03:22.240> of

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
sound and then this huge discovery of

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
world that the poet's trying to conjure

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.450 
world that the poet's trying to conjure
up<00:03:57.270> figure<00:03:58.270> out<00:03:58.450> what's<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:59.340> you<00:04:00.340> know

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
up figure out what's that you know

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.030 
up figure out what's that you know
incredibly<00:04:00.940> powerful<00:04:01.540> under<00:04:01.900> message<00:04:02.080> and

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
incredibly powerful under message and

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.310 
incredibly powerful under message and
set<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.550> free<00:04:03.910> so<00:04:04.570> in<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.840> way<00:04:04.960> what<00:04:05.140> I<00:04:05.170> was

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
set that free so in a way what I was

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.750 
set that free so in a way what I was
trying<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.650> do<00:04:05.770> was<00:04:05.890> figure<00:04:06.070> out<00:04:06.280> what's<00:04:06.520> the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
trying to do was figure out what's the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.120 
trying to do was figure out what's the
message<00:04:07.270> behind<00:04:07.990> these<00:04:08.500> what's<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:08.860> world

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
message behind these what's the world

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.610 
message behind these what's the world
that<00:04:09.430> made<00:04:09.640> these<00:04:09.880> things<00:04:10.150> happen<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:11.350> I

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
that made these things happen that I

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.300 
that made these things happen that I
could<00:04:11.920> access<00:04:12.130> that<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:13.000> could<00:04:13.360> universal<00:04:13.990> eyes

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
could access that I could universal eyes

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.650 
could access that I could universal eyes
so<00:04:15.310> that<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.520> could<00:04:15.700> do<00:04:15.790> something<00:04:16.060> that's<00:04:16.210> true

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
so that I could do something that's true

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.630 
so that I could do something that's true
to<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.960> world<00:04:17.230> of<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.650> poet<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.220> world

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
to the world of the poet and the world

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.330 
to the world of the poet and the world
of<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:19.000> poetry<00:04:19.540> without<00:04:20.470> actually<00:04:21.040> just

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
of the poetry without actually just

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.590 
of the poetry without actually just
saying<00:04:21.520> I<00:04:21.609> think<00:04:21.670> well<00:04:21.820> my<00:04:21.940> job<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.570> just

saying I think well my job is to just

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.510 
saying I think well my job is to just
take<00:04:23.170> this<00:04:23.350> world<00:04:23.650> which<00:04:23.920> is<00:04:24.070> which<00:04:24.400> is

there's<00:04:30.910> in<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.900> way<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.080> feel<00:04:32.320> like<00:04:32.380> what<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.680> did

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
even though it has nothing to do with
