00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 this video is to show you how 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.780
 performs neck examination 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.700
 also in this case as for the rest 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.400
 all forms of objective examination the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.900
 doctor uses his senses the sight 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.730
 to inspect the patient's neck 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.910
 feel to palpate it and hearing to 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.050
 maybe listen to some formations 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.009
 vascular more than anything else 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.790
 inside the neck structures 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:38.750
 so let's start with the inspection 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:43.170
 inspection 1 is aware of the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.629
 we say conformation of the neck and if on 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.750
 There are no admonitions on the neck 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.520
 present alterations they make 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.620
 suspect the presence of swellings 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.320
 more careful observation can be made 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.410
 inviting the patient to lay the head 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:07.380
 all back and turn the neck from before 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:10.470
 one part and then the other once 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.020
 the doctor inspected for 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.340
 make a palpation from a position 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.860
 best 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.700
 must be carried behind the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.400
 patient 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.700
 the most correct position to carry out 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.759
 the palpation of the neck and to stand at 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.320
 shoulders of the patient and the hands of the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.630
 doctor who visits will go to palpate the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.150
 anterior region of the neck 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.220
 also because there is to say that in the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.100
 pathology of the neck and therefore in the examination 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.500
 neck part the most part 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.009
 important of this region 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.540
 the thyroid plays it essentially for 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.979
 neck inspection is an inspection of 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.829
 of the thyroid gland 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.840
 besides then also to the other structures 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.990
 so the doctor will look for those who 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.090
 are the needs of cartilage 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.259
 stone that will hear them the trachea e 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.080
 knowing that the two-lobed thyroid 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.069
 side and a front isthmus will look 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.709
 to palpate at least the portion 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.469
 the only one of the thyroid in conditions 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.889
 normal in thyroid orbit does not occur 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:24.950
 appreciate and then the doctor will try 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:27.200
 to realize with palpation if 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.129
 yes instead vice versa considering the ai 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.829
 increased in size yes the gland 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.319
 had increased in size for 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:39.650
 realize that it really is 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.930
 some thyroid glands are made simple 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.060
 maneuver since the thyroid like 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.459
 we have said is in solidarity with the trachea 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.150
 and therefore with the whole laryngeal axis 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.060
 tracheal 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.189
 if the patient is asked to swallow 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:58.489
 try to swallow here is the swelling 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:03:02.150
 possibly highlighted thyroid will be 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:06.230
 in solidarity with the act of swallowing e 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.049
 then it will move to the tar form for 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.969
 highlight a pathology 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.189
 let's say throw idea then in one 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.949
 definitely swelling shooting idea is 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.769
 that of inviting the patient to do 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:20.120
 a closed glottis inspiration 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.819
 that is effectively what one does 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.549
 when they do more we point out shots 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:30.250
 of cough ie the glottis is closed and yes 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:33.220
 tries to inspire try this can 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.889
 think of what it's called in medical terms 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.780
 if the thyroid preface becomes still 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:44.650
 more manifest breathe freely 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.239
 a final further let's say maneuver for 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.699
 make sure of the relevance of the 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.069
 communication to the thyroid is that from 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:55.879
 moment the thyroid is covered here 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:59.150
 from the ribbon-like muscles of the neck 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:02.780
 if the patient is invited to lower the 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.090
 neck and we tell it but it is in contrast 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.609
 by pressing on the chin in this 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.019
 case we will see that the swelling 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:12.319
 decreases in size because 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.420
 compressed by the front muscles of the 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.220
 neck 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:21.200
 once done that so 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:24.919
 palpation you can switch to the listen 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.169
 thione of the neck concludes the examination 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.590
 neck target with the school 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:33.380
 tation on the neck portion 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.530
 especially the front one for two 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.919
 reasons and for which they run on the necks of 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.780
 arterial vessels of which we can 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.139
 feel the pulse but especially 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.330
 in the case of a thyroid disease e 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.040
 especially when this is hyper 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.290
 functioning, you can hear puffs 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.610
 vascular effects due precisely to the increase 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.340
 let's say thyroid vasculature 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.790
 pathological therefore always according to 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.639
 position behind the 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.900
 patient places the phonendoscope on 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:16.610
 anterior region of the neck and is sought 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:20.419
 to perceive if there are sayings 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:23.000
 thus alterations of vascular sophie 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.910
 with this maneuver you also hear one 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.820
 important thing is the passage of air 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.570
 in the upper airway than in the case of 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.889
 a pathology for example in the thyroid 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:38.410
 Stenante can give rise to noises 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.610
 pathological due to narrowness 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.340
 tracheal laryngeal that if it comes 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.330
 determined by the swelling of the 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.100
 increased thyroid volume per 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.880
 further explanations on the exam 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.740
 target in the neck you can turn 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.620
 to the e-mail that is flowing in this 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.919
 moment overlaid 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.919
 Thanks for the attention
