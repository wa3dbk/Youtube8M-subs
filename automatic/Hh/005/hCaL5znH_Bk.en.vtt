 renault trucks stand you have three 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.259
 universe of different a universe that 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.810
 is called strong role was the echo that is 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.000
 devoted to fuel economy for 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.390
 our offer extends pioneer and leader 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.509
 in terms of 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.520
 of fuel consumption this is a 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.110
 important area for us you have 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.780
 a second part devoted to 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.940
 urban freight transport with 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.129
 vehicles from the distribution to the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.220
 optimized delivery for the reduction of 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.690
 consumption and also cleantech 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.170
 that is vehicles using 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.060
 alternative energies like the 100% 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.580
 electric as the hybrid or 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.970
 natural gas is then a little bit more 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.370
 far off the booth you have 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.290
 the passion atmosphere that is turned around 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.690
 of our commitment in the races of 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.830
 trucks in truck racing with particular 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:14.320
 a new race simulator 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.940
 pretty impressive all these vehicles 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.220
 are euro 5 vehicles 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.890
 we are enjoying an ogre 2012 for 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.080
 introduce our new euro 6 engine 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.360
 which is wave-shaped and which 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.810
 will be accompanied by other engines too 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.480
 for the whole range namely 5 8 8 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.630
 liters eleven cities and president 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.820
 so we took the technology sdr 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.060
 we know well and keep 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.670
 used for many years which 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.960
 has been optimized for this also with 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.299
 light with 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.390
 on engines 5 liters and 8 liters 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.190
 with a combination of systems 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.600
 that can increase the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.000
 engine temperature and make the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:06.140
 more efficient sr system on the 11th and the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:09.350
 13 and the goal is clearly to reduce 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.300
 consumption the fuel item in 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.910
 the operating account of our customers 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.700
 so it goes through different means 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.980
 it can go through an optimization of 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.440
 diesel vehicle but it can also 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.630
 go through do it the choice of a 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.670
 electric alternative motorization 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.310
 hybrid with natural gas that can prove 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.110
 more paying than the dl according to the uses 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.000
 public then at this show there is the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.940
 court of renault trucks announced the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.980
