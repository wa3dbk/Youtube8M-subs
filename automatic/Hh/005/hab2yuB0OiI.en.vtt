00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
screwdriver and we're going to take out

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.749 
screwdriver and we're going to take out
the<00:01:57.710> two<00:01:57.860> screws<00:01:58.330> that<00:01:59.330> are<00:01:59.479> deep<00:01:59.720> inside<00:02:00.759> you

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
the two screws that are deep inside you

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.169 
the two screws that are deep inside you
can<00:02:01.910> see<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.179> there's<00:02:02.330> one<00:02:02.390> there<00:02:02.750> and

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
can see that there's one there and

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.460 
can see that there's one there and
there's<00:02:05.179> also<00:02:05.330> one<00:02:05.630> over<00:02:05.840> here<00:02:06.020> on<00:02:06.050> this<00:02:06.229> side

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
there's also one over here on this side

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:39.430 
there's also one over here on this side
and<00:02:07.420> we're<00:02:08.420> going<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.570> just<00:02:08.720> take<00:02:08.869> these<00:02:08.959> out

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.110 

also<00:02:40.440> there's<00:02:41.040> maybe<00:02:41.190> more<00:02:41.280> screws<00:02:41.760> on<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
also there's maybe more screws on the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.470 
also there's maybe more screws on the
top<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:43.730> this<00:02:44.730> time<00:02:44.940> we'll<00:02:45.090> be<00:02:45.150> using<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
top and this time we'll be using the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.140 
top and this time we'll be using the
small<00:02:45.750> Phillips<00:02:46.050> screwdriver<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.030> can

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
small Phillips screwdriver and you can

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.580 
small Phillips screwdriver and you can
see<00:02:48.270> why<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:48.570> keep<00:02:48.690> on<00:02:48.870> trading<00:02:49.110> off<00:02:49.320> on<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
see why we keep on trading off on the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.710 
see why we keep on trading off on the
screwdrivers<00:02:50.180> because<00:02:51.180> there's<00:02:51.390> not<00:02:51.510> much

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
screwdrivers because there's not much

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.100 
screwdrivers because there's not much
room<00:02:52.050> between<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.530> screw<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:54.510> dashboard

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
room between the screw and the dashboard

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.280 
room between the screw and the dashboard
so<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:56.610> gives<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.910> very<00:02:57.090> little<00:02:57.300> room<00:02:57.570> and

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
so it gives you a very little room and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.080 
so it gives you a very little room and
that's<00:02:58.770> why<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.010> use<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.310> small<00:02:59.430> Phillips

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that's why we use the small Phillips

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.570 
that's why we use the small Phillips
screwdriver<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:01.320> there's<00:03:01.800> also<00:03:01.920> deep<00:03:02.220> screws

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
screwdriver and there's also deep screws

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.010 
screwdriver and there's also deep screws
that's<00:03:02.970> why<00:03:03.180> we<00:03:03.270> use<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.510> long<00:03:03.660> Phillips

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
that's why we use the long Phillips

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:15.530 
that's why we use the long Phillips
screwdriver<00:03:13.850> after<00:03:14.850> we<00:03:14.940> take<00:03:15.120> these<00:03:15.300> screws

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
screwdriver after we take these screws

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.600 
screwdriver after we take these screws
