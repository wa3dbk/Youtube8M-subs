00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
and this sort of technical revolution

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.100 
and this sort of technical revolution
and<00:00:20.410> Grayson<00:00:20.920> is<00:00:21.100> an<00:00:21.570> American<00:00:22.570> coming<00:00:22.930> to

London bringing on this new technology

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.750 
London bringing on this new technology
so<00:00:26.380> I<00:00:26.800> mean<00:00:27.010> it's<00:00:27.160> it's<00:00:27.340> the<00:00:27.580> original

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
so I mean it's it's the original

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.940 
so I mean it's it's the original
characters<00:00:28.630> but<00:00:28.960> it<00:00:29.080> certainly<00:00:29.320> strays<00:00:29.830> a

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
characters but it certainly strays a

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.770 
characters but it certainly strays a
little<00:00:30.220> from<00:00:30.400> the<00:00:30.610> story<00:00:30.910> because<00:00:31.570> it's<00:00:31.690> a

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
little from the story because it's a

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.390 
little from the story because it's a
series<00:00:32.110> you<00:00:32.260> know<00:00:32.349> I<00:00:32.379> see<00:00:32.680> I<00:00:32.710> feel<00:00:32.950> like<00:00:33.100> the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
series you know I see I feel like the

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.950 
series you know I see I feel like the
story<00:00:33.640> can<00:00:33.850> only<00:00:33.970> go<00:00:34.120> for<00:00:34.300> so<00:00:34.420> long<00:00:34.600> you<00:00:34.840> need

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960

she says she very much wants to follow
in<00:01:11.810> his<00:01:11.990> footsteps<00:01:13.210> but<00:01:14.210> in<00:01:14.330> doing<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:14.690> she<00:01:14.870> has

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
in his footsteps but in doing so she has

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.630 
in his footsteps but in doing so she has
to<00:01:15.290> be<00:01:15.410> very<00:01:15.620> progressive<00:01:15.800> and<00:01:16.130> she<00:01:16.250> has<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.520> be

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
to be very progressive and she has to be

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.940 
to be very progressive and she has to be
really<00:01:16.940> she's<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.750> fight<00:01:17.990> for<00:01:18.260> what<00:01:18.380> she<00:01:18.530> wants

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
really she's to fight for what she wants

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.440 
really she's to fight for what she wants
and<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.520> think<00:01:19.729> that<00:01:19.820> comes<00:01:20.000> through<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.240> lot<00:01:20.420> in

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
and I think that comes through a lot in

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.930 
and I think that comes through a lot in
sort<00:01:20.720> of<00:01:20.780> all<00:01:21.200> all<00:01:21.860> aspects<00:01:22.369> of<00:01:22.460> her<00:01:22.550> life<00:01:22.760> I

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
sort of all all aspects of her life I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.609 
sort of all all aspects of her life I
think<00:01:23.119> she's<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.300> bit<00:01:23.420> of<00:01:23.510> a<00:01:23.570> fighter<00:01:23.869> whereas

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
think she's a bit of a fighter whereas

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.250 
think she's a bit of a fighter whereas
you<00:01:24.740> know<00:01:24.860> in<00:01:25.070> different<00:01:25.520> sort<00:01:25.729> of<00:01:26.260> versions

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
you know in different sort of versions

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.810 
you know in different sort of versions
of<00:01:27.410> Mina<00:01:27.590> Mina<00:01:27.830> isn't<00:01:28.130> necessarily<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.610> like

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
of Mina Mina isn't necessarily that like

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.140 
of Mina Mina isn't necessarily that like
I<00:01:28.910> think<00:01:29.090> often<00:01:29.450> she's<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.810> damsel<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:30.440> she's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
I think often she's the damsel and she's

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.370 
I think often she's the damsel and she's
you<00:01:32.150> know<00:01:32.180> she's<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:32.540> she's<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:33.020> she's<00:01:33.350> a

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
you know she's the she's a she's a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.770 
you know she's the she's a she's a
victim<00:01:33.830> but<00:01:34.340> in<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:34.670> one<00:01:34.910> I<00:01:35.210> think<00:01:35.660> she's

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
victim but in this one I think she's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.750 
victim but in this one I think she's
very<00:01:35.990> empowered<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:36.830> I<00:01:37.220> think<00:01:37.460> that<00:01:37.610> women

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
very empowered and I think that women

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.030 
very empowered and I think that women
will<00:01:38.030> really<00:01:38.270> relate<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.540> Mina<00:01:38.869> in<00:01:39.770> this

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
will really relate to Mina in this

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.469 
will really relate to Mina in this
production<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.970> think<00:01:41.210> there's<00:01:41.330> something

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
production I think there's something

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.050 
production I think there's something
great<00:01:42.320> for<00:01:42.470> women<00:01:42.650> in<00:01:42.860> it<00:01:42.979> with<00:01:43.790> all<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
great for women in it with all the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.370 
great for women in it with all the
female<00:01:44.330> characters<00:01:44.690> as<00:01:44.780> well<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:45.229> look

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
female characters as well that you look

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.359 
female characters as well that you look
at<00:01:45.470> all<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.590> female<00:01:45.830> characters<00:01:46.160> and<00:01:46.250> they're

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
at all the female characters and they're

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.230 
at all the female characters and they're
so<00:01:46.550> strong

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.550
