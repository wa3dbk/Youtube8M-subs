00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.179
 the first two parts you can 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.059
 go see the two previous videos 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.400
 so today is the third and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.070
 last part where I answer your 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.650
 questions about this match so that's because 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.949
 that you enjoyed the video and we 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.810
 start everything is faded at 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.390
 starbucks i'm really still tim 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.230
 starbucks gerard starbucks but 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.600
 I really would really like the cooling 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.520
 cool starbucks 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.170
 by the way, it's too good it's finally the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.770
 kind and like it looks like it's like 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.300
 leek in one in a lime on 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.670
 sir jean therme on sale their share 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.829
 jane i had her at starbucks but 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.110
 I had a price well there to attend 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.489
 this kind of lemonade plus syrup 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.100
 raspberry who I think said I want 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.980
 of the order plugs in but it's too much 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.780
 good so that's where it's faith that's 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.640
 Funny it'll be hot as it costs 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.100
 really too expensive for just some 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.890
 thing to see so I'm more team 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.790
 tim hortons today voice or in 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.260
 ten years 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.020
 so I think in ten years it's 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.500
 easier than in 25 years so that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.540
 in ten years I'm going to 28 years that's for sure 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.159
 that I want before a nice kid in 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.080
 same time a child I'm going 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.460
 give birth to people had time this 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.040

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.030
 even that before my house that is 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.680
 Stable with Habib yeah that's what 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.049
 so that you wanted to have a 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.939
 beauty chain so I see by obama 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.770
 chains like a jeanjean beauty chain 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.100
 in makeup and then I like it is the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.530
 beauty but I restrict myself adjusts 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.070
 first of all he like I'll never have there 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.320
 a blog channel never 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.240
 but the fact that I do not let myself 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.920
 videos then machine it's a chain 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.990
 video because I have videos on 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.360
 youtube so here but youtube has 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.650
 favorite so the game takes a category 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.540
 jeans united states quebec france legs 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.340
 were United States off just the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.880
 people who do a soft English 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.119
 but also from his stays to spin well 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.360
 the story never two required each 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:18.540
 libya aspect in a history in quebec 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:23.830
 I would say I really have the videos to 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.670

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.830

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.620
 creams to verdi and funding I would have 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.450
 could say gules but the question if 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.540
 I should have done all the buzz but I like 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.340
 really videos an asset 140 never 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.980
 but I demand that they really like the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.560
 play again during his rush as I like 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.269
 really and fine and but have grown 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.090
 that it is so video its slow too long 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.650
 the idou like 29 minutes and then I just 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.570
 no time to watch it but I like 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.489

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.989
 tapas of the globe with my drizzle then 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.420
 I would really like to do something 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.780

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.209

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.600
 Quebec version and I can finally 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.400
 leave it like that a least youtube 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.160
 known that you want us to discover 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.660
 and I've already talked about it the memo is 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.570
 really yes so to the huge to 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:21.730

 which happens to you of refusal but a video 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.600
 many times it's really good 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.850
 really to rome and poor and people 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.700

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.890
 light is just on a robot figure the 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.500
 video was kind not good quality 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.730
 piqued on video that was important to me 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.280
 but 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.319
 I already filmed it but it would have 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.659
 really normal or more complicated 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.280
 in a morning routine where daddy is 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.349
 what 's happening I'm filming some of it 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.390
 as was less well filmed it was in 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.940
 what also I like and it is to become 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.220
 what to throw my cave is the most beautiful 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.660
 so it's often and too cute then 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.349
 when I'm in communication in the 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.420
 media that made radio hype bfm - 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.840
 earthais my do more radio than 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.000
 the atheist etc to become a facilitator of 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.959
 TV or radio what is this small 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.090

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.129

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.590
 pittman masseur who do you love me 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.359

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.310
 but yes otherwise I'm really not a 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.470
 big fan of the medoc are the only time 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.039

 victories that rest I tried with the 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.160
 sauce I bathe the lips would taste if 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.419
 long before I'm surprised it's me 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.250
 I came back hot in the guts 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.350
 if you did not find these little 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.600
 but it's really good and janry 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.340
 Wednesday the message to merkel in a 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.900
 times when I saw that I have beautiful me because 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.820
 that it 's just going in the marsh the well 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.560
 without him I would have been traumatized I 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.630
 do not eat amuse mcdo people but 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.729
 when when you have children if yes 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.740
 how much I would like it to be forward 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.080

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.729

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.849
 team of two the fna the injured injured 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.440
 21 other teams of 2 fake jeans and I 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.510
 find that three is a good number 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.410
 if you still had a place to go in 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.389
 trip home or so it's a subject to 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.729
 every day I go to the sites of 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.500
 trips to go traveling just 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.500
 not the divas that I would really like 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.270
 those as participants except I see 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.950
 it costs me as overpriced done 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.840
