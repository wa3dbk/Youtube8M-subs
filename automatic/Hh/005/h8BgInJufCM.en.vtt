00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
just so much fun you know that's why I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.340 
just so much fun you know that's why I
haven't<00:01:44.369> really<00:01:44.700> been<00:01:44.850> playing<00:01:45.750> black<00:01:46.020> ops<00:01:46.200> 1

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
haven't really been playing black ops 1

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.380 
haven't really been playing black ops 1
so<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> haven't<00:01:47.189> been<00:01:47.310> able<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:47.850> gameplays

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
so I haven't been able to get gameplays

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.359 
so I haven't been able to get gameplays
clips<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.200> upload<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.799> that's<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
clips to upload so that's one of the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.530 
clips to upload so that's one of the
biggest<00:01:50.579> reasons<00:01:50.970> why<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> haven't<00:01:51.360> been
