00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:06.820
 good people 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.460
 now we are going to work a little bit it was a show of this technique 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:12.129
 of the battery 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.379
 are basic principles of battery hebe place I wanted to talk about the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.630
 choice of drumstick 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.369
 this is a very important thing is not that the students are beginning to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.390
 ask what the real drumstick is 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.390
 but play drums 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.130
 does not require a little more 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.770
 the one I have with two parents for two barqueata 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.890
 the model of s 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.810
 and a heavier model 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.940
 this here is a brothel of the general 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.400
 currently working at apcc insisted 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.769
 they work with vat which was a bit heavier 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.400
 until you can create a little more resistance 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.080
 the model that is much bigger 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.350
 of a thickness 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.560
 ney matogrosso 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.580
 already requires a little bit more 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.360
 david and conditioners 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.540
 giving your moves acts as you pick up a lighter stick 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.640
 I'll quote a little bit more loose and it helps a lot now when it's time to play 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.020
 Boavista is very comfortable, nor do I particularly like to finish it 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.320
 has a little more leads to which preside the air if you take 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.650
 depending on the musical style almost touched 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.770
 for example a boatman - which requires a little more movement 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.700
 how did nero work with models changed airs like this one? 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.610
 a drumstick 7 air 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.600
 how is musseque work a little more weight as media as I go to work 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.520
 the record 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.539
 in studio 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.409
 working on rewriting ballads which demands a blow to the strongest footprint in the 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.149
 person from a box I work I like it I like to record and play with drumsticks 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.479
 heavier piraja couto too with 10 you exchange you playing in 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.100
 world 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.290
 again 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.999
 It has little acoustic style, but it does have to have a sound. 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.010
 a little more 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.180
 I can say so 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.730
 lower is not 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.710
 people who play a lot of church who have acoustics - and such that they study at home 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.529
 who can not do many measures 9 from the mother of the father 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:17.419
 does not advise to take the lightest drumstick that just take a little lighter 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:18.659
 now 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.900
 it's dangerous to be addicted to any kind of machine it's cool to be seen in 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.689
 varied pick up a tit but part does all in black gives one relaxed with 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.889
 The lightest beat is then the question 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.999
 You always touch it, it's a matter of taste. It's always good. You have one. 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.819
 the average barqueata half the model thought by the three fathers of Baptist to 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.669
 sister the five arh models is a medium model the cta is already a finer model 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:44.560
 ba 500 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.549
 How did you change airs? 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.239
 they work use a motorcycle fall of it depends a little more than the slight 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.519
 as a hero's pain a fall and Chileans as a little bit larger complement 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.289
 will be expected of 5 2 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:00.889
 the 2p are to have enough thought
