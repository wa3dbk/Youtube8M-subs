00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
 unwell 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.110
 But we do not just want to 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.110
 Time to be seen but also upside down 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.489
 that too is possible 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.489
 but a bit more complicated 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.149
 we do not have to have more spatial understanding for that 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.569
 For example, at one point you only see your feet 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.550
 I'll give you a title track take home from an old one 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.550
 Things simply Modena figure with playmobil figures requested 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.820
 Petri goes to court 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820
 then you can see the right perspectives 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.390
 Dr 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.460
 now the male is supposed to 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.510
 but upside down in Dietkirchen Trichet Madrid 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.210
 make them 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.210
 Kalsow it's supposed to do a backflip 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.340
 legally without physical effort 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.750
 with him, of course, always have to give away a certain spam 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.270
 greater 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.850
 So getting fatter, so to speak per capita is getting smaller in the well into the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.820
 Distant moves 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.860
 we should not fritter 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.860
 the head and not too little Christian and too big 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.110
 should be something like this sometime Dr's feet have to break his head 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.860
 brave Hawking SPD to 8 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.420
 and do it 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.780
 the approx 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.490
 Of course I have to shorten everything because of course I am the whole Kopper 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.400
 contracts 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.400
 not possible shared in the end he is fine 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.949
 Of course now has to make the head a little smaller 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.009
 Eck says the whole body is the best approach 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.009
 except in federal politics 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.859
 most likely to start a bit further down 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.649
 and so it is 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.649
 Here too I can make a bit thinner 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.749
 and a bit short 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.909
 as I said, "lately i could well recognize 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:49.339
 Statements him before that too 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:52.979
 this should be the focus 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.829
 He lays about in the hip 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.679
 the maggots in bacon 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.869
 that means hands up and down 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:02.869
 I leave hideouts in the classroom 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:08.929
 it is now completely warped 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:10.599
 every other picture 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.379
 never keep running thicker 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.679
 Körzell of course 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:19.569
 the upper body getting shorter and shorter with Merck suffering from head 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.769
 and Günther 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:30.929
 it's a bit baffled 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:34.760
 Serious if he 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.679
 far ago 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.679
 More would be lying on the floor in front of you 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.219
 the thief percent Beijing 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.939
 stay in the head 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.939
 The citizens also have to get people together 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:02.539
 and the others may be 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:31.150
 Thus, one can only see the small head 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
 that hide the feet 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.860
 it never has a half turn 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.860
 we want like a cat 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.800
 he should still turn his head at Schaaf 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.879
 Unfortunately, we can not do it this time 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.580
 the friends of Tomba used by him demand us and turn back shield 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.099
 would 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.099
 Bush travel 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.759
 so 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.680
 the flour an answer no 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.520
 the gazettes 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.520
 around Kato's principle the same again 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.620
 and the other direction 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.620
 the clubs are getting smaller 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.330
 Upper body are getting bigger 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.099
 and everything is diverging 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.099
 then it draws against Cologne from 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.610
 usually you have to probe the BAK 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:05.669
 Heinrich Männle help at school 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.659
 important are about 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.939
 nice comments poularden a review 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.770
 Pollen comments 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.589
 that helps me 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.229
 Veit like Dirks 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.229
 to do well and better 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.280
 Researchers also like to relax with tutorials questions 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.189
 also Cantona 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:34.189
 Do You Have Questions 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.599
 send it to me 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.599
 Either I answer them immediately so that usually does 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.150
 and so I put on then sometimes good story l 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.889
 Well, these questions could have been 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.719
 or I will answer only in writing 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.689
 and Aleem n 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:54.689
 give that is not enough to finally make peace 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:08.270
 We already have more of our France 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.050
 our stick figure 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.839
 that hangs upside down 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:17.289
 see the value 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:19.089
 Treitz yourself 

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:22.579
 Of course Hasselffurt must also have the artful as dazed 

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:25.879
 Add the eyes at the very end 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:29.419
 since Manha sees the eyes again through the perspective changes 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.020
 also pretty fast 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:41.669
 in the mouth that now for regular customers 

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:44.839
 Silvia 

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.839
 the little bit is relatively strict 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.430
 Thanks for coming, I say goodbye until next time 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.849
 this year comic-con
