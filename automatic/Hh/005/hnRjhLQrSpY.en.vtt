00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:40.130
 ok is that the steering wheel of the head 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.930
 mission 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.540
 the small steering wheel and find here 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:53.020
 the connector the baby because I 'm 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.020
 showing this connector the baby then 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:02.530
 here the pbx link 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.530
 I'll put it here now to protect 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 tim 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.680
 the focus of the deal has enem 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.740
 so now show us how we 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.200
 set up iphone also asks chissola 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:42.360
 winking looking for an iphone sign 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:54.240
 Come on, man. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 Just for you, ready on us, let's click. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.630
 here was from there he has even found 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.630
 positive does not set on it here 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.790
 right 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.520
 basically the configuration of it is what 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.110
 will put as automatic connection is 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.420
 configure the static ip address is 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:27.350
 so basically I'm going to put the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:34.200
 ip address 192 168 0 11 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:37.739
 the hamas face 255 255 255 0 and the address 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:45.050
 of the router is 192 168 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:48.480
 10 will be the address configuration 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.610
 then almost only now, just the bes 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.610
 common here 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.870
 The game is to connect 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.160
 W 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.600
 so here 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:15.590
 alan he already stopped blinking and connected 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.340
 here ready 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.340
 what I see 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:27.939
 It's okay to put it here, you see. 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:51.660
 is practically instantaneous and a little lonely 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.450
 almost nothing compared to 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.920
 bluetooth 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.269
 So I'll do a review after the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.440
 functions like time okay 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.440
