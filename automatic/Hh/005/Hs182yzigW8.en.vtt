 made harder than me laws of people 2 maybe even 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.479
 percoto professional stories so where they still certain you buy the fact 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.330
 that that supports these things are displaced in the end must make people 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.460
 you have no mere political turn and therefore 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.520
 a person really comes out who still has his politics I find myself 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.819
 that human beings always have their poetics 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.509
 then it is the everyday life that changes you 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.509
 and I'd like to find someone who really has a DNA 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.180
 dddddd credem bad because there is a question mark, perhaps the murders you 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.509
 that if one has matured anyway he is not good or not 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.200
 I know when you see the video of di di napoli that you see a priority 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.760
 a man who smokes twice withdraws the test to get rid of the hyenas 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.529
 really a shocking thing no i don't even think about picking it up 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:02.789

 balloon counts a lot what the first approach is also I always look for 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.490
 of when I know that it reaches the person food I try to distract myself some more 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.690
 to look at it for the first time I can't stay to know it no because we say 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.410
 however then it is 15 minutes a quarter of an hour of time where however one with 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.900
 fact that knows that you have to put the machine down anyway already many abbot

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:40.669
 of parts barriers

 because the touched the ears yay yay yay looked at the nose hair it seems 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.060
 trivial. you are truly the trait of the intimacy of the personality not 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.050
 you're really close if nba is really all about the ear 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.649

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:02.400
 confidence rain then fought all the flags up to 15 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.250
 it also helps a lot because then the person becomes calm and lets himself be done 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.150
 comes for absolutely what 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.970
 and then the laying of the hands more or less just serves escrit for a writing of 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:14.700
 let's say 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.279
 futurist 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.690
 translate to the image plane but definitely not needed 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.289
 goes to do 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.199
