00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.750
 tousled not be 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.050
 mmm 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.610
 do not need and we are 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.420
 well we are in another boyfriend and I am very 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.460
 very very cheerful guys because he's older 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.440
 because we are happy then 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.719
 because this is not so much that I have been 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.120
 supporting in my videos us 32 that 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.460
 uploaded has been supporting me more all 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.159
 those who support me and that's why it's appreciated 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.409
 and I send you a psychological hug to 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:01:00.440
 all of you all good in this 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.559
 videoblog is about some questions that 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.679
 they have been asking me obviously for 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.450
 facebook by twitter on all sides 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:10.520
 for wherever you're asking me that 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.140
 may where I do the systems I think that 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.200
 it's up to minecraft and all that kind of 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.899
 things then good because more or less like 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.300
 I knew him separate me because we have a 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.610
 Also invited the video that Ivan Ivan 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.729
 Soler explode like it here is not 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.860
 included also first question which one 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.539
 it was my first impression when when 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.460
 I started to see michael when I 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.000
 they commented on what was beginning to speak 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.400
 of the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.700
 girls print by pressing 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.290
 that game is crap but because what 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.600
 I said I do not have the same god in him so 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.210
 which I said because obviously you see a game 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.560
 as pixels and you say guatafan like 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.470
 as people play this video game and then 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.360
 directed I do not know I do not understand it when it 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.210
 they practiced this from that of that 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.380
 they killed kills the cows killed everything not 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.330
 I said they killed skeletons I said guatafán 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.510
 second question because there is to play 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.179
 minecraft is that this answer is very 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.340
 very very like that very silly but what 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.650
 I decided to play because I was looking 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.700
 videos from youtube internet either 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.540
 USA of Mexico of Spain watched videos and 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.490
 hip hop as good as I try it and what 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.190
 download regulations search the forums 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.500
 come in as download then then I 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.030
 download it and this one comments 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.560
 can survival will start a little its 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.450
 rival and until I knew it is 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.340
 multiplayer was 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.860
 It will be free I said good sample 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.500
 multiplayer and that's when I entered 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.890
 the wonderful games of hunger and that 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.110
 when unfortunately I started third 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.730
 wonders what more I 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.050
 impressed from minecraft what most 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.390
 impressed of minecraft was the 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.690
 structure of the world I can not stay 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.560
 like that guata fac may that says all the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.810
 world is that you can get to 1 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.870
 there on the map and it turns out that it never 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.150
 it ends up good it was very very very far away 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.250
 I think it's over but not me 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.560
 we release says out there that I like it here 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.660
 an oriental or european 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.970
 from here the American area I do not know where the 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.610
 true says a guy if the sale I think 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.560
 that a year to be able to remember the the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.709
 world of minecraft completely from 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.040
 fat up to your destination 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.780
 fourth and last question that came from 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.910
 minecraft the truth I would not change anything 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.080
 basic average something would not change not be 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.600
 the game what would change 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.990
 that will optimize improve the game so that 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.330
 so grab on computers that from 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.900
 flat they are shit and then it's the 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.910
 disputed not that I do not know what for example that 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.150
 if I am they start to compute a laptop 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.070
 that already digital and that allows me what 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.410
 I grabbed it does not grab me the game and it improves 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.040
 well not very well but if I run 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.290
 something as I have moved and with the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.320
 answers from Ivan Ivan you tell us 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.790
 about minecraft having presented to 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.790
 this to this beautiful public that we 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.170
 they are living now juanes from may 97 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.460
 I am already the material and I am a blogger of 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.770
 here on youtube and good talking 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.450
 facebook we had an idea to make a 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.859
 kind of tag in which we would do 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.690
 some questions about this game that 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.040
 We both like minecraft and we decided 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.500
 answer them so you can know 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.510
 also our likes answers and 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.910
 thoughts about this game so 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.650
 there goes the first question was what was 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.360
 your impression about minecraft the truth 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.520
 is that when I discovered minecraft I 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.930
 I was a bit disappointed as I 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.370
 we discovered and krafft through a 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.870
 friend and the truth is that when I saw it and 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.650
 he told me a little bit I stayed a little 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.330
 disappointed 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.190
 I judge you that you have to try it for 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.930
 know how it is then I simply view 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.460
 go to many cubes and they told me things 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.050
 that did not make much sense as per 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.509
 example of what the game is going 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.979
 will survive zombie spiders and others and 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.690
 let's say I did not like it very much, 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.750
 it attracted me so my first impression 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.330
 about minecraft was 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.890
 2 why did you decide to start playing 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.540
 I decided to start playing because at the same time 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.160
 of being so curious 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.850
 It impressed so much that such a game 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.020
 basic and so simple could be so 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.520
 extremely popular I decided to start 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.530
 play because a friend from the Canary Islands 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.940
 called david invited me to do it and from 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.670
 this way and known all this world 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.050
 of the minecraft gameplays and so on like 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.520
 I have not met May it is a pleasure 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.780
 be here in your channel and the truth is 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.940
 that I started playing because I saw some 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.680
 videos my friend told me and we started 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.540
 to make a server of the other two a 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.790
 little to explain me a little 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.590
 play and finally we hit a flawed 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.720
 that I got up at 8 in the morning to 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.460
 post to play on the weekends 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.320
 to have more time in the early morning 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.730
 to play third question what was it 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.169
 that you are most impressed with minecraft 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.120
 possibly one of the things that I 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.280
 impressed is creativity you can 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.380
 do what you want in this world 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.810
 you can make electrical conduits in order 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.580
 I was very impressed discovering things 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.410
 inside not to mention the mods and the 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.390
 varieties of things that are within 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.730
 these games let's say that impressed me 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.310
 minecraft overall I loved everything 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.120
 I discovered and I loved everything I saw 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.070
 and the truth is that 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.750
 playing for a long time because it's something 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.699
 that really entertains me and that makes 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.400
 that I would laugh for a while with my friends or 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.229
 just creating my things and so on and 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.940
 thing number 4 that change is in 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.380
 minecraft but I think it's the question 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.540
 it's a bit difficult because if you change 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.160
 something from minecraft is no longer minecraft is 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.260
 say handyman is characterized by the 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.479
 cubes for how it is for the textures 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.100
 etcetera now there are many more packs of 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.020
 textures and the truth is that they favor 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.490
 much more the game and they are not bad and 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.169
 I love playing with these textures 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.400
 also and good guys, I hope that 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.960
 you liked the video of miami or 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.610
 you have my channel in the description of what 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.080
 I also leave here on a label and 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.630

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.990
 a hug and enchanted from Spain 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.030
 iván soles blogs chau and I play the most 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.180
 you guys have already heard the answers 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.190
 of Ivan that the truth if he did not answer 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.530
 which is almost any other although I 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.210
 almost the same then then from our 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.620
 point of view I would like to know what is 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.180
 your point of view and these questions that 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.590
 will leave us in the comments of 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.539
 what do you think of minecraft what 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.230
 would change minecraft and remember 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:06.120
 online in the video that is 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.040
 too much and you can also continue in my 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.070
 social networks that already know what is 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.960
 facebook that will be on this side and 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.090
 twitter that was on this side there is 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.190
 where I spend more time in these networks and 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.290
 I'm more on twitter it 's done 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:25.070
 others remember no comments

 thank you very much and see you later
