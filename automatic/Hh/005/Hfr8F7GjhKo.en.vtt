like<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.600> said<00:02:57.660> there<00:02:58.200> had<00:02:58.380> been<00:02:58.410> no<00:02:59.060> issues<00:03:00.060> up

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
like I said there had been no issues up

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.690 
like I said there had been no issues up
until<00:03:01.170> about<00:03:03.920> four<00:03:04.920> days<00:03:05.100> ago

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
until about four days ago

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.790 
until about four days ago
I<00:03:05.730> believe<00:03:08.510> they<00:03:09.510> started<00:03:10.260> getting<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.650> loose

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
I believe they started getting the loose

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.720 
I believe they started getting the loose
again<00:03:11.269> I<00:03:12.500> can<00:03:13.500> even<00:03:13.680> feel<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.190> right<00:03:14.370> now<00:03:14.549> when

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
again I can even feel it right now when

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.600 
again I can even feel it right now when
I'm<00:03:14.850> talking<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.690> I've<00:03:15.900> got<00:03:16.380> them<00:03:16.650> secured<00:03:17.370> in

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
I'm talking and I've got them secured in

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.560 
I'm talking and I've got them secured in
there<00:03:18.360> with<00:03:18.930> adhesive<00:03:19.760> but<00:03:20.760> they<00:03:20.880> still<00:03:21.239> feel

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
there with adhesive but they still feel

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.870 
there with adhesive but they still feel
really<00:03:22.670> really<00:03:23.670> loose<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.600> unstable<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
really really loose and unstable and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.920 
really really loose and unstable and
because<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:28.489> guess<00:03:29.489> my<00:03:30.000> gums<00:03:30.299> in<00:03:30.690> the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
because of that I guess my gums in the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.509 
because of that I guess my gums in the
back<00:03:31.230> over<00:03:31.769> here<00:03:32.190> on<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.489> bottom<00:03:32.670> side<00:03:34.519> they

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
back over here on the bottom side they

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.460 
back over here on the bottom side they
have<00:03:35.760> shrunken<00:03:36.209> more<00:03:36.480> on<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.840> spot<00:03:37.170> for

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
have shrunken more on that spot for

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.430 
have shrunken more on that spot for
whatever<00:03:37.620> reason<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.340> believe<00:03:38.549> because<00:03:39.440> it's

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
whatever reason I believe because it's

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.360 
whatever reason I believe because it's
cutting<00:03:41.070> down<00:03:42.260> into<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:43.470> whole<00:03:43.799> area<00:03:44.310> right

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
cutting down into this whole area right

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.170 
cutting down into this whole area right
here<00:03:44.579> like<00:03:44.910> it's<00:03:45.920> it's<00:03:46.920> not<00:03:47.220> as<00:03:47.400> bad<00:03:47.609> as<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:47.970> was

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
here like it's it's not as bad as it was

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.860 
here like it's it's not as bad as it was
a<00:03:48.209> few<00:03:48.329> days<00:03:48.690> ago<00:03:49.070> but<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.280> was<00:03:50.730> really<00:03:51.390> bad<00:03:51.630> it

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
a few days ago but it was really bad it

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.170 
a few days ago but it was really bad it
thought<00:03:52.109> really<00:03:52.440> sore<00:03:52.950> sore<00:03:53.400> like<00:03:53.700> somebody

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
thought really sore sore like somebody

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.660 
thought really sore sore like somebody
had<00:03:54.420> like<00:03:54.630> punched<00:03:55.260> me<00:03:55.440> in<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.560> face<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.280> mean

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
had like punched me in the face I mean

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.300 
had like punched me in the face I mean
it<00:03:56.790> was<00:03:56.880> really<00:03:57.239> painful<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:58.109> so<00:03:58.859> I<00:03:58.890> know<00:03:59.100> that

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
it was really painful and so I know that

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.090 
it was really painful and so I know that
I<00:03:59.640> need<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.060> get<00:04:00.150> them<00:04:00.390> relined<00:04:00.810> again<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.620> don't

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
I need to get them relined again I don't

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.509 
I need to get them relined again I don't
have<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.489> money<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.730> do<00:04:03.120> that<00:04:03.329> right<00:04:03.630> now

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
have the money to do that right now

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.670 
have the money to do that right now
but<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:06.120> compensate<00:04:06.570> for<00:04:07.019> that<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.440> actually

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
but to compensate for that I actually

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.610 
but to compensate for that I actually
started<00:04:08.340> putting<00:04:08.579> more<00:04:09.269> adhesive<00:04:10.019> in<00:04:10.560> the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
started putting more adhesive in the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.420 
started putting more adhesive in the
back<00:04:10.950> bottom<00:04:12.109> to<00:04:13.109> add<00:04:13.380> like<00:04:13.769> an<00:04:13.920> extra

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
back bottom to add like an extra

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.210 
back bottom to add like an extra
cushioning<00:04:14.970> there<00:04:15.239> because<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:16.440> was<00:04:16.680> really

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
cushioning there because it was really

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.830 
cushioning there because it was really
really<00:04:17.549> uncomfortable

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.630 

so<00:04:21.840> that's<00:04:22.830> that<00:04:24.500> can't<00:04:25.500> get<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.770> ring<00:04:26.070> line<00:04:26.310> yet

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
so that's that can't get a ring line yet

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.540 
so that's that can't get a ring line yet
because<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.770> don't<00:04:28.770> have<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.070> money<00:04:29.190> for<00:04:29.280> it

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
because I don't have the money for it

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.220 
because I don't have the money for it
yet<00:04:29.730> but<00:04:30.420> I<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:31.560> have<00:04:32.810> heard<00:04:33.810> of<00:04:33.870> a<00:04:33.930> product

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
yet but I I have heard of a product

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.060 
yet but I I have heard of a product

a<00:05:03.660> bowl<00:05:03.840> of<00:05:03.990> hot<00:05:04.470> water<00:05:04.530> for<00:05:05.190> like<00:05:05.370> ten<00:05:05.730> minutes

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
a bowl of hot water for like ten minutes

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.200 
a bowl of hot water for like ten minutes
and<00:05:06.360> then<00:05:06.540> you<00:05:06.570> um<00:05:07.460> it's<00:05:08.460> just<00:05:08.820> like<00:05:09.000> when<00:05:09.180> you

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
and then you um it's just like when you

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.050 
and then you um it's just like when you
go<00:05:09.420> to<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.630> dentist<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.140> get<00:05:10.350> it<00:05:10.500> done<00:05:11.060> but

roll<00:05:16.650> it<00:05:17.160> into<00:05:17.430> like<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:17.790> long<00:05:18.090> thing<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.290> then

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
roll it into like a long thing and then

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.720

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.460 
it set for a few minutes or whatever and
then<00:05:26.220> it's<00:05:26.370> supposed<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.420> be<00:05:27.600> like<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.350> know

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
but from what I've read online it lasts

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.170
