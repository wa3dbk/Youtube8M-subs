00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 after my first two videos 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.629
 on industrialized orange juice 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.179
 A lot of people come and ask me about 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.700
 a certain brand of juice that is said 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.410
 the people really want to know if 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.000
 believe in the label 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.220
 this is what happens when companies 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.859
 live deceiving the consumer 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.730
 nobody believes in anything else let's go 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.650
 parts 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.720
 the first information I check in 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.949
 any label is always the list of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.170
 Ingredients 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.720
 here is written orange juice 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.270
 integral and acidulating citric acid 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.460
 so that's why I already know that the juice is not 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.219
 completely natural because it contains 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.160
 citric acid that is normally used to 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.230
 help with conservation, and then those warnings 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.629
 here on the side that the juice does not have 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.520
 addition of sugar or non- conservative 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.559
 make a lot of difference to me because I 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.510
 I already read the list of ingredients 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.640
 other information than the relevant game in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.620
 This is the first packaging. 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.770
 company in Brazil until the process of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.930
 Cold pasteurizing hpt when I read 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.809
 This understands I did not know or even want to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.760
 to pass the coldest vision neither hpt eu 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.890
 I knew that pasteurization with the use 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.990
 heat that is used for example in this 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.000
 Milk here warms up milk is a 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.400
 determined temperature over time 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.380
 enough to kill most of the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.540
 microbes but some are still friends 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.000
 and this is why this milk needs 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.979
 stay in the refrigerator even if you let it 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.270
 here is also in the refrigerator of the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.920
 supermarket 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.390
 if he stays out of the fridge he's ruined 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.700
 because he still has a pet 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.829
 books is different from those of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.380
 box outside the refrigerator that 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.020
 went through an overrun or 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.810
 sterilization that killed everything and there 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.210
 stay months and a half there on the shelf http 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.460
 means flash ray and process or 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.710
 high pressure processing in 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.750
 cold update no more heat is used 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.930
 the water pressure to squeeze the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.509
 microbes that spoil food 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.200
 Imagine if a diver goes deep 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.360
 too much in the sea 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.390
 the pressure down there is too high it 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.040
 can die right 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.770
 now imagine that this diver is a 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.289
 bacterium that is in the fruit juice and that 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.270
 the sea is a machine called an autoclave 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.720
 which is full of water and has a control 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.720
 pressure 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.909
 imagine this bacterium 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.909
 in that juice inside that machine 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.340
 now imagine that this public machine 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:32.280
 too much pressure on this squeezing water 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.319
 this juice every side out for 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.099
 from bottom to top and from top to bottom to 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.190
 low 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:41.489
 Do you know what happens to the dna and the rna of this 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.660
 matter is well the function and it dies by 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.750
 apartment 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.260
 that makes a difference is bacteria die 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.140
 drowned or squeezed after the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.790
 animal welfare and humanitarian slaughter 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.579
 mclaren 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.200
 and this is not any of it 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.239
 the difference between using the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.670
 heat or pressure in the processing of 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.470
 food is that the heat beyond destroying 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.209
 bacteria also spoils some 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.930
 important characteristics that give 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.400
 flavor color texture as well as nutrients 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.560
 pressure leaves it all practically 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.720
 impact so the advertising is 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.450
 bear on the quality of the fruit 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.099
 that the pressure does not destroy comparison 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.989
 with the technical treatment that leaves the 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.299
 I like juices so weird 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.430
 yet the durability of cissokho 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.799
 enclosed inside the refrigerator is five 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.200
 months according to the manufacturer 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.780
 this high-pressure treatment preserves 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.120
 the original flavor of the fruit then taste 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.299
 of this juice of my being identical to that of 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.370
 a freshly made home-made juice 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.739
 not necessarily because things do not 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.630
 can be simpler, is it not that 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.280
 fruits used by the industry may not 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.889
 be of the same species that we buy 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.870
 at the fair as well as tomato used by 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.459
 industry to make canned love is not 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.329
 the same thing that we buy to make a 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.400
 eye hair 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.470
 industry mixes positive facts that 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.209
 I get a perfect blend reminds me 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.470
 I said in the ultra orange video 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.169
 processed 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.419
 Furthermore, the label does not make it clear 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.819
 company uses only high pressure to 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.709
 pasteurizing the juice is during these hours 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.500
 those school interpretation classes 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.650
 they make the difference it's seen here it's written 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.150
 that she is the first company in Brazil to 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.090
 have the hpp 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.030
 but that does not mean that she uses this 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.580
 process in all juices even if it does not 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.560
 does not use or other processing 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.599
 of course I got in touch with the 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.650
 company to take this doubt and it 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.259
 I said yes 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.360
 technical pasteurization also uses a 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.699
 researcher at unicamp the engineer of 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.250
 food a Christian beast guaranteed me 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.110
 that the challenge paw with high pressure is a 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.180
 very interesting method to increase 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.740
 the durability of food without 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.550
 it is necessary to place additives 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.199
 chemical 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.240
 he said that he used methods to 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.370
 to conserve coconut water and that it 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.110
 just like the natural coconut water does not 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.669
 that crap of coconut water . 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.810
 box that I already showed one 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.340
 video here 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.020
 he also told me that although the 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.360
 equipment is still expensive 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.849
 several companies in brazil already use this 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.620
 method alone do not do this by 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.169
 I can not give you more examples 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.909
 You are what you know about what to eat. 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.280
 if you want to know more about 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.229
 cold pasteurisation and other methods of 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.060
 processing of foods that can 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.050
 help the industry to use less additives 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.909
 chemical 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.440
 show yourself because I can achieve 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.449
 bring more information to you 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.860
 including perhaps a visit to the 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.270
 unicamp laboratory 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.919
 and remember to enjoy the video 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.779
 share with friends sign up 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.060
 the channel participates in the financing 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.129
 that helps me to make this happen. 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.219
 Anyway, I already need a camera. 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:40.789
 microphone and thank you for coming and 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:40.789
 to the next
