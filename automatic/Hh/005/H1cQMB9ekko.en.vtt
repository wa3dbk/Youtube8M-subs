white and the way this game works is on

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.839 
white and the way this game works is on
your<00:01:46.409> turn<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.709> play<00:01:46.890> two<00:01:46.950> cards<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.489> I<00:01:47.610> said

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:47.849 
your turn you play two cards like I said

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:49.100 
your turn you play two cards like I said
and<00:01:48.030> you're<00:01:48.149> gonna<00:01:48.270> put<00:01:48.539> those<00:01:48.689> cards

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and you're gonna put those cards

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
and you're gonna put those cards
together<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:50.369> when<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.000> ignore

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
together and when you do so you ignore

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.910 
together and when you do so you ignore
everything<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> outside<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.679> you<00:01:52.770> only

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
everything on the outside and you only

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.380 
everything on the outside and you only
look<00:01:53.099> at<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.250> inside<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:53.789> doing<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.090> blue

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
look at the inside so I'm doing a blue

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.949 
look at the inside so I'm doing a blue
action<00:01:54.959> on<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.399> red<00:01:56.399> card<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.000> that's<00:01:57.659> how<00:01:57.810> this

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
action on a red card and that's how this

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.249 
action on a red card and that's how this
works<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.729> these<00:02:00.270> Forks<00:02:00.719> may<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:01.170> mean

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
works so and these Forks may just mean

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
works so and these Forks may just mean
that<00:02:01.319> no<00:02:01.619> action<00:02:02.009> no<00:02:02.039> action<00:02:02.429> so<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.610> would<00:02:02.819> only

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
that no action no action so I would only

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.209 
that no action no action so I would only
look<00:02:03.149> at<00:02:03.299> two<00:02:03.479> things<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.649> play<00:02:04.860> these<00:02:05.039> two

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
look at two things if I play these two

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.130 
look at two things if I play these two
the<00:02:05.310> other<00:02:05.489> two<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> blue<00:02:06.209> action<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.750> red

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the other two a blue action on red

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.069 
the other two a blue action on red
that's<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.709> very<00:02:07.739> simple<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.780> what<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
that's it very simple so what do the

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.530 
that's it very simple so what do the
different<00:02:10.500> actions<00:02:11.009> mean<00:02:11.280> well<00:02:11.819> let's<00:02:12.359> look

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
different actions mean well let's look

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.099

with another white card let's see if I

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.440 
with another white card let's see if I
can<00:03:58.109> find<00:03:58.260> two<00:03:58.530> here<00:03:58.799> so<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.579> play<00:03:59.909> a<00:03:59.940> white<00:04:00.239> car

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
can find two here so I play a white car

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.819 
can find two here so I play a white car
with<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.659> car<00:04:00.810> that<00:04:00.870> lets<00:04:01.170> me<00:04:01.290> move<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.650> white

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
with a car that lets me move the white

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.440 
with a car that lets me move the white
one<00:04:02.010> off<00:04:02.159> mine<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.430> don't<00:04:02.730> have<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.209> worry<00:04:03.359> about

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
one off mine I don't have to worry about

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.099 
one off mine I don't have to worry about
that<00:04:03.750> but<00:04:04.709> then<00:04:04.889> I<00:04:04.920> can<00:04:05.280> serve<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.329> white<00:04:06.659> this

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
that but then I can serve a white this

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.929 
that but then I can serve a white this
allows<00:04:07.530> me<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.739> serve<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.040> white<00:04:08.250> dish<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:08.639> send

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
allows me to serve a white dish I send

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.910

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
them back to his normal state and I

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.220

serve a white dish off my stack only

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.660 
serve a white dish off my stack only
it's<00:04:13.409> better<00:04:13.439> than<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.829> green<00:04:14.069> card<00:04:14.340> but<00:04:14.579> it

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
it's better than a green card but it

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.749 
it's better than a green card but it
requires<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.090> little<00:04:15.239> bit<00:04:15.389> more<00:04:15.510> setup<00:04:16.759> finally

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
requires a little bit more setup finally

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.610 
requires a little bit more setup finally
there<00:04:17.970> are<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.120> blue<00:04:18.299> cards<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:19.109> blue<00:04:19.320> card

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
lets you find any thing in your stack so

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.879 
lets you find any thing in your stack so
I<00:04:24.030> take<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.330> look<00:04:24.479> at<00:04:24.599> my<00:04:24.750> stack<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.349> I<00:04:25.410> say<00:04:25.560> okay

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
I take a look at my stack and I say okay

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.800 
I take a look at my stack and I say okay
there's<00:04:26.099> a<00:04:26.160> white<00:04:26.430> one<00:04:26.580> in<00:04:26.669> my<00:04:26.760> stack<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.270> can

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
there's a white one in my stack I can

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.040 
there's a white one in my stack I can
take<00:04:27.960> all<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:29.190> chips<00:04:29.849> above<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.479> white<00:04:30.750> chip

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
take all the chips above that white chip

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.310 
take all the chips above that white chip
take<00:04:31.380> them<00:04:31.590> off<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.099> make<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.610> new<00:04:32.910> stack<00:04:33.320> now

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
take them off and make a new stack now

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.439 
take them off and make a new stack now
see<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.770> guess<00:04:35.550> in<00:04:35.699> the<00:04:35.789> beginning<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.120> should

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
see I guess in the beginning it should

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.510 
see I guess in the beginning it should
have<00:04:36.659> said<00:04:36.810> that<00:04:37.110> my<00:04:37.560> stacks<00:04:37.889> on<00:04:38.130> top<00:04:38.280> of<00:04:38.400> all

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
have said that my stacks on top of all

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.430 
have said that my stacks on top of all
these<00:04:38.610> cards<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.120> now<00:04:39.570> take<00:04:39.780> another<00:04:39.900> card<00:04:40.380> from

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
these cards I now take another card from

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.950 
these cards I now take another card from
my<00:04:40.560> hand<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.520> have<00:04:41.729> two<00:04:42.000> stacks<00:04:42.360> it's

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
my hand and I have two stacks it's

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.390 
my hand and I have two stacks it's
easier<00:04:43.320> to<00:04:43.409> get<00:04:43.560> rid<00:04:43.740> of<00:04:43.800> these<00:04:43.949> when<00:04:44.220> there's

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
easier to get rid of these when there's

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.950 
easier to get rid of these when there's
two<00:04:44.610> stacks<00:04:44.880> because<00:04:45.150> if<00:04:45.419> they<00:04:45.539> both<00:04:45.720> have<00:04:45.870> the

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
two stacks because if they both have the

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.420 
two stacks because if they both have the
same<00:04:45.990> color<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.620> say<00:04:46.770> get<00:04:46.919> rid<00:04:47.039> of<00:04:47.099> all<00:04:47.310> the

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
same color and I say get rid of all the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.740 
same color and I say get rid of all the
blue<00:04:47.610> plates<00:04:47.909> they're<00:04:48.150> all<00:04:48.270> gone

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
blue plates they're all gone

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.629 
blue plates they're all gone
getting<00:04:49.440> rid<00:04:49.590> of<00:04:49.620> plates<00:04:49.949> any<00:04:50.250> card<00:04:50.550> my

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
getting rid of plates any card my

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.189 
getting rid of plates any card my
opponent<00:04:50.669> plays<00:04:51.330> will<00:04:51.570> get<00:04:51.690> them<00:04:51.840> all<00:04:51.990> gone

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
opponent plays will get them all gone

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.409 
opponent plays will get them all gone
and<00:04:52.380> so<00:04:52.530> on<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:53.340> disadvantage<00:04:53.909> is<00:04:54.030> it<00:04:54.240> takes

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
and so on the disadvantage is it takes

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.360 
and so on the disadvantage is it takes
another<00:04:54.630> card<00:04:54.960> out<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.169> my<00:04:55.260> hand<00:04:55.620> however<00:04:56.159> you

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
another card out of my hand however you

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.100 
another card out of my hand however you
can<00:04:56.490> keep<00:04:56.639> splitting<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.240> splitting<00:04:57.360> as<00:04:57.750> if

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
can keep splitting and splitting as if

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.450 
can keep splitting and splitting as if
you<00:04:58.260> want<00:04:58.470> but<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.800> just<00:04:58.949> makes<00:04:59.130> your<00:04:59.220> hand

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
you want but it just makes your hand

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.689 
you want but it just makes your hand
smaller<00:04:59.849> and<00:05:00.180> smaller<00:05:00.870> each<00:05:01.139> time<00:05:01.490> so<00:05:02.490> we<00:05:02.580> keep

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
smaller and smaller each time so we keep

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.820 
smaller and smaller each time so we keep
going<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:03.180> one<00:05:03.449> person<00:05:03.960> or<00:05:04.080> one<00:05:04.110> team<00:05:04.470> gets<00:05:04.650> rid

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
going to one person or one team gets rid

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.290 
going to one person or one team gets rid
of<00:05:04.860> all<00:05:04.979> their<00:05:05.190> plates<00:05:05.460> and<00:05:05.639> then<00:05:05.940> that<00:05:06.090> person

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
of all their plates and then that person

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.540 
of all their plates and then that person
is<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.780> winner<00:05:06.960> there's<00:05:07.949> just<00:05:08.159> a<00:05:08.250> lot<00:05:08.490> of

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
is the winner there's just a lot of

is the winner there's just a lot of
really<00:05:08.970> little<00:05:09.449> neat<00:05:09.690> things<00:05:10.080> in<00:05:10.320> this<00:05:10.470> game

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800

brand<00:05:16.680> new<00:05:16.800> but<00:05:16.889> it's<00:05:17.159> a<00:05:17.190> good<00:05:17.370> idea<00:05:17.729> and<00:05:17.970> it

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
brand new but it's a good idea and it

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.610 
brand new but it's a good idea and it
works<00:05:18.360> well<00:05:18.690> here<00:05:18.930> it's<00:05:19.050> really<00:05:19.289> quick<00:05:19.500> and

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
works well here it's really quick and

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.379 
works well here it's really quick and
easy<00:05:19.740> like<00:05:20.580> I<00:05:20.669> said<00:05:20.849> it<00:05:20.909> look<00:05:21.030> like<00:05:21.180> there's<00:05:21.330> a

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
easy like I said it look like there's a

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.820 
easy like I said it look like there's a
lot<00:05:21.419> of<00:05:21.599> information<00:05:21.870> on<00:05:22.289> the<00:05:22.380> cards<00:05:22.710> but

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
lot of information on the cards but

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.540 
lot of information on the cards but
there<00:05:23.010> really<00:05:23.159> isn't<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:25.010> it<00:05:26.010> just<00:05:26.400> plays

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
there really isn't and it just plays

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.279 
there really isn't and it just plays
very<00:05:26.880> interestingly<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:27.810> know<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:27.930> could<00:05:28.169> get

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
very interestingly you know I could get

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.050 
very interestingly you know I could get
rid<00:05:28.440> of<00:05:28.500> this<00:05:28.650> red<00:05:28.860> one<00:05:29.070> but<00:05:29.340> two<00:05:29.820> of<00:05:29.849> the

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
rid of this red one but two of the

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.640 
rid of this red one but two of the
opponents<00:05:30.510> also<00:05:30.659> on<00:05:30.900> a<00:05:30.930> red<00:05:31.139> one<00:05:31.320> on<00:05:31.409> top

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
opponents also on a red one on top

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.080 
opponents also on a red one on top
respect<00:05:32.100> so<00:05:32.220> that's<00:05:32.370> gonna<00:05:32.490> help<00:05:32.639> them<00:05:32.850> more

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
respect so that's gonna help them more

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.879 
respect so that's gonna help them more
than<00:05:33.270> me<00:05:33.449> so<00:05:34.050> I'm<00:05:34.139> not<00:05:34.169> going<00:05:34.440> to<00:05:34.500> clear<00:05:34.710> the

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
than me so I'm not going to clear the

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.659 
than me so I'm not going to clear the
red<00:05:35.070> plates<00:05:35.600> moving<00:05:36.600> those<00:05:37.040> lids<00:05:38.040> around<00:05:38.460> has

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
red plates moving those lids around has

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.600 
red plates moving those lids around has
a<00:05:38.699> little<00:05:38.940> bit<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.180> take<00:05:39.419> that<00:05:39.720> feature<00:05:40.110> but

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
a little bit of a take that feature but

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.129 
a little bit of a take that feature but
since<00:05:41.610> they<00:05:41.789> have<00:05:42.030> to<00:05:42.180> go<00:05:42.300> back<00:05:42.539> to<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.870> middle

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
since they have to go back to the middle

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.810 
since they have to go back to the middle
before<00:05:43.289> they<00:05:43.530> go<00:05:43.650> to<00:05:43.680> someone<00:05:44.009> else<00:05:44.190> it's<00:05:44.580> not

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
before they go to someone else it's not

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.460 
before they go to someone else it's not
too<00:05:45.090> bad<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:45.570> the<00:05:45.630> game<00:05:45.840> won't<00:05:46.080> get<00:05:46.229> thrown

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
too bad and the game won't get thrown

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.710 
too bad and the game won't get thrown
out<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:46.919> finally<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.610> splitting<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.419> stacks

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
out and finally the splitting the stacks

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.570 
out and finally the splitting the stacks
that's<00:05:48.960> such<00:05:49.080> an<00:05:49.199> interesting<00:05:49.410> concept<00:05:50.310> to<00:05:50.370> me

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580
