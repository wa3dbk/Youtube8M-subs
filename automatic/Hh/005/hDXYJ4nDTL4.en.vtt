00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 they are all boys and welcome this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.380
 new android universe video 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.180
 Today we will explain how 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.500
 difficult to control remotely from your 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.700
 android smartphone 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.700
 let's get to it right away 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.230
 to do this we will use the application 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.700
 teamviewer that we should install on 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.100
 our smartphone also on our pc 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.989
 from the smartphone just go to the play 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.850
 history try to send and install 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.540
 free application while on 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.309
 pc we should go to this site 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.260
 after which we will have to click on via 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.280
 free version and start downloading 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.019
 pro time then download the file 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.030
 We install the program 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.739
 and once there is a program 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.120
 installed however we will obviously like 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.120
 an active internet connection 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.510
 just validate us here below the bullet 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.460
 green with active connection 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.380
 ours will appear ours is ours 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.260
 password and at this point we should 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.850
 bring us to our smartphone 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
 then we open the application on our 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.090
 smartphone and we'll meet in front 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.010
 this screen here 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.299
 we insert then divides them viewer which 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.619
 we find on our pc 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.040
 we therefore await the bio 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.040
 connection 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.960
 I obviously remember that the connection 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.200
 of the stars and active both on ours 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.789
 smartphone that on our pc 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.310
 to this civil point to insert the 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.590
 password that we find on the teamviewer of 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.600
 our pc 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.460
 and here we are therefore connected to 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.320
 our pc moving your finger on the screen 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.770
 we will move the mouse arrow 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.140
 as you can see on the pc also here 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.850
 we will have many other options let's go to the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.890
 settings where we can choose the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.630
 quality resolution and also 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.149
 will eliminate the background to decrease the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.740
 data traffic on pc then the background 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.780
 to make it all black but when 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.969
 you will exit send was the background will return to 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.979
 what you had before we can now 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.569
 then use our earthquake PCs 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.249
 even outside your home obviously taking 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.539
 Active teamviewer is a connection 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.729
 active on our pc 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.490
 we could also go for example to 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.840
 open documents view images 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.910
 music and anything else like it 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.209
 we can see we can perfectly a 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.980
 also surfing the web the pc will answer 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.730
 great to commands like this see 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.130
 this is the page we have 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.560
 displayed first 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.630
 let's go out 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.430
 and when we finish ours 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.610
 session just click on this rate 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.819
 here the aics close the connection 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.250
 close and here we are 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.020
 disconnect from our pc reconnect 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.700

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.950
 remote enter the password again 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.050
 time however we will close teamviewer 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.569
 we will reopen on our pc 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.290
 the password will then change us there 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.610
 we recommend making an account 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.250
 then create the folder mine 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.549
 computer and we could connect like that in 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.700
 an automatic account will simply go to the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.459
 teamviewer site to go to weblogin e 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.950
 click on record once and then 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.590
 registered 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.660

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.130

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.349

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.120
 use a default password for 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.260
 connect to our pc 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.570

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.880
