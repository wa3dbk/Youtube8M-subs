00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
I probably should have been using the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.710 
I probably should have been using the
assault<00:02:35.140> rifle<00:02:35.560> instead<00:02:35.860> of<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.670> SMG<00:02:37.540> there

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.940 
assault rifle instead of the SMG there
to<00:02:37.810> take<00:02:37.960> out<00:02:38.080> those<00:02:38.200> two<00:02:38.260> guys<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.770> then<00:02:38.890> I

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
to take out those two guys and then I

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.290 
to take out those two guys and then I
probably<00:02:39.190> would<00:02:39.430> have<00:02:39.490> been<00:02:39.640> able<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.240> be

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
probably would have been able to to be

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.270 
probably would have been able to to be
honest<00:02:40.510> but<00:02:41.260> unfortunately<00:02:41.800> I<00:02:41.830> wasn't<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
honest but unfortunately I wasn't the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.730 
honest but unfortunately I wasn't the
case<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.780> didn't<00:02:43.990> work<00:02:44.110> out<00:02:44.320> quite<00:02:44.590> as

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
case so it didn't work out quite as

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.150 
case so it didn't work out quite as
planned<00:02:45.130> but<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:45.970> can't<00:02:46.270> complain<00:02:46.540> now

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160
