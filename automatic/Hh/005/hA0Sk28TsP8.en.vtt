00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
up to the Xbox music app so if I ask her

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.620 
up to the Xbox music app so if I ask her
to<00:04:11.010> play<00:04:11.190> music<00:04:11.640> she<00:04:11.820> won't<00:04:11.970> actually<00:04:12.150> do<00:04:12.480> it

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
to play music she won't actually do it

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.210 
to play music she won't actually do it
but<00:04:13.170> let's<00:04:13.290> demonstrate<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.800> anyway

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
but let's demonstrate it anyway

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.470 
but let's demonstrate it anyway
play<00:04:14.790> music<00:04:16.520> resuming<00:04:17.520> and<00:04:17.760> if<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.030> had<00:04:18.120> music

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
play music resuming and if I had music

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.380 
play music resuming and if I had music
it<00:04:18.810> would<00:04:18.960> start<00:04:19.200> playing<00:04:19.880> she<00:04:20.880> also<00:04:21.000> does<00:04:21.210> map

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
it would start playing she also does map

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.550 
it would start playing she also does map
some<00:04:21.630> directions<00:04:22.080> which<00:04:22.230> I<00:04:22.290> haven't<00:04:22.410> actually

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
some directions which I haven't actually

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.520 
some directions which I haven't actually
tested<00:04:22.860> yet<00:04:23.190> so<00:04:23.280> let's<00:04:23.460> do<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.610> now<00:04:23.940> um<00:04:24.530> let's

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
tested yet so let's do that now um let's

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.700 
tested yet so let's do that now um let's
see<00:04:25.860> what<00:04:26.160> we<00:04:26.370> do<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:27.260> how<00:04:28.260> long<00:04:28.470> will<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.620> take

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
see what we do so how long will it take

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.150 
see what we do so how long will it take
to<00:04:28.980> get<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.250> Big<00:04:29.430> Ben

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
didn't worse try something else can't

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.200 
didn't worse try something else can't
give<00:04:35.640> me<00:04:35.760> directions<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.300> Big<00:04:36.540> Ben<00:04:38.210> getting

new directions - this is not working
well<00:04:42.030> as<00:04:42.120> you<00:04:42.210> can<00:04:42.330> see<00:04:42.480> if<00:04:42.720> it<00:04:42.870> was<00:04:43.020> working

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
well as you can see if it was working

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.410 
well as you can see if it was working
you'd<00:04:43.740> get<00:04:43.920> directions<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.490> Big<00:04:44.760> Ben<00:04:45.060> however

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
you'd get directions to Big Ben however

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.860 
you'd get directions to Big Ben however
as<00:04:45.600> Cortana<00:04:46.110> just<00:04:46.350> said<00:04:46.500> this<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:47.160> not<00:04:47.310> working

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
as Cortana just said this is not working

again<00:04:48.870> early<00:04:49.320> build<00:04:49.530> things<00:04:50.070> will<00:04:50.250> not<00:04:50.370> work

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
again early build things will not work

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.430 
again early build things will not work
but<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.180> get<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.420> idea<00:04:51.450> directions<00:04:52.260> will<00:04:52.410> be

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
but you get the idea directions will be

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.120 
but you get the idea directions will be
available<00:04:52.950> in<00:04:53.100> Windows<00:04:53.490> 10<00:04:53.700> on<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.030> desktop

available in Windows 10 on the desktop
you<00:04:56.130> can<00:04:56.160> also<00:04:56.370> ask<00:04:56.550> her<00:04:56.790> where<00:04:57.360> restaurants

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870

you can also ask her where restaurants
and<00:04:58.020> things<00:04:58.140> are<00:04:58.380> so<00:04:58.530> if<00:04:58.590> I<00:04:58.650> ask<00:04:58.800> her<00:04:58.920> where<00:04:59.040> the

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
and things are so if I ask her where the

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.340

nearest Starbucks is is there a

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.740 
nearest Starbucks is is there a
Starbucks<00:05:01.890> near<00:05:02.040> me<00:05:03.170> and<00:05:05.390> there's<00:05:06.390> a<00:05:06.450> list<00:05:06.630> of

Starbucks but if I click on them I would

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.400 
Starbucks but if I click on them I would

Windows<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.730> can<00:05:14.730> ask<00:05:14.850> for<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.060> weather<00:05:15.240> which

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
Windows I can ask for the weather which

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.630 
Windows I can ask for the weather which
is<00:05:15.660> very<00:05:15.870> simple<00:05:16.320> what's<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.370> weather<00:05:17.490> like

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
is very simple what's the weather like

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.340 
is very simple what's the weather like
in<00:05:17.790> New<00:05:18.090> York<00:05:18.300> City<00:05:19.490> and<00:05:21.050> that's<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:22.230> weather

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
in New York City and that's the weather

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.080

in<00:05:22.500> New<00:05:22.560> York<00:05:22.740> City<00:05:22.980> so<00:05:23.670> that's<00:05:23.820> pretty<00:05:24.000> much

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
in New York City so that's pretty much

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.330 
in New York City so that's pretty much

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
precise moment I believe she'll be able

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.500 
precise moment I believe she'll be able
to<00:05:28.710> do<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.800> lot<00:05:29.070> more<00:05:29.250> when<00:05:29.490> she<00:05:30.060> rolls<00:05:30.240> on<00:05:30.390> to

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
to do a lot more when she rolls on to

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.300 
to do a lot more when she rolls on to
the<00:05:30.600> public<00:05:31.110> however<00:05:31.410> right<00:05:31.770> now<00:05:31.800> as<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.070> said

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
the public however right now as I said

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.070 
the public however right now as I said
in<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:32.580> beginning<00:05:32.670> of<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:32.970> video<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.780> other

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
in the beginning of the video the other

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.810 
in the beginning of the video the other
side<00:05:34.440> of<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.740> database<00:05:35.130> which<00:05:35.370> would<00:05:35.580> involve

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
side of the database which would involve

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.190 
side of the database which would involve
all<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.120> chitchat<00:05:36.360> stuff<00:05:36.750> isn't<00:05:36.990> available

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
all the chitchat stuff isn't available

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.650 
all the chitchat stuff isn't available
so<00:05:37.590> I<00:05:37.650> can't<00:05:37.890> ask<00:05:38.100> her<00:05:38.280> to<00:05:38.310> convert<00:05:38.730> pounds<00:05:39.510> to

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
so I can't ask her to convert pounds to

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.070 
so I can't ask her to convert pounds to
dollars<00:05:39.990> or<00:05:40.640> what<00:05:41.640> her<00:05:41.820> name<00:05:42.240> is<00:05:42.270> or<00:05:42.630> and<00:05:42.870> so<00:05:42.990> on

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
dollars or what her name is or and so on

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.590 
dollars or what her name is or and so on
and<00:05:43.230> so<00:05:43.290> forth<00:05:43.620> but<00:05:44.400> everything<00:05:45.090> else<00:05:45.240> appears

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600
