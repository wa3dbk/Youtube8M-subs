 military a dynamic and attractive city open to the sea source of its wealth 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.550
 its great industrial economic capacity is reflected in the development of 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.550
 important sectors such as automotive or fishing 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.800
 the most populous city of galicia also has a relevant role in the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.339
 trade thanks to its strategic location as a gateway 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.460
 from the Atlantic 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.980
 the vigo airport is part of the economic and business potential of the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.830
 city 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.830
 it is a vital infrastructure to boost its growth 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.430
 Therefore, the Ministry of Development through Aena Aeropuertos is 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.720
 carrying out the renovation of its facilities 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.720
 with an investment of 100 million euros 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.690
 new infrastructures that add to existing ones to offer more quality 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.900
 in the service that the airport provides to its users 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.740
 and to expand its capacity to 4 million passengers per year 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.170
 the new car park is located in front of the terminal building 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.250
 and triples the offer of places for vehicles with spaces reserved for 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.600
 people with reduced mobility 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.620
 and a modern automatic license plate reading system 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.450
 It has five levels 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.780
 one at the height of the terminal and 4 paco this surface 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.810
 its design harmonizes with the volumetric lines of the whole 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.790
 airport 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.330
 with large skylights that carry natural light vertically 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.950
 to all floors below ground 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.909
 its terraced slabs allow optimal ventilation elimination 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.800
 and contribute to their integration into the landscape 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 At all times we have sought to minimize the environmental impact 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.320
 and achieve savings and energy efficiency 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.600
 To the north of the car park, the block destined for 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.980
 offices of aena 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.300
 that integrates with it forming a single building 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.760
 and the urbanization has also been renewed 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.670
 with new vials and new traffic organization that makes it easier to 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.670
 access to different buildings 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.790
 this renewal of the airport includes the extension remodeling of its 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.039
 terminal building 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.059
 which will mean a significant increase in airport capacity 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:26.189
 the current terminal will be remodeled and modernized and will also be expanded 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.189
 its two laterals to triple its surface 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.930
 The new building will consist of two volumes of different heights with 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.930
 Triangular section covers punished by a skylight 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:41.399
 large windows allow the passage of sunlight illuminating its interior and 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.399
 allowing you to enjoy your environment 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.089
 if the passenger directly accesses the parking lot through a nucleus of 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:52.819
 communication located in the basement without the need to cross 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.019
 access roads 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.340

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.389
 more and better services in all areas 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.819
 in the check-in room p 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.819
 other security filters 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:11.439
