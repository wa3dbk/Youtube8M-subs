is<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.590> salinas<00:01:26.070> impression<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.970> with

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
is it salinas impression of that with

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.399 
is it salinas impression of that with
four<00:01:27.540> legs<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> body

okay now Selena can you imagine the dots

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.280 
okay now Selena can you imagine the dots
once<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.040> dog<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.460> doing<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.960> color

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
once the dog is doing and you color

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.960 
once the dog is doing and you color
color<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.830> background<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.430> different

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
color the background with different

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.920 
color the background with different
different<00:01:39.750> color<00:01:40.289> you<00:01:40.590> want

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
different color you want

00:01:41.930 --> 00:02:02.810 
different color you want
alright<00:01:43.189> let<00:01:44.189> me<00:01:44.220> go<00:01:44.429> and<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.909> crayon

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.349 

well<00:02:03.820> this<00:02:04.090> is<00:02:04.270> another<00:02:04.509> simple<00:02:05.049> method<00:02:05.200> of

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
well this is another simple method of

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.490 
well this is another simple method of
the<00:02:07.359> right<00:02:07.570> brain<00:02:07.780> training<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.289> actually

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
the right brain training is actually

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.650 
the right brain training is actually
travel<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.789> object<00:02:10.349> okay<00:02:11.349> and<00:02:11.709> explain<00:02:12.370> again

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
travel the object okay and explain again

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.460 
travel the object okay and explain again
travel<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.750> object<00:02:15.120> using<00:02:16.120> other<00:02:16.660> trials<00:02:17.319> to

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
travel the object using other trials to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.880 
travel the object using other trials to
use<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.709> finger<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.550> regional<00:02:19.390> sticks<00:02:19.660> here<00:02:19.930> to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
use a finger and regional sticks here to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.770 
use a finger and regional sticks here to
show<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.780> how<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:23.709> do<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.040> by<00:02:24.489> actually<00:02:24.640> if<00:02:25.180> you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
show you how to do it by actually if you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.860 
show you how to do it by actually if you
use<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.290> fingers<00:02:26.970> actually<00:02:27.970> something<00:02:28.690> like

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
use the fingers actually something like

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.070 
use the fingers actually something like
this<00:02:29.340> change<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.580> outline<00:02:31.000> trace<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
this change the outline trace the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.030 
this change the outline trace the
outline<00:02:32.410> first<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.540> your<00:02:35.079> brain<00:02:35.440> has<00:02:35.470> an

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
outline first so that your brain has an

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.569 
outline first so that your brain has an
image<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:37.329> overall<00:02:37.720> outline<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:39.190> Charles

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
image of the overall outline the Charles

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.569 
image of the overall outline the Charles
they<00:02:39.730> have<00:02:39.940> an<00:02:40.060> image<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.390> over<00:02:41.049> a<00:02:41.260> line<00:02:41.590> then

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
they have an image of over a line then

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.170 
they have an image of over a line then
after<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.209> start<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.930> fill<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.530> empty

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
after that start to fill in the empty

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.640 
after that start to fill in the empty
space<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.620> center<00:02:48.540> okay<00:02:49.540> then<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.410> makes

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
space in the center okay then it makes

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.809 
space in the center okay then it makes
the<00:02:50.920> object<00:02:51.989> crater<00:02:52.989> in<00:02:53.260> your<00:02:53.440> brain<00:02:53.709> okay

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
the object crater in your brain okay

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.830 
the object crater in your brain okay
so<00:02:55.329> then<00:02:55.540> after<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:56.099> they<00:02:57.099> can<00:02:57.310> stop<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:58.629> will

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
so then after that they can stop it will

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.100 
so then after that they can stop it will
do<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.140> coloring<00:02:59.530> fill<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.280> color<00:03:00.549> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
do the coloring fill in the color and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.160 
do the coloring fill in the color and
they<00:03:02.110> can<00:03:02.349> imagine<00:03:03.040> whatever<00:03:03.930> color<00:03:04.930> they

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
they can imagine whatever color they

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.259 
they can imagine whatever color they
want<00:03:05.379> doesn't<00:03:05.980> matter<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.459> neck<00:03:06.670> must<00:03:06.940> match

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
want doesn't matter that neck must match

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.840 
want doesn't matter that neck must match
the<00:03:07.480> object<00:03:07.630> color<00:03:08.079> so<00:03:09.040> it's<00:03:09.250> up<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.670> their

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
the object color so it's up to their

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.240 
the object color so it's up to their
free<00:03:10.150> imagination<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.290> choose<00:03:11.620> any<00:03:11.829> color<00:03:12.069> the

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
free imagination to choose any color the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.800 
free imagination to choose any color the
one

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
one

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.070 
one
and<00:03:12.980> again<00:03:13.980> they'll<00:03:14.190> complete<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.730> color

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
and again they'll complete the color

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.820 
and again they'll complete the color
okay<00:03:17.080> well<00:03:17.620> guess<00:03:18.310> another<00:03:19.170> lesson<00:03:20.170> for<00:03:20.739> the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
okay well guess another lesson for the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.720 
okay well guess another lesson for the
backroom<00:03:21.250> joint<00:03:22.209> training
