good morning
like<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.139> show<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.410> how<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> built<00:00:10.680> this

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
like to show you how I built this

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.939 
like to show you how I built this
our<00:00:13.860> 154<00:00:14.879> internal<00:00:15.879> straw<00:00:16.180> bearing<00:00:16.779> setup<00:00:17.289> for

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
our 154 internal straw bearing setup for

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.130 
our 154 internal straw bearing setup for
the<00:00:18.220> narrow<00:00:18.820> block<00:00:19.560> 4g63<00:00:20.579> Mitsubishi<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.960> is

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
the narrow block 4g63 Mitsubishi this is

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.470 
the narrow block 4g63 Mitsubishi this is
the<00:00:23.259> bail<00:00:23.500> hauling<00:00:27.210> it's<00:00:28.210> pretty

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
the bail hauling it's pretty

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.810 
the bail hauling it's pretty
labor-intensive<00:00:28.960> to<00:00:29.680> build<00:00:29.980> these<00:00:30.189> to<00:00:30.669> get

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
labor-intensive to build these to get

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.530 
labor-intensive to build these to get
them<00:00:30.969> just<00:00:31.270> right<00:00:32.190> it<00:00:33.190> took<00:00:33.579> a<00:00:33.610> long<00:00:33.969> time<00:00:34.000> to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
them just right it took a long time to

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.299 
them just right it took a long time to
bring<00:00:34.719> this<00:00:34.930> one<00:00:35.140> to<00:00:35.200> market<00:00:38.129> there<00:00:39.129> were<00:00:39.280> a

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
bring this one to market there were a

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.360 
bring this one to market there were a
couple<00:00:39.579> of<00:00:39.850> things<00:00:40.210> that<00:00:40.540> had<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:41.050> happen<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
couple of things that had to happen the

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.930 
couple of things that had to happen the
original<00:00:43.050> transmission<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.730> 154<00:00:47.940> didn't

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
original transmission for the 154 didn't

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.920 
original transmission for the 154 didn't
have<00:00:49.240> a<00:00:49.630> long<00:00:50.050> enough<00:00:51.329> thrall<00:00:52.329> bearing<00:00:52.930> collar

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
have a long enough thrall bearing collar

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.550 
have a long enough thrall bearing collar
to<00:00:56.280> go<00:00:57.280> all<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.489> way<00:00:57.520> up<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.000> Mitsubishi

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
to go all the way up to the Mitsubishi

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.120 
to go all the way up to the Mitsubishi
flywheel<00:00:59.560> or<00:01:00.010> pressure<00:01:00.520> plate<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.620> I<00:01:02.649> had<00:01:03.010> to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
flywheel or pressure plate so I had to

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.490 
flywheel or pressure plate so I had to
build<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:03.550> into<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.059> belt<00:01:06.899> so<00:01:07.899> originally

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
build it into the belt so originally

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.639 
build it into the belt so originally
this<00:01:09.130> had<00:01:09.369> a<00:01:09.399> collar<00:01:09.759> that<00:01:10.090> came<00:01:10.329> out<00:01:10.570> about

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
this had a collar that came out about

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.020 
this had a collar that came out about
three<00:01:11.649> inches<00:01:11.979> that<00:01:12.189> the<00:01:12.340> throg<00:01:12.610> bearing

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
three inches that the throg bearing

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.870 
three inches that the throg bearing
would<00:01:13.210> have<00:01:13.299> rode<00:01:13.509> on<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:14.170> I<00:01:15.159> had<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.430> cut<00:01:15.640> that

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
would have rode on and I had to cut that

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.090 
would have rode on and I had to cut that
off<00:01:15.940> because<00:01:16.479> I<00:01:16.750> replaced<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.530> right<00:01:17.799> in<00:01:17.979> the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
off because I replaced it right in the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.100 
off because I replaced it right in the
bellows<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.710> will<00:01:20.860> see<00:01:21.130> that<00:01:21.340> this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
bellows you will see that this

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.460 
bellows you will see that this
transmission<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.970> perfectly<00:01:25.630> flush<00:01:26.110> up

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
transmission it's perfectly flush up

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.789 
transmission it's perfectly flush up
into<00:01:27.070> that<00:01:27.250> dog<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:28.000> he<00:01:28.060> works<00:01:28.240> out<00:01:28.479> real<00:01:28.750> well

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
into that dog and he works out real well

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.070 
into that dog and he works out real well
the<00:01:29.799> other<00:01:29.950> thing<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.400> did<00:01:30.760> is<00:01:31.360> on<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.750> input

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
the other thing I did is on the input

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.149 
the other thing I did is on the input
yep<00:01:32.440> I<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.890> cut<00:01:36.369> it<00:01:36.490> down<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.560> width<00:01:38.799> of<00:01:39.040> a

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
yep I I cut it down to the width of a

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.480 
yep I I cut it down to the width of a
pilot<00:01:39.640> bearing<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.470> exactly<00:01:42.070> I<00:01:42.100> think<00:01:42.310> that's

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
pilot bearing so exactly I think that's

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
pilot bearing so exactly I think that's
a<00:01:42.729> thousand<00:01:43.630> different<00:01:44.170> thicknesses<00:01:45.010> and

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
a thousand different thicknesses and

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.590 
a thousand different thicknesses and
instead<00:01:47.439> of<00:01:47.680> they<00:01:48.490> had<00:01:48.670> an<00:01:48.820> arrangement<00:01:49.330> in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
instead of they had an arrangement in

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.450 
instead of they had an arrangement in
here<00:01:49.869> where<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.140> were<00:01:50.409> supposed<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.950> just<00:01:51.220> put

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
here where you were supposed to just put

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.440 
here where you were supposed to just put
a<00:01:51.490> nut<00:01:51.820> on<00:01:52.030> these<00:01:52.299> studs<00:01:52.689> and<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.450> bearing

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
a nut on these studs and the bearing

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.230 
a nut on these studs and the bearing
would<00:01:55.630> push<00:01:55.900> just<00:01:56.200> against<00:01:56.710> those<00:01:56.860> studs<00:01:57.369> I

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
would push just against those studs I

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.270 
would push just against those studs I
liked<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:58.990> better<00:01:59.200> pushing<00:01:59.860> against<00:02:00.220> the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
liked it better pushing against the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.109 
liked it better pushing against the
whole<00:02:00.549> pad<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.200> made<00:02:02.560> these<00:02:03.119> plates

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
whole pad so I made these plates

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.490 
whole pad so I made these plates
different<00:02:04.630> thicknesses<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.600> I<00:02:08.110> put<00:02:08.379> them

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
different thicknesses and I put them

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.020 
different thicknesses and I put them
down<00:02:08.530> in<00:02:08.890> here<00:02:09.039> so<00:02:09.099> that<00:02:09.519> you<00:02:09.670> could<00:02:09.819> select

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
down in here so that you could select

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.399 
down in here so that you could select
your<00:02:10.450> adjustments<00:02:11.140> with<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.349> new<00:02:11.650> disc<00:02:11.980> on<00:02:12.280> the

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
your adjustments with a new disc on the

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.770 
your adjustments with a new disc on the
mitsubishi<00:02:15.569> stock<00:02:16.569> clutch

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
mitsubishi stock clutch

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.840 
mitsubishi stock clutch
and<00:02:19.710> then<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.010> use<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.520> homeand<00:02:21.560> style<00:02:22.850> throw

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
and then I use this homeand style throw

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.620 
and then I use this homeand style throw
up

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
up

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.040 
up
and<00:02:25.500> all<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.950> did<00:02:26.250> was<00:02:26.460> bring<00:02:27.090> out<00:02:27.270> these<00:02:27.450> ends

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
and all I did was bring out these ends

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.230 
and all I did was bring out these ends
so<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.380> these<00:02:28.530> are<00:02:28.740> 1/8<00:02:29.130> pipe<00:02:29.520> fittings<00:02:30.030> so

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
so that these are 1/8 pipe fittings so

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.760 
so that these are 1/8 pipe fittings so
that<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.510> could<00:02:30.660> fit<00:02:30.870> them<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.080> any<00:02:31.290> fitting

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
that you could fit them to any fitting

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.060 
that you could fit them to any fitting
that<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.070> fight<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.720> built<00:02:33.960> this<00:02:34.140> spacer

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
that you fight and I built this spacer

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.510 
that you fight and I built this spacer
that's<00:02:35.340> bevel<00:02:35.880> on<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.150> two<00:02:36.420> sides<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:38.070> use<00:02:38.280> the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
that's bevel on the two sides to use the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.560 
that's bevel on the two sides to use the
stock<00:02:39.330> toy<00:02:39.750> autopilot<00:02:40.350> during<00:02:40.860> setup<00:02:41.570> you

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
stock toy autopilot during setup you

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.500 
stock toy autopilot during setup you
simply<00:02:43.190> put<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.340> spacer<00:02:44.880> into<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
simply put the spacer into the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.650 
simply put the spacer into the
crankshaft<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.220> then<00:02:47.880> put<00:02:48.120> your<00:02:48.270> bearing

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
crankshaft in and then put your bearing

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.960 
crankshaft in and then put your bearing
in<00:02:48.840> there<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:51.270> made<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.080> plate<00:02:52.760> because<00:02:53.760> I

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
in there and I made this plate because I

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.500 
in there and I made this plate because I
was<00:02:54.120> concerned<00:02:54.900> about<00:02:55.320> starter<00:02:55.890> location<00:02:56.580> and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
was concerned about starter location and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.199 
was concerned about starter location and
I<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:59.330> cover<00:03:00.330> up<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:01.880> flywheel<00:03:02.880> from

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
I like to cover up the flywheel from

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.060 
I like to cover up the flywheel from
rocks<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.810> stones<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.410> all<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.709> sort<00:03:05.010> of

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
rocks and stones and all that sort of

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.930 
rocks and stones and all that sort of
thing<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:07.230> other<00:03:07.380> thing<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.680> did<00:03:07.739> as<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.670> had<00:03:08.820> to

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
thing the other thing I did as I had to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.110 
thing the other thing I did as I had to
pour<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.920> center<00:03:11.310> circle<00:03:11.760> out<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
pour the center circle out of the

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.080 
pour the center circle out of the
flywheel<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:14.160> had<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.459> make<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.820> big<00:03:15.060> enough

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
flywheel and I had to make it big enough

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.660 
flywheel and I had to make it big enough
to<00:03:15.510> accept<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.020> input<00:03:16.140> shaft<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.160> input

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
to accept the input shaft so the input

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.330 
to accept the input shaft so the input
shaft<00:03:17.970> fits<00:03:18.239> could<00:03:18.930> spin<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.410> there<00:03:19.590> freely

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
shaft fits could spin in there freely

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.410 
shaft fits could spin in there freely
I<00:03:21.320> made<00:03:22.320> that<00:03:22.500> around<00:03:22.769> 28<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.489> 30<00:03:23.760> millimeters

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
I made that around 28 to 30 millimeters

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.410 
I made that around 28 to 30 millimeters
can<00:03:25.140> be<00:03:25.260> any<00:03:25.410> size<00:03:25.739> in<00:03:26.040> there<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.940> combined

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
can be any size in there it combined

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.170 
can be any size in there it combined
this<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.500> Toyota<00:03:28.769> disc<00:03:29.370> it's<00:03:29.670> just<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.970> 9

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
this is the Toyota disc it's just a 9

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.720 
this is the Toyota disc it's just a 9
inch<00:03:30.390> disc<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:31.049> think<00:03:31.799> this<00:03:31.950> one<00:03:32.190> came<00:03:32.400> out<00:03:32.580> of

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
inch disc I think this one came out of

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.050 
inch disc I think this one came out of
an<00:03:32.850> 85<00:03:33.420> Toyota<00:03:34.260> truck<00:03:34.650> with<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:34.950> 22-hour<00:03:35.459> engine

flywheel<00:03:54.060> oh<00:03:54.650> yeah<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.799> whole

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
flywheel oh yeah so this is the whole

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:15.050 
flywheel oh yeah so this is the whole
system<00:03:59.519> as<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.450> goes

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.660 

these<00:04:16.060> guy<00:04:16.359> things<00:04:16.780> would<00:04:17.019> be<00:04:17.230> de<00:04:18.190> penser

these guy things would be de penser

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.690 
these guy things would be de penser
engine<00:04:19.060> transmission<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:24.040> guys<00:04:24.250> are<00:04:24.580> all

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
engine transmission so the guys are all

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.580 
engine transmission so the guys are all
the<00:04:24.850> end<00:04:25.000> everything<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:25.870> still<00:04:26.170> spins

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
the end everything and it still spins

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.660 
the end everything and it still spins
freely<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:28.740> this<00:04:29.740> all<00:04:29.950> motors<00:04:30.460> also

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
freely and this all motors also

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.230 
freely and this all motors also
assembled<00:04:31.450> off<00:04:31.600> so<00:04:31.990> it's<00:04:32.230> hard<00:04:32.500> for<00:04:32.590> me<00:04:33.240> to

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
assembled off so it's hard for me to

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.100 
assembled off so it's hard for me to
spin<00:04:35.940> that's<00:04:36.940> it<00:04:37.300> they're<00:04:38.070> put<00:04:39.070> in<00:04:39.190> your

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
spin that's it they're put in your

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.470 
spin that's it they're put in your
master<00:04:41.110> cylinder<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.820> way<00:04:42.970> I've<00:04:43.120> got<00:04:43.150> it

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
master cylinder the way I've got it

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.560 
master cylinder the way I've got it
adjust<00:04:43.840> all<00:04:44.430> it's<00:04:45.430> already<00:04:45.700> adjusted<00:04:46.210> in
