for<00:04:29.370> each<00:04:29.520> side<00:04:29.820> because<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.330> will<00:04:30.419> attach<00:04:30.660> it

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
for each side because you will attach it

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.570

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
stitches in which case you would simply

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.909 
stitches in which case you would simply
attach<00:04:46.800> your<00:04:47.010> yarn<00:04:47.720> single<00:04:48.720> crochet<00:04:49.169> in<00:04:49.410> the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
next seven stitches you can make your

straps as wide as you like I like them

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.240 
straps as wide as you like I like them
wide<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:55.320> can<00:04:55.500> make<00:04:55.650> sure<00:04:55.889> that<00:04:56.070> they're

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
wide so it can make sure that they're

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.580
