 they test fires with milestone using the

 technology as your biggest advantage starts 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.989
 by the uach and excel with the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.239
 advantages that a university gives you 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.250
 digital I decided well I decided you for the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.469
 Hispanic American University and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.750
 fortunately, the result has 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.760
 proved that it is the best and that the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.700
 greater rose to anyone but him 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.450
 belong 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.579
 better to see 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.760
 but not 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.760
 probably yes 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.080
 yes yes the kingdom time the time of 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.960
 thin parrot where there were the 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.270
 lusos vine and all that other 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.790
 great generation generation 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.520
 Colombians but I think that in these 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.250
 moments you can say that think that 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.729
 he is a better climber than all of them 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.729
 probably 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.770
 among others, it has been the culprit of 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.710
 make great moments 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.759
 difficult to nairo with the help of their 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.950
 comrades among them andrei has been 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.100
 able to spend all those bad moments 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.770
 and be able to get to this last week 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.680
 because that is where we have already seen one 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.050
 ironman recovered and where especially 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.800
 his colleagues have been the key 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.479
 to be able to see it clothed during 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.479
 the previous 15 days 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.970
 and logically his name much more mature 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.879
 with an already important experience a 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.940
 man that they know how to work and 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.459
 be around the needs of a 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.400
 great leader and good knowing well 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.310
 important not because sometimes in the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.990
 cycling only value is given to the 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.180
 fact of getting here in 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.680
 in the goals but to get here in 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.170
 the goals have had to happen before 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.750
 really complicated filters where there 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.940
 the team is decisive and many times 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.950
 because of having it to not have it 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.790
 you could see the other day in the stage of 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.070
 of the stÃ©lvio because in that day it was 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.970
 gorka izaguirre and then it was 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.010
 fundamental because the team is 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.290
 determinant is to help you pose 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.360
 especially not to lose the turn and in 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.670
 specific moments as it could be from 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.580
 the other day that he commented to you then they were 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.350
 also to help you win now 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.350
 put him as leader
