00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
front the brake caliper when I was

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.580 
front the brake caliper when I was
squeezing<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.510> leave<00:00:24.689> when<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> squeezing<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
squeezing the leave when I squeezing the

lever<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:27.980> handlebars<00:00:29.420> nothing<00:00:30.420> was

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
lever on the handlebars nothing was

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.200 
lever on the handlebars nothing was
happening<00:00:30.689> really<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> took<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.099> off<00:00:32.340> tried

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
happening really so I took it off tried

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.970 
happening really so I took it off tried
to<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.480> lamp<00:00:33.690> mantel<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.829> silver

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
to this lamp mantel it but that silver

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.090 
to this lamp mantel it but that silver
piston<00:00:37.980> there<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.430> can't<00:00:39.440> retract<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.950> get

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
piston there I can't retract it to get

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.819 
piston there I can't retract it to get
the<00:00:42.140> pad<00:00:43.140> back<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:44.120> so<00:00:45.289> just<00:00:46.289> wondered<00:00:46.620> how<00:00:46.770> you

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the pad back in so just wondered how you

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.389 
the pad back in so just wondered how you
to<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:50.750> basically<00:00:51.860> yet<00:00:52.860> there<00:00:53.340> was

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
to do that and basically yet there was

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.450 
to do that and basically yet there was
fluid<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.230> chamber<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:56.070> wasn't<00:00:56.370> getting

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
fluid in the chamber just wasn't getting

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.560 
fluid in the chamber just wasn't getting
through<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> brakes<00:00:57.120> they<00:00:57.390> weren't

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
through to the brakes they weren't

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.610 
through to the brakes they weren't
working<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> bike<00:00:59.760> there<00:01:00.180> is

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
working now going up the bike there is

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.310 
working now going up the bike there is
the<00:01:01.670> forks<00:01:02.670> which<00:01:03.090> when<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.480> had<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> wheel<00:01:04.110> off

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the forks which when I had the wheel off

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.130 
the forks which when I had the wheel off
they<00:01:04.739> were<00:01:05.330> bouncing<00:01:06.330> up<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.540> down<00:01:06.659> fine

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
they were bouncing up and down fine

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.719 
they were bouncing up and down fine
perfect<00:01:08.150> resistance<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.680> since<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.950> wheel

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
perfect resistance but since the wheel

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.320 
perfect resistance but since the wheel
is<00:01:11.970> now<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.200> absolutely<00:01:14.330> no

almost<00:02:02.910> touching<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:05.450> caliper<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.510> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
almost touching the caliper at the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.810 
almost touching the caliper at the
moment<00:02:06.900> but<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.800> reservoir<00:02:09.200> back<00:02:10.200> there<00:02:10.500> is

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
moment but the reservoir back there is

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.230 
moment but the reservoir back there is
sort<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:11.930> no<00:02:12.930> resistance<00:02:13.470> on<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.800> whatsoever

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
as you can see by all the tools I've

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.170 
as you can see by all the tools I've
left<00:03:00.209> around<00:03:00.510> here<00:03:01.340> I've<00:03:02.340> tried<00:03:02.640> pretty<00:03:03.090> much

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
left around here I've tried pretty much

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.650 
left around here I've tried pretty much

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
everything the clutch lever itself is

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.820 
everything the clutch lever itself is
wobbly<00:03:07.620> but<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:09.000> clutch<00:03:09.269> does<00:03:09.540> work<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:10.140> tried

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
wobbly but the clutch does work I tried

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.640 
wobbly but the clutch does work I tried
tightening<00:03:11.480> whereas<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.630> there's<00:03:12.840> try

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
tightening whereas it there's try

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.420

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
tightening this up to know which way to

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.449 
tightening this up to know which way to
turn<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.239> I<00:03:18.299> tried<00:03:18.390> all<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.310> hasn't<00:03:20.310> really

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
turn it so I tried all but hasn't really

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.240
