all right as previously mentioned in
another<00:00:04.830> video<00:00:05.190> using<00:00:05.670> these<00:00:06.259> wire<00:00:07.259> hoop

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.060 

thingies<00:00:11.519> or<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.179> wire<00:00:12.330> hoops<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:13.469> can<00:00:13.889> make

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
thingies or the wire hoops we can make

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.790 
thingies or the wire hoops we can make
some<00:00:14.460> things<00:00:14.759> out<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.299> wire<00:00:15.560> that<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.650> could

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
some things out of wire that you could

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.980 
some things out of wire that you could
make<00:00:16.980> otherwise<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.600> just<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.869> lot

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
make otherwise but it's just a lot

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.900 
make otherwise but it's just a lot
easier<00:00:19.320> when<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:19.680> already<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.310> circle

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
easier when it's already in a circle

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.060 
easier when it's already in a circle
these<00:00:21.660> are<00:00:21.840> silver<00:00:22.140> plated<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.769> that's<00:00:22.949> an

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
these are silver plated so that's an

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.160 
these are silver plated so that's an
advantage<00:00:23.420> these<00:00:24.420> aren't<00:00:24.570> very<00:00:24.660> these<00:00:25.050> won't

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
advantage these aren't very these won't

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.980 
advantage these aren't very these won't
cost<00:00:25.470> very<00:00:25.710> much<00:00:25.769> probably<00:00:26.279> about<00:00:26.990> two

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
cost very much probably about two

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.810 
cost very much probably about two
dollars<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.619> eighty<00:00:28.740> cents<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.220> think<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.609> paid

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
dollars and eighty cents I think I paid

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
dollars and eighty cents I think I paid
for<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.179> like<00:00:30.449> this

for that like this

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.479 
for that like this

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
Fisher ring okay now we're gonna go

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.110 
Fisher ring okay now we're gonna go
ahead<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.719> do<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> heart<00:00:40.710> which<00:00:41.670> would<00:00:41.850> seem

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
ahead and do a heart which would seem

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.670 
ahead and do a heart which would seem
like<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> most<00:00:42.570> obvious<00:00:42.690> thing<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.290> make<00:00:43.500> out

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
like the most obvious thing to make out

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.319 
like the most obvious thing to make out
of<00:00:43.710> these<00:00:44.750> once<00:00:45.750> again<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.260> small<00:00:46.649> hoop<00:00:46.920> area

is what we want to have be the longest
part<00:00:51.239> left<00:00:51.510> over<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:53.100> bend<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> up

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
part left over so we can then bend it up

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.260 
part left over so we can then bend it up
and<00:00:54.559> use<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.800> an<00:00:56.250> attachment<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and use it for an attachment to the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.400 
and use it for an attachment to the
earring<00:00:57.840> piece<00:00:58.430> okay<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.670> we're<00:00:59.850> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.059> do

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
earring piece okay all we're going to do

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.429 
earring piece okay all we're going to do
you<00:01:01.410> may<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.680> noticed<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.439> for

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
you may have noticed that for the for

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.230 
you may have noticed that for the for
the<00:01:04.739> other<00:01:05.369> piece<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.850> did<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.090> use<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the other piece that we did we use a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.679 
the other piece that we did we use a
smaller<00:01:06.659> hoop<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:08.180> today<00:01:09.180> we're<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.510> to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
smaller hoop and today we're going to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.590 
smaller hoop and today we're going to
use<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> larger<00:01:10.320> hoop<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.119> all<00:01:12.119> we're<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
use a larger hoop so all we're going to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.649 
use a larger hoop so all we're going to
do<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.020> bend<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.330> in<00:01:15.330> such<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> way<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.650> this

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
do is bend it in such a way that this

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.570 
do is bend it in such a way that this
piece<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> smaller<00:01:19.500> hoop<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
piece with a smaller hoop on it is the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.649 
piece with a smaller hoop on it is the
biggest<00:01:21.240> piece<00:01:21.390> left<00:01:21.630> over<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> we've<00:01:24.360> been<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
biggest piece left over so we've been it

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.800 
biggest piece left over so we've been it
like<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.909> going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> bottom

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
like that this is going to be the bottom

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.850 
like that this is going to be the bottom
of<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> heart<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.700> we'll<00:01:29.820> come<00:01:30.000> back<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.860> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
of the heart so we'll come back up and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.160 
of the heart so we'll come back up and
just<00:01:32.210> create<00:01:33.210> what<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.420> consider<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:34.049> a

just create what you consider to be a
nice<00:01:34.409> heart<00:01:34.680> shape<00:01:36.140> with<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:38.990> with<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.200> wire

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
nice heart shape with this with the wire

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.789 
nice heart shape with this with the wire

pliers the needle nose

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.510 
pliers the needle nose
don't<00:01:44.790> try<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.119> bend<00:01:45.479> from<00:01:45.990> over<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:46.560> bend

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
don't try to bend from over here bend

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.090 
don't try to bend from over here bend
from<00:01:47.820> here<00:01:48.270> from<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> edge<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:49.860> way<00:01:50.040> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
from here from the edge that way you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.120 
from here from the edge that way you
allow<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.520> wire<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.509> bend<00:01:51.780> itself<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.649> this

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
allow the wire to bend itself on this

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.359 
allow the wire to bend itself on this
segment<00:01:54.200> start<00:01:55.200> bending<00:01:55.439> inward<00:01:56.899> bend<00:01:58.369> until

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
segment start bending inward bend until

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.920 
segment start bending inward bend until
it<00:01:59.520> looks<00:01:59.790> like<00:01:59.939> you've<00:02:00.090> got<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.509> heart

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
it looks like you've got that heart

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.149 
it looks like you've got that heart
shaped<00:02:01.229> look<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:03.180> see<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.619> right<00:02:04.619> there<00:02:04.649> that

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
shaped look you see it right there that

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.690 
shaped look you see it right there that
heart-shaped<00:02:05.490> look

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
heart-shaped look

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.730 
heart-shaped look
and<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.570> may<00:02:07.689> not<00:02:07.720> be<00:02:07.869> perfect<00:02:08.380> but<00:02:08.410> this<00:02:08.590> is

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
and that may not be perfect but this is

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.979 
and that may not be perfect but this is
trial<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.099> error<00:02:09.459> then<00:02:09.940> take<00:02:10.179> this<00:02:10.420> piece<00:02:10.750> and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
trial and error then take this piece and

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.370 
trial and error then take this piece and
bend<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.770> inward<00:02:12.750> until<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:14.020> looks<00:02:14.140> like<00:02:14.260> you

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
bend it inward until it looks like you

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.070 
bend it inward until it looks like you
have<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.560> heart<00:02:14.800> shaped<00:02:15.069> look<00:02:15.250> also<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.900> not

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
have the heart shaped look also it's not

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.410
