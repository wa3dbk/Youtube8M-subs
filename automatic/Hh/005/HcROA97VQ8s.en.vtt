here's<00:02:50.580> my<00:02:50.820> ipad<00:02:51.239> 2<00:02:51.510> let's<00:02:52.020> go<00:02:52.140> ahead<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.830> put

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
here's my ipad 2 let's go ahead and put

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.940 
here's my ipad 2 let's go ahead and put
this<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.489> case<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.870> ipad<00:02:55.260> goes<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.739> with

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
this in the case the ipad goes in with

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.370 
this in the case the ipad goes in with
the<00:02:55.980> front<00:02:56.280> display<00:02:56.459> facing<00:02:57.150> inside<00:02:57.510> because

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
the front display facing inside because

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.470 
the front display facing inside because
it<00:02:58.530> will<00:02:58.709> not<00:02:58.890> fit<00:02:59.130> if<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.550> display<00:02:59.850> is<00:02:59.880> facing

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
it will not fit if the display is facing

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.470 
it will not fit if the display is facing
outside<00:03:01.430> there<00:03:02.430> are<00:03:02.489> no<00:03:02.670> more<00:03:02.910> cut<00:03:03.090> outs<00:03:03.330> for

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
outside there are no more cut outs for

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.960 
outside there are no more cut outs for
the<00:03:03.720> volume<00:03:04.020> buttons<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:05.250> i<00:03:05.280> guess<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:05.820> will

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
the volume buttons so i guess this will

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.520 
the volume buttons so i guess this will
go<00:03:06.209> in<00:03:06.420> like<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:08.989> there's<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.110> cutout

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
go in like this there's a cutout

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.020 
go in like this there's a cutout
that<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:11.040> think<00:03:11.310> will<00:03:11.459> line<00:03:11.610> up<00:03:11.640> with<00:03:11.820> the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
that I think will line up with the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.170 
that I think will line up with the
headset<00:03:12.390> jack<00:03:15.739> they<00:03:16.739> change<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.340> design<00:03:17.489> just

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
a little bit because now the volume

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.350 
a little bit because now the volume
buttons<00:03:20.790> will<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.030> accessible

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360
