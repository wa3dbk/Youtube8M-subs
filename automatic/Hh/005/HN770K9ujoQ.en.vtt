that<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.470> moves<00:02:58.709> are<00:02:59.010> not<00:02:59.250> visual<00:03:00.030> which<00:03:00.299> kind

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
that the moves are not visual which kind

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.330 
that the moves are not visual which kind
of<00:03:00.570> sucks<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.049> they'll<00:03:01.799> probably<00:03:01.829> add<00:03:02.190> that

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
of sucks but they'll probably add that

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.030 
of sucks but they'll probably add that
in<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.459> future<00:03:02.640> or<00:03:03.120> i<00:03:03.630> mean<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.560> pros

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
in the future or i mean the the pros

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.069 
in the future or i mean the the pros
outweigh<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.370> cons<00:03:05.519> anyways<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.510> terms<00:03:06.840> of

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
outweigh the cons anyways in terms of

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.289
