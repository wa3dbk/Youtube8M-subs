 which will be attached to the center of the rear and in this video I will answer 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.470
 before the threat of a peace regime and again 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.249
 from youtube through facebook 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.690
 I sent many restless people 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.720
 and it is true 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.650
 for some things you need to know that in relation to decorating with 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.109
 balloons 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.710
 among other things I had not answered the equality questions 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.520
 with alexis sanchez inhabitant in companies 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.950
 in the first question here 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.110
 and although it is said that they study if it existed or if it is studied 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.129
 art is the expression 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.499
 well I did not study design that I studied psychology 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.340
 this car nevertheless exists 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.280
 January or you have a lot of time so determining the race was that I started 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.039
 with this business hispania exemplary career 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.320
 it was in which the genoa and sampdoria ita 6-1 and 6-3 in one hour ayala francisco yes 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.860
 I do not dedicate myself to today 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.070
 so for a foot decoration and how much does it cost to repair your consultants 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.670
 very variable this depends on a quick command of the Chinese style too 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.290
 He says that he has so much decoration 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.880
 and this and another one of the things 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.970
 she believes that by adjustments plus any other trade 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.120
 Uncle Urtiaga profession charges you depending on the quality of your work 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.450
 this ii for you to have the great job for specific 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.950
 experience and you need to know many gay things to have quality 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.880
 to 100 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.159
 you can already obtain through this course of workshops and seminars 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.179
 and then support with registered 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.179
 with internet with books are many things not then 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.650
 i depends on your 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.430
 your work what you do if you need to have good quality so you can give 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.650
 a good service 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.900
 also in this much is based for example someone there 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.930
 of the quality of the materials that it had what it takes and manages 47 elcogás and not 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.020
 by hits but it's because I do not know what kind of written materials you handle 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.450
 or that neither economical that so expensive that it can contribute 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.889
 in basketball 10 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.599
 then that depends on the client 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.099
 people like you get 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.969
 these subsidiaries type of material 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.659
 also a year 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.749
 good and conditioning 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.359
 six meters 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.589
 it's a standard arc that would be the same as what I handle for all 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.589
 events and for all the happy squares 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.699
 in which I also had my favorite pastime 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.399
 me when I'm not working 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.469
 the decoration because I love being at home and being with my family 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.559
 and I another of the things that I like 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:55.680
 that is to say what he said but to learn from makeup and can and this is a good 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:56.539
 deal 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:57.549
 cinema 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.659
 and it's a business but like all business 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.309
 can be a cyclist 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:06.169
 to the slope they need to give their time to the business to get ahead 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.040
 I do not think why 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.709
 in I have many 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.709
 many friends that kansas city while it's okay 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:19.249
 maybe I do how much did he charge August to say that I find it or that it's a 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.069
 good business 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.469
 if it is a bad business since I tell you from experience it is very satisfactory 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.029
 of what I have achieved here what I have what I have done 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:30.549
 but if you need arístide 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.479
 do not believe that for example they have negotiated today 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.479
 and within a kiss between two months she will have 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.119
 all those profits and they were going to sell smoke 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.769
 like nobody can not 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.769
 you have to give them time business you have to let them know you 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.729
 in that province a lot of propaganda for clients so that they know you and so that 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.160
 people enjoy dancing and drinking in the quality of their work 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.239
 really if I wanted to do 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.399
 active form and returning to left foot 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:02.539
 Sacyr Pulse recommends that you also stop to learn how to shoot 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.439
 I think 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.430
 the courses that you have the possibility to attend 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.549
 assistant information 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.599
 the neighbors of santillana and 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.759
 you know it matters to me also it's productivism 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:20.789
 because these areas are a lot of people who are dedicated to the same thing then star and 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.639
 you are learning other things are worth learning from other experiences 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.219
 and all that works, so every year 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:32.969
 Caribou to the workshops to the seminars to force in foot villa I recommend that 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:34.960
 go amán where you can go 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.380
 and is that they can and pointed out that you do not know how to learn to transport 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.919
 how long before you have to go 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.349
 in Buenos Aires or they also depend a lot 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.669
 hence the childhood before mayweather 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.690
 includes many here intervened 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.849
 many factors 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.840
 the first is to go 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.219
 what decoration are you going to do 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:58.189
 100 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.389
 if there are people who support you 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.650
 How many people do you have but who is going to fight you? 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.620
 what are your work tools 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.980
 one was not even professional 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.820
 then all about the massacre they do it learning but in the Canary Islands 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.780
 I recommend that they suffered that if they tell you that the party starts at 5 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.360
 the afternoon 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.529
 the decoration should be 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.659
 at least 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.849
 half an hour before the hour 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.039
 so they say that the crisis at five o'clock falls 4 4 and a half that day has to 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.939
 be completely finished and act is now 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.150
 ajá of the state and that he accepts box office and already studies not 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.129
 that's why it's very ugly 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.379
 among the guests and it still fails you 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:41.229
 then take reference 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.159
 half an hour 40 minutes before it was time for someone to tell you what's going 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.349
 start the party 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.659
 also has a lot to do with the process will last the incidence is a 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:50.529
 local closed 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:54.909
 all of that influences a lot because obviously the nations are not in this work and it's 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.710
 much more difficult 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.499
 an exposed place 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:03.479
 right away, another question is how do we get the balloons to hold up? 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:06.830
 Álvarez expressed 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.830
 what if I put at least so that endurance is not worth 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:15.799
 point of view there is nothing here nothing that I do not like hold all the 

00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:17.789
 parties which is a place outdoors 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.300
 this agreement has asked who the parties on the beach and 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.539
 them but I the truth nadal 

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:30.059
 the globe while it is exposed to the sun to the heat 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.759
 always going to burst you will work in such a short time is going to 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.650
 dull in a very short time 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.720
 then one of the things that I can suggest 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.939
 is that when it's improving 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.210
 he has exposed 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.210
 because it tries to inflate 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.259
 a little smaller capacity 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.210
 that who regularly does 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.840
 and so that you can hold a little more but that does not mean you have to put up with 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.749
 Party 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.189
 while I am when they are 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:01.460
 and then I try to go handle other options 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.080
 if they put the Perón logos to the best not 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.520
 so much for you 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.449
 I did what I did 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:12.029
 I told clients to propose what they ask me, but rather it is not 

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:14.770
 they guarantee you of a march on foot 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:15.819
 so 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.999
 saints are details that Sweden awards do something on the fly but that 

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:21.659
 also feel comment 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:24.449
 Antolin that are already here 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.069
 if you want it or simple 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:30.059
 and can be handled other alternatives ago perhaps 

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:33.439
 xie that the centerpieces are more striking bigger 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.379
 bottle or other people 

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:39.379
 of things to participate to make the cd 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.070
 lilly any forced and parker comment then I am to serve you 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.339
 dry dock vigo delivered and after a triple of blums 

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:48.680
 have them dot 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.139
 and there you will find all the data for 

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.340
 won the game to the track added 

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.839
 the outside 

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:59.539
 there is a cream contact mast of castile and lion and they will suffer 

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:02.539
 nonsense when the gdp grew in everything for what happened 

00:08:03.619 --> 00:08:05.449
 heavy load docks machinery
