00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.950
 philippe so we continue to the 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.960
 nukak frosting exactly so that's it 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.759
 simply melt the dough to 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.530
 glossy blonde who is a preparation 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.240
 which will simply allow you 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.740
 to have a beautiful icing and well 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.260
 brilliant and very easily then 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.110
 how to do this it's easy 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.880
 do melt at 35 to 40 degrees so the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.070
 blonde dough you add as 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.140
 I made directly praline 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.460
 prime grains and crunch hazelnuts 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.770
 which are crushed that were 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.870
 caramelized so it's exceptional and 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.760
 It will bring you to the surface 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.020
 tasty side that can be found at 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.670
 through different products 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.080
 knows well in our everyday life at 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.100
 level of the pastry so there we 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:49.900
 here is unfortunately this preparation there 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.530
 we will be able to use it as many times 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.660
 we want 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.920
 the only requirement is really the 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:01.960
 temperature ie 35 40 degrees 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.780
 here I take the temperature 35 36 c 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.680
 then did not once this 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.310
 preparation is made 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.200
 you put it in a container spout 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.780
 pourer to be able to weigh 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.150
 cream of milk and other things 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:23.880
 way to facilitate so the frosting of 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.880
 our traveler's check is perfect 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.410
 then we'll just go back 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.620
 in Cairo we will prepare the 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:37.930
 exits duflot smooth smooth ten years ago 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.130
 and that the temperature they are there 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.780
 why about twenty degrees 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.760
 we put them on a grid so we can 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.240
 so the ice creams and in the best 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.050
 terms 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.530
 so that's where exactly 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.840
 the spout so we add 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:01.930
 directly so our ice cream 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.040
 like those who will coat the biscuit 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.860
 cocoa 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.860
 do the same for the other side 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.520
 if there are small imperfections 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.830
 you will be able to read the bed 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.270
 rectified with the palette thought about 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.380
 put a hollow plate under the grate 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:24.010
 shelter to recover accessing this 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.620
 it's perfect you use a small 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.630
 palette like that so to remove 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.980
 the surplus so he does not have too much 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.980
 thickness of milk frosting lo 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.610
 then there are two advantages to this 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.770
 finish that's going to allow the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.720
 biscuits to stay well soft inside 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.640
 a cookie so you leave it to 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.560
 in the open air it will dry the fact that they 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.030
 are wrapped and ben sanou lost them 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.320
 air passengers to protect him from 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.970
 look and have something that 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:00.150
 can be kept long enough 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.040
 here you are tapping lightly and there in 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.890
 ten minutes that it will 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.720
 firmed up its shine to put on can be 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.240
 ten minutes have passed since as 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.430
 a glass and cake so the icing was 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.290
 frozen here is the frosting froze it is 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.910
 well brilliant and now so we're going 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.320
 finish with whipped cream 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.430
 chocolate then chocolate whipped cream 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.290
 excuse me for cutting you young in 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.030
 question I would like to use an icing 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.410
 I'm eight years old something else broken 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.870
 by bulky haykel I'm at the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.490
 home i am i am alone what is this 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.020
 that I'm going to make a single kilo in fact 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.670
 with cacao barry products you have 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.770
 origins you have plantations 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.530
 you have chocolates on which you 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.020
 you can add 10 to 15% oil 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.460
 of grape seeds a neutral oil in 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.710
 makes an oil that will not bring 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.150
 taste and then mixing everything so 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.640
 you just take your chocolate 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.570
 you put it at 35 degrees you add 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.370
 this oil with the net on it gives you 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.230
 and then you go ice cold 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.790
 exactly we did everything to 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.620
 the hour ie the jug 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.060
 indirectly on so simply 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.860
 the travel cake 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.540
 and then after you the past pretty much 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.950
 ten minutes in the fridge the story to do 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.910
 fi I have enough quickly and you 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.560
 find in fact in the same 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.310
 conditions with a chocolate that is 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.810
 original 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.240
 it's in the cover of his choice 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.770
 7 10 to 15% city of gaza exactly this 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.330
 which will allow near power 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.609
 cut quite easily without that 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.080
 breaks what why this low city and 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.300
 oil actually will actually allow you to 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.100
 gain ease in terms of 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.080
 briand because normally a chocolate 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.370
 that crystallize you know you all 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.020
 seen little videos at best of 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.940
 chief point as on which one made 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.100
 casts things like that so there 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.350
 he had to table and he stayed 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.940
 little bit more tedious than normal 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.800
 there putting oil on you 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.420
 actually allows to get something 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.220
 shine pretty quickly but under 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.870
 conditions still state 35 degrees and 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.520
 to do a little thermal shock that 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.390
 provides gloss agree 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.370
 with the first of the great 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.370
 we do not change anything very well
