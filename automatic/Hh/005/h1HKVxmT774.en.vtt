and<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:22.980> sand<00:02:23.250> made<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.640> over<00:02:23.850> here<00:02:25.220> I'm

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
and the sand made it over here I'm

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.950 
and the sand made it over here I'm
guessing<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.820> probably<00:02:26.850> did<00:02:30.560> where<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.770> it

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
guessing it probably did where is it

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.830 
guessing it probably did where is it
sand<00:02:33.960> glass<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.040> stone<00:02:35.310> here<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.510> there<00:02:36.780> it

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
sand glass and stone here and there it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.840 
sand glass and stone here and there it
is<00:02:36.930> there's<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.680> stone<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> same<00:02:38.640> that

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
is there's the stone and the same that

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.360 
is there's the stone and the same that
we<00:02:39.000> sent<00:02:39.300> over<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.690> way<00:02:40.010> now<00:02:41.010> i'm<00:02:41.160> going<00:02:41.310> to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
we sent over this way now i'm going to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.030 
we sent over this way now i'm going to
show<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:41.490> guys<00:02:41.700> quickly<00:02:42.210> how<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.690> works

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
show you guys quickly how this works

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
quickly as i can as i said it uses the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.310 
quickly as i can as i said it uses the
plugin<00:02:46.260> minecart<00:02:46.800> mania<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.580> without<00:02:47.850> that

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
plugin minecart mania so without that

we launched it off it came down from
there<00:03:04.230> that's<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.560> station<00:03:05.100> up<00:03:05.250> there<00:03:05.430> it

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360

furnaces and the furnaces are

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.120 
furnaces and the furnaces are
interesting<00:03:12.090> because<00:03:13.020> they'll<00:03:13.380> deposit<00:03:13.709> coal

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
interesting because they'll deposit coal

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.830

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
dispense it later this gold block right

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.060 
dispense it later this gold block right
here<00:04:45.120> this<00:04:46.020> is<00:04:46.080> one<00:04:46.290> of<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.410> blocks<00:04:46.650> you<00:04:46.830> use

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
here this is one of the blocks you use

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.960 
here this is one of the blocks you use
when<00:04:47.970> making<00:04:48.710> mine<00:04:49.710> cart<00:04:49.980> systems<00:04:50.400> with<00:04:50.760> mine

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
when making mine cart systems with mine

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.160 
when making mine cart systems with mine
car<00:04:51.180> mania<00:04:51.740> gold<00:04:52.740> block<00:04:52.980> is<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.220> booster<00:04:53.610> block

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
car mania gold block is a booster block

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.380 
car mania gold block is a booster block
so<00:04:55.170> makes<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.100> car<00:04:56.310> go<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.520> lot<00:04:56.700> faster<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:57.360> I

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
so makes the car go a lot faster so I

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.360 
so makes the car go a lot faster so I
needed<00:04:57.690> to<00:04:57.750> get<00:04:57.930> speed<00:04:58.260> sped<00:04:58.770> up<00:04:58.950> here<00:04:59.130> to<00:04:59.250> get

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
needed to get speed sped up here to get

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.060 
needed to get speed sped up here to get
up<00:04:59.460> these<00:04:59.580> heels<00:05:00.080> this<00:05:01.080> brick<00:05:01.590> blocks<00:05:01.860> are

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
up these heels this brick blocks are

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.250 
up these heels this brick blocks are
right<00:05:02.190> here<00:05:02.490> is<00:05:02.640> an<00:05:02.820> intersection<00:05:03.419> block<00:05:03.660> so

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
right here is an intersection block so

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.659 
right here is an intersection block so
when<00:05:04.410> you<00:05:04.500> put<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.680> brick<00:05:04.860> block<00:05:05.070> down<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:05.520> can

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
when you put a brick block down you can

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.530 
when you put a brick block down you can
put<00:05:05.820> a<00:05:05.850> sign<00:05:06.180> which<00:05:06.510> is<00:05:06.720> down<00:05:07.440> under<00:05:07.890> it<00:05:08.540> which

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
put a sign which is down under it which

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.320 
put a sign which is down under it which
tells<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.050> card<00:05:10.380> switch<00:05:10.680> what<00:05:11.010> to<00:05:11.160> do<00:05:11.340> and

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
tells the card switch what to do and

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.950 
tells the card switch what to do and
what<00:05:12.419> this<00:05:12.600> one's<00:05:12.870> for<00:05:13.110> is<00:05:13.500> if<00:05:14.510> if<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.630> mine

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
what this one's for is if if the mine

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.480 
what this one's for is if if the mine
cart<00:05:16.169> is<00:05:16.320> empty<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:16.860> will<00:05:16.980> send<00:05:17.250> it<00:05:17.370> straight

the mine cart is non empty it will send
it<00:05:20.250> up<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.610> word<00:05:20.730> the<00:05:20.850> right<00:05:21.030> there<00:05:21.330> which

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
it up to the word the right there which

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.390 
it up to the word the right there which
will<00:05:24.080> which<00:05:25.080> has<00:05:25.290> a<00:05:25.320> stop<00:05:25.650> block<00:05:25.860> up<00:05:26.190> there

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
will which has a stop block up there

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.050 
will which has a stop block up there
which<00:05:27.030> allows<00:05:27.330> us<00:05:27.600> to<00:05:28.100> inspect<00:05:29.100> what<00:05:29.700> was<00:05:29.850> not

which allows us to inspect what was not
picked<00:05:30.750> up<00:05:30.900> at<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.050> warehouse<00:05:31.320> so<00:05:31.740> that<00:05:31.890> we

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
picked up at the warehouse so that we

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.409 
picked up at the warehouse so that we
can<00:05:32.750> modify<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.900> warehouse<00:05:34.410> to<00:05:35.419> accommodate

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
can modify the warehouse to accommodate

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.970 
can modify the warehouse to accommodate
that<00:05:36.600> next<00:05:36.930> time

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
so here we have a bunch of redstone

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.940 
so here we have a bunch of redstone
running<00:05:40.480> around<00:05:40.720> all<00:05:40.840> over<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:41.140> place<00:05:41.230> that's

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
comes up this way the empty one it

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.920 
comes up this way the empty one it
deposits<00:05:49.300> into<00:05:49.510> this<00:05:49.690> chest<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:52.360> then<00:05:52.720> when

we hit the button up there to dispense
the<00:05:54.880> minecart<00:05:55.390> it<00:05:55.780> will<00:05:55.990> shoot<00:05:56.260> out<00:05:56.470> here<00:05:56.970> head

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
the minecart it will shoot out here head

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.630 
the minecart it will shoot out here head
up<00:05:58.180> booster<00:05:59.110> block<00:05:59.350> and<00:05:59.770> head<00:05:59.980> up<00:06:00.190> toward
