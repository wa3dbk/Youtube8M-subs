00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149 
episode so all in all I thought the
setup<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> characters<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> main

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
setup of the characters was the main

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.010 
setup of the characters was the main
focus<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.060> episode<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.869> should

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
focus of this episode what we should

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.420 
focus of this episode what we should
expect<00:01:07.110> from<00:01:07.439> each<00:01:07.619> individual<00:01:08.220> character

and<00:01:08.760> tried<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> set<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.020> guess<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and tried to set up I guess the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.770 
and tried to set up I guess the
atmosphere<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> series<00:01:11.700> now<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.630> do

okay<00:03:23.310> most<00:03:23.640> likely<00:03:23.940> one<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.299> harus<00:03:24.810> family

members has a powerful place in the

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:27.800 
members has a powerful place in the
government<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.120> they're<00:03:27.299> probably<00:03:27.480> trying<00:03:27.720> to

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
government so they're probably trying to

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.840 
government so they're probably trying to
hunt<00:03:27.989> down<00:03:28.049> Haru<00:03:28.440> -<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:28.920> guess<00:03:29.250> strike<00:03:29.609> at<00:03:29.760> the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
hunt down Haru - I guess strike at the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.099 
hunt down Haru - I guess strike at the
government<00:03:30.269> officials<00:03:30.690> that's<00:03:30.870> what<00:03:30.989> my

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
government officials that's what my

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.289 
government officials that's what my
major<00:03:31.290> opinion<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.100> hypothesis<00:03:32.850> of<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.120> is

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
major opinion and hypothesis of this is

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.610 
major opinion and hypothesis of this is
because<00:03:33.630> usually<00:03:33.810> that's<00:03:34.079> what<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.350> will<00:03:34.440> lead

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
because usually that's what it will lead

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.140 
because usually that's what it will lead
into<00:03:34.799> on<00:03:35.220> these<00:03:35.489> type<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.970> guess

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
into on these type of I guess

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.849 
into on these type of I guess
circumstances<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.200> when<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.470> know<00:03:37.590> have<00:03:37.769> an

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
circumstances and when you know have an

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.140 
circumstances and when you know have an
innocent<00:03:38.220> girl<00:03:38.370> being<00:03:38.579> hunted<00:03:38.940> down<00:03:39.090> by

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
innocent girl being hunted down by

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.229 
innocent girl being hunted down by
assassins<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.620> really<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.280> love<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:42.000> first

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239
