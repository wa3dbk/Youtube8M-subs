happen<00:02:45.049> but<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.560> sounds<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.340> interesting<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:47.660> I

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
happen but it sounds so interesting so I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.970 
happen but it sounds so interesting so I
think<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:47.989> is<00:02:48.049> definitely<00:02:48.260> going<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.680> be<00:02:48.769> one

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
think this is definitely going to be one

or<00:04:23.380> an<00:04:23.560> era<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:24.370> sounds<00:04:24.970> equally<00:04:25.330> terrible<00:04:25.870> and

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
or an era it sounds equally terrible and

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.960 
or an era it sounds equally terrible and
wonderful<00:04:26.380> but<00:04:27.010> I<00:04:27.220> think<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.640> deals<00:04:27.880> with

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
wonderful but I think it deals with

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.290 
wonderful but I think it deals with
obsession<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:28.990> romance<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:29.590> mental<00:04:29.890> illness
