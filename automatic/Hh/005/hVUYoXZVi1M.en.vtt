00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.910
 the chance to drive 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.230
 electric since already almost a year this 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.549
 which is interesting is that it's 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.750
 cars the center is silent so 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.630
 it's a driving comfort 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.820
 and then we can roll for 2 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.320
 to do 100 km so economically so 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.730
 it's advantageous a face the terminal is 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.410
 extremely simple to use these 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.689
 practical because we can adjust the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.950
 cable length by wrapping around 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:40.290
 their colors which is planned for that one 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.120
 can learn to disconnect the plug the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.020
 pause and in the basket and suddenly ben 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.020
 it's very easy to use 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.230
 secure charging, particularly by the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.449
 makes the car and the terminal 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 communicate together and therefore allow 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.100
 to make sure that the charge is going on 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.930
 good for the user so we have the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.910
 indicator light that allows him to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.149
 know the status of the terminal in time 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.149
 real 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.570
 which is also interesting is that we 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.549
 can ask at the charging station and 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.829
 when the electric tariff and the most 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.149
 more versatile bollard 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.409
 it can be installed indoors 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.180
 but also outside 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.490
 I could very well imagine from 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.780
 have one installed at my place of 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.490
 work which would allow me to 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.890
 reload your targets during the hours 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.090
 Office 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.110
 which is appreciable when driving in 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.549
 electric car is that we can 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.220
 recharge at home so it's a certain 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.539
 comfort compared to going to the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.250
 petrol station etc 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.020
 so it's a guy to be able to recharge 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.020
 at home at night when returning 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.240
 to install a charging terminal 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.070
 war already has a training of a 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.680
 day in society hardly 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.020
 brought near my home where I 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.960
 learned to implement and its bounds 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:04.479
 charging the installation of the terminal 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.180
 charge is very simple and almost like 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:11.800
 a radiator confides saumur had formerly 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.209
 a level a very sturdy fastener and 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.459
 for the connection you have a 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.209
 small chain rot the module that has 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.680
 a certain weight 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.350
 so what makes us easier 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.260
 considerably the implementation of 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.840
 the device the installation of the terminal of 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.820
 charge and electrically said very 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.280
 familiar given that we meet the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.130
 same connection terminals as in a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.050
 standard table of the building or 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.340
 tertiary or other sectors since 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.320
 it's a device that is totally 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.060
 autonomous even a person who does not know 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.290
 not use a computer will be very 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.550
 use it well as you have to 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.410
 this judge for angers a catch in a 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.560
 car and unplug it when it's 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.560
 made
