00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello everyone with you meshuggah and resource 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.540
 here is the top point ru 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.470
 surely each of you came across 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.290
 a problem 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.750
 about searching for a platoon and we will consider today 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.929
 and the service that recently started on 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.529
 site and consider how to apply 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.680
 to search for a platoon and proceed immediately to us 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.310
 and the search platoon button and click create 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.099
 application 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.010
 but as we see here we have a lot of fields 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.630
 the topmost field is the nickname and now we 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.640
 try to enter it perfectly entered nickname 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.530
 See some time he checked 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.660
 lit up green check mark it means 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.469
 what the system looked to on what tanks 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.260
 we drove 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.020
 and now he offers us to choose 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.149
 one of the seven nations that we have in 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.879
 burn well let's say it will be the technique of the ussr 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.039
 and then choose the type of technology 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.600
 let's say it will be medium tanks and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.430
 We look what kind of technician on 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.949
 offers as you can see here 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.800
 there are all medium tanks on which 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.470
 I have fights on the account, they generally all 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.869
 Tanks with out precisely those which on 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.909
 there are fights and if I deflated a tank 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.340
 investigated it bought but did not drive either 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.960
 one fight on it and the system is not 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.040
 would offer me this tank in this 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.460
 popup listings 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.189
 but choose an object 416 and then 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.320
 we choose which server is convenient for us 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.740
 Sorry, so far, there is no reason for a functional 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.780
 select multiple servers and if you have 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.119
 up to a few good ping 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.430
 choose to hand or later choose 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.130
 time at 2 o'clock intervals 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.229
 In principle, she is prime time with us usually 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.900
 eight to ten or six to eight 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.759
 choose 6 to 8 and then choose 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.560
 type of communication that suits us 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.409
 and also not implemented the functional selection 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.479
 several methods of communication so well 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.060
 try to choose any well, let's say 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.219
 raidcall as usual and then we send 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.119
 application and our application 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.740
 but appears but you see and congratulations 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.040
 your application is created, it remains to wait 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.469
 when you are invited in the game and now our 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.479
 application created on the site we can even her 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.060
 see see click search again 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.740
 platoon and here we see how created 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.960
 our 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.420
 application itself application will be active on 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.730
 exactly one week but if you enter 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.380
 through wargaming go to the site now we 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.380
 probably try to do it yes here 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.100
 see and enter our account enter our 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.160
 email and password naturally 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.860
 click confirm now we 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.360
 we can create an application that will 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.820
 keep the site exactly two weeks 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.550
 Now our application will hang two 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.260
 weeks if we now re-create in 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.230
 principle advantage is not very big 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.180
 week two weeks but if you do not long 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.190
 can you find a platoon then of course 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.950
 log in through wargaming and go 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.050
 make one application 1 2 weeks then what 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.420
 I hope all this service will be you 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.040
