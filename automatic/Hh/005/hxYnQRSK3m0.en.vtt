00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.969
 cooking and war iran iraq 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.600
 tj evening guest sir works to friends who just published to 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.710

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.210
 news would devote to the devote to the war iran iraq hours 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.910
 to deliver a passion that ask essential questions about Islam you 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.390
 are tunisian sir men like you currently live in lausanne 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.230
 in our country teach you math to enlistment drunk 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.050
 tunisia hirsch is a passion this 7 and Tunisia of course 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.430
 while in europe worries it's tunisia face the imposture med with 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.520
 which a little about his victims 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.530
 yes of an edge what pushed me to write this book is the suffering not 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.020
 it is the suffering of men and women 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.120
 who screams in the east but also all this time with our sites 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.130
 and throw in jail 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.130
 and this suffering pushed me to write this book that you see 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.920
 for what is composed of three 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.430
 part of the first part and it's a mother like alizÃ©e comments 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.690
 obtained from an open letter 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.840
 as you will think a communist dismissing not agree 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.500
 the goal is to clear 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.960
 the phenomenon the logic of Bourguibism 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.300
 to not understand that bourguiba 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.780
 and the second part place it's about following the strategy of France in 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.119
 the probe center propelled by winds to see that is to say history of the 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.210
 deliberations movement of the country 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.490
 the goal is the game 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.270
 do you disengage% is it dependence on the one hand to the risks of dependencies 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.490
 when i will have tunisia right now 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.090
 do not try to get a democracy finally north 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.170
 to move towards democracy yes it's called change 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.010
 so that's the third part of the book 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.010
 as a party change 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.670
 we are hardly common law prisoners among the elite 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.250
 among the nine pass to stay off and his thieves will 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.820
 without ribery while men who scream stop with our sites are always 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.120
 in prison and it's called it changes everything so much about democracy 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.710
 to be clear saying it's more of a coca-cola democracy in 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.420
 place by whom has absolutely nothing to learn with democracy such 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.959
 that it is practiced in Switzerland 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.839
 as it is practiced in France or the United States 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.979
 the chip is a democracy it's a parody of democracy that is not 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:33.629
 restrictive that was exclusive to the entire population 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.379
 are dismissed from the outset 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.629
 alas this democracy and I will have finished it is dangerous it is crippling 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.049
 for the beneficiary peoples ie the Tunisians the 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.719
 senegalese the egyptians 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.299
 for the pr ehile 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.730
 a poison for control peoples 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.720
 as the Swiss people the year you yourself offer you a solution 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.230
 because I mean she manipulates you have a solution for the future 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:02.029
 let's say I do not belong to a specific political party and sport 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.759
 so obviously by writing this book gg I will try to understand what we 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:06.940
 can do for tunisia 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.940
 and I actively prepared a five-point program 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.519
 that I introduce you to him who is destined to spa to the Tunisian people 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.489
 as a whole for all tendencies and which is also intended for 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.799
 current government says change 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.409
 and the five points that you see it yourself the spaces are actually the 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.729
 basis of all true democracy 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.059
 this game asks what the release of all political detainees and the 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.059
 restoration of these prisoners in their civil and political rights 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.799
 secondly invited all Tunisians to participate in building the future of the 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:40.320
 country 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.829
 proceed to legislative elections 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.509
 and then proceed to presidential elections 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.829
 why read finally the first president of a tunisia become 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.829
 independent because do you see go when we say optimistic 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:56.779
 the staff of which I am pessimistic I am pessimistic as I told you 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.999
 since we are freeing the hostages in common 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:01.889
 while those who scream 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.949
 not having the instructions are still keeping in jail and we proceed is not it 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.669
 no retouching to some articles of the constitution for better 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.269
 sit down the power of the current president 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.979
 I say the thing and 40% at the risk of attending member states 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:20.900
 was it up to such a standing government to listen to its summers of applying these 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.509
 five points that are at stake the repeats conform to the basis of democracy 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.610
 so he claims 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.680
 want to apply in tunisia 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.449
 I thank you as 2010 may have to vault books the 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.750
 tunisia facing the imposture by ocha will beat him a threshold plus the war he 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.750
 will fill club 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.490
 Why 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.610
 continue your suggested thinking tonight in this edition 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.439
 main newscast 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.949
 canada has 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.729
 no
