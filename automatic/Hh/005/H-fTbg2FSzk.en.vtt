question<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:34.280> what<00:00:35.280> else<00:00:35.730> could<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.809> mean

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
question is what else could this mean

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.979 
question is what else could this mean
and<00:00:38.000> you<00:00:39.000> may<00:00:39.180> need<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.480> ask<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.930> question

because<00:00:41.360> because<00:00:42.800> we<00:00:43.800> each<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.219> us<00:00:44.610> has<00:00:45.059> our

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
because because we each of us has our

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.529 
because because we each of us has our
own<00:00:45.600> beliefs<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.620> value<00:00:47.100> system<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.510> look

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
own beliefs and value system and we look

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.869 
own beliefs and value system and we look
at<00:00:48.960> what's<00:00:49.289> happening<00:00:49.680> around<00:00:49.860> us<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.579> what's

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
at what's happening around us and what's

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.150 
at what's happening around us and what's
happening<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.420> us<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> world<00:00:52.440> through

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
happening to us and in the world through

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.720 
happening to us and in the world through
the<00:00:53.370> system<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.910> belief<00:00:54.180> system<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.730> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the system of belief system so the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.430 
the system of belief system so the
system<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.329> belief<00:00:57.690> system<00:00:58.170> yes<00:00:58.980> and

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
system of belief system yes and

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.509 
system of belief system yes and
therefore<00:01:01.730> we<00:01:02.730> constantly<00:01:03.239> search<00:01:03.690> for

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
therefore we constantly search for

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.800 
therefore we constantly search for
validation<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:07.070> values<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> beliefs<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> we

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
validation of values and beliefs and we

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.969 
validation of values and beliefs and we
can<00:01:10.080> our<00:01:10.979> brain<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.970> tendency<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
can our brain is tendency to

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.820 
can our brain is tendency to
automatically<00:01:13.979> reject<00:01:14.670> or<00:01:15.140> treat<00:01:16.140> negatively

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
automatically reject or treat negatively

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
automatically reject or treat negatively
everything<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.580> doesn't<00:01:17.759> fit<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.390> our

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
everything that doesn't fit in our

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.280 
everything that doesn't fit in our
belief<00:01:18.930> system<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.150> by<00:01:21.150> asking<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.720> question
