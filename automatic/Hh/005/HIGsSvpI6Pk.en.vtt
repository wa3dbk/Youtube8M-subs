00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
don't forget make sure about the arc has

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.260 
don't forget make sure about the arc has
spawned<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.770> order<00:01:49.980> to<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.160> this<00:01:50.250> glitch<00:01:50.550> so

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
spawned in order to do this glitch so

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.150 
spawned in order to do this glitch so
you<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.600> wanna<00:01:51.840> keep<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.080> walking<00:01:52.440> jump<00:01:52.830> over

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
you just wanna keep on walking jump over

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160 
you just wanna keep on walking jump over
and<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.910> right<00:01:54.120> there<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:54.540> believe

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and that's this right there I believe

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.110 
and that's this right there I believe
hunters<00:01:55.590> are<00:01:55.830> able<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> warlocks<00:01:56.940> as

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
hunters are able to do it warlocks as

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.810 
hunters are able to do it warlocks as
well<00:01:57.300> as<00:01:57.390> Titans<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.870> course<00:01:58.430> I'm<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.640> how<00:01:59.760> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
well as Titans of course I'm not how to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.670 
well as Titans of course I'm not how to
censor<00:02:00.120> them<00:02:00.240> forward<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:00.990> hundreds<00:02:01.470> but<00:02:01.620> i'm

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
censor them forward for hundreds but i'm

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.050 
censor them forward for hundreds but i'm
pretty<00:02:01.830> sure<00:02:01.920> hunters<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:03.030> well

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
pretty sure hunters can do this as well

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.360 
pretty sure hunters can do this as well
the<00:02:03.720> only<00:02:03.960> downside<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.410> that<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.710> need<00:02:05.070> in

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
the only downside is that you need in

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.430 
the only downside is that you need in
armor-piercing<00:02:06.330> round<00:02:06.540> sniper<00:02:06.900> guys<00:02:07.140> i<00:02:07.170> want

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
to do this because any other gun cannot

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.750 
to do this because any other gun cannot
