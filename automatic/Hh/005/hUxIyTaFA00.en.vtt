00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
two LED power brights I decided not to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.060 
two LED power brights I decided not to
go<00:00:16.650> with<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.250> blue<00:00:17.760> because<00:00:18.470> the<00:00:19.470> blue<00:00:19.890> ones

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
go with the blue because the blue ones

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.359 
go with the blue because the blue ones
actually<00:00:20.449> spot<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.750> water<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.590> see

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
actually spot the water and you can see

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.189 
actually spot the water and you can see
areas<00:00:23.789> where<00:00:23.910> there's<00:00:24.090> more<00:00:24.269> blue<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
areas where there's more blue so I

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.980 
areas where there's more blue so I
decided<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.769> go<00:00:25.980> ahead<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.340> just<00:00:26.490> go<00:00:26.670> with<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
decided to go ahead and just go with the

around i also went out and made a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.430 
around i also went out and made a
bracket<00:00:35.280> system<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:36.120> where<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.800> put<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.010> glass

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
bracket system here where I put a glass

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.780 
bracket system here where I put a glass
cut<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> out<00:00:40.649> put<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.040> right<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.309> front<00:00:41.550> so

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
cut it out put it right in front so

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.389 
cut it out put it right in front so

compacts also i actually move the
authentic<00:00:57.920> base<00:00:59.300> had<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.420> slide<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.809> over<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
authentic base had to slide it over a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.609 
authentic base had to slide it over a
little<00:01:01.170> bit<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:02.010> add<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.309> extra<00:01:02.600> 10<00:01:03.600> k<00:01:03.960> LED

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
little bit to add that extra 10 k LED

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.590 
little bit to add that extra 10 k LED
running<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.040> middle<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.519> actually<00:01:06.270> looks

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
ahead and put another power compact

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.640 
ahead and put another power compact
maybe<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> 27<00:01:36.960> wat<00:01:37.909> right<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.409> right<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.439> this

maybe a 27 wat right here right in this
section<00:01:40.979> right<00:01:41.189> here<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:44.130> that's<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.930> just

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
because i want to go ahead and add

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.139 
because i want to go ahead and add
another<00:01:48.890> actinic<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.250> i<00:01:50.490> don't<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
another actinic but i don't want like I

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.510 
another actinic but i don't want like I
said<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> LED<00:01:52.020> picked<00:01:52.710> annex<00:01:53.130> because<00:01:53.369> they

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
said the LED picked annex because they

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.740 
said the LED picked annex because they
spot<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.090> water<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> power

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
spot the water so if I go with the power

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.270 
spot the water so if I go with the power
compacts<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.350> believe<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.649> I'm<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.130> get

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
compacts I believe that I'm going to get

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.480 
compacts I believe that I'm going to get
a<00:01:59.310> more<00:01:59.549> uniformed<00:02:00.149> effect<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:02.009> that's<00:02:02.250> what<00:02:02.460> I

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
a more uniformed effect so that's what I

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.679 
a more uniformed effect so that's what I
did<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:03.290> what<00:02:04.290> I'll<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:05.060> once<00:02:06.060> i<00:02:06.360> install

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
did and what I'll do is once i install

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.620 
did and what I'll do is once i install
it<00:02:06.899> and

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
it and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.270 
it and
I'll<00:02:07.719> shoot<00:02:08.200> another<00:02:08.410> video<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:08.950> can<00:02:09.009> see

here with this cable it's the only way
to<00:02:18.069> run<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:18.700> can<00:02:18.790> either<00:02:18.910> run<00:02:19.150> it

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
to run it you can either run it

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.900 
to run it you can either run it
underneath<00:02:19.599> or<00:02:20.050> over<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.910> actually

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
underneath or over it I actually

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.240 
underneath or over it I actually
insulated<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.959> I<00:02:23.110> mean<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.380> can<00:02:23.560> tell<00:02:23.830> but<00:02:24.190> I

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
insulated it I mean you can tell but I

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.009 
insulated it I mean you can tell but I
insulated<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:24.910> wire<00:02:25.120> with<00:02:25.500> silicone<00:02:26.500> tubing

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
insulated the wire with silicone tubing

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.089 
insulated the wire with silicone tubing
so<00:02:29.019> it's<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:30.030> 100-percent<00:02:31.030> heat<00:02:31.239> resistant

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
so it's a 100-percent heat resistant

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.250 
so it's a 100-percent heat resistant
nothing's<00:02:33.099> going<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.280> happen<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.730> cable

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
nothing's going to happen to the cable

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.800 
nothing's going to happen to the cable
so<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:36.370> actually<00:02:36.519> runs<00:02:36.940> down<00:02:37.209> over<00:02:37.510> here

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
so and it actually runs down over here

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.320 
so and it actually runs down over here
the<00:02:38.319> hood<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.680> still<00:02:38.920> accessible<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.180> get

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
the hood is still accessible so you get

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.080 
the hood is still accessible so you get
open<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.870> close<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.349> hood<00:02:41.580> that's<00:02:42.580> perfect

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
open and close the hood that's perfect

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.839 
open and close the hood that's perfect
and<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:45.040> what<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.250> do<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.640> said

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
and and this is what I do like I said

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.210 
and and this is what I do like I said
with<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.060> glass<00:02:46.319> just<00:02:47.319> used<00:02:47.590> egg<00:02:47.860> crate

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
with the glass just used egg crate

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.520 
with the glass just used egg crate
silicone<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.150> it's<00:02:49.660> pretty<00:02:49.870> good<00:02:50.080> so

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
silicone and it's pretty good so

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.460 
silicone and it's pretty good so
whenever<00:02:50.769> anything<00:02:51.130> splashes<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:53.380> know

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
whenever anything splashes it you know

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.000 
whenever anything splashes it you know
stage<00:02:53.860> right<00:02:53.890> there<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.730> that's<00:02:55.480> my<00:02:55.720> hood

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.740 

that's<00:03:00.010> really<00:03:00.280> about<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.849> mean<00:03:01.060> I'll<00:03:01.390> go

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
that's really about it I mean I'll go

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.210 
that's really about it I mean I'll go
ahead<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:01.930> install<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.500> show<00:03:02.829> you<00:03:02.890> guys<00:03:02.980> what

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
ahead and install and show you guys what

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:25.600 
ahead and install and show you guys what
it<00:03:03.310> looks<00:03:03.340> like<00:03:03.640> in<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:03.940> next<00:03:04.060> video<00:03:04.420> okay

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.200 

there<00:03:26.240> you<00:03:26.330> go<00:03:26.420> with<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.600> lights<00:03:26.870> off<00:03:28.180> kind<00:03:29.180> of

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
there you go with the lights off kind of

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:44.090 
there you go with the lights off kind of
looks<00:03:29.450> stock<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.320> it's<00:03:31.280> pretty<00:03:31.430> good<00:03:31.720> see

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.970 

ok
