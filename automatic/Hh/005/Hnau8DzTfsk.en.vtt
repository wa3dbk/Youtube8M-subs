light not that heavy from what I thought

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.720 
light not that heavy from what I thought
it<00:03:19.200> would<00:03:19.349> be<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:22.560> here<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.909> lens<00:03:24.150> itself

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
it would be so here is the lens itself

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.720 
it would be so here is the lens itself
ultrasonic<00:03:26.730> lens<00:03:27.299> cap<00:03:27.599> right<00:03:27.780> there<00:03:28.730> yeah

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
ultrasonic lens cap right there yeah

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.420 
ultrasonic lens cap right there yeah
pretty<00:03:30.269> small<00:03:30.690> it's<00:03:31.680> not<00:03:31.919> too<00:03:32.250> big<00:03:33.410> if<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:35.069> were

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
pretty small it's not too big if I were

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.819 
pretty small it's not too big if I were
to<00:03:35.579> compare<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.540> 50<00:03:37.290> millimeter<00:03:37.620> f

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
to compare this to the 50 millimeter f

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.210 
to compare this to the 50 millimeter f
1.8<00:03:38.370> I'd<00:03:39.209> say<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:39.900> just<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.650> bit<00:03:40.919> bigger

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
1.8 I'd say that it's just a bit bigger

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.879 
1.8 I'd say that it's just a bit bigger
and<00:03:41.489> bulkier<00:03:42.079> but<00:03:43.079> really<00:03:43.530> it's<00:03:43.650> not<00:03:43.829> that

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
and bulkier but really it's not that

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.509 
and bulkier but really it's not that
