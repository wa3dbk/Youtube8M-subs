00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.600
 so of course we do not just want that 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.130
 cook our delicious dishes 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.040
 but we also want that, of course 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.759
 she learns something we have considered 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.550
 we will add a new rubric 1 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:20.689
 We start cutting today 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.019
 a paprika 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.800
 I start the paprika down first 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.750
 to cut 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.160
 we do not need the core case 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 but we only need the outer 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.129
 I keep the peppers down on one 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.890
 Stand and cut first 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.260
 down around it if only me 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.440
 I have a bit stand 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.739
 knife and cut me the whole 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.840
 core casing that is my paprika 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.699
 bowls are sour 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.180
 you have no loss except for that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.190
 core case and the style 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.190
 we start with the stripes 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.990
 this guide of this leadership 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.500
 finger here is the knife 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.570
 that's your leadership level 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.350
 nothing can ever happen there 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.270
 Be careful that the fingers are looking 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.090
 are folded back and a little bit 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:33.050
 bent forward and then you put that 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:42.290
 knife and cuts slowly down 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:43.990
 and your stripes, in spite of the paprika, you 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.670
 It will certainly not be so in the beginning 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.050
 optimally and evenly gets that 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.660
 but does not matter at all 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.729
 more important is to take care of your fingers 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.550
 because you have none of it if you 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.020
 your fingers off and I have 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.330
 none of this when I'm still behind 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.530
 to hear complain get further still 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.050
 turn over the paprika bowl slowly 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.630
 press down a bit and start 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.729
 fold forward 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.610
 and this finger as mentioned serves as 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.080
 pad as a guide and then 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.200
 slowly strip for stripes 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.810
 distinguish 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.120
 slowly withdraw the fingers and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.350
 always folded so that you even 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.220
 not only in the temptation comes to you 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.840
 to cut in the nails 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.830
 and because it was so nice to do what now 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.239
 the third time 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.239
 but now in my own way 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.969
 so not so hard or 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.870
 next time 's something new 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.870
 See you
