 as to the question of the day how many countries are in a smart 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.290
 19 this is the record 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.260
 we already imagine the discussions because I can change the cede ap 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.199
 i'm going there ap 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.210

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.050
 live on the internet for everyone to enjoy 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.160
 and we can say that it was the fire his evening to the patience she was in

 beer quail in hand on music that is not recognized at its 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.750

 that time in russia to defeat the front real life with gta 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.840
 it happens sometimes when you leave there were no injuries 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.720
 it was quite surprising 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.260
 with the signatures of the day trying to stop a man who owns 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.530
 a parachute 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.670
 not kapalua brard app 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.609

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.760
 what for 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.890
 at the entrance of the famous London store cs word ran out 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.980
 the main thing he wanted to leave a last message of farewell to his direction 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.150
 and to all the passers-by it's us the lenders will not be able all the 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.630
 world 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.640
 we must finish the gf38 sport of the day it is a member of the staff of 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.390
 the american football team the jets of new york i was a little 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.910
 crook-paw neither seen nor known an opposing player 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.410
 l he gets up even more then when we explain what is this 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.410
 protection would be ridiculous that carries this role 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.939
 to start let's talk a bit about what's new in the gaming world 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.790
 we already know the wii to play without the kinect buttons to play without 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:16.340
 controller 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.860
 and sega launches a new game called every athlete the goal of the game 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.570
 it is to target the small target to make a maximum of points 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.110
 the idea being to place this machine in the toilets of bars and 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.630
 restaurants so quote people go to the Elysee inevitably have delays 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.890
 of an hour they will become at the gaming table as usual 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.890
 jerked me james 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:42.779
 vim 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.969
 when we first make an agreement 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.739
 the report as a Christian conservative 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.409
 leader 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.989
 you continue with an American who is not quiet in the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.790
 life they suspect the delivery company ups of bollée 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.620
 this policy to find that 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.549
 he adopted a very ingenious system getting himself down a 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.860
 collar taking care to place inside an alarm that snaps 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.819
 when the package is open 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.719
 after rather juicy beginnings since it took only ten minutes to 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.189
 a psg employee takes a look in the package 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:24.789
 thus setting the bar 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:26.849
 it's a super pro thumb to nature 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.279
 a small sign will not leave 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:32.279
 the party not what to do 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.419
 more than three hits of the head and then these amounts technology vehicle the package 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.790
 to understand to the kidnappers who is lying on the table at the nice fifa 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.999
 not one team on the ground 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.719
 I am happy 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:47.639
 a monster 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.639
 the Olympic I do not see 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.059
 this fall
