00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:10.709
 I sometimes miss a mandatory offer 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.699
 Munich dpa 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.699
 I have weapons away percent 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.759
 for me is open 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.929
 A 900 rent-smart German viewer will be under control nine months too 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.170
 "Software as the night only my place in the marathon 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.260
 ice-cold menu 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.650
 To be the law like that I do not want to be with you now but about the money 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.620
 talk 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.460
 The way most people come to do this week 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.389
 not every pore and dolci are now one up 

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:51.279
 No, I give German and over the goal topic number one maybe even if 

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:53.580
 it turned up in a few facts 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.470
 Published by a lot of Videos One as well as the braid of people 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.050
 and about these facts like many German lives and that Evelyn herself 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.989
 new 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.750
 at Black from the so-called Borba matches 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.510
 he offered himself money earned percent are four different game forms Ulysses 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.450
 then percent go more than in September but just a ball just wanted 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.240
 times must hold stop finds on 9 Google wants Michel you have to stop again 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240
 satisfied with velvet new 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.760
 and percent 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.050
 that in turn is very interesting and interesting to me 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.290
 in the end shows on the winner 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.240
 So all applicants get the money and on 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.700
 The first three are not money and the last three are not and I want that too 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.380
 again are very very close 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.440
 there's longevity in normal mode, Ganser told us 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.230
 and another 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.810
 Where I get it Keller where you just everyone has the same 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.810
 Barcode changed after a while as the alertness 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.060
 Well 40 that Sarah Wagner Magical I was very curious you pay that 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.250
 earn money 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.220
 the task was confirmed to the Pope or percent percent the facts 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.770
 tell there is no command a security guard to escape 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.689
 who have no comments Mio and i said i and world expanded because he is so with 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.170
 many connections 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.610
 and there is no slogan 'power so you can get out of the gun licenses 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.420
 make baroque makes you notice anyway i do not like to give 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.259
 and I am very horny because then there are not these people 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:27.309
 which is just if this recommends the UNEP and just put it all way 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30.609
 And anyway, nothing Köllerer you can actually be so proud of it 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.399
 the summer hole 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:38.999
 yes, because the times of new lawsuit of the Flesh there was reduced so if you 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.619
 that's very difficult to manage 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.229
 everything stays as long as Flash normally 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.559
 What I do not know now when I usually say it 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.269
 itself there everything later in the game Zabel is finally money 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.090
 can rip off 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.709
 and there is one too 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.000
 illegal weapons 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.029
 quite clear the bad art 74 o'clock to approx 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:02.449
 May be high at home here is finally back in the game and we give 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.669
 us from the euro-countries from the Wetterau 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.749
 his name has recently been added to his name 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.210
 So duty differently explains the goal 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.059
 thought so 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.560
 we take the slogan 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.800
 this time wanted 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.800
 No until the entrance of the ISM work by percent 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:23.759
 whoever wants to be safe wants to get full of Metal Jacket 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.369
 while percent 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.699
 leave the weapon like that 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.049
 she won a year ago 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.469
 So whoever you can be name even the week we know you can 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:37.439
 The Burgdorfer also plans to make complaints on the week 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.449
 you can clearly create Novus 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.149
 and so on and so on then you can still complete your characters 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.950
 even 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.220
 he creates so you can put in the same payments 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.889
 whoever wants to preserve and change blah blah blah blah blah blah blah more i know 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.250
 Unfortunately not where van Gaal was looking for yet 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.250
 Kobe Bryant was the video of almost one percent one 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.459
 to show off her character anyway I had such a little bit of showing 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.929
 and Dr, I am very curious, but there are also again 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:10.899
 Bassenheim negative point called flamethrower essay 

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:14.469
 yes so you can also use his normal assault rifles a flame thrower 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.599
 and if he is really so tingling now we all still know 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.219
 Not 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:23.849
 But you can not say so, so stay there 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.379
 I still do not know anything about it 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:27.290
 should think 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.240
 "I know that I only give them a pure mode 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.230
 should or even like to govern 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.660
 but she has to shoot lovingly for the first time a year before 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.129
 furthermore, Mass will arrive at 11 am at a formal outside 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.599
 that's how I imagine it »by Bayer Whistler, there is no big one now 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.599
 proud drugs 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.400
 That's good for us too 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.449
 Hall first appeared once and Blogger 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.939
 The complex in the present expose you deserve in the game so 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.990
 virtual money you do not have to pay for the online mode 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.240
 Let me tell you that, unfortunately, is also the biggest shit from Philips 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.090
 not a few words have become 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.370
 by Treyarch or Activision 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.870
 they would never do that because he does not have any audio line up games like this 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.439
 a few 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:19.319
 The analogous case of money you deserve to pay money as I said not that 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.320
 what is right or just decisive as you have to buy 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.330
 and how you can even choose it yourself so you can say 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.740
 i am adequate before so if i have such test before 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.139
 Challenges to take the money for it or I tell you 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.680
 that's why i am now too l the challenges are up there 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.979
 to create the hall 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.779
 and all that for me already way really cool, however, Mr. are also time 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.580
 So you can not limit yourself and then someday you do 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.189
 should have done as fast as possible percent 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.169
 In my opinion, I met you all so much for your money 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.819
 cool on the graphic style brings her way something new who but still show more 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.129
 how the zach team will be the later gameplay 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.210
 hear more here is the first departure is quite normal on the counter 

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:04.059
 UNEP at the act 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:08.869
 job-attacke I see so what will probably be shown from ca are no longer there 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:12.849
 Ingenious possibility I would have said I want to have seen everything 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.419
 then one percent 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:15.969
 absolutely normal 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.969
 Round it again effect miracles like Coop Duty 5 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.440
 again there is something driving how far was on the low point two different 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.250
 a small and a big one 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.070
 if it's just under 1 3 and so on and so forth I'm curious what's going on there 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.150
 come and remember the car 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.909
 around 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:36.019
 yes I was a bit angry because the game is over and I just want to 

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:37.759
 be seen over everything 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.020
 actually already talked about everything but we are already waiting 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:45.839
 case-studies on the Wheel of Fortune turn off ticked off 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:50.229
 Characters Year yes that comes sometimes to money as I said he has to 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.979
 then through various shell Eni I earn, I guess 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.930
 that will be so that even at the beginning ripp bit of state money available 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.580
 have to buy them soon the first few weeks or essays and so on 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.669
 I'm curious 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:05.090
 how this will all turn out "as Oskar is openly denied 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.699
 off there 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.969
 19 eleven did not generate costs at the 11 people 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:10.309
 I would also have politics
