00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.220 
we're here with the micro sampler and

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.530 
we're here with the micro sampler and
what<00:00:09.430> i'm<00:00:09.519> going<00:00:09.550> to<00:00:09.670> show<00:00:09.820> you<00:00:09.850> today<00:00:09.940> is<00:00:10.450> how

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
what i'm going to show you today is how

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.990 
what i'm going to show you today is how
to<00:00:11.110> sample<00:00:11.470> a<00:00:11.680> drum<00:00:12.010> kit<00:00:12.040> into<00:00:12.520> the<00:00:12.700> micro

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
to sample a drum kit into the micro

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.380 
to sample a drum kit into the micro
sampler<00:00:13.420> and<00:00:13.570> to<00:00:14.050> do<00:00:14.170> that<00:00:15.090> we're<00:00:16.090> going<00:00:16.270> to

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
sampler and to do that we're going to

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.029 
sampler and to do that we're going to
use<00:00:16.480> drum<00:00:16.750> sounds<00:00:17.170> in<00:00:17.320> this<00:00:17.500> wonderful<00:00:17.949> little

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
use drum sounds in this wonderful little

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.270 
use drum sounds in this wonderful little
chaos<00:00:18.430> later<00:00:18.700> so<00:00:19.090> let's<00:00:19.870> get<00:00:20.020> into<00:00:20.080> it<00:00:20.289> will

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.280 
chaos later so let's get into it will

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.220 
chaos later so let's get into it will
combine<00:00:21.670> them<00:00:21.880> onto<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.330> micro<00:00:22.690> sampler<00:00:23.050> so

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
combine them onto the micro sampler so

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.990 
combine them onto the micro sampler so
we<00:00:23.350> can<00:00:23.470> play<00:00:23.650> them<00:00:23.860> polyphonic<00:00:24.550> lee<00:00:24.670> whenever

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
we can play them polyphonic lee whenever

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.510 
we can play them polyphonic lee whenever
we<00:00:25.180> want<00:00:25.390> now<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.500> way<00:00:26.619> to<00:00:26.680> do<00:00:26.860> this<00:00:27.010> is<00:00:27.070> to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
we want now the way to do this is to
