I'm continually asked it's when do I
hear<00:00:35.230> down<00:00:35.469> and<00:00:35.770> what<00:00:36.250> should<00:00:36.460> i<00:00:36.550> air<00:00:36.760> down<00:00:37.059> to

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:37.359 
hear down and what should i air down to

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.779 
hear down and what should i air down to
that's<00:00:37.809> two<00:00:38.109> questions<00:00:38.260> genius<00:00:39.069> I<00:00:39.280> also<00:00:39.429> want

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
that's two questions genius I also want

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.520 
that's two questions genius I also want
to<00:00:39.879> know<00:00:40.030> what<00:00:40.420> type<00:00:40.659> of<00:00:40.690> trails<00:00:41.109> isn't

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
to know what type of trails isn't

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.559 
to know what type of trails isn't
necessary<00:00:41.980> to<00:00:42.129> even<00:00:42.249> air<00:00:42.489> down<00:00:42.699> on<00:00:42.969> make<00:00:43.539> it

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:43.569 
necessary to even air down on make it

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:51.719 
necessary to even air down on make it
three<00:00:48.239> now<00:00:49.239> there's<00:00:49.479> a<00:00:49.539> maximum<00:00:50.440> psi<00:00:51.190> rating

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:51.729 
three now there's a maximum psi rating

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:53.610 
three now there's a maximum psi rating
that's<00:00:52.149> written<00:00:52.479> right<00:00:52.629> on<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:53.050> sidewall<00:00:53.589> of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
the tire now just because it says 50 psi

on the sidewall of this tire that

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:00.149 
on the sidewall of this tire that
doesn't<00:00:58.899> mean<00:00:59.079> that's<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.409> pressure<00:00:59.739> that<00:01:00.039> we

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
doesn't mean that's the pressure that we

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.189 
doesn't mean that's the pressure that we
want<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.429> run<00:01:00.609> our<00:01:00.760> tires<00:01:01.030> at<00:01:01.329> that's<00:01:01.929> the

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
want to run our tires at that's the

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.410 
want to run our tires at that's the
maximum<00:01:02.859> pressure<00:01:03.159> that<00:01:03.639> we<00:01:03.760> should<00:01:03.999> put<00:01:04.239> in

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
maximum pressure that we should put in

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.899 
maximum pressure that we should put in
this<00:01:04.600> tire<00:01:05.070> hey<00:01:06.070> do<00:01:06.370> you<00:01:06.460> have<00:01:06.549> anything<00:01:06.790> to

about<00:01:51.140> air<00:01:51.380> in<00:01:51.500> these<00:01:51.590> tires<00:01:51.649> down<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.189> little

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
about air in these tires down a little

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.510 
about air in these tires down a little
bit<00:01:52.460> in<00:01:52.549> some<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.880> benefits<00:01:54.280> number<00:01:55.280> one

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
you better traction in the mud on the

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:01.840 
you better traction in the mud on the
rocks

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
rocks

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.850
