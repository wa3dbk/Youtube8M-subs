00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.590
 the staff of the standing fest came to confer the 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.360
 Sao Paulo fashion week 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.340
 we talk confectioners and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.900
 personalities of the fashion world who 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.020
 Let's tell you what are the main 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.020
 bets for summer 2014 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.040
 My God, there are so many things that stop me. 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.720
 to ask about trend I swear 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.750
 that I 'm like this knows that noise of 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.100
 crickets 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.550
 but I think white for summer is 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.550
 always good 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.469
 a trend that is looking very 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.239
 that I'm betting well is this thing of the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.930
 cleaner modeling and modeling more 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.780
 which has a very asymmetric cut 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.570
 then without much picture with the placed 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.770
 I think it's a new sex, yes, the sexy one. 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.770
 chic can be said 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.780
 black and white is cool because it's a 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.010
 classic female clothing wardrobe then 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.240
 You can invest this season. 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.240
 because it will continue 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.790
 I think the very cause that in the 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.950
 truth neither like but never trend 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.050
 because for me it has become a classic but 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.820
 she is super present in summer 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.680
 However, the lists are 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.030
 horizontally and practices that have 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.460
 be very careful because the vertical ones 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.260
 they must behave vertically in the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.000
 body and the horizontal ones are not so good 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.009
 for those who are overweight but it is a 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.540
 tendency that we are seeing things there 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.000
 but nautical 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.640
 I think it's very nautical, it 's cute. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.380
 It provides the nautical combines both right of 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.410
 buy once in a lifetime and use forever 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.030
 It's a classic never goes out of style and I'm 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.399
 really enjoying seeing things in his blazer 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.149
 to wear without a bra in Tokyo with just the button 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.039
 so you have to be careful but it 's beautiful and 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.600
 painted blue and red also 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.520
 together with snow white is 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.350
 complete is a very sophisticated look I 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.350
 I think I'll bet on it will provide 2014 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.680
 and you in conference will bet on 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.680
 general
