is<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.590> make<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.740> lighter<00:01:31.010> version<00:01:31.490> of<00:01:32.050> the

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
is to make a lighter version of the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.990 
is to make a lighter version of the
standard<00:01:33.410> version<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:33.860> shoe<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.340> they've

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
standard version of the shoe and they've

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.760 
standard version of the shoe and they've
done<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.660> standard<00:01:35.960> version<00:01:36.230> of<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.380> LZ

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
done that the standard version of the LZ

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.920 
done that the standard version of the LZ
weighs<00:01:37.190> in<00:01:37.550> has<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.060> listed<00:01:38.420> weight<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.750> 8

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
weighs in has a listed weight of 8

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.720 
weighs in has a listed weight of 8
ounces<00:01:39.350> where<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.040> listed<00:01:40.340> weight<00:01:40.460> for<00:01:40.640> the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
ounces where the listed weight for the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.600 
ounces where the listed weight for the
LZ<00:01:40.880> SL<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.660> seven<00:01:42.050> point<00:01:42.200> three<00:01:42.320> ounces<00:01:42.490> so<00:01:43.490> it

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
LZ SL is seven point three ounces so it

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.660 
LZ SL is seven point three ounces so it
shaves<00:01:43.820> off<00:01:43.970> just<00:01:44.270> about<00:01:44.480> 0.7<00:01:45.200> ounces<00:01:45.670> which

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
shaves off just about 0.7 ounces which

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.730 
shaves off just about 0.7 ounces which
is<00:01:46.700> not<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.000> lot<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.300> weight<00:01:47.650> especially<00:01:48.650> when

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
is not a lot of weight especially when

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.050 
is not a lot of weight especially when
you're<00:01:48.830> going<00:01:48.890> from<00:01:49.070> a<00:01:49.310> shoe<00:01:49.520> that's<00:01:49.700> already

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
you're going from a shoe that's already

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.570 
you're going from a shoe that's already
light<00:01:50.270> like<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.720> predator<00:01:51.050> LZ<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:52.340> I'm<00:01:52.430> not

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
light like the predator LZ so I'm not

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.890 
light like the predator LZ so I'm not
entirely<00:01:52.760> sure<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.240> there's<00:01:53.480> a<00:01:53.570> huge

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
entirely sure that there's a huge

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.930 
entirely sure that there's a huge
difference<00:01:54.260> as<00:01:54.380> far<00:01:54.410> as<00:01:54.760> noticeable<00:01:55.760> amount

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
difference as far as noticeable amount

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.970 
difference as far as noticeable amount
of<00:01:56.150> weight<00:01:56.330> change<00:01:56.630> between<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.110> two<00:01:57.290> but<00:01:57.860> it

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
of weight change between the two but it

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.170 
of weight change between the two but it
is<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.130> little<00:01:58.460> bit<00:01:58.550> lighter<00:01:58.730> I'll<00:01:58.910> give<00:01:59.090> it

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
is a little bit lighter I'll give it

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.290 
is a little bit lighter I'll give it
that<00:01:59.330> for<00:01:59.510> sure<00:01:59.630> and<00:02:00.370> as<00:02:01.370> you<00:02:01.760> can<00:02:01.850> see<00:02:01.910> this<00:02:02.120> is

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
that for sure and as you can see this is

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.520 
that for sure and as you can see this is
a<00:02:02.330> completely<00:02:02.840> different<00:02:02.990> shoe<00:02:03.230> from<00:02:03.410> the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
a completely different shoe from the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.830 
a completely different shoe from the
standard<00:02:03.830> predator<00:02:04.160> LZ<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:05.060> upper<00:02:05.300> itself<00:02:05.660> is

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
standard predator LZ the upper itself is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.510 
standard predator LZ the upper itself is
no<00:02:05.990> not<00:02:06.260> that<00:02:06.470> synthetic<00:02:06.770> leather<00:02:07.190> that<00:02:07.430> we

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
no not that synthetic leather that we

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.789 
no not that synthetic leather that we
see<00:02:07.670> on<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.880> LZ<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.509> it's<00:02:09.079> actually<00:02:09.409> a<00:02:09.439> single

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
see on the LZ and it's actually a single

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.110 
see on the LZ and it's actually a single
layer<00:02:09.950> sprint<00:02:10.280> skin<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.609> exact<00:02:10.939> same

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
layer sprint skin the exact same

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.250 
layer sprint skin the exact same
synthetic<00:02:11.599> used<00:02:11.840> on

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
synthetic used on

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.030 
synthetic used on
zero<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.540> like<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.659> slightly<00:02:15.080> ie0<00:02:15.470> it's<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.830> very

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
zero and like I slightly ie0 it's a very

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.009 
zero and like I slightly ie0 it's a very
thin<00:02:16.250> synthetic<00:02:16.790> there's<00:02:17.390> not<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.540> whole<00:02:17.810> lot

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
thin synthetic there's not a whole lot

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.410 
thin synthetic there's not a whole lot
to<00:02:18.049> it<00:02:18.379> but<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.489> overall<00:02:19.790> shape<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.239> shoe

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
to it but the overall shape of the shoe

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.059 
to it but the overall shape of the shoe
appears<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.840> be<00:02:20.959> very<00:02:21.379> similar<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:22.010> the

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
appears to be very similar to the

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.160 
appears to be very similar to the
standard<00:02:22.250> LZ<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:23.360> keep<00:02:23.659> in<00:02:23.750> mind<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.989> fits

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
standard LZ so keep in mind the fits

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.809 
standard LZ so keep in mind the fits
gonna<00:02:24.349> be<00:02:24.470> similar<00:02:24.709> as<00:02:24.950> well<00:02:25.129> you're<00:02:25.670> also

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
gonna be similar as well you're also

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.130 
gonna be similar as well you're also
gonna<00:02:26.000> notice<00:02:26.209> oh<00:02:26.239> you<00:02:26.330> have<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.540> same<00:02:26.750> exact

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
gonna notice oh you have the same exact

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.190 
gonna notice oh you have the same exact
liner<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:28.250> heel<00:02:28.640> liner<00:02:28.879> as<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.420> standard<00:02:29.930> LZ

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
liner a heel liner as the standard LZ

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.780 
liner a heel liner as the standard LZ
which<00:02:30.379> is<00:02:30.530> nice<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> shoe<00:02:31.129> should<00:02:31.549> fit

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
which is nice so the shoe should fit

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.490 
which is nice so the shoe should fit
comfortably<00:02:32.120> even<00:02:32.480> though<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.260> has<00:02:33.470> a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
comfortably even though that has a

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.039 
comfortably even though that has a
stripped<00:02:34.340> down<00:02:34.400> upper<00:02:34.970> as<00:02:35.420> far<00:02:35.660> as<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.870> lethal

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
stripped down upper as far as the lethal

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.420 
stripped down upper as far as the lethal
zones<00:02:36.410> which<00:02:36.590> are<00:02:36.709> pretty<00:02:36.890> much<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.280> most

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
zones which are pretty much the most

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.640 
zones which are pretty much the most
important<00:02:38.030> part<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.390> shoe<00:02:38.599> or<00:02:38.840> real<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
whole really the reason for all the hype

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.240 
whole really the reason for all the hype
behind<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.650> LZ<00:02:42.980> release<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.950> what's<00:02:45.950> strange

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
behind the LZ release and what's strange

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.460 
behind the LZ release and what's strange
about<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.549> SL<00:02:46.879> version<00:02:46.910> is<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.989> kind<00:02:48.349> of

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
about the SL version is it it kind of

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.640 
about the SL version is it it kind of
thumbs<00:02:49.220> down<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.730> lethal<00:02:49.940> zones<00:02:50.299> a<00:02:50.629> lot<00:02:51.379> it's

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
thumbs down the lethal zones a lot it's

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.220 
thumbs down the lethal zones a lot it's
almost<00:02:52.129> like<00:02:52.310> they're<00:02:52.459> not<00:02:52.579> even<00:02:52.640> there<00:02:52.879> if<00:02:53.480> we

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
almost like they're not even there if we

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.660 
almost like they're not even there if we
start<00:02:54.440> with<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.620> past<00:02:54.950> pad<00:02:55.190> here<00:02:55.430> there's

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
start with the past pad here there's

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.550 
start with the past pad here there's
actually<00:02:56.120> it's<00:02:56.299> outlined<00:02:56.750> but<00:02:57.260> there's<00:02:57.440> no

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
actually it's outlined but there's no

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.199 
actually it's outlined but there's no
actual<00:02:57.799> padding<00:02:58.340> here<00:02:58.489> it's<00:02:58.640> just<00:02:58.790> completely

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
actual padding here it's just completely

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.789 
actual padding here it's just completely
thinned<00:02:59.540> out<00:02:59.720> there's<00:03:00.260> nothing<00:03:00.530> there<00:03:00.680> it's

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
thinned out there's nothing there it's

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.319 
thinned out there's nothing there it's
just<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.160> straight<00:03:01.609> sprint<00:03:01.940> skin<00:03:02.150> all<00:03:02.269> the

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
just that straight sprint skin all the

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.030 
just that straight sprint skin all the
way<00:03:02.420> through<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.140> it<00:03:03.200> even<00:03:03.410> have<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:03.709> outline

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
way through so it even have that outline

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.039 
way through so it even have that outline
there<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:04.400> kind<00:03:04.609> of<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:05.000> little<00:03:05.660> bit<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:05.989> a

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
there it's kind of a little bit of a

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.210 
there it's kind of a little bit of a
tease<00:03:06.290> simply<00:03:06.650> because<00:03:06.920> there's<00:03:07.040> not

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
tease simply because there's not

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.069 
tease simply because there's not
actually<00:03:07.459> anything<00:03:07.849> there<00:03:08.180> if<00:03:08.690> we<00:03:08.780> go<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:08.959> the

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
actually anything there if we go to the

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.839 
actually anything there if we go to the
sweet<00:03:09.290> spot<00:03:09.530> here<00:03:09.799> it<00:03:10.190> doesn't<00:03:10.459> even<00:03:10.579> appear

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
sweet spot here it doesn't even appear

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.190 
sweet spot here it doesn't even appear
to<00:03:10.910> be<00:03:11.000> rubber<00:03:11.299> it<00:03:11.510> seems<00:03:11.720> like<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:11.989> some

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
to be rubber it seems like this some

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.289 
to be rubber it seems like this some
kind<00:03:12.379> of<00:03:12.410> coating<00:03:12.799> it<00:03:13.310> may<00:03:13.579> be<00:03:13.640> rubber<00:03:14.060> but

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
kind of coating it may be rubber but

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.059 
kind of coating it may be rubber but
it's<00:03:14.450> not<00:03:14.599> abrasive<00:03:15.079> or<00:03:15.440> sticky<00:03:15.769> or<00:03:15.890> anything

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
it's not abrasive or sticky or anything

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.620 
it's not abrasive or sticky or anything
like<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:17.030> it's<00:03:17.120> something<00:03:17.239> that's<00:03:17.359> not

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
like that so it's something that's not

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.030 
like that so it's something that's not
really<00:03:17.840> gonna<00:03:18.049> be<00:03:18.139> all<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:18.380> noticeable<00:03:18.769> I

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
really gonna be all that noticeable I

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.710 
really gonna be all that noticeable I
haven't<00:03:19.609> tried<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.910> shoe<00:03:20.060> yet<00:03:20.269> but<00:03:20.450> just<00:03:20.630> from

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
haven't tried the shoe yet but just from

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.750 
haven't tried the shoe yet but just from
feeling<00:03:21.590> that's<00:03:21.889> my<00:03:22.010> hand<00:03:22.250> it's<00:03:22.400> nowhere<00:03:22.579> near

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
feeling that's my hand it's nowhere near

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.720 
feeling that's my hand it's nowhere near
the<00:03:23.180> same<00:03:23.389> as<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.930> standard<00:03:24.200> LZ<00:03:24.919> and<00:03:25.609> then

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
the same as the standard LZ and then

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.860 
the same as the standard LZ and then
you're<00:03:25.819> gonna<00:03:25.910> notice<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.209> your<00:03:26.419> drive<00:03:26.630> zone

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
you're gonna notice that your drive zone

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.620 
you're gonna notice that your drive zone
is<00:03:27.049> significantly<00:03:28.030> thinner<00:03:29.030> rubber<00:03:29.359> I<00:03:29.510> don't

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
is significantly thinner rubber I don't

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.490 
is significantly thinner rubber I don't
know<00:03:29.690> how<00:03:29.750> great<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.019> guys<00:03:30.079> can<00:03:30.260> see<00:03:30.349> it<00:03:30.410> on

know how great you guys can see it on

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.819 
know how great you guys can see it on

my website they really give you an idea
of<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.310> depth<00:03:34.579> of<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.970> striking<00:03:35.720> elements

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
of the depth of the striking elements

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.900 
of the depth of the striking elements
and<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.349> compare<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:36.650> can<00:03:37.190> can<00:03:37.549> compare

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
and you compare that can can compare

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.580 
and you compare that can can compare
those<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.329> pictures<00:03:38.630> of<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.959> standard<00:03:39.290> LZ

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
those to the pictures of the standard LZ

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.409 
those to the pictures of the standard LZ
also<00:03:40.280> on<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.489> website<00:03:40.639> and<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.060> can<00:03:41.180> see<00:03:41.239> the

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
also on the website and you can see the

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.789 
also on the website and you can see the
depth<00:03:41.630> of<00:03:41.840> those<00:03:41.959> striking<00:03:42.230> elements<00:03:42.680> I

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
depth of those striking elements I

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.250 
depth of those striking elements I
really<00:03:43.340> do<00:03:43.459> up<00:03:43.910> close<00:03:44.090> pictures<00:03:44.569> like<00:03:44.810> macro

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
really do up close pictures like macro

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.990 
really do up close pictures like macro
shots<00:03:45.530> where<00:03:46.160> you'll<00:03:46.280> be<00:03:46.370> able<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.639> see<00:03:46.849> the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
shots where you'll be able to see the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.420 
shots where you'll be able to see the
details<00:03:47.359> and<00:03:47.540> these<00:03:47.690> striking<00:03:48.049> elements<00:03:48.440> what

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
details and these striking elements what

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.259 
details and these striking elements what
you<00:03:49.519> probably<00:03:49.760> won't<00:03:49.880> be<00:03:49.970> able<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.120> see

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
you probably won't be able to see

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.640 
you probably won't be able to see
anywhere<00:03:50.540> else<00:03:50.690> online<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.230> again<00:03:51.410> if<00:03:51.530> you're

out there'll be a link in description

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.900 
out there'll be a link in description
right<00:03:54.319> to<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.530> review<00:03:54.620> page<00:03:54.980> for<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.280> but

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
right to the review page for that but

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.280 
right to the review page for that but
again<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.269> rubber<00:03:56.419> elements<00:03:56.720> on<00:03:56.959> here<00:03:57.139> are

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
again the rubber elements on here are

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.819 
again the rubber elements on here are
significantly<00:03:58.569> thinner<00:03:59.569> and<00:04:00.530> they're<00:04:00.709> also

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
significantly thinner and they're also

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.069 
significantly thinner and they're also
not<00:04:01.129> at<00:04:01.340> all<00:04:01.549> as<00:04:01.760> abrasive<00:04:02.090> as<00:04:02.419> the<00:04:02.690> standard

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
not at all as abrasive as the standard

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.500 
not at all as abrasive as the standard
version<00:04:03.500> so<00:04:04.010> interesting<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.239> manes

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
version so interesting that the manes

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.509 
version so interesting that the manes
elements<00:04:06.230> on<00:04:06.379> this<00:04:06.590> shoe<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:07.010> really<00:04:07.250> not<00:04:07.400> the

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
elements on this shoe and really not the

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.970 
elements on this shoe and really not the
same<00:04:07.669> as<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:07.910> LZ<00:04:08.180> at<00:04:08.389> all<00:04:08.709> you're<00:04:09.709> also<00:04:09.829> gonna

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
same as the LZ at all you're also gonna

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.110 
same as the LZ at all you're also gonna
notice<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.400> first<00:04:10.579> touch<00:04:10.760> stone<00:04:10.970> on

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
notice that the first touch stone on

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.059 
notice that the first touch stone on
here<00:04:11.329> significantly<00:04:12.290> thinner<00:04:12.500> elements<00:04:13.010> that

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
here significantly thinner elements that

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.309 
here significantly thinner elements that
barely<00:04:13.459> six<00:04:13.819> off<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.150> shoe<00:04:14.329> at<00:04:14.449> all<00:04:14.629> and<00:04:15.049> again

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
barely six off the shoe at all and again

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.839 
barely six off the shoe at all and again
the<00:04:15.440> rubber<00:04:15.620> is<00:04:15.829> really<00:04:16.130> not<00:04:16.280> grippy<00:04:16.699> or

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
the rubber is really not grippy or

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.089 
the rubber is really not grippy or
sticky<00:04:17.299> at<00:04:17.449> all<00:04:17.479> which<00:04:18.349> again<00:04:18.560> somewhat

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
sticky at all which again somewhat

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.520 
sticky at all which again somewhat
strange<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.329> me<00:04:20.450> especially<00:04:20.840> where<00:04:21.200> he<00:04:21.349> lives

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
strange to me especially where he lives

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.890 
strange to me especially where he lives
based<00:04:21.769> all<00:04:22.039> around<00:04:22.310> this<00:04:22.490> kind<00:04:22.729> of<00:04:22.940> grip<00:04:23.690> and

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
based all around this kind of grip and

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.050 
based all around this kind of grip and
control<00:04:24.159> that<00:04:25.159> they've<00:04:25.280> kind<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:25.550> marketed

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
control that they've kind of marketed

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.820 
control that they've kind of marketed
the<00:04:26.150> shuai's<00:04:26.600> then<00:04:27.139> also<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.530> dribble

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
the shuai's then also the dribble

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.770

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
as the soleplate goes it's the exact

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.560 
as the soleplate goes it's the exact
