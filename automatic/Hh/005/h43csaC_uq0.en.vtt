00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.439 
and JH mix has um snap quantizing so
when<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> when<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> go<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.500> live<00:00:26.010> record<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.269> right

now my snaps are set to 8 i'm going to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.999 
now my snaps are set to 8 i'm going to
change<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.330> quarter<00:00:30.689> notes<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.109> any<00:00:31.650> note

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
change it to quarter notes and any note

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.680 
change it to quarter notes and any note
i<00:00:32.040> play<00:00:32.430> you're<00:00:32.910> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> perfectly<00:00:33.570> align

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
i play you're going to perfectly align

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.319 
i play you're going to perfectly align
with<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.290> next<00:00:34.559> quarter<00:00:34.920> note<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.300> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
with the next quarter note so this is

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
with the next quarter note so this is
how<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:36.989> song<00:00:37.320> perfectly<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:38.070> time

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
how you get your song perfectly on time

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.650 
how you get your song perfectly on time
so<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.700> super<00:00:39.000> fun<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.270> play<00:00:39.420> back<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.780> game

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.049 

if<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.190> kind<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.250> Miss<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.550> measure

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
if you see I kind of Miss that measure

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.770 
if you see I kind of Miss that measure
so<00:00:48.809> I'm<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:50.239> nudge<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.270> note<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
so I'm going to do is nudge that note a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.110 
so I'm going to do is nudge that note a
little<00:00:52.170> bit<00:00:52.289> backwards<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
little bit backwards so I'm going to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.700 
little bit backwards so I'm going to
change<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.390> direction<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> nudge<00:00:55.440> tool

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
change my direction of the nudge tool

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.590 
change my direction of the nudge tool
the<00:00:55.920> nudge<00:00:56.100> tool<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.610> pushes<00:00:57.030> notes<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.539> i

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the nudge tool just pushes notes so i

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.689 
the nudge tool just pushes notes so i
can<00:00:57.840> push<00:00:58.350> all<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.829> notes<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.219> song<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
can push all the notes of the song to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
can push all the notes of the song to
make<00:00:59.850> room<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.570> chorus<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.140> something<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.649> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
make room for a chorus or something or I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.590 
make room for a chorus or something or I
could<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:01.920> nudge<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.910> note<00:01:03.120> backwards

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
could just nudge that one note backwards

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.329 
could just nudge that one note backwards
a<00:01:03.690> little<00:01:03.750> bit<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.890> I'm<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> nudge<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
a little bit so I'm going to nudge it

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.910 
a little bit so I'm going to nudge it
back<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.140> perfectly<00:01:07.530> aligned

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
back and so now it's perfectly aligned

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.830 
back and so now it's perfectly aligned
with<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> measure<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.270> I'm<00:01:09.540> gonna<00:01:09.689> go<00:01:09.780> ahead

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
with the measure and I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.480 
with the measure and I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:09.930> step<00:01:10.260> record<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.740> note<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.280> step

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and step record a note in and step

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.310 
and step record a note in and step
recording<00:01:12.000> essentially<00:01:12.450> places<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> note

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
recording essentially places a note

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.679 
recording essentially places a note
where<00:01:13.860> your<00:01:14.040> play<00:01:14.220> line<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.240> skipped

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
where your play line is and then skipped

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.749 
where your play line is and then skipped
you<00:01:15.810> ahead<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.439> amount<00:01:16.740> your<00:01:16.890> snap<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.369> set<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
you ahead the amount your snap is set to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.969 
you ahead the amount your snap is set to
so<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.020> create<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> series<00:01:19.799> of

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
so I can do is just create a series of

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.280 
so I can do is just create a series of
eighth<00:01:20.220> notes<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.729> by<00:01:20.939> step<00:01:21.630> recording<00:01:22.140> in

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
eighth notes just by step recording in

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
eighth notes just by step recording in
and<00:01:22.670> just<00:01:23.670> plain<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> bunch<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.360> notes<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.979> for

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and just plain a bunch of notes so for

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
and just plain a bunch of notes so for
the<00:01:26.400> drums<00:01:26.670> what<00:01:26.939> I'm<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.210> use<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the drums what I'm going to use is the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.080 
the drums what I'm going to use is the
drum<00:01:28.170> machine<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.880> essentially<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
drum machine and essentially what the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.539 
drum machine and essentially what the
drum<00:01:30.299> machine<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.079> all<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
drum machine is is all you do is you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.160 
drum machine is is all you do is you

hold the button down

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.770 
hold the button down
and<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> rip<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.610> I've<00:01:36.509> done<00:01:36.750> I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and you get a rip going I've done I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.950 
and you get a rip going I've done I
Drummle<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:39.030> drum<00:01:39.299> loops<00:01:39.509> are<00:01:39.659> always

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
Drummle and these drum loops are always

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
Drummle and these drum loops are always
playing<00:01:40.320> back<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.950> all<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.790> to

playing back and all you have to do to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.219 
playing back and all you have to do to
change<00:01:42.090> your<00:01:42.210> drum<00:01:42.479> loop<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.020> press<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
different button and it plugs into that

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.149 
different button and it plugs into that
drummer<00:01:45.600> you're<00:01:45.930> always<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.530> beat<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.979> you

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
notes triplets so when I step record

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.830 
notes triplets so when I step record
this<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.650> its<00:03:29.100> going<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.610> skip<00:03:30.300> ahead<00:03:30.450> a

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
this in its going to skip ahead a
