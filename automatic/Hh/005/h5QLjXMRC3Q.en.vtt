00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.740 

so<00:01:16.530> far<00:01:16.950> away<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.150> don't<00:01:18.360> fall<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.720> the

so far away and you don't fall in the
whip<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.909> then<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.570> things<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:22.830> go<00:01:23.040> down

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
whip and then have things what go down

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.460 
whip and then have things what go down
and<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.210> steer<00:01:24.509> their<00:01:24.840> cause<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> snake<00:01:25.979> it's

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
and you steer their cause a snake it's

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.609
