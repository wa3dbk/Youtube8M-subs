00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:25.449
 what I want 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:29.770
 that this is very important 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:32.559
 great in couples' lives that I realize 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.350
 day to day and probably all of you 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.660
 that relate they realize this 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.670
 that the difficulty of 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.900
 communication between couples 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.629
 people will sometimes offer their 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.730
 companion or companion is there any 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.579
 situation they are living unpleasant 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.680
 some discomfort some annoyance 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.540
 and usually these 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.909
 people when it offers the other 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.540
 offers in a way sometimes very 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:04.360
 aggressive very very disconnected so 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.759
 sometimes very invasive than another that 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.430
 was when I heard is already very 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.259
 bored no longer wants to talk 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.200
 about the subject and can be a subject 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:17.310
 very pertinent what I'm trying to do 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.659
 warn if you pay attention 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.030
 in three things I'll call it that 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.460
 obviously this is not a rule but it may 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.430
 help when we 're going to communicate someone 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.590
 some fact in the relationship with a person who 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.240
 we have to be careful like this in the 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.250
 moment we are going to communicate 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.230
 preference that is not something 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.600
 who has other people together in 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.159
 when the person arrives and says to his 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.990
 companion started to follow some 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.790
 thing the other does not like and has a 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.600
 series of people with friends other 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.450
 couples 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.820
 so the moment that will speak another 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.190
 important thing is the content of the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.799
 talk right what the people will say 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.110
 to be careful is to offer the 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.080
 another in a way so clear what 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.540
 we are saying so is the content 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.180
 of conversation and another form or something else 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.130
 important is the form of the conversation 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.129
 sometimes the person will say something ready 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.379
 already increased voice is already screaming already 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.860
 is angry any of these three 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.840
 things that I put to you if 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.120
 out of focus the person who is 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.099
 listening will lose interest in 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.750
 hear what is being said 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.019
 so this is very important so 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.659
 because the couples fight to discuss and 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.580
 sometimes they are separated by things that 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.380
 they are small but they are very poor 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.040
 conducted on a daily basis 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.220
 an example is your combined with the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.490
 my girlfriend to go to the movies with 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.230
 her eight at night I get to pick up there 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.560
 at 7 o'clock 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.440
 and then it arrives in there 10 of its difficult 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.730
 I'm in the waiting car, it's already 7 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.700
 when she opens the door if I 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.400
 I was annoyed with these 15 minutes and 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.910
 massive this is time 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.460
 Boxing delayed to look annoying do not have 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.650
 regards to me but was already spoiled 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.430
 The party is, the cinema is gone. 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.410
 movie theaters 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.450
 so details of this nature 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.480
 so the person can tell the other 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.440
 op waiting for the club nor 717 15 I am 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.690
 here in the car 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.090
 the subject matter here may be assaulted 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.890
 and you never told me that this 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.810
 transaction knows I went up to anything 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.410
 of this nature but people generally 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.360
 do not have this capability with this 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.240
 competence to realize the other is 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.860
 January when the person informs 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.860
 thing to another and often it 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.440
 informs you as if it was a charge or 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.680
 so she does not want to hear the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.510
 time to say she is already charging 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.430
 hoping that what he's saying is 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.930
 the other has to agree with her 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.240
 This is very common in 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.980
 also so that the person starts from the 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.250
 assumption that the other did something 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.370
 wrong and she already leaves charging 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.580
 Like that, gums so I agreed. 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.700
 with you and you did not come and another person at 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.130
 sometimes I did not even know the combination or why 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.440
 passed the message on to someone and did not arrive 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.690
 in her left message with the sister that he 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.980
 sent it to her or vice versa so it's 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.190
 very important that people have 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.810
 caution when will they put her 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.060
 for something else that is not 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.760
 liking because it's very easy for us to 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.340
 annoy if it irritates and if yes like 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.170
 relations basically by pauteiro 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.390
 a lot of control desire 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.550
 one wants to rule the other's life then 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.200
 I usually stumble on these things I 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.990
 Sometimes you're walking through a 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.360
 shopping or a sidewalk is in a bar 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.620
 sitting and listening to people close to 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.020
 times speaking louder 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.220
 arguing about things so much 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.260
 stupid 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.889
 Like I left with this outfit. 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.020
 Today I do not like 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.270
 to go out with this clothes that I do not 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.550
 like I remember the day when a 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.379
 person telling me that the woman 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.479
 I used to pack the clothes for him. 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:58.580
 leave the house where the woman buttons and 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.710
 some clothes and her husband did not 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.569
 wanted those clothes put on other clothes 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.779
 that he chose is the best he's stayed 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:08.529
 curious was very very angry and 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:11.900
 ray won because he was not even 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:14.180
 accepting that the clothes she put on 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.999
 you think as it is possible to 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.919
 relationship to have some success when 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:20.689
 the person wants to send a life of the other 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.889
 so this is very important in these 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.090
 communications because sometimes the 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.669
 communications 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.159
 people try to put it in the head of 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.199
 other what they desire what they 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.210
 think is what they want 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.370
 they are not trying to talk to the 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.710
 another to see if the other agrees or 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.139
 not with their opinion then much of the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.629
 relationships have to do with this 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.789
 example another example sometimes 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:47.029
 people are together, I'm dating, they're going 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.800
 and one of the two the woman many 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.710
 times can not be undone with the 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.990
 referral of that relationship because 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.210
 did not feel caressed enough 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.039
 that the guy wanted to fuck her face she did not 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.360
 was excited enough and she 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.129
 do not say anything 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.520
 What will happen this will stay 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:06.529
 inside it and into a 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.120
 Initially she will mistreating the 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.219
 Your partner is going to fight. 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.129
 to annoy you for not bringing 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.759
 here it is clearly from that moment of the 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.009
 relationship 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.389
 so this is a bit of a sense 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.089
 so I wanted to share with you 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:24.370
 about the difficulties that are many 

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:24.370
 relationships between couples
