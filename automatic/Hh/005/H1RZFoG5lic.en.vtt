we<00:00:09.850> have<00:00:10.030> always<00:00:10.210> thought<00:00:10.570> of<00:00:10.630> design<00:00:11.290> as

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
we have always thought of design as

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.270 
we have always thought of design as
being<00:00:12.880> so<00:00:13.240> much<00:00:13.420> more<00:00:13.750> than<00:00:14.050> just<00:00:14.100> the<00:00:15.100> way

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
being so much more than just the way

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.580 
being so much more than just the way
something<00:00:15.580> looks

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.640 

it's<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.400> whole<00:00:20.609> thing<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:22.199> way<00:00:22.349> something

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
it's the whole thing the way something

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.679 
it's the whole thing the way something
actually<00:00:22.949> works<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.849> so<00:00:24.150> many<00:00:24.210> different

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
actually works on so many different

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.730 
actually works on so many different
levels

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.060 

ultimately<00:00:30.740> of<00:00:30.980> course<00:00:31.390> design<00:00:32.390> defines<00:00:33.070> so

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
ultimately of course design defines so

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:46.400 
ultimately of course design defines so
much<00:00:34.430> of<00:00:34.640> our<00:00:34.760> experience

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.510 

I<00:00:46.470> think<00:00:47.250> there<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:48.030> profound<00:00:48.900> and<00:00:49.530> enduring

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
I think there is a profound and enduring

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.380 
I think there is a profound and enduring
beauty<00:00:51.710> in<00:00:52.710> simplicity<00:00:53.329> in<00:00:54.329> clarity<00:00:55.320> in

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
beauty in simplicity in clarity in

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.770 
beauty in simplicity in clarity in
efficiency<00:00:57.390> true<00:00:58.260> simplicity<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:59.850> derived

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
efficiency true simplicity is derived

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.250 
efficiency true simplicity is derived
from<00:01:01.110> so<00:01:01.770> much<00:01:02.040> more<00:01:02.809> than<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> absence

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
from so much more than just the absence

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.190 
from so much more than just the absence
of<00:01:04.800> clutter<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.250> ornamentation<00:01:05.940> it's<00:01:06.900> about

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
of clutter and ornamentation it's about

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.920 
of clutter and ornamentation it's about
bringing<00:01:07.470> order<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.450> complexity

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.219 

ios7<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.860> clear<00:01:17.369> representation<00:01:18.300> of<00:01:19.020> these

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
ios7 is a clear representation of these

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.749 
ios7 is a clear representation of these
goals<00:01:22.399> it<00:01:23.399> has<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:24.180> whole<00:01:24.780> new<00:01:24.810> structure<00:01:25.759> that

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
goals it has a whole new structure that

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.109 
goals it has a whole new structure that
is<00:01:26.910> coherent<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:28.979> applied<00:01:29.460> across

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
is coherent and that is applied across

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:41.870 
is coherent and that is applied across
the<00:01:30.630> entire<00:01:30.960> system

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.810 

we've<00:01:42.420> considered<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.590> tiniest<00:01:44.280> details

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
we've considered the tiniest details

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.679 
we've considered the tiniest details
like<00:01:45.750> refining<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> typography<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:48.509> much

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
like refining the typography to much

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.539 
like refining the typography to much
larger<00:01:48.960> ones<00:01:49.409> by<00:01:49.979> redesigning<00:01:50.670> MB<00:01:51.240> icons<00:01:51.720> and

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
larger ones by redesigning MB icons and

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.249 
larger ones by redesigning MB icons and
developing<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.640> grid<00:01:53.909> system<00:01:54.150> allowed<00:01:55.049> us<00:01:55.229> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
developing a grid system allowed us to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.430 
developing a grid system allowed us to
achieve<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:56.100> much<00:01:56.490> more<00:01:56.520> harmonious

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
achieve a much more harmonious

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.430 
achieve a much more harmonious
relationship<00:01:58.440> between<00:01:58.830> individual<00:01:59.790> elements

we've<00:02:01.440> also<00:02:01.740> incorporated<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.909> whole<00:02:03.360> new

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
we've also incorporated a whole new

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.400 
we've also incorporated a whole new
palette<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.170> colors

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410

distinct functional layers help

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.600 
distinct functional layers help
establish<00:02:13.140> hierarchy<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.280> order<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:19.610> the
