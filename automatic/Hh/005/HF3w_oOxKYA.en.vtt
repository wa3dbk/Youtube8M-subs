00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
both devices do a lot of typing go in

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.150

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.299 
and out the menus etc and let me know
which<00:00:38.610> device<00:00:39.000> they<00:00:39.420> preferred<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:41.190> not

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
which device they preferred so it's not

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
which device they preferred so it's not
really<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.610> scientific<00:00:42.420> kind<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.809> thing<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
it's definitely not going to be just

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.940 
it's definitely not going to be just
because<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> base<00:00:46.680> means

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
because they like that the base means

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.590 
because they like that the base means
you're<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.730> boy<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.510> was
