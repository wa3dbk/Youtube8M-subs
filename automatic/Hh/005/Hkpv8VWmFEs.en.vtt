00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the body I've used it quite roughly so

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
you see the top bezel you know even it

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.349 
you see the top bezel you know even it
from<00:02:56.889> the<00:02:57.010> sides<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.639> would<00:02:57.790> see<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.209> it's

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
from the sides you would see that it's

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.250 
from the sides you would see that it's
really<00:02:58.750> similar<00:02:59.109> to<00:02:59.919> the<00:03:00.099> galaxy<00:03:00.519> s4<00:03:01.139> you<00:03:02.139> know

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
really similar to the galaxy s4 you know

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.629 
really similar to the galaxy s4 you know
I<00:03:02.290> will<00:03:02.500> show<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.799> bottom<00:03:03.129> part<00:03:03.340> as<00:03:03.430> well

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
I will show you the bottom part as well

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.800 
I will show you the bottom part as well
again<00:03:04.389> they<00:03:04.780> look<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.200> similar<00:03:06.480> but<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.569> grand

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
again they look so similar but the grand

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.229 
again they look so similar but the grand
-<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.169> definitely<00:03:08.829> thicker<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.819> it's

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
- is definitely thicker and it's

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.330 
- is definitely thicker and it's
slightly<00:03:10.599> bulkier<00:03:11.290> but<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.620> also<00:03:11.829> provides

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
slightly bulkier but that also provides

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.250 
slightly bulkier but that also provides

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.199 
- being slightly bulkier bigger and
thicker<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:39.040> obviously<00:03:39.489> is<00:03:39.699> little<00:03:40.030> more

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
thicker it obviously is little more

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.300

difficult<00:03:40.269> to<00:03:41.139> be<00:03:41.260> used<00:03:41.470> using<00:03:41.680> just<00:03:42.010> one<00:03:42.280> hand

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
difficult to be used using just one hand

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.789 
difficult to be used using just one hand
whereas<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.299> s4<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:43.900> really<00:03:44.199> slim<00:03:44.470> body

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799

smaller<00:03:45.519> screen<00:03:45.909> size<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.479> really<00:03:47.049> well<00:03:47.829> it's

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
smaller screen size and really well it's

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.309 
smaller screen size and really well it's
thin<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.209> obviously<00:03:49.419> makes<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.109> lot

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
thin so it obviously makes it a lot

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.360 
thin so it obviously makes it a lot
easier<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:50.919> be<00:03:51.129> used<00:03:51.370> using<00:03:51.699> just<00:03:52.090> one<00:03:52.359> hand

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
Android 4.3 the only difference is

so<00:04:26.140> there<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:26.410> literally<00:04:27.100> no<00:04:27.400> difference<00:04:27.430> in

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.930 
so there is literally no difference in
terms<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.530> know<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.800> UI<00:04:29.980> it's<00:04:30.490> it's<00:04:30.790> all

terms of you know the UI it's it's all

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.700 
terms of you know the UI it's it's all
the<00:04:31.120> same<00:04:31.330> you've<00:04:31.660> got<00:04:31.840> widgets<00:04:32.290> you've<00:04:32.530> got

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
the same you've got widgets you've got

shortcuts on the on the lockscreen you
know<00:04:35.590> that's<00:04:35.800> pretty<00:04:36.400> much<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.730> same<00:04:37.000> number

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
know that's pretty much the same number

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.170 
know that's pretty much the same number
of<00:04:37.450> apps<00:04:37.840> pre-installed<00:04:38.500> on<00:04:39.190> both<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:39.610> them

my<00:04:40.510> s4<00:04:40.960> has<00:04:41.170> a<00:04:41.230> little<00:04:41.620> more<00:04:41.830> apps<00:04:42.070> right<00:04:42.340> now

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
my s4 has a little more apps right now

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.890 
my s4 has a little more apps right now
but<00:04:42.790> that's<00:04:42.910> because<00:04:43.060> I've<00:04:43.270> been<00:04:43.420> using<00:04:43.600> it

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
but that's because I've been using it

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.390 
but that's because I've been using it
and<00:04:44.020> I've<00:04:44.140> installed<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.650> bunch<00:04:44.800> of<00:04:44.980> them<00:04:45.190> but

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
and I've installed a bunch of them but

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.160 
and I've installed a bunch of them but
again<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.210> know<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.450> look<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:46.780> feel<00:04:46.960> is

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
again you know the look and feel is

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.800 
again you know the look and feel is
pretty<00:04:47.560> much<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.980> same<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:49.300> if<00:04:49.420> you<00:04:49.510> go<00:04:49.690> ahead

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
pretty much the same but if you go ahead

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.350 
pretty much the same but if you go ahead
and<00:04:50.260> open<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:51.100> notification<00:04:51.790> panel<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.270> you

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
and open the notification panel and you

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.990 
and open the notification panel and you
look<00:04:52.540> at<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.930> radio<00:04:53.500> toggles<00:04:54.010> well<00:04:54.760> it's

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
look at the radio toggles well it's

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.200 
look at the radio toggles well it's
pretty<00:04:55.920> prominent<00:04:56.920> that<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.310> s4<00:04:57.640> has<00:04:57.670> so<00:04:58.060> many

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
pretty prominent that the s4 has so many

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.650 
pretty prominent that the s4 has so many
more<00:04:58.510> features<00:04:58.780> than<00:04:59.290> that<00:04:59.800> of<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.160> grande<00:05:00.400> -

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
more features than that of the grande -

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.850 
more features than that of the grande -
especially<00:05:01.660> you<00:05:01.780> know<00:05:01.870> with<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.110> air<00:05:02.290> gesture

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
especially you know with the air gesture

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.880 
especially you know with the air gesture
the<00:05:03.010> air<00:05:03.190> view<00:05:03.460> sbeam<00:05:03.940> and<00:05:04.120> NFC<00:05:04.360> a<00:05:04.750> smart<00:05:05.620> pause

not present in the grant oh oh and
there's<00:05:10.810> reading<00:05:11.140> mode<00:05:11.320> as<00:05:11.470> well<00:05:12.600> so<00:05:13.600> let's

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
there's reading mode as well so let's

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.060 
there's reading mode as well so let's
just<00:05:14.020> talk<00:05:14.170> about<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.530> camera<00:05:14.740> real<00:05:15.040> quick

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
just talk about the camera real quick

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.490 
just talk about the camera real quick
the<00:05:15.790> grand<00:05:16.000> two<00:05:16.150> has<00:05:16.360> an<00:05:16.480> 8<00:05:16.600> megapixel<00:05:16.870> sensor

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
the grand two has an 8 megapixel sensor

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.680 
the grand two has an 8 megapixel sensor
the<00:05:17.740> s4<00:05:18.160> has<00:05:18.190> a<00:05:18.370> 13<00:05:18.790> megapixel<00:05:18.940> sensor

the s4 has a 13 megapixel sensor

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.840 
the s4 has a 13 megapixel sensor
obviously<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.560> s4<00:05:20.950> takes<00:05:21.190> a<00:05:21.340> lot<00:05:21.580> better

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
obviously the s4 takes a lot better

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.520 
obviously the s4 takes a lot better
pictures<00:05:22.240> than<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.630> grand<00:05:22.870> -<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.320> if<00:05:23.440> you

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
pictures than the grand - and if you

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
grand - now I have a feeling that a lot

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.140 
grand - now I have a feeling that a lot
of<00:05:56.470> people<00:05:56.800> who<00:05:56.890> wanted<00:05:57.310> to<00:05:57.370> buy<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.610> grand<00:05:57.970> -

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
of people who wanted to buy the grand -

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.880 
of people who wanted to buy the grand -
may<00:05:58.390> even<00:05:58.630> start<00:05:58.870> thinking<00:05:59.140> about<00:05:59.410> buying<00:05:59.710> the

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
may even start thinking about buying the

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.680 
may even start thinking about buying the
s4<00:06:00.370> simply<00:06:00.760> because<00:06:01.060> it's<00:06:01.270> it's

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
s4 simply because it's it's

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.780 
s4 simply because it's it's
better-looking<00:06:02.470> it's<00:06:02.710> slimmer<00:06:03.040> and<00:06:03.430> it's

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
better-looking it's slimmer and it's

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.090 
better-looking it's slimmer and it's
more<00:06:04.000> powerful<00:06:04.229> as<00:06:05.229> compared<00:06:05.530> to<00:06:05.560> the<00:06:05.680> grand<00:06:05.919> -

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
more powerful as compared to the grand -

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.590 
more powerful as compared to the grand -
and<00:06:06.280> it's<00:06:06.430> really<00:06:06.640> just<00:06:06.880> a<00:06:07.030> matter<00:06:07.180> of<00:06:07.330> a

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
and it's really just a matter of a

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.980 
and it's really just a matter of a
couple<00:06:07.630> of<00:06:08.080> thousands<00:06:08.770> of<00:06:08.890> rupees<00:06:09.840> that<00:06:10.840> you

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
couple of thousands of rupees that you

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.620 
couple of thousands of rupees that you
know<00:06:11.110> it<00:06:11.560> makes<00:06:11.770> all<00:06:11.950> the<00:06:12.100> difference<00:06:12.330> so<00:06:13.330> the

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
know it makes all the difference so the

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.750 
know it makes all the difference so the
s4<00:06:13.780> again<00:06:14.500> just<00:06:14.800> a<00:06:14.890> better<00:06:15.130> display<00:06:15.520> better

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
s4 again just a better display better

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.600 
s4 again just a better display better
processor<00:06:17.010> everything<00:06:18.010> is<00:06:18.130> really<00:06:18.400> just

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
processor everything is really just

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.400 
processor everything is really just
better<00:06:19.030> except<00:06:19.390> for<00:06:19.510> the<00:06:19.600> screen<00:06:19.840> size<00:06:20.140> which

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
better except for the screen size which

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.370 
better except for the screen size which
the<00:06:20.620> grand<00:06:20.860> -<00:06:21.040> is<00:06:21.250> clearly<00:06:22.240> the<00:06:22.419> winner<00:06:22.600> but

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
the grand - is clearly the winner but

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.490 
the grand - is clearly the winner but
the<00:06:23.440> s4<00:06:23.950> is<00:06:24.190> more<00:06:25.030> expensive<00:06:25.600> than<00:06:26.080> the<00:06:26.260> grand

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
the s4 is more expensive than the grand

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.610 
the s4 is more expensive than the grand
-<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.860> grand<00:06:27.100> -<00:06:27.280> is<00:06:27.460> just<00:06:27.790> at<00:06:28.000> 22,000<00:06:28.900> and<00:06:29.020> the
