00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
button right here it's got a green leaf

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.359 
button right here it's got a green leaf
that's<00:01:03.809> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> light<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.530> blue<00:01:04.860> gas<00:01:05.040> pump

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
so it's really easy to activate you can

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.350 
so it's really easy to activate you can
do<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.400> either<00:01:11.520> while<00:01:11.729> you're<00:01:11.850> driving<00:01:12.240> while

idle<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.439> engine<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> idle<00:01:20.130> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
idle the engine is going to idle a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.800 
idle the engine is going to idle a
little<00:01:20.520> bit<00:01:20.610> lower<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> downshift

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
little bit lower it's going to downshift

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810

clutch to engage sooner and remain
engaged<00:01:37.470> longer<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:38.700> got<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> little

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
engaged longer so it's got a little

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.580 
engaged longer so it's got a little
bunch<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.329> really<00:01:39.450> great<00:01:39.689> features<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.409> might

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
bunch of really great features you might

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.840 
bunch of really great features you might
notice<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.040> little<00:01:41.070> bit<00:01:41.310> different<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.610> way<00:01:41.729> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
notice a little bit different the way it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.280 
notice a little bit different the way it
drives<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.600> extremely

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
drives but it's not extremely

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.830 
drives but it's not extremely
significant<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.820> said<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:45.509> easy

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
significant so like I said really easy

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.620 
significant so like I said really easy
