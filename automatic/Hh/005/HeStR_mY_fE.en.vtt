00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.740
 little hair and I will take that 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.379
 I've done a keratin treatment 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.449
 at home a treatment that has sent me 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.520
 a web page called brazil 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.070
 dotcom beauty 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.320
 he sent so that he managed at home to give me my 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.390
 opinion sent me a treatment of 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.640
 keratin and some other products for 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.320
 I've been trying these hair 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.600
 days as has been advanced by the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.470
 facebook and good today I wanted to 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.320
 give you my opinion of special product 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.580
 that they have sent me is this that I know of the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.260
 brand that gives max 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.739
 This is a complete treatment of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.720
 good keratin for those who do not know 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.980
 that I doubt it because there are a thousand videos of 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.540
 talking about the keratin that is the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.550
 Keratin creatine is a substance 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.440
 that we have in the hair and when 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.420
 we make good because we have it one hundred 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.579
 hundred but as time goes by in 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.070
 land as we go to 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.199
 an age pollution 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.720
 a thousand factors make our hair what 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.430
 but we are losing it then 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.580
 this thing that gives us the frizz 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.100
 Weakness in the hair at the tips 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.220
 open and good those treatments are 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.230
 they try to remove that lack 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.940
 well I do not know if you 've seen a lot 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.820
 of movies me lately repairmen 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.170
 witchcraft treatments of keratin and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.060
 Well, the good thing is that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.470
 work at home gives you more than one 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.990
 occasion and are worth double cheap as logical 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.970
 to me this treatment is good to me 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.140
 least nothing for two occasions in the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.850
 keratin treatments 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.660
 that you have to make them at least last 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.160
 from one to another spent a month to me already by 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.170
 what I saw that I have left I have become one 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.910
 this weekend of illness for 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.770
 other everything depends if you have the hair of 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.110
 the pantoja put was for one if you have 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.970
 the short hair was for three 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.620
 I'm going to leave you precious here 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.120
 because I do not remember very well and 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.250
 I prefer to leave it 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.200
 this good treatment is special for 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.480
 treated hair ie for hair 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.890
 dyed well then on the web I think that 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.810
 you can good bye bye they are already saying to you 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.039
 for what kind of hair cels and then 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.460
 you also have a counselor for 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.800
 ask him and nothing is super super easy 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.440
 doing it gives me a bit of fear this 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.540
 comes consists of four little tubes like this 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.610
 madryn are going numbered I do not know if what 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.800
 you see Friday in this puts two is to say 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.200
 that goes step by step first that is some 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.490
 then another then another to avoid giving in 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.780
 do it for about 45 minutes because 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.300
 some things you do not have to wash the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.239
 hair then flat your treatment but 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.000
 good good results say that I 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.459
 I was quite surprised I did not know it was so 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.540
 good that kind of treatments and not what 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.510
 I say because they are giving me the 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.010
 product is very clear but because the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.020
 effects have been very good ie 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.540
 I usually fall me me much 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.730
 hair and do not always touch everything but very 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.890
 curled here the short hair of that 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.890
 they are doing and well when I 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.830
 note that that treatment had 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.560
 removed very soft hair soft soft 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.420
 smooth soft and good is recommended 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.340
 when you do the treatment 24 o 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.319
 48 hours to wash your hair again and I 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.160
 Well, I washed it today, that is 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.380
 Now, like washing with shampoo 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.810
 always and good I keep noticing the hair more 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.030
 soft, I do not know much more before then 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.819
 I eat tables because I noticed 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.380
 always sometimes when untangling is not 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.959
 ok but in some places scourers 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.200
 I made it a mask but it has not 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.790
 noticed better is to say that good I have 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.680
 to say that the treatments are true 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.690
 at least keratin in me I have 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.290
 gone 13 minutes that have sent me that has 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.629
 been this one 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.780
 an enke oil treatment 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.810
 keratin spray 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.140
 that apart from good apart from giving us a 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.610
 contribution to the hair also works as 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.250
 thermal protector pulls this what 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.780
 we would use on the occasions that is to say 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.520
 this one thing is the treatment of 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.200
 keratin and this when we go 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.819
 washing the hair when it 's like 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.130
 we always do with our shampoos 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.220
 usual this is when we would use 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.140
 this type of product this I have 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.350
 used today that is mediated of the 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.970
 hair and good before I got it a 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.030
 little with the towel and before giving it with 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.470
 the dryer as I have pulverized this 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.989
 by all the hair then I have it 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.760
 massaged well a little and good to tell you 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.740
 that has left my hair very soft 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.320
 it has not greased me that for me that's 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.510
 very very important and good to protect what 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.400
 they did in it I notice it protected but 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.590
 well this is something that you see after 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.900
 of time and finally sent me 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.750
 this product called drop 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.950
 gilthead this is like a serum 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.240
 this is used so he used 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.300
 when more calls out of that chalice 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.600
 hair and has a different tone all 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.050
 well then to close that point indeed 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.720
 a little bit on the fingers on 5 10 and I give myself 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.970
 so in the very small amount not 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.090
 I greased nothing I used yesterday and 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.090
 today 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.380
 I have nothing bad to say about these 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.080
 products at least of those that to me 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.300
 they sent me 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.950
 they are quite economic products that 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.070
 I love that 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.470
 and I have found the 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.500
 I will continue testing if it comes informing in 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.330
 facebook that maybe keeps going but 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.790
 good to tell you how good he is the girl 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.530
 of quotes from the website I know Brazil 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.540
 and beauty I explained a little how it was 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.180
 my hair and the truth that has been successful 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.880
 quite with the girls I hope that you 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.100

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.480
