00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.650
 hello important to win even if 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.920
 that's the most important thing 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.010
 to try to start setting up 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.600
 because we worked 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.030
 training on a situation of 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.530
 tomorrow if it was our first match 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.210
 it's always but two points 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.430
 to play 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.800
 the first game of the season so we 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.930
 start with a victory and above all we 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.230
 worked well on everything we had 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.150
 done they are for example on the stage 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.280
 must all the tactical work we put 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.420
 in place we really could work 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.670
 today with a real opposition 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.559
 a real defense is a real 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.330
 intensity support it's normal that everything 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.710
 not be perfect yet both 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.210
 new days integrate new ones 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.220
 systems of new engagement at 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.290
 integrate the new defensive system 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.960
 so arms all this is coming into place 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.070
 little by little, that's good to have 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.960
 a match situation for after 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.940
 to be able to base ourselves also on our 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.770
 adversary that we are us to 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.000
 workout and pears after 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.830
 work on what has not been 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.020
 we defended well 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.570
 I want a lot of ball rises on 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.460
 had worked a lot that we also 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.320
 physically prepare for to play 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.370
 like that and we saw that it could do that 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.450
 could work well when everyone 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.390
 was has been in his role and apartment 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.850
 just and we apply the instructions 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.260
 works we will try to work 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.150
 still throughout the week to 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.500
 training here to prepare the 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.900
 next game against hull 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.160
 yet we will go up two levels 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.970
 here I think all the matches we 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.640
 will rise in power 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.830
 we will try to do less and less 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.660
 errors as the game progressed 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.370
 and why make another games and for 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.710
 be set up an opposition a 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.010
 little more pitiful with a team 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.979
 of excellence romagné la jérôme fernandez 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.479
 players from confirmed players like 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.430

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.470
 barcelona years rights 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.630
 so then he 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.820
 the work that our cocks that had the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.270
 during these two seasons surely had to 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.160
 so pay in 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.440
