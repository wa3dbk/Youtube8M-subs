pedal board it really changed the way
that<00:00:27.919> I<00:00:28.130> approached<00:00:28.550> my<00:00:28.759> onstage<00:00:29.329> setup<00:00:29.979> for

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:30.979 
that I approached my onstage setup for

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:32.200 
that I approached my onstage setup for
starters<00:00:31.399> I<00:00:31.519> found<00:00:31.729> it's<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:31.939> lot<00:00:32.060> more

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210
