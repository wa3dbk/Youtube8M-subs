self-directed and that they are finding

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.350 
self-directed and that they are finding
something<00:01:17.159> inside<00:01:17.580> themselves<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.180> makes

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
something inside themselves that makes

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
something inside themselves that makes
them<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.020> pursue<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:20.250> their<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.729> their
