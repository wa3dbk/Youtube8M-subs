directly put in a flash memory card
right<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.440> or<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.059> need<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
right here or if you need you can do a

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.270 
right here or if you need you can do a
microsd<00:01:01.859> which<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.120> 32<00:01:03.510> gigs<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
microsd which is up to 32 gigs and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.850 
microsd which is up to 32 gigs and
that's<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.430> nice<00:01:05.580> feature<00:01:06.229> so<00:01:07.229> let's<00:01:07.380> turn<00:01:07.650> this

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that's a nice feature so let's turn this

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.120 
that's a nice feature so let's turn this
on<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.930> one<00:01:10.080> thing<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.350> noticed<00:01:10.500> about<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.950> is

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
on the one thing I noticed about this is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.429 
on the one thing I noticed about this is
that<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.400> startup<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.030> kind<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.390> slow<00:01:12.540> but

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that the startup is kind of slow but

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
that the startup is kind of slow but
with<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> custom<00:01:14.460> rom<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.270> bit

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
with the custom rom it's a little bit

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
with the custom rom it's a little bit
quicker<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.840> takes<00:01:16.049> about<00:01:16.170> 30<00:01:16.530> seconds<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> be

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
quicker it takes about 30 seconds to be

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.300 
quicker it takes about 30 seconds to be
ready<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.130> running<00:01:22.310> cyanogen

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
ready to go this is running cyanogen

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.170 
ready to go this is running cyanogen
which<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> custom<00:01:24.720> rom<00:01:25.220> done<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
which is a custom rom done in the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.929 
which is a custom rom done in the
gingerbread<00:01:27.689> build<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.579> android<00:01:29.579> i<00:01:29.759> was

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
gingerbread build of android i was

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.640 
gingerbread build of android i was
trying<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.210> use<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> honeycomb<00:01:30.869> stuff<00:01:31.320> but

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
trying to use the honeycomb stuff but

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620 
trying to use the honeycomb stuff but
it's<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.280> stable<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:33.000> here<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it's just not stable on here this is a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.789 
it's just not stable on here this is a
dual-core<00:01:34.320> nvidia<00:01:35.040> with<00:01:35.960> 512<00:01:36.960> megabytes<00:01:37.590> of

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
dual-core nvidia with 512 megabytes of

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.569 
dual-core nvidia with 512 megabytes of
ram<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.020> i<00:01:40.020> think<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.220> little

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
ram and i think that it's just a little

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.990 
ram and i think that it's just a little
bit<00:01:41.880> too<00:01:42.090> much<00:01:42.329> task<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:44.250> ask<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.610> run<00:01:44.850> all

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
bit too much task to ask it to run all

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.999 
bit too much task to ask it to run all
the<00:01:45.149> stuff<00:01:45.390> that's<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:46.049> going<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.829> I

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the stuff that's that's going on so I

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.130 
the stuff that's that's going on so I
know<00:01:47.700> there's<00:01:47.939> people<00:01:48.090> still<00:01:48.420> hacking<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
know there's people still hacking it and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.600 
know there's people still hacking it and
trying<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.680> honeycomb<00:01:50.040> stuff<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.460> run

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
trying to get the honeycomb stuff to run

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.039 
trying to get the honeycomb stuff to run
on<00:01:50.729> here<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.140> want<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.649> stable

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
on here but if you want it to be stable

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.370 
on here but if you want it to be stable
this<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> cyanogenmod

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
this is the one to do so the cyanogenmod

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:11.530 
this is the one to do so the cyanogenmod
number<00:01:58.380> seven

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.500 

okay<00:02:12.319> so<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.780> pretty<00:02:15.019> much<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.480> I

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
okay so this is pretty much it so I

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.089 
okay so this is pretty much it so I
bought<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:17.930> with<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.379> intention<00:02:19.010> of

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
bought this with the intention of

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.130 
bought this with the intention of
hacking<00:02:19.459> at<00:02:19.579> putting<00:02:19.849> on<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.030> custom<00:02:20.420> rom<00:02:20.599> the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
hacking at putting on a custom rom the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.610 
hacking at putting on a custom rom the
stuff<00:02:21.379> that<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.620> comes<00:02:21.829> with<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.159> android<00:02:22.790> 2.2

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
stuff that it comes with is android 2.2

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.190 
stuff that it comes with is android 2.2
it's<00:02:24.620> by<00:02:25.069> viewsonic<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.329> it's<00:02:26.689> terrible

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
it's by viewsonic and it's it's terrible

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.720 
it's by viewsonic and it's it's terrible
you<00:02:27.920> should<00:02:28.099> just<00:02:28.250> throw<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.579> away

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
you should just throw that away

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.979 
you should just throw that away
immediately<00:02:30.760> what's<00:02:31.760> basically<00:02:32.569> happening

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
immediately what's basically happening

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.130 
immediately what's basically happening
is<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.680> you're<00:02:33.920> running<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.849> rom<00:02:35.329> that<00:02:35.720> thinks

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
is that you're running a rom that thinks

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.759 
is that you're running a rom that thinks
it's<00:02:36.230> on<00:02:36.439> a<00:02:36.470> phone<00:02:37.840> but<00:02:38.840> it's<00:02:39.049> been<00:02:39.260> kind<00:02:39.680> of

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
it's on a phone but it's been kind of

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.759 
it's on a phone but it's been kind of
hacked<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.459> work<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.599> has<00:02:41.750> my<00:02:41.959> contacts<00:02:42.500> and

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
hacked to work so it has my contacts and

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.940 
hacked to work so it has my contacts and
stuff<00:02:42.859> in<00:02:43.159> here<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:44.150> don't<00:02:44.450> really<00:02:44.950> you

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
stuff in here but you don't really you

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.229 
stuff in here but you don't really you
can't<00:02:46.189> really<00:02:46.250> call<00:02:46.670> out<00:02:47.349> out<00:02:48.349> of<00:02:48.409> this<00:02:48.650> thing

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
can't really call out out of this thing

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.899 
can't really call out out of this thing
there's<00:02:50.239> widgets<00:02:50.659> on<00:02:50.900> here<00:02:51.349> there's<00:02:51.909> all

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
there's widgets on here there's all

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.530 
there's widgets on here there's all
types<00:02:53.569> of<00:02:53.689> apps<00:02:54.430> it's<00:02:55.430> basically<00:02:55.849> for<00:02:56.150> me<00:02:56.269> just

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
types of apps it's basically for me just

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.679 
types of apps it's basically for me just
a<00:02:56.599> PDF<00:02:57.019> reader<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.790> nice<00:02:59.120> thing<00:02:59.329> about<00:02:59.359> it

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
a PDF reader and the nice thing about it

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.349 
a PDF reader and the nice thing about it
is<00:02:59.810> that<00:02:59.840> I<00:03:00.290> don't<00:03:00.349> have<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.849> do<00:03:01.849> any<00:03:02.030> weird

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
is that I don't have to do any weird

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.360 
is that I don't have to do any weird
stuff<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.959> know<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.200> ipad<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.799> basically<00:03:04.159> have

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
stuff I know the ipad you basically have

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.589 
stuff I know the ipad you basically have
to<00:03:05.349> do<00:03:06.349> stuff<00:03:06.650> with<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.159> cloud<00:03:07.700> only<00:03:08.329> there's

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
to do stuff with the cloud only there's

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.199 
to do stuff with the cloud only there's
no<00:03:08.659> file<00:03:09.019> system<00:03:09.500> on<00:03:09.680> there<00:03:09.909> so<00:03:10.909> what<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.030> have

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
no file system on there so what I have

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.039 
no file system on there so what I have
here<00:03:11.239> are<00:03:11.569> some<00:03:11.780> pdfs<00:03:13.450> go<00:03:14.450> ahead<00:03:14.629> and<00:03:14.780> try<00:03:14.959> and

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
here are some pdfs go ahead and try and

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.030 
here are some pdfs go ahead and try and
open<00:03:15.370> open<00:03:16.370> one<00:03:16.579> and<00:03:17.440> all<00:03:18.440> these<00:03:18.650> apps<00:03:18.829> are

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
open open one and all these apps are

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.059 
open open one and all these apps are
free<00:03:19.220> i<00:03:19.310> haven't<00:03:19.549> paid<00:03:19.729> for<00:03:19.940> any<00:03:20.030> apps<00:03:20.239> yet<00:03:20.389> so

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
free i haven't paid for any apps yet so

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.080 
free i haven't paid for any apps yet so
let's<00:03:22.069> see<00:03:22.220> if<00:03:22.310> i<00:03:22.400> can<00:03:22.519> get<00:03:22.579> a<00:03:22.639> better<00:03:22.849> angle

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
let's see if i can get a better angle

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:34.290 
let's see if i can get a better angle
without<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:24.250> fan

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.310 

so<00:03:35.300> this<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.570> all<00:03:35.690> i'm<00:03:35.780> going<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:35.990> use<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.290> for

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
so this is all i'm going to use it for

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.310 
so this is all i'm going to use it for
us<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.860> pdfs<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:38.990> kind<00:03:39.200> of<00:03:39.260> stuff

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
us is pdfs and and that kind of stuff

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:46.150 
us is pdfs and and that kind of stuff
and<00:03:41.200> it's<00:03:42.200> it's<00:03:42.560> pretty<00:03:42.950> nice<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:45.130> of<00:03:46.130> course

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
and it's it's pretty nice and of course

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.700 
and it's it's pretty nice and of course
if<00:03:46.670> you<00:03:46.790> want<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.060> read<00:03:47.210> it<00:03:47.410> you<00:03:48.410> know<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.680> just

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
if you want to read it you know it just

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.690 
if you want to read it you know it just
starts<00:03:49.190> going<00:03:49.280> that<00:03:49.640> way<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:51.590> i've<00:03:51.950> got<00:03:51.980> a

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
starts going that way so i've got a

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.200 
starts going that way so i've got a
really<00:03:53.600> smooth<00:03:54.470> experience<00:03:55.070> with<00:03:55.430> this<00:03:55.580> it's

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
really smooth experience with this it's

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.050 
really smooth experience with this it's
a<00:03:56.360> dual<00:03:56.570> core<00:03:57.460> so<00:03:58.460> that<00:03:58.640> gives<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:58.970> little

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
a dual core so that gives it a little

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.430 
a dual core so that gives it a little
bit<00:03:59.210> better<00:03:59.330> performance<00:03:59.960> than<00:04:00.020> a<00:04:00.140> single

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
bit better performance than a single

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.670 
bit better performance than a single
core<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.880> know<00:04:02.000> chip<00:04:02.390> obviously<00:04:02.930> but<00:04:03.530> this

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
core you know chip obviously but this

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.860 
core you know chip obviously but this
has<00:04:03.830> also<00:04:03.980> been<00:04:04.250> overclocked<00:04:04.730> using<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.330> custom

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
has also been overclocked using a custom

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.520 
has also been overclocked using a custom
corn<00:04:06.440> kernel<00:04:07.070> and<00:04:07.990> usually<00:04:08.990> this<00:04:09.110> thing<00:04:09.320> runs

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
corn kernel and usually this thing runs

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.050 
corn kernel and usually this thing runs
at<00:04:09.680> one<00:04:09.860> gigahertz<00:04:10.160> this<00:04:10.520> is<00:04:10.610> running<00:04:10.850> at<00:04:10.910> one

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
at one gigahertz this is running at one

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.860 
at one gigahertz this is running at one
and<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.240> half<00:04:11.270> so<00:04:11.960> if<00:04:12.140> you<00:04:12.350> test<00:04:12.980> this<00:04:13.250> out<00:04:13.870> it's

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
and a half so if you test this out it's

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.660 
and a half so if you test this out it's
it's<00:04:15.230> blowing<00:04:15.710> away<00:04:15.800> all<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.160> phones<00:04:16.430> in

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
it's blowing away all the phones in

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.199 
it's blowing away all the phones in
performance<00:04:17.270> and<00:04:18.310> it's<00:04:19.310> on<00:04:19.459> par<00:04:19.640> with<00:04:19.700> some<00:04:20.120> of

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
performance and it's on par with some of

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.520 
performance and it's on par with some of
the<00:04:20.270> new<00:04:20.420> stuff<00:04:20.690> that's<00:04:20.900> coming<00:04:21.110> out<00:04:21.290> that

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
the new stuff that's coming out that

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.790 
the new stuff that's coming out that
cost<00:04:21.920> twice<00:04:22.190> as<00:04:22.250> much<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.840> it's<00:04:23.990> nice<00:04:24.140> it's<00:04:24.470> you

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
cost twice as much so it's nice it's you

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.440 
cost twice as much so it's nice it's you
know<00:04:24.890> 260<00:04:25.520> you're<00:04:25.760> getting<00:04:26.060> probably<00:04:26.390> a

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
know 260 you're getting probably a

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.990 
know 260 you're getting probably a
five-hundred-dollar<00:04:27.050> device<00:04:27.820> albeit<00:04:28.820> a

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
five-hundred-dollar device albeit a

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.660 
five-hundred-dollar device albeit a
little<00:04:29.120> bit<00:04:29.750> heavier<00:04:30.110> than<00:04:30.250> then<00:04:31.250> you<00:04:31.520> would

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
little bit heavier than then you would

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.030 
little bit heavier than then you would
be<00:04:32.020> used<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.530> it's<00:04:33.590> not<00:04:33.830> running

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
keyboard that sounds really nice except

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.260 
keyboard that sounds really nice except
for<00:05:06.080> its<00:05:06.320> kind<00:05:06.560> of<00:05:06.650> expensive<00:05:07.160> so<00:05:07.700> at<00:05:08.120> this

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
for its kind of expensive so at this

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.880 
for its kind of expensive so at this
point<00:05:08.480> these<00:05:08.690> are<00:05:08.840> kind<00:05:09.020> of<00:05:09.050> like<00:05:09.200> toys<00:05:09.500> to<00:05:09.770> me

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.640 
i don't have to worry about it crashing
my<00:07:02.780> phone<00:07:03.340> if<00:07:04.340> the<00:07:04.820> ROM<00:07:05.060> or<00:07:05.750> anything<00:07:06.229> goes<00:07:06.380> bad

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650 
my phone if the ROM or anything goes bad

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.550 
my phone if the ROM or anything goes bad
there's<00:07:06.950> backups<00:07:07.460> and<00:07:07.820> all<00:07:08.660> that<00:07:08.810> fun<00:07:08.990> stuff<00:07:09.050> I

think<00:07:10.250> the<00:07:10.340> best<00:07:10.550> thing<00:07:10.669> though<00:07:11.060> is<00:07:11.210> is

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.390 
think the best thing though is is

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.630 
think the best thing though is is
Twitter<00:07:11.840> on<00:07:12.020> here<00:07:12.229> is<00:07:12.320> much<00:07:12.680> easier<00:07:12.710> than<00:07:13.160> then

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.640 
Twitter on here is much easier than then

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.130 
Twitter on here is much easier than then
on<00:07:13.760> the<00:07:13.880> phone<00:07:14.120> it's<00:07:14.990> it's<00:07:15.350> just<00:07:15.620> really<00:07:15.950> easy
