00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.970
 mailbox that this package this one had 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.739
 given to a neighbor because I do not 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.089
 it was something that is not like that since I have 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.300
 problems on the intercom that sometimes 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.720
 it stops working and nothing is going to 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.720
 do the unboxing 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.660
 to people who have boxed 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.790

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.300
 it's a great bitch to do it with 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.480
 a hand 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.400

 here we have it gb gtx 560 ti me what 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.870
 I expected smaller the truth is that it's 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.850
 a piece of box 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.850
 well let's see that here 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.460
 How cool is to do it with one hand 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.650
 well here all the references of 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.620

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.750
 the instruction book is going to be the headquarters 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.190
 the cables 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.000

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.260
 I do not know what the fuck is this either 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.680
 I suppose it's for the fans 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.890
 to give power to the fans to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:54.850

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.550
 for that I bring the scissors 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.630

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.710

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.840

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.140

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.430
 two fans so he had two 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.310
 from what I've read out there they say it's 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.690
 Very silent it is very well cooled 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.580

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.689
 mine 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.680
 what is the 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:04.539

 the movement is over 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.860
 was missing a little bit good because that 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.240
 I will try to record airsoft games 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.039

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.039

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:48.380
 a mini video camera recorder 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.210

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.210
 I'll try to put it somewhere 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:10.080
 to record my airsoft games 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.449
 well and I do not know when I do it because 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.240
 lately in summer because we are not 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:17.310
 very willing to go warm playing 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.490
 in the forest, then we go to a field 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.550
 It's from the woods, I do not know when I'm doing 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.310

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.360

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.340
