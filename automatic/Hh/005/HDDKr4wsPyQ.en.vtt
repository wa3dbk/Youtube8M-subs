00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello now i will write for you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.400
 video comparison of two 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.259
 let's say so pretty similar devices 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.780
 this is such a w200i lenovo a830 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.880
 what are they like first so here 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.340
 here we are diagonally 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.680
 screen 5 inches and for the price they 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.660
 plus or minus is the same that is, this one is worth 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.300
 100 people to the level connects the center in 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.240
 total 200 and this phone depends on 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.800
 configuration, too, plus or minus there 180 90 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.489
 up to 200 dollars that is how would he 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.920
 comes here and so basically like in 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.500
 what is the difference between them 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.450
 the difference is that this information 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.520
 will be useful for those who want to choose 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.300
 or is it five or taking this 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.800
 five that is outwardly as though well outside 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.090
 here and so you can see how they differ 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.190
 Ie dx or we have this 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.149
 stylish dark screen which actually 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.809
 merges with the top of the bottom 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.120
 phone 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.700
 but the field is a little different 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.869
 there is a screen more rounded forms that is 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.930
 they rested with us more 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.040
 rectangular for but we have more 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.600
 rounded here logo checks here 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.420
 standard buttons that are 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.570
 there is a vice on all devices 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.920
 lenovo 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.290
 in appearance that is, in front like this 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.990
 here they look let's see with 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.880
 right side right side rest 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.540
 or we have a power button 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.000
 shutdown 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.530
 steering lock but we have 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.070
 volume button on the left 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.909
 parties we have a rest and we have a button 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.939
 volume control in lenovo we have with 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.439
 this side is nothing you empty game 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.740
 and if here and so you have to see it 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.490
 we basically actually 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.500
 flat floor is not in terms of what 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.840
 there is a fireplace straight line and wine vodka 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.549
 we have a little rounded that is to me 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.030
 such a rounded shape that in principle 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:11.700
 quite interesting behind 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.500
 we have a quiet lenovo plastic mat 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.170
 we have a car that if new 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.850
 touch is much nicer accept 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.530
 I personally like it a lot more 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.480
 Here is the cover, that is, it is so pleasant 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.430
 such a feeling of such correctness and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.040
 keep accordingly how would it be 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.900
 much more convenient than 3 and because 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.459
 plastic however was leaving 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.840
 not as pleasant as 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.400
 soft-touch plastic here we have a camera 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.940
 on the one and the other, that is me 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.440
 so abram at the summit of 8 megapixels 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.920
 flash actually on the look 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.590
 almost identical here below us 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.930
 here the speaker and here the speaker is actually 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.300
 The locations are very similar but 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.980
 even our logo is almost in one 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.709
 place 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.340
 top top top what we see top top we 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.790
 see rest or have a micro usb connector 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.040
 and 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.500
 headphone or headset jack 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.790
 lenovo we also have a connector Chernushkin 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.730
 headset and power button 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.200
 shutdown ie in this regard 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.320
 the location of the learning buttons 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.940
 locks now win because 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.519
 so here it is more convenient to press than 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.320
 under the fives to reach the very top 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.690
 fingers to press this button then 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.520
 there is here like my personal course 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.560
 opinion 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.780
 what do you want in this plan more 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.690
 comfortable bottom let's see below 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.970
 so that it is below 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:42.630
 Bottom we bought on microusb 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:44.190
 connector and the microphone hole and now 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.400
 there is nothing below us except 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.990
 microphone that hid in a niche 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.760
 which allows you to open the back 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.800
 cover according to the characteristics ie these 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.570
 two devices are similar in principle but 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.500
 still there are some differences 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.370
 i.e 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.960
 rest i'm a guest on mtk6589t processor 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:10.560
 who works at a frequency of 1 hertz and 5 from 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.150
 lenovo a830 spring processor mtk 6589 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.330
 without prefix this which works on 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.110
 frequency 1 and 2 gigahertz here and here 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.730
 we have one byte of RAM 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.070
 only the built-in volume is different 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.530
 memory for the user at lenovo a830 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.020
 that's four bytes available there order 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.550
 one and a half gigabyte and composition of ace boxes 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.480
 for use by the user here at 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.000
 we have 8 gigabytes of rest or available almost 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.760
 that 6 gigabytes of sex is not mistaken 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.520
 that is, as if in this respect , now 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.380
 Of course wins because right away 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.700
 no need to buy a memory card in order 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.350
 to install on for some game 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.060
 because of the volume that is at 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.970
 lenovo is not enough if the game is 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.220
 let's say even a small cache there 500 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:58.470
 megabytes 1000 megabytes 2 megabytes and so 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:01.390
 and so on also let's see by 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:07.390
 dad dad on tests what 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:14.470
 with showed let's see what we 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:16.810
 said antutu that is antutu to us 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.800
 showed such date that is such 16 re 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:23.290
 420 one point or but 13,000 296 but that 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.910
 understandable because there is more 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.430
 productive processor who works 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:34.350
 on more frequency than lenovo 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.350
 we have the same operating system 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:42.850
 let's see I think bellows there 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:45.490
 there is android 4 2 1 and also the difference 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.100
 these two devices that despite the 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.610
 what this one and here has a screen diagonal 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.840
 5 inches but you have at least a hd 720 resolution 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:58.000
 at 1280 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:01.240
 lenovo has a resolution of 540 by 960. 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.430
 that is, in this regard, too, the device is quiet 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.890
 or but again in his opinion that is 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:11.620
 wins games on what's on what 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.680
 This machine works fine without 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.670
 brakes ie without any 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.590
 discomfort that is in this 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.450
 plan veteran something more rest 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.160
 powerful lenovo processor absolutely like 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.960
 he is not inferior to at least that I 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.690
 I tried missing nedforspid new 3 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.570
 I tried the kombat 4 pro bold module and all 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.240
 works here on both devices 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:35.500
 great what if wins but 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.180
 compared with the quiet w200 hotel w 200 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.840
 battery one thousand eight hundred 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.480
 milliamper hours at lenovo 2250 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.880
 milliampere hours that is in this plan in 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.740
 plan more 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.280
 long work like all the same 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.410
 plus I think you can confidently 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.660
 put such lenovo 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.390
 that is, these are the differences 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.520
 which basically i saw you i found 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.590
 that is, if you know some other 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.080
 differences please can write to 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.090
 comments oh hope my videos 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.040
 it will be useful that we liked that 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.750
 will help you choose the device 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.330
 this or this people who want 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.010
 translate because let's say for the price 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.440
 this is basically classmates 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.690
 but for everything else you decide 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.200
 yourself all thank you very much everyone for 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.270
