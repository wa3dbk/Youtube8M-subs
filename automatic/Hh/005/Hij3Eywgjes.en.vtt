and it's gonna sound terrible if you're
slapping<00:00:26.310> an<00:00:26.430> E<00:00:26.880> flat<00:00:27.060> for<00:00:27.390> example<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:29.010> you

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
slapping an E flat for example and you

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640 
slapping an E flat for example and you
can<00:00:29.189> hear<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.340> opening<00:00:29.820> ring<00:00:30.380> with<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.529> even

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.110 
just hitting the bass you can hear it
sometimes<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.579> important<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> keep<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
sometimes so it's important to keep the

using muted with our slap hand we want

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.110 
using muted with our slap hand we want
to<00:00:40.620> try<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.829> keep<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.070> thumb<00:00:41.280> parallel<00:00:41.940> to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120

wonders<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.160> me<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.550> seems<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:47.910> very

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
wonders for me it seems to be very

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360 
wonders for me it seems to be very

one<00:00:59.969> string<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.600> I'll<00:01:00.780> never

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
one string like that I'll never

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.210 
one string like that I'll never
understand<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:02.250> he's<00:01:02.460> four<00:01:02.670> he's<00:01:02.850> awesome<00:01:03.210> so

understand but he's four he's awesome so
by<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> thumb<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.729> parallel<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.510> got<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
by the thumb going parallel we got the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.500 
by the thumb going parallel we got the
hand<00:01:06.930> sort<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:07.890> more<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> 35<00:01:08.970> 45

hand sort of on it's more like a 35 45
degree<00:01:09.869> angle<00:01:10.260> you'll<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:10.860> of

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
degree angle you'll have to kind of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.450 
degree angle you'll have to kind of
adjust<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.400> depending<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.150> who<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.450> are

hang<00:01:29.220> loose

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.690 

now<00:01:36.500> I<00:01:36.530> found<00:01:36.800> it's<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.070> little<00:01:37.340> bit<00:01:37.430> easier<00:01:37.670> to

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
now I found it's a little bit easier to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.550 
now I found it's a little bit easier to
do<00:01:37.850> it<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:37.970> way<00:01:38.270> because<00:01:38.630> or<00:01:39.170> just<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.380> do<00:01:39.470> the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
do it that way because or just to do the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.810 
do it that way because or just to do the
slaps<00:01:39.800> that<00:01:39.950> way<00:01:40.070> because<00:01:40.220> it<00:01:40.430> seems<00:01:40.640> that<00:01:40.700> I

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
slaps that way because it seems that I

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.460 
slaps that way because it seems that I
though<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.570> hand<00:01:41.810> pivots<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.200> little<00:01:42.380> bit

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
though the hand pivots a little bit

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.200 
though the hand pivots a little bit
better<00:01:42.620> you've<00:01:43.310> got<00:01:43.430> an<00:01:43.520> access<00:01:43.940> on<00:01:44.090> your

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
better you've got an access on your

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.610 
better you've got an access on your
index<00:01:44.510> finger<00:01:44.810> if<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:44.930> hold<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.440> hand

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
index finger if you hold it the hand

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.320 
index finger if you hold it the hand
actually<00:01:45.770> swings<00:01:46.130> quite<00:01:46.400> freely<00:01:46.730> on<00:01:47.060> that

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
actually swings quite freely on that

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.360 
actually swings quite freely on that
index<00:01:47.570> finger<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:48.440> your<00:01:48.680> middle<00:01:48.740> not<00:01:49.130> quite

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
index finger and your middle not quite

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.490 
index finger and your middle not quite
so<00:01:49.520> much<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:50.540> you've<00:01:50.630> got<00:01:50.750> not<00:01:50.930> access<00:01:51.380> that

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
so much so you've got not access that

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.930 
so much so you've got not access that
goes<00:01:51.620> all<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.800> way<00:01:52.010> up<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.490> tendons<00:01:52.820> in<00:01:52.910> your

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
goes all the way up the tendons in your

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.540 
goes all the way up the tendons in your
arm<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.330> stars<00:01:53.540> are<00:01:53.750> your<00:01:53.900> arm<00:01:54.460> so<00:01:55.460> if

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
arm and stars are your arm so if

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.260 
arm and stars are your arm so if
something<00:01:55.760> we<00:01:55.820> really<00:01:56.000> want<00:01:56.120> to<00:01:56.150> take

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
something we really want to take

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.290 
something we really want to take
advantage<00:01:56.660> of<00:01:56.810> when<00:01:56.930> we're<00:01:57.050> doing<00:01:57.140> that<00:02:01.300> the

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
advantage of when we're doing that the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.790 
advantage of when we're doing that the
act<00:02:02.450> of<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.660> slap<00:02:02.900> it's<00:02:03.080> not<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:03.320> much<00:02:03.410> a<00:02:03.470> slap

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
act of the slap it's not so much a slap

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.550 
act of the slap it's not so much a slap
slap<00:02:04.220> implies<00:02:04.810> follow-through<00:02:05.810> if<00:02:06.380> you're

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
thumb so that you can move the bone

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.250

right<00:03:02.060> at<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.239> back<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.600> shift<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.959> back<00:03:03.080> and

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
right at the back to shift it back and

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.920 
right at the back to shift it back and
forth<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.709> should<00:03:03.860> move<00:03:04.010> just<00:03:04.370> on<00:03:04.790> its<00:03:04.940> own<00:03:05.090> and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
forth it should move just on its own and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.030 
forth it should move just on its own and
that<00:03:05.959> way<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.260> can<00:03:06.350> kind<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.560> get<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.800> swinging

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
that way you can kind of get it swinging

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.560 
that way you can kind of get it swinging
like<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:07.730> what<00:03:07.820> I<00:03:07.880> do<00:03:07.970> for<00:03:08.060> practice

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
like that this is what I do for practice

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.790 
like that this is what I do for practice
just<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.959> make<00:03:09.110> sure<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:09.350> I'm<00:03:09.440> keeping<00:03:09.590> it

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
just to make sure that I'm keeping it

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.130 
just to make sure that I'm keeping it
relaxed<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.550> so<00:03:11.360> I'm<00:03:11.420> just<00:03:11.540> kind<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.750> flinging

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
relaxed and so I'm just kind of flinging

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.690 
relaxed and so I'm just kind of flinging
you'll<00:03:12.500> see<00:03:12.650> I'm<00:03:12.739> twisting<00:03:13.130> my<00:03:13.250> wrist<00:03:13.489> and

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
you'll see I'm twisting my wrist and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.270 
you'll see I'm twisting my wrist and
flinging<00:03:14.239> my<00:03:14.510> thumb<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.769> it's<00:03:15.890> going<00:03:16.070> I'll

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
flinging my thumb and it's going I'll

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.030 
flinging my thumb and it's going I'll
slow<00:03:16.519> it<00:03:16.550> now<00:03:16.730> here<00:03:16.970> kind<00:03:17.239> of<00:03:17.300> up<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:18.040> then

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
slow it now here kind of up and then

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:28.270 
slow it now here kind of up and then
bouncing<00:03:19.400> off<00:03:20.890> so

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.099 

and<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.370> just<00:03:29.549> add<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:29.939> pop<00:03:30.120> by<00:03:30.329> popping

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
and I just add in the pop by popping

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.509 
and I just add in the pop by popping
first<00:03:31.680> string<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.099> you're<00:03:32.189> just<00:03:32.310> snapping

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
first string so you're just snapping

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:46.910 
first string so you're just snapping
against<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:32.969> fingerboard<00:03:45.709> kind<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.769> again

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
against the fingerboard kind of again

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.649 
against the fingerboard kind of again
using<00:03:47.159> that<00:03:47.189> axis<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.849> my<00:03:47.909> index<00:03:48.150> finger<00:03:48.480> has

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
using that axis and my index finger has

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.179 
using that axis and my index finger has
to<00:03:48.930> do<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.170> popping<00:03:49.590> motion<00:03:49.889> or<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.069> that

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
to do that popping motion or is that

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:56.649 
to do that popping motion or is that
twisting<00:03:50.970> back<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.659> forth<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.019> can

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.550 

eventually<00:03:57.659> you<00:03:57.900> can<00:03:57.989> see<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:58.109> get<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.409> double

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
eventually you can see I get the double

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.500 
eventually you can see I get the double
balances<00:03:59.040> one<00:04:04.909> there's<00:04:05.909> kind<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.180> really

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
balances one there's kind of really

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.789 
balances one there's kind of really
difficult<00:04:06.659> where<00:04:06.989> I'm<00:04:07.049> flinging<00:04:07.439> and<00:04:07.590> getting

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
difficult where I'm flinging and getting

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.349 
difficult where I'm flinging and getting
a<00:04:07.859> good<00:04:08.010> initial<00:04:08.370> one<00:04:08.489> in<00:04:08.639> the<00:04:08.730> second<00:04:09.090> one<00:04:09.120> I'm

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
a good initial one in the second one I'm

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.559 
a good initial one in the second one I'm
letting<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.689> just<00:04:11.120> kind<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.150> bounce<00:04:12.359> off

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
letting it just kind of bounce off

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.140 
letting it just kind of bounce off
things<00:04:12.780> vibrating<00:04:13.409> on<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.620> string<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:15.000> took

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
things vibrating on the string it took

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.520 
things vibrating on the string it took
me<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.299> long<00:04:15.480> time<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.750> get<00:04:15.989> that<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.169> think<00:04:16.410> Les

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
me a long time to get that I think Les

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.779 
me a long time to get that I think Les
Claypool<00:04:16.949> can<00:04:17.099> get<00:04:17.220> actually<00:04:17.430> like<00:04:17.519> five

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
Claypool can get actually like five

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.460 
Claypool can get actually like five
little<00:04:18.030> thumps<00:04:18.329> out<00:04:18.449> of<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:19.049> best<00:04:19.259> angle

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
little thumps out of it the best angle

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.050 
little thumps out of it the best angle
I've<00:04:19.829> been<00:04:19.949> able<00:04:20.039> to<00:04:20.160> get<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.459> three<00:04:20.759> out<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:20.970> my

hoping the audio in the video is gonna

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.469 
hoping the audio in the video is gonna
match<00:05:09.930> it<00:05:10.110> most<00:05:10.289> likely<00:05:10.620> not<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.729> any

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479
