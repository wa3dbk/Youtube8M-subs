00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
recommended for ages 5 through 12 so we

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.270 
recommended for ages 5 through 12 so we
get<00:00:30.579> to<00:00:30.730> make<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.110> tanker<00:00:32.110> looks<00:00:32.950> like<00:00:33.100> it's

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
get to make the tanker looks like it's

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.450 
get to make the tanker looks like it's
probably<00:00:34.680> 12<00:00:35.680> wheels<00:00:35.890> you've<00:00:36.160> got<00:00:36.250> a<00:00:36.280> double

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
probably 12 wheels you've got a double

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.720 
probably 12 wheels you've got a double
axle<00:00:36.910> in<00:00:36.969> the<00:00:37.030> back<00:00:38.339> looks<00:00:39.339> like<00:00:39.370> a<00:00:39.460> gas

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
axle in the back looks like a gas

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.009 
axle in the back looks like a gas
station<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.469> we<00:00:41.589> come<00:00:41.710> with<00:00:41.829> a<00:00:41.859> minifig<00:00:42.309> and<00:00:43.179> we

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
station so we come with a minifig and we

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.950 
station so we come with a minifig and we
do<00:00:44.170> get<00:00:44.850> numbered<00:00:45.850> bags<00:00:46.089> in<00:00:46.329> here<00:00:46.539> we'll<00:00:46.780> see

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
do get numbered bags in here we'll see

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.139 
do get numbered bags in here we'll see
that<00:00:47.109> in<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.289> second<00:00:47.739> I<00:00:47.890> guess<00:00:48.699> we<00:00:48.820> get<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:49.030> make

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
that in a second I guess we get to make

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.020 
that in a second I guess we get to make
all<00:00:49.329> this<00:00:49.510> cool<00:00:50.469> stuff<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:51.219> see<00:00:51.789> all<00:00:51.909> the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
all this cool stuff and see all the

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.130 
all this cool stuff and see all the
features<00:00:52.239> that<00:00:52.570> it<00:00:52.719> has<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.640> let's<00:00:55.109> take<00:00:56.109> a

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
features that it has so let's take a

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:16.350 
features that it has so let's take a
peek<00:00:56.289> inside<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.339> see<00:00:57.519> what<00:00:57.609> we<00:00:57.730> get

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.820 

like<00:01:17.360> this<00:01:17.540> thing's<00:01:17.780> packed<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.350> pieces

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:36.930 

number<00:01:24.830> they<00:01:25.640> get<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:25.909> bunch<00:01:26.119> of<00:01:26.210> plate<00:01:33.700> get<00:01:34.700> a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.330 

energy<00:01:37.940> so<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:38.540> get<00:01:38.659> a<00:01:38.690> bunch<00:01:38.840> of<00:01:38.930> stickers<00:01:39.340> get

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
energy so we get a bunch of stickers get

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.249 
energy so we get a bunch of stickers get
a<00:01:40.369> long<00:01:40.659> string<00:01:41.659> with<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:43.810> host<00:01:44.810> pick<00:01:45.110> it

a fire extinguisher this does go into

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.360 
a fire extinguisher this does go into
the<00:02:59.359> compartment<00:03:01.030> behind<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.209> truck<00:03:03.280> just<00:03:04.280> a

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
the compartment behind the truck just a

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.460 
the compartment behind the truck just a
simple<00:03:04.700> brick<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.390> water<00:03:05.720> spigot<00:03:08.380> now<00:03:09.380> we

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
simple brick and water spigot now we

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.670 
simple brick and water spigot now we
have<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.980> gas<00:03:10.400> pump<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:11.060> few<00:03:12.019> things<00:03:12.320> to<00:03:12.500> note

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
have the gas pump a few things to note

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.630 
have the gas pump a few things to note
here<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.070> this<00:03:13.459> does<00:03:13.910> come<00:03:14.600> off<00:03:14.630> very<00:03:14.750> easily

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
here that this does come off very easily

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.000 
here that this does come off very easily
so<00:03:16.640> this<00:03:16.760> is<00:03:16.880> not<00:03:17.000> really<00:03:17.060> user<00:03:17.420> friendly<00:03:18.010> with

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
so this is not really user friendly with

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.970 
so this is not really user friendly with
the<00:03:19.130> hose<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.579> stuff<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:20.830> didn't<00:03:21.830> put<00:03:21.920> the

the hose and stuff I didn't put the
sticker<00:03:22.190> on<00:03:22.310> here<00:03:22.430> cuz<00:03:22.580> I'm<00:03:22.670> probably<00:03:22.819> use

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
sticker on here cuz I'm probably use

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.300
