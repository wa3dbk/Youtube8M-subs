they're sitting in the middle 50s we

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.510 
they're sitting in the middle 50s we
thought<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.140> might<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> upper<00:00:49.649> 40s<00:00:50.160> now

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
thought we might be in the upper 40s now

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.100 
thought we might be in the upper 40s now
but<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.940> go<00:00:51.059> north<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> low

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
40s up in the Tennessee Valley so I'd

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.869 
40s up in the Tennessee Valley so I'd
say<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.570> about<00:00:54.629> 40<00:00:55.289> miles<00:00:55.670> displaced<00:00:56.670> from

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.160 
and there's the trough you can see
Wednesday<00:06:59.640> but<00:06:59.700> again<00:07:00.090> I<00:07:00.540> think<00:07:00.600> the<00:07:00.780> slower

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.170 
Wednesday but again I think the slower

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.660 
Wednesday but again I think the slower
solution<00:07:01.770> is<00:07:01.890> right<00:07:02.100> I<00:07:02.130> think<00:07:02.370> will<00:07:02.460> target

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:02.670 
solution is right I think will target

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.390 
solution is right I think will target
Wednesday<00:07:03.380> and<00:07:04.380> clearly<00:07:04.770> with<00:07:05.010> temperatures

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
Wednesday and clearly with temperatures

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.890 
Wednesday and clearly with temperatures
up<00:07:05.550> around<00:07:05.640> 70<00:07:06.300> there<00:07:06.450> will<00:07:06.570> be<00:07:06.690> some

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
up around 70 there will be some

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.470 
up around 70 there will be some
instability<00:07:07.260> but<00:07:07.680> whether<00:07:07.890> the<00:07:08.480> dynamic

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 
instability but whether the dynamic

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.150 
instability but whether the dynamic
support<00:07:09.870> the<00:07:10.170> lapse<00:07:10.410> rates<00:07:10.770> the<00:07:10.950> holistic

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 
support the lapse rates the holistic

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.920 
support the lapse rates the holistic
thing<00:07:11.760> else<00:07:11.940> falls<00:07:12.180> into<00:07:12.270> place<00:07:12.420> we<00:07:12.720> just

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
thing else falls into place we just

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.110 
thing else falls into place we just
don't<00:07:13.110> know<00:07:13.320> that<00:07:13.350> yet<00:07:13.710> so<00:07:13.950> maybe<00:07:14.550> some<00:07:14.820> active

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 
don't know that yet so maybe some active
