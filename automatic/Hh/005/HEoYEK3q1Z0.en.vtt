00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.949
 the way we're going to work the automotive air conditioner is no different 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.949
 of which we handle traditional refrigeration systems 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.320
 the difference are 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.460
 for example that I have in my hands two plugs 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.670
 from the assumption to olate written off 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.940
 on the side of the small ones on the side of before big 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.820
 there is no way that we are wrong when placing 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.730
 our sappers because they are not going to enter nor that of mayor they go down and 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.360
 high 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.340
 in fact these factors are through fast connection 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.370
 all automotive to handle the r134a 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.210
 Like the other refrigeration, we occupy the high water pressure gauge 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.510
 low requested no substitute feel the musculados that with the other 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.880
 in this 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.640
 the more cars we need the more we handle a lubricant different from the town 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.330
 esther and this is more copeco titles still that the polo lester is also 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.370
 makes a very fast hole 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.730
 and also ep or we will be technical psalms of puskas escape until very supervise 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.420
 nitrogen we will look for strength or with less contrast and I have my 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.230
 occupies the kicker in fact the factors very useful to search in cars 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.360
 since we can put it under the board and we can look for the leak if not 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.870
 we got to bring by the evaporator side 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.690
 that are usually placed 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.480
 on the side of the cabin where the co-pilot goes in a very expensive eleven 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.830
 and from this side muse against the compressor 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.790
 unlike him the traditional maintenance issues this 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.680
 equipment has accepted this is the vacuum pump the scale and the tank 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.650
 recovered 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.770
 with a single button we will be able to send the instruction 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.690
 p cut the coolant after we can proceed to make the vacuum and 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.180
 again the equipment we will be able to load refrigerant to the vehicle
