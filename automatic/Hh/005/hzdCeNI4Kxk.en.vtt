00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.950
 well you surely do not know so 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.839
 I will start by presenting I 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.670
 call me to fit these people and I like 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.780
 among staff thus fix it 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.490
 you are interested but there would be 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.500
 no info young man has feeling on a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.120
 cactus and today I'm Christmas 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.250
 who could make this video as they 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.779
 you told him last week 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.270
 this week the theme is you 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.529
 talk about our favorite movies and series 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.480
 so at the movies I chose 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.590
 four who are really for me my 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.420
 favorite of all times 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.640
 the first film is this blog san pedro 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.380
 also known as the world 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.880
 so cart this movie 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.739
 basically he tells the story of a 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.510
 teenager who has just entered a 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.219
 new so it was at the beginning 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.880
 the German struggling to fit in because 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.070
 seven 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.820
 the excess school of others who will stay 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.560
 long enough removed from the rest until 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.710
 day actually he will meet two 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.150
 terminal so that but patrick it's going 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.940
 to be a little these two new best 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.230
 friends really has great lcn that I 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.820
 advises by force asserted one of 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.739
 they comes my second who preferred his 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.790
 four gorgeous girls so you 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.200
 surely know what he is 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.780
 quite known calais happens in the 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.610
 1920s 1930s in New York it is 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.370
 really all dance mime auxois the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.500
 sets the costumes the music that is 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.030
 really too much nose to the story 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.010
 in herself she is just too much 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 perfect support aprilia leonardo dicaprio 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.970
 so that's still a lot 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.530
 more perfect than it already is 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.390
 this movie let's say it's a bit my life 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.650
 what I had to see at least ten times 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.660
 that she eat adore her I you 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.210
 strongly advise 3f that he preferred 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.479
 seo camp gering so it's a movie 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.940
 horror 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.729
 so I'm not at all a fan of the game 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.110
 quite quickly 1st story is 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.820
 a family settles in a house 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.660
 what in fact this house and link can 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.840
 own 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.460
 yeah yeah help you she's going on 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.170
 a little chauvinistic stuff like in all 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.690
 games will have what will have to do 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.120
 call for specialists 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.650
 if you like not really tried 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.920
 the other because I tried and 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.300
 I love my case it's a small favorite 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.540
 it's a thing to the king and so it's a 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.400
 pretty old movie or wei is not it 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.950
 is not recent story of a young 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.780
 man who is nothing graduated who is 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.340
 really promised a great future is in 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.649
 do they decide 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.599
 to leave without warning his parents or 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.300
 his money and identity cards 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.470
 yes me that everything is repaired and in 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.790
 did they decide to leave for 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.390
 alaska it's really a movie that 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.720
 I really like 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.849
 I have it long and then a lot of 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.890
 scenes landscape hobbies that lasts enough 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.860
 a long time but the landscapes are just there 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.450
 beautiful and serving a superb movie 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.190
 hours at the series level it was at 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.349
 my turn to find you she was 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.180
 but several series of the woman 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.660
 already spoke had two first ones getting 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.130
 continues anyway girl who 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.019
 would contribute so it's later these 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.519
 kids there so in my opinion i'm 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.410
 brunette and that's what they really are 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.880
 very very very cozy it's just fox 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.790
 then 2 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.980
 it's that that have nothing to do with 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.140
 two first from washington and the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.420
 beauceronnes serving the contrary it is 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.770
 my mouth give your opinion but I 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.330
 I'm too attached to the characters then 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.710
 after the perfect walking dead at the beginning 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.940
 I did not want to look because I 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.980
 am in the final lost throat and support 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.050
 no blood is where my suitcase decided to 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.670
 look and since the failure for the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.170
 spit butter to live elsewhere from 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.550
 crazy thanks the walking dead 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.740
 not so bad to finish 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.820
 I hope you liked it but it was 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.670
 not good in the comments what 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.390

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.110
