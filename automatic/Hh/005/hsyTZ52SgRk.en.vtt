00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you have to keep the sensor that leads

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.029 
you have to keep the sensor that leads
to<00:02:10.709> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
to you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.460 
to you
like<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.610> what<00:02:11.819> I'm<00:02:11.970> doing<00:02:12.000> now<00:02:12.480> now<00:02:13.230> it's

use this cultural upside down you can
still<00:02:24.150> do<00:02:24.329> it<00:02:24.360> ok<00:02:24.659> another<00:02:24.959> good<00:02:25.200> feature<00:02:25.439> is

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
still do it ok another good feature is

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.440 
still do it ok another good feature is
it<00:02:26.129> has<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.720> mode<00:02:27.720> control<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.590> also<00:02:29.310> row<00:02:30.120> and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
it has a mode control and also row and

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.750 
it has a mode control and also row and
the<00:02:30.750> teeth<00:02:31.079> are<00:02:31.110> C<00:02:31.680> control<00:02:32.069> s<00:02:32.390> see<00:02:34.250> I'm<00:02:35.250> now

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
the teeth are C control s see I'm now

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.630 
the teeth are C control s see I'm now
using<00:02:35.819> my<00:02:36.480> channel<00:02:37.200> 5<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:38.099> mode<00:02:38.310> switch

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
using my channel 5 as the mode switch

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.949 
using my channel 5 as the mode switch
and<00:02:38.970> also<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.879> this<00:02:41.879> is<00:02:42.030> my<00:02:42.180> Levin<00:02:42.659> and

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
and also the this is my Levin and

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.649 
and also the this is my Levin and
elevator<00:02:43.709> for<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.609> low<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.450> pitch

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
elevator for the low and the pitch

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.970 
elevator for the low and the pitch
control<00:02:45.870> ok<00:02:46.859> here<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.280> can<00:02:47.549> see<00:02:47.790> my<00:02:47.970> radio<00:02:48.390> I

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
control ok here you can see my radio I

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.910 
control ok here you can see my radio I
am<00:02:49.980> going<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.519> try<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.849> real<00:02:51.389> control<00:02:51.920> see

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
am going to try the real control see

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.289 
am going to try the real control see
it's<00:02:53.519> working<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.709> then<00:02:55.709> here<00:02:56.250> I'm<00:02:56.489> using<00:02:56.849> the

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
it's working and then here I'm using the

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.119 
it's working and then here I'm using the
precision<00:02:57.870> mode<00:02:58.260> namely<00:02:59.220> where<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.549> put<00:03:01.129> namely

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
precision mode namely where I put namely

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.930 
precision mode namely where I put namely
I<00:03:02.370> put<00:03:03.299> my<00:03:03.569> stick<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.560> certain<00:03:05.340> position<00:03:05.609> and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
I put my stick to a certain position and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.960 
I put my stick to a certain position and
that<00:03:06.900> involve<00:03:07.260> your<00:03:07.379> follow<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.099> then<00:03:08.940> I

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
that involve your follow and then I

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.030 
that involve your follow and then I
release<00:03:09.299> my<00:03:09.540> stick<00:03:09.870> they<00:03:10.200> will<00:03:10.379> go<00:03:10.500> back<00:03:10.530> and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
release my stick they will go back and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.099 
release my stick they will go back and
also<00:03:11.819> here<00:03:12.329> is<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:13.470> tod<00:03:13.680> control<00:03:14.599> yeah<00:03:15.629> where

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
also here is the tod control yeah where

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.500 
also here is the tod control yeah where
I<00:03:16.139> release<00:03:16.470> my<00:03:16.680> stick<00:03:16.980> they<00:03:17.220> will<00:03:17.340> go<00:03:17.459> back<00:03:17.510> so

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
I release my stick they will go back so

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.830 
I release my stick they will go back so
here's<00:03:19.049> another<00:03:19.410> mode<00:03:19.829> is<00:03:20.069> called<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.840> speed

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
here's another mode is called the speed

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.580 
here's another mode is called the speed
mode<00:03:22.049> -<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.709> speed<00:03:23.099> mode<00:03:23.340> ok<00:03:23.699> so<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:24.780> turned<00:03:25.440> the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
mode - the speed mode ok so I turned the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.770 
mode - the speed mode ok so I turned the
control<00:03:26.190> mode<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:27.169> speed<00:03:28.169> so<00:03:29.010> when<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.030> move<00:03:30.569> my

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
control mode to speed so when I move my

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.349 
control mode to speed so when I move my
stick<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.780> yeah<00:03:34.379> I<00:03:34.560> can<00:03:34.859> control<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.489> low

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
stick and yeah I can control the low

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.280 
stick and yeah I can control the low
speed<00:03:36.859> yeah<00:03:37.859> like<00:03:38.489> this<00:03:38.699> and<00:03:39.109> also<00:03:40.109> for

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
speed yeah like this and also for

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.270 
speed yeah like this and also for
attitude

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.970 

so<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.300> is<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.540> pistol<00:03:45.960> mode<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.710> can<00:03:46.950> use

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
so this is a pistol mode you can use

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.330 
so this is a pistol mode you can use
this<00:03:47.430> facedown<00:03:48.120> mode<00:03:48.540> without<00:03:49.440> any<00:03:49.860> problem

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
this facedown mode without any problem

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.640 
this facedown mode without any problem
so<00:03:51.060> let's<00:03:51.360> go<00:03:51.540> back<00:03:53.780> are<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.900> on<00:03:55.080> this<00:03:55.230> circle

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
so let's go back are you on this circle

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.310 
so let's go back are you on this circle
process<00:03:55.890> ring<00:03:56.250> can<00:03:56.820> bow<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.090> very<00:03:57.420> very<00:03:58.110> nice

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
process ring can bow is very very nice

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.940 
process ring can bow is very very nice
indeed<00:03:58.590> skimble<00:03:59.130> also<00:03:59.460> has<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.730> computer

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
indeed skimble also has a computer

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.430 
indeed skimble also has a computer
configuration<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.190> too<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.760> show<00:04:03.000> the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
configuration you too can show the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.800 
configuration you too can show the
parameters<00:04:04.440> against<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.640> tilt<00:04:06.060> angle<00:04:06.300> and

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
parameters against the tilt angle and

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.110 
parameters against the tilt angle and
other<00:04:07.080> parameters<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:08.010> also<00:04:08.520> for<00:04:08.970> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
other parameters and also for the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.810 
other parameters and also for the
homework<00:04:09.360> upgrade<00:04:10.050> and<00:04:10.320> this<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.250> very<00:04:11.550> nice

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
homework upgrade and this is very nice

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.160 
homework upgrade and this is very nice
and<00:04:12.060> ready<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.450> use<00:04:12.570> and<00:04:13.940> so<00:04:14.940> I<00:04:15.240> really<00:04:16.019> like
