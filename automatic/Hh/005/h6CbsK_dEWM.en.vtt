00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.620
 good very good guys to all and 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.479
 welcome to my channel again what 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.580
 sorry for not taking yesterday video but it's 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:10.959
 that made me impossible and in this video 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.459
 I want to clarify an issue one 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.940
 stir that has been for the past 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.530
 videos 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.230
 about the kind of videos that I'm 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.880
 going up and I'm going to clear everything up 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.460
 many people first being 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.250
 complaining that yes or too much with this 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.980
 weapon that is the sm1 I'm going to play everything 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.969
 who wants and more this is like that and in fact 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.469
 more now that is when when 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:37.070
 less time I have to play what 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.469
 I'm working and I leave a lot if I 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.510
 they kill the same guy twice and hitting 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.760
 very well everything is like that to leave with the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.140
 gameplay what I told you guys now 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.670
 that I have much less time to 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.100
 play for the thing that I work and such 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.879
 I have very few hours a day I go to 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.739
 7 to work and I have a couple of 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.780
 hours at the most if I do not have to do 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.039
 things and I have to do more things not 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.589
 I have time to play because of the 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.749
 night I have to sleep early and not 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.040
 I can not be possible, it's worth what 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.690
 I'm seeing on screen lately 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.180
 is complaining that I bring you that 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.230
 so it is not bad enough but little 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.950
 bulging in the channel 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.660
 I do not see it that way, that is, if I get out 24 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.480
 low in a game that lasts two 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.900
 minutes 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.380
 are 24 casualties in two minutes do not look 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.780
 that are 24 casualties in the game if I bring 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.310
 a gameplay with 24 casualties and has been 24 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.940
 rapid declines has been employment 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.320
 frantic has been fine in general 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.090
 because you have to discriminate the replay 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.010
 because it has been 24 casualties and it has been 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.260
 funny 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.180
 is that I do not see any kind of problem 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.220
 I do not know if you like more 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.220
 types of games of 100 casualties that last 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.620
 10 minutes and it has been all the lows with 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.590
 a guard a paladin and a drone 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.040
 escort and a bomber to me the truth 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.620
 A) Yes 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.730
 I like to play at times not always because 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.950
 is that I really do not have a good time 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.110
 apart from that they are more difficult gusts 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.580
 to take out the ones I have and there are many 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.790
 Sometimes you can not get them out 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.460
 is that I do not have much easier to play 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.650
 well with cloud and get me out and have a couple of 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.970
 gusts to throw in case I take it out 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.390
 try to kill with the most 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.390
 possible I have to be there piloting a 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.570
 guard and followed piloting a paladin 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.550
 the truth is that I like to play with 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.340
 the weapon I do not expect you to see it 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.750
 equal and it reproached me is that that the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.190
 games will be a bit bad I'll be the truth 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.260
 If I take a life and I liked it 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.990
 as I played and I liked the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.900
 I'm going to upload it with a weapon that 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.610
 be it with the gusts that are the 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.590
 game that is the same as if I want 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.959
 die ten times and the game has been 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.489
 well if the game was good and me 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.630
 I liked how I played 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.480
 go up because I think it's going to 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.400
 like you do not like it, do not see it 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.050
 it's that easy right now I have a 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.590
 little time to record and you can not 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.080
 ask to bring you weapons with the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.580
 lightning weapon for the weapon the new weapon 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.019
 this I have that the truth is a 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.610
 shit so I'm going to play with a gun 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.959
 that is crap when I play I have little 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.849
 time and I have to record a gameplay 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.310
 to upload them in which I have to 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.260
 fun for me is not an obligation to 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.510
 I like it and I like to make a gameplay 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.299
 after I like to edit it I like me 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.470
 like everything in general to upload videos 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.420
 then I like to take my 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.069
 camera to wash my face with a 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.230
 gameplay and start a game of duel 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.140
 by killing teams and if I liked the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.330
 Lame game and I upload it and more so if it has 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.790
 there was something funny in the video with me 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.890
 face or whatever the 2.0 with your hands 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.650
 it's also something innovative, not the 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.420
 true that pretty cool and guys I the 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.950
 I really see it like that, I do not know how you see it 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.379
 I you the truth now 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.400
 I have very little time to play 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.110
 maybe on a weekend so have 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.940
 more and this weekend I'll have it 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.040
 very busy as next week 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.200
 I'm not home or I'm going on a trip 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.670
 of jobs a work trip that 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.430
 I have to go is I have to be Monday 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.819
 to Friday away from home I have to go 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.530
 1100 kilometers from my house is worth 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.989
 work to repair some machines in a 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.870
 factory and such and I have to go from the 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.569
 rioja that I live up to huelva 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.310
 to notice you guys is that if I have to 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.349
 work this this weekend to 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.150
 upload videos a lot yes it's going to 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.060
 cost but it will not cost much either 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.950
 work since I like it and if instead of 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.989
 in the five videos that you have to have 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.160
 in Monday through Friday you have three 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.190
 It's normal because it costs me a lot 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.130
 plus 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.450
 I do not know how you see it but I see it that way 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.100
 a change that there is in the channel then 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.270
 because there is a change in my life that is 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.270
 that I have a new job 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.090
 it's true 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.710
 that takes away from me for quite some time 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.960
 take away time is that I need that time 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.940
 to work 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.520
 I have less time to make videos and 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.440
 to play and for everything I would like to 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.090
 me being 8 hours playing is what most 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.000
 I would like to me in life to live from 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.319
 play is like all of you what 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.440
 I'm watching the videos you'd love 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:57.210
 to live from playing as it is logical, but not 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.919
 it can not be that way at the moment it can not be 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.449
 well I do not know if one day you can reach 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.250
 I have no idea I do not know just that 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.889
 I am looking for I am looking for fun here 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.490
 people and the more people who 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.990
 I have more fun I have fun 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.819
 the output is a pretty epic stanza 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.000
 but guys, I'm seeing this in 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:17.250
 screen is a 36 to 515 times are 36 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.800
 duel casualties by teams of which 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.960
 are 75 I get almost half of the 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.340
 low of the game 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.349
 I think guys that's pretty good 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.880
 the gusts do not kill much are almost all 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.889
 with the weapon I make two streaks of 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.060
 inexorable followed in which if not 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.099
 I would have died in the middle would have taken me 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.990
 a fierce guys I do not know what else you want 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.940
 this is a normal screen and it's what I 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.430
 I had a good time playing for that is the rise of 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.599
 I had it saved for this purpose 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.490
 week what happens that how has it 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.840
 this comment arose that I am 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.030
 thinking about leaving work I 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.610
 they pour coffee into the bar and 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.050
 Well, I thought about this and 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.490
 this comment came to me 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.930
 comment 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.220
 and I would like you to say your opinion 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.860
 what do you think I know there are many who 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.960
 you think that there are places that are not 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.520
 worthy for this channel but guys I'm 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.740
 I do not think so I think I'm going to 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.300
 upload what I like that I have 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.070
 that go up bone what I like me 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.500
 I played and I had fun that's what 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.570
 that I am going to upload you have it very clear that 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.890
 we like it so do not see it shughour that 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.290
 and why the game because someone has me 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.390
 liked and that's why I upload it to share 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.310
 what you do not like many I understand 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.470
 perfectly do not see it but neither 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.970
 you need to tell me in the 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.830
 comments that this is not worthy of me 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.150
 channel because that's not the case there's a lot 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.730
 people who did not like it and there are 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.350
 many people who have supported me that follow 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.420
 that is my channel and upload what I want that 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.920
 it's like that that's going to be from crate continue to 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.750

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.960
 how you applauded yourself and a boy 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.630
