00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.029
 at six or seven I like the design not 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.920
 I like that one of the many 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.570
 questions why you ask if 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.220
 we can go back to it 6 once 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.139
 installed he gave 7 and in this video I'm going to 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.639
 answer all those problems that 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.969
 Many let us know through the 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.969
 social networks 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.060
 ah 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.630
 hello guys and girls very good and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.730
 Welcome to support 5 x 1 on the day of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 today we are going with the second chapter of the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.930
 help section within the channel like 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.610
 You see in the first delivery we were 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.630
 talking about a very frequent problem 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.370
 among the users that gives the 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.500
 Warm up on your device 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.210
 well today we are going to talk about a second 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.330
 problem that you are facing 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.190
 many that on the existential doubt of 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.050
 if you can return to ios 6 after 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.660
 be in year 7 because many have not 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.059
 liked or does not work well and you have 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.320
 the intention to return and the question 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.449
 it's very clear I can go back to it 6 the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.309
 answer is there is not a video on the channel 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.170
 in which I explain how you can 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.430
 return to the 6 that is right now 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.220
 receiving a multitude of comments 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.930
 but it is clear that the title says that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.870
 method was only when you could 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.460
 come back to them 6 when we were in 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.490
 the period of the goodbye beta 7 is 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.650
 to say still to paul signed to me 6 the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.000
 problem this is that to see the method you 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.440
 you can do it but the problem is that 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.299
 to Paul when verifying the 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.430
 software that you want to install, not what 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.299
 sign so you can not install this 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.710
 operating system 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.930
 the problem is that which has expired 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.180
 we could say of some 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.680
 they can only install rays 6 to those 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.140
 that they do not have the possibility to install 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.540
 at 7 as is for example the case of 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.160
 the iphone 3 iphone 3gs etc. that 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.360
 those phones because logically they can 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.860
 install until the latest version of 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.479
 compatible videos for them has not 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.740
 never expired I 6 but for the new ones 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.050
 devices that have the possibility 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.750
 to update rays 7 yes it has expired 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.030
 that possibility so much guys feel 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.430
 tell you that you are going to have to put up with and 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.830
 you have to be with them 7 many 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.540
 surely you also want it for the 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.550
 made to try to improve the 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.470
 battery results because it is one of 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.570
 the problems that most reports jce to my 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.190
 twitter account that incidentally the 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.870
 you have in the description many 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.550
 reports battery problems and by 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.590
 that you want to go back to me 6 because nobody 6 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.840
 you had an optimal performance I 'm going to 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.180
 put some advice in the description 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.940
 I gave a few days ago to try 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.040
 save battery on May 7 I have to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.959
 say that greatly improved my 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.430
 battery performance yesterday with 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.530
 selected my channel partner and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.090
 I will be so surprised 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.070
 because I did not expect it to be so good 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.230
 the performance had eight hours of use 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.750
 finish the day yesterday with eight hours of use 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.390
 and with a day at rest which is 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.310
 quite acceptable for a goodbye 7 that 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.020
 is giving more than problems yes that is 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.610
 true that we must recognize that this 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.890
 there are 27 to work in a way 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.780
 optimal or more or less acceptable in 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.220
 battery terms you have to 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.740
 disable a lot of options in 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.270
 second plane so good is the 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.740
 advice that we can give you at least 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.720
 to minimize the consumption up to 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.790
 that by providing an update the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.170
 update the them 7.1 that seems 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.780
 be that directly will be the one 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.970
 leave possibly if it is not in the week 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.530
 of the new ipad can be the 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.480
 next but of course that is at 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.610
 fall in which we will see corrected many 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.890
 failures and with which we expect many 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.510
 that the applications are better 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.250
 optimized and of course the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.600
 General phone performance helps you 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.580
 there is no overheating like 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.130
 we explained yesterday and also 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.540
 a high consumption of battery for 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.760
 that you want to change the design by 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.350
 example of your year 7 I also have 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.610
 to say that is one of the main 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.350
 reasons also why you want 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.810
 come back to it 6 because you do not like me 7 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.730
 I have to say that many times it is 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.520
 better to put a suitable fund to 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.230
 decorate the 7 in this year 7 is very 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.940
 important the wallpaper that 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.550
 put because as you see 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.200
 at 7 he has the main 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.670
 feature that they use many 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.220
 transparent layers therefore 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.690
 transparent in the background and the background makes 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.650
 that changes the whole general aspect of 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.990
 phone is therefore very important 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.520
 have a proper background I'll put them 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.640
 also in the description a chapter 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.380
 where I put you and I talked to you about how 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.750
 customize and get the most out of the 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.550
 wall of your phone in 7 years these are 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.410
 the tips that I can give guys I feel 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.470
 communicate to all who have that 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.630
 problem and in this help section 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.880
 I wanted to clarify that existential doubt 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.100
 that you have many since you have 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.109
 installed and 27 sorry you can not say it 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.150
 you can go back to it 6 but that's what 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.830
 there's been everything you guys already know 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.210
 if you liked the video give a little hand 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.880
 up to subscribe if you have not done 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.250
 and see you in a next video bye bye 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.440
 well this problem is generated logically 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.420
 as it says sign when there is a 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.920
 overheating either because you've 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.780
 been for a long time running 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.180
 a game or because you've been using 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.720
 an application that your device does not 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.720
 it fits well
