00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.910 
first of all you can't transform into
your<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> transformations<00:02:00.390> also<00:02:00.869> all<00:02:01.439> this

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
your the transformations also all this

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.880 
your the transformations also all this
 shouldn't<00:02:02.640> show<00:02:03.290> until<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.829> you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
 shouldn't show until you know you

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.820 
 shouldn't show until you know you
click<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.310> your<00:02:05.640> character

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
click on your character

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.570 
click on your character
like<00:02:06.950> on<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.990> dragon<00:02:08.990> ball<00:02:09.290> z<00:02:09.500> tenkaichi<00:02:09.770> 3<00:02:10.490> I

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
like on a dragon ball z tenkaichi 3 I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.490 
like on a dragon ball z tenkaichi 3 I
mean<00:02:10.790> this<00:02:10.880> guy<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.120> supposed<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.570> be<00:02:11.690> for<00:02:12.140> ps3

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
mean this guy is supposed to be for ps3

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.710 
mean this guy is supposed to be for ps3
this<00:02:12.950> is<00:02:13.130> supposed<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.430> be<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.790> future<00:02:14.270> but<00:02:14.600> it

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
this is supposed to be a future but it

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.870 
this is supposed to be a future but it
seems<00:02:14.930> like<00:02:15.080> dragon<00:02:15.560> ball<00:02:15.740> z<00:02:15.950> budokai

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
seems like dragon ball z budokai

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.510 
seems like dragon ball z budokai
tenkaichi<00:02:17.810> 3<00:02:18.080> was<00:02:18.260> way<00:02:18.530> more<00:02:18.560> advanced<00:02:19.400> in

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
tenkaichi 3 was way more advanced in

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.220 
tenkaichi 3 was way more advanced in
this<00:02:19.640> games<00:02:19.910> with<00:02:20.180> which<00:02:20.690> makes<00:02:20.990> absolutely

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
this games with which makes absolutely

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.660 
this games with which makes absolutely
no<00:02:21.860> sense<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:23.090> me<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.630> bet<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.440> thinking<00:02:25.160> digits

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
no sense to me I bet you thinking digits

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.730 
no sense to me I bet you thinking digits
to<00:02:25.790> make<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.150> character<00:02:26.630> roster<00:02:26.780> bigger<00:02:27.440> I

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
to make the character roster bigger I

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.550 
to make the character roster bigger I
think<00:02:28.280> that's<00:02:28.490> why<00:02:28.670> they<00:02:28.880> made<00:02:29.180> like<00:02:29.960> all<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
think that's why they made like all the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.800 
think that's why they made like all the
transformations<00:02:31.040> separate<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.000> notice<00:02:32.720> you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
transformations separate but notice you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.530 
transformations separate but notice you
just<00:02:33.020> let<00:02:33.260> us<00:02:33.290> transform<00:02:34.280> into<00:02:34.670> an<00:02:35.000> auntie

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
just let us transform into an auntie

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.680 
just let us transform into an auntie
what<00:02:36.110> would<00:02:36.260> have<00:02:36.380> been<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.740> hard<00:02:37.070> about<00:02:37.250> that

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
what would have been so hard about that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.990 
what would have been so hard about that
freaking<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.960> mean<00:02:39.680> greedy<00:02:40.130> assholes<00:02:40.760> and

many<00:03:11.260> no<00:03:12.260> transformations<00:03:13.130> they<00:03:13.190> have<00:03:13.340> most

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
many no transformations they have most

of<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:14.030> just<00:03:14.239> transformations<00:03:15.140> there's

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
of this is just transformations there's

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.620 
of this is just transformations there's
not<00:03:15.560> really<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.100> lot<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.550> characters<00:03:17.120> on<00:03:17.300> this

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
not really a lot of characters on this

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.350 
not really a lot of characters on this
game<00:03:18.190> anyway<00:03:19.190> it's<00:03:19.370> just<00:03:19.400> my<00:03:19.730> thoughts<00:03:20.120> my

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
game anyway it's just my thoughts my

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.750 
game anyway it's just my thoughts my
opinion<00:03:21.110> I<00:03:21.260> feel<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.890> roster<00:03:22.310> could<00:03:22.640> have

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
opinion I feel the roster could have

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.940 
opinion I feel the roster could have
been<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:22.940> lot<00:03:23.030> better<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.380> really<00:03:24.620> need<00:03:24.800> to
