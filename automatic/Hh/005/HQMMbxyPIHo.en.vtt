 Hey guys 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.790
 welcomes you to my channel on my 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.580
 first good video is first of all 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.859
 I wanted to say that it's just a video inside is 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.509
 I'm just going to explain a little about what I 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.789
 I want to do it here on youtube 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:24.769
 so I hope to take the two minutes of 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.359
 its time if it will not bother to 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.640
 first of all I wanted to thank the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.710
 silvio santos gameplay that has me 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.350
 helped a lot in the language in the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.390
 because I believe that the majority of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.429
 of you are here because of the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.890
 So much publicity, thank you. 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:44.550
 even so it was worth 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.980
 I'll start here with minecraft is already 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.410
 we have a guide that my loot not to 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.530
 meet here with him on the team 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.640
 I said I'll start here more 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.059
 craft is already spreading my pec way 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.219
 that I created by the technical platform 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:09.030
 for those who do not know the technician 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:10.920
 platform is like a voucher 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
 as if it was not a bad smell of 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.350
 death pecs where you can download and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.170
 install pec mold without the need to 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 install anything in minecraft ie 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.410
 greatly facilitates our work because 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.240
 just download the manual xvii and you open 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.340
 by the batch of the technician without the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.280
 need to open a nursery or anything 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.020
 Good, I'll see if I remember. 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.540
 explain a little more about the technician 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.390
 platform in the next videos of the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.010
 series is cool but coming back to the channel 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.560
 I'll start with this minecraft series 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.920
 but I will not be alone in this I'm going to play 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.250
 in other games I'll already throw 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.460
 some here the water and cross faulty which are 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.340
 two fps games that I really like 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.760
 and I love fps and I'm not good but I 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.800
 love retraced and I will bring here for the 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.119

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.910

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.190
 I'll bring it also recognizes that it's a 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.950
 I play very, very cool 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.260
 a game that I really like is a game 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.100
 survival is based on the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.510
 air mode but two and also based on 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.030
 The biggest craft that is is a blend season is 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.500
 Ball show I loved playing and I'm going 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.020

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.800
 It's that I still have nothing in mind is 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.670
 only those same ones that I'm already in mind 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.710
 already to do but I'll bring more 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.410
 games that this will bring tempted 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.740
 bring releases also because 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.040
 October is complicated that it is very 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.390
 we have a lot to worry about 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.930
 copyright then it gets very 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.460
 difficult but let's see let's go 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.610
 over time we will achieve 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.390
 our sponsorship and we will no longer have 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.090
 copyright issues 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.280
