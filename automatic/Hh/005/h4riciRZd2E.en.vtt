robotic solution for some of the major

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.429 
robotic solution for some of the major
agencies<00:01:19.429> and<00:01:20.429> out<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.450> solution<00:01:21.719> it<00:01:22.229> was

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
agencies and out of that solution it was

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.219 
agencies and out of that solution it was
quite<00:01:22.740> incredible<00:01:22.859> the<00:01:23.429> the<00:01:23.459> actual<00:01:24.329> leap

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
quite incredible the the actual leap

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.020 
quite incredible the the actual leap
forward<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.740> technology<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.490> was<00:01:26.609> produced

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
forward in technology that was produced

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.269 
forward in technology that was produced
to<00:01:27.240> allow<00:01:27.479> D<00:01:27.869> Falls<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.499> used<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.069> roofs

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:29.279 
to allow D Falls to be used in the roofs

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.099 
to allow D Falls to be used in the roofs
and<00:01:29.579> some<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.909> major<00:01:30.090> stadiums<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.899> and

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
and some of the major stadiums there and

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.679 
and some of the major stadiums there and
what<00:01:31.979> we're<00:01:32.100> seeing<00:01:32.279> now<00:01:32.369> 18<00:01:32.999> months<00:01:33.029> on<00:01:33.420> is

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
what we're seeing now 18 months on is

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.499 
what we're seeing now 18 months on is
the<00:01:33.840> next<00:01:34.109> leap<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.649> that<00:01:34.859> technology<00:01:35.219> and<00:01:35.700> its

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the next leap in that technology and its

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.179 
the next leap in that technology and its
really<00:01:36.689> great<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.139> see<00:01:37.319> that<00:01:37.350> Bob<00:01:37.649> Martin<00:01:37.859> is

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
really great to see that Bob Martin is

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.779 
really great to see that Bob Martin is

you would love to put a photographer but
you<00:02:05.939> can't<00:02:06.149> physically<00:02:06.539> put<00:02:06.779> one<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.169> they

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
you can't physically put one and they

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.550 
you can't physically put one and they
are<00:02:08.130> very<00:02:08.640> responsive<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.319> you're

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
are very responsive so it is like you're

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.820 
are very responsive so it is like you're
you<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> photographer

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
you have a photographer

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.370 
you have a photographer
but<00:02:12.580> effectively<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.660> just<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.020> robotic

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
but effectively it's just a robotic

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.500 
but effectively it's just a robotic
camera<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:15.190> could<00:02:15.340> have<00:02:15.550> one<00:02:15.730> anywhere<00:02:16.240> so

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
camera you could have one anywhere so

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.830 
camera you could have one anywhere so
the<00:02:16.870> robotic<00:02:17.410> cameras<00:02:17.800> have<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:19.600> tree<00:02:19.810> just

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
the robotic cameras have the tree just

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.890 
the robotic cameras have the tree just
power<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.680> Ethernet<00:02:21.340> connection<00:02:21.820> that's<00:02:22.690> all

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
power and Ethernet connection that's all

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.600 
power and Ethernet connection that's all
you<00:02:23.110> really<00:02:23.260> need<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.980> might<00:02:24.160> have<00:02:24.340> multiple

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
you really need you might have multiple

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.780 
you really need you might have multiple
cameras<00:02:25.210> mounted<00:02:25.600> on<00:02:25.840> one<00:02:26.050> head<00:02:26.490> for<00:02:27.490> instance

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
cameras mounted on one head for instance

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.280 
cameras mounted on one head for instance
as<00:02:27.970> they<00:02:28.120> had<00:02:28.270> at<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.510> Olympics<00:02:28.930> they<00:02:29.140> had

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
as they had at the Olympics they had

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.040 
as they had at the Olympics they had
several<00:02:30.010> two<00:02:30.640> cameras<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.270> two<00:02:31.480> large<00:02:31.780> zoom

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
several two cameras and two large zoom

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.860 
several two cameras and two large zoom
lenses<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:32.800> one<00:02:33.250> heads<00:02:33.720> everything<00:02:34.720> is

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
lenses on one heads everything is

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.110 
lenses on one heads everything is
powered<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.890> controlled<00:02:35.950> from<00:02:36.580> one<00:02:36.850> Ethernet

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
powered and controlled from one Ethernet

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.090 
powered and controlled from one Ethernet

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
connection and one power connection we

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.920 
connection and one power connection we
are<00:02:39.250> looking<00:02:39.550> for<00:02:39.820> extraordinary<00:02:40.300> pictures

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
are looking for extraordinary pictures

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.600 
are looking for extraordinary pictures
and<00:02:41.200> part<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.860> finding<00:02:42.100> unusual

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
and part of that is finding unusual

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.490 
and part of that is finding unusual
spots<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.330> shoot<00:02:43.510> from<00:02:43.750> these<00:02:43.990> are<00:02:44.200> fleeting

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
spots to shoot from these are fleeting

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.020 
spots to shoot from these are fleeting
moments<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.280> know<00:02:45.400> there's<00:02:45.580> only<00:02:45.760> an<00:02:45.850> hour<00:02:46.000> or

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
moments you know there's only an hour or

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.030 
moments you know there's only an hour or
so<00:02:46.390> each<00:02:46.570> night<00:02:46.870> when<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.170> lights<00:02:47.380> right<00:02:47.680> and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
so each night when the lights right and

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.410 
so each night when the lights right and
only<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.460> many<00:02:48.610> days<00:02:48.880> have<00:02:49.180> sunshine

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
only so many days have sunshine

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.040 
only so many days have sunshine
obviously<00:02:50.140> but<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.580> remote<00:02:52.150> system<00:02:52.630> enables

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
obviously but this remote system enables

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.480 
obviously but this remote system enables
us<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.230> capture<00:02:53.620> them<00:02:53.950> from<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> best

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
us to capture them from the best

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.330 
us to capture them from the best
possible<00:02:54.910> angle<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.540> use<00:02:56.260> those<00:02:56.560> shadows<00:02:57.040> in

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
possible angle to use those shadows in

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.010 
possible angle to use those shadows in
our<00:02:57.430> photography<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.270> produce<00:02:58.600> extraordinary

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
our photography to produce extraordinary
