00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 1 to all and to all welcome to the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.319
 review of the 783 one piece manga 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.269
 had not been for a long time 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.800
 I was uploading reviews is basically because I 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.469
 I left the series since it was done to me 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.540
 quite heavy but what happens that 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.940
 I had the bad luck to leave the series 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.130
 at the best moment of the saga of 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.260
 rose just when they were 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.670
 concluding the battles little by little 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.470
 epic either forum against itch either 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.840
 diamond against cairo or I left the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.669
 series in the fucking best time but 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.230
 well , nothing happens, the matter is that 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.910
 I've seen the series again and come back 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.680
 the day and as long as you have 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.260
 time I can bring you the reviews 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.469
 weekly wampis and good what has 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.850
 passed in this 783 chapter of one piece 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.289
 for the truth that has been a chapter 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.450
 I liked it a lot because it has 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.000
 put together the conversation part with the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.770
 part of action pretty well in this 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.960
 occasion we are going to comment a lot of things 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.270
 very important about this chapter and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.399
 first he talks to us about the side 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.710
 side it surprises me very much that always 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.600
 that is, escaping death 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.120
 at all times in the latter 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.100
 chapters we have seen like 2 flamingo 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.560
 to hit him by all means the blow 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.260
 end to the side and really side always 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.690
 escapes the bastard 1s but basically 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.240
 either by the ruv or by the help of 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.730
 the light mates either by light and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.860
 either for any reason always side 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.840
 he escapes the final blow that they have 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.420
 to hit Sunday to end the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.730
 life of this one that seems very cool to me that 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.010
 part this chapter give you the option to 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.200
 side of really getting saved completely 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.500
 from the hands of don flamingo with the grouper 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.530
 fact of going down that is to say descending from 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.510
 floor thanks to the help of this barbarism 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.630
 I do not believe that it was called this way this fruit 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.010
 who ate bartolomÃ© or the boss - 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.020
 basically it can be we have stairs 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.700
 to make the grape be saved by 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.490
 complete on the other hand I understand the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.190
 decision of now really stay at 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.630
 let 's see how dies 2 flamingo as 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.940
 the water been trying on these 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.130
 last years revenge for the death of 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.290
 heart and come stress out of 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.510
 heart always tried to bust the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.479
 face to Sunday has always tried 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.360
 so let him die really 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.460
 don flamingo and of course it's better 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.160
 and not to see how that person dies to the 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.950
 how much you hate or really risk your 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.320
 life to see that in quotes dream 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.030
 from seeing die to Sunday I think the 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.830
 second option is more valid and that's why 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.950
 in this chapter he has decided to stay 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.170
 to see if flamingo is defeated by 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.780
 lucy or vice versa obviously if you have 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.310
 clad flamingos defeat when move and 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.930
 what happens that the flamingos finally has 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.580
 managed to strike the final blow at 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.070
 side and the new one can do nothing for 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.600
 save yourself since the slope practically 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.370
 it's practically useless not currently 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.440
 can not do practically nothing is 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.090
 very busted so good we leave you 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.950
 the topic on the side I think that what you 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.200
 I have to comment on this character 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.180
 let's talk a little about knee that 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.489
 happens a pretty curious fact happened a 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.140
 pretty interesting scene that's not good 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.360
 to better give it more importance than the one 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.400
 should but let's document the and it 's 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.160
 there is basically a part in which 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.870
 cavendish gives the jacket to robin and 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.390
 that cavendish really wants to stay 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.160
 with side to look at that death of gift 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.100
 flamingo and clear when he gives the 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.320
 jacket to cavendish to robing is made 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.240
 emphasize a vignette on wounds 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.400
 that it has in the back 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.740
 then you think that somehow it's going to 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.660
 have a healing power the jacket is a 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.130
 this really I think it has nothing 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.110
 what to see I just think that it has 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.120
 emphasized the wounds of let's say 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.460
 robbie just when cavendish has 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.320
 given the jacket because those wounds to 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.600
 be covered with the jacket the most 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.160
 difficult to get infected then by 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.990
 I just think that it has been done 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.730
 stress on the wound when that fucking 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.740
 cavendish the die in the fucking jacket 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.970
 rob i think it's just that and nothing 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.280
 I think the only thing that I need 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.020
 comment of this chapter is that ending 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.000
 well we have to comment before it 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.680
 forget the battle itself what we have 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.960
 seen a bit of action between lufti and 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.280
 Sunday where really in this chapter 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.620
 it has been seen how flamingos have 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.110
 enough superiority against lutfi already 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.420
 that the flamingos has hit more blows 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.430
 light and stronger in fact than those who 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.750
 Lucia has hit Sunday in this 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.360
 chapter so the increase has 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.340
 enough superiority not flamingo cental 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.260
 uci but I think that with what happens to 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.540
 end of this fucking chapter is going to give 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.520
 for let's say you're going to go around this 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.880
 combat since it looked like it's going to 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.190
 activate the fourth evil 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.650
 oh my god, we really want to see 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.110
 What does the fourth gear really do? 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.060
 a reminder for those who do not 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.770
 you agree the second gear allows you 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.070
 pump blood more quickly 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.840
 making it really faster to look and 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.220
 the third gear what makes lucy 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.230
 is that it allows you to stretch 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.360
 limbs allows you to inflate some 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.470
 tips a tip to make 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.560
 that those three lives be stronger 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.420
 then what will the fourth gear because 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.790
 well I really have several options 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.310
 or that fourth gear what it does is 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.960
 comes back and like in the third brand 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.520
 that his arm is swollen but with everything 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.950
 the body without a chassis becomes mega 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.410
 giant or just the fourth gear 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.780
 what you date is we imagine how he sees 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.910
 the blood so fast but so extremely 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.400
 fast that even your body not only 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.080
 throws steam but it starts to burn me 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.120
 I think it's one of those two options or 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.920
 there can not be more options can not 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.810
 anything really be different 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.280
 We will see what we are surprised with now 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.480
 that nothing I think this the most important thing 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.740
 I have to comment on this 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.840
 chapter I think he left me nothing 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.910
 simply makes a reminder that 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.830
 yes or yes this skill that used 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.910
 this skill that the actors the side 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.650
 of the fourth 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.750
 It is an avenue that in some way you 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.820
 harms why I think he has 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.440
 I been saving as the harms 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.090
 because I think basically like 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.100
 he did the second march that what he 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.350
 he made the light and he basically cut it 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.240
 the life time so nothing I think that 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.980
 he left me nothing to comment what I said 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.210
 as he always commented that it appeared 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.860
 this chapter that you have found this 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.020
 review your predictions 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.160
 give me I like this video you like the 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.900
 I really think that helps a lot to 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.640
 keep going subscribe for not 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.600
 lose you any video and well I think that 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.700
 say goodbye to me here we see it in the next 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.700
 video come kids until next time 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.210
 do not
