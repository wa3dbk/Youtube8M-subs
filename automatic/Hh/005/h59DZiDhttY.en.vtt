00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 today we start the first part of this 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.390
 car I quote in the second part we will do 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.429
 the baby that goes in this concept is 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.759
 very easy to do and just need rubber 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.010
 white blue eva and hot tail here the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.320
 pattern you have on our website 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.610
 Well, this is the pattern you have 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.980
 on our website 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.670
 in cakes point is to do the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.060
 pram 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.330
 we're going to need that eva rubber pattern 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.869
 white and rubber eva blue the pattern has 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.710
 put cardboard or otherwise cardboard 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.930
 hot if you want you do not want to use rubber 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.980
 eva for some ornament because you use sticks 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.320
 of pipes and tape opecu lina good 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.420
 look pattern is divided into two one 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.830
 part rose and in a blue part the part 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.080
 pink is the one that corresponds to the stroller 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.059
 and the blue corresponds to 9 that we will do in 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.769
 another video 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.350
 Well, we started cutting all the 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.350
 parts that correspond to the stroller 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.920
 and 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.170
 once we have cut them 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.200
 we went to rubber eva for that with a pencil 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.630
 we border our pattern in this case is 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.180
 one side of the car you see that 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.760
 it has some points a dashed line 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.040
 inside that's where we'll have to put 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.410
 in the central part where the line 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.410
 discontinuous good now we cut 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.710
 all our eva rubber chips 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.360
 We are cutting out in blue eva rubber and 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.390
 once we have done that we pass 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.100
 also to cardboard because we need 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.200
 that the eva rubber is firm then 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.490
 we use a cardboard cut it to the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.490
 height of the paste to the rubber eva 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.120
 we already have both sides of the stroller 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.120
 now let's do the central part 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.340
 once we do the central part the 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.680
 we are not hitting the edge because 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.360
 then it would be very difficult if not leaving 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.760
 like a finger where it said that it was the 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.880
 dashed line, we 're going to hit it 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.880
 there 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.870
 ah 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.420
 once we have pasted one of the 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.860
 lateral paste the other is very simple 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.900
 what we have to put is a bit of 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.989
 hot glue on the edge and put the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.020
 top over well, well, we do that 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.790
 we put with the hot the lid we have 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.069
 first as up to half and then the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.569
 another part so as not to put too much 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.569
 of hot glue to go little by little 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.090
 Well now let's start with the 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.330
 wheels we have to cut four wheels 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.650
 in eva rubber we will do it in white and 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.060
 then we will also put each 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.060
 a cardboard behind 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.810
 to put the wheels in the car I'm going 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.510
 to teach a trick 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.220
 the two wheels are supposed to go like this and 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.110
 you see 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.850
 to get them to stay exactly 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.620
 Like what we do is mark as per 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.250
 where is the side of the car of one of 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.520
 the wheels and now these signs the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.930
 we went to the other four wheels 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.120
 we have more to adjust then the 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.450
 signals when we paste we have the 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.450
 wheels 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.780
 You see how we have adjusted them well 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.780
 we do the same with the other side 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.010
 we already have the car's casing now 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.860
 we would have more to do a little more 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.050
 strong to put it as a trim 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.640
 in the part above you see that 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.030
 It will also disguise if it has 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:48.680
 stayed regular so we paste it here 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:50.150
 missing with the cardboard underneath is 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.770
 It is also important to note that although 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.470
 the central structure we have not stuck 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.570
 to the edge now we could cut the edge 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.700
 so that we will be right in but good 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.640
 we leave it that good now before 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.740
 put the wheels well then now fix 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.660
 with a small frame cutter ones 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.120
 hearts in the rubber eva i use a 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.030
 cutter but you can also use the 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.570
 heart that comes in the good pattern 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.420
 Well now let's put a blue heart 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.660
 in the middle of each wheel as if it were the 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.660
 axis 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.110
 to continue decorating we will use 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:32.419
 we can use and said piculín a or 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.870
 with a zig zag scissors we cut the 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.750
 rubber eva and cut again then 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.060
 we are left as if it were then piculín a 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.530
 then let's put in the part 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.969
 side 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.520
 we started putting the top 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:49.129
 we put some hot glue and 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.800
 we stick the rubber white eva 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.389
 and we do the same thing transversally of 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.809
 way that we have somehow 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:58.639
 differentiated the hood of the car 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:02.569
 you can decorate as you wish I have not 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.699
 happened this but let's go each one has 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:07.879
 your imagination can you if you want to put 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:10.369
 as it doubles I have decided to put it 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:14.409
 but I could not have put it too 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:14.409
 we put another embellisher on the edge 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.240
 We cut an eva rubber strip to make 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.670
 like the handlebar we can also have 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.440
 used a clean pipes we put with the 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.750
 hot in the center and we doubled 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.620
 we have more to hit on each side of 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.620
 our stroller 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.770
 and 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:55.040
 finally we finish putting some 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.040
 white eva rubber hearts 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.220
