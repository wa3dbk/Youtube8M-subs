gives you the practicality behind it and
it's<00:00:19.199> funny<00:00:19.410> because<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.770> never<00:00:19.949> even<00:00:20.039> knew

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
it's funny because I never even knew

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.920 
it's funny because I never even knew
that<00:00:20.730> was<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> right<00:00:21.060> recommendation<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.900> I

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
that was the right recommendation so I

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.859 
that was the right recommendation so I
wanted<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> ask<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:23.240> well<00:00:24.240> then<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.449> retha<00:00:24.750> look

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
back into in about 10 years ago and it

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.650 
back into in about 10 years ago and it
came<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:28.050> 2003<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.849> changed<00:00:30.359> people's

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.720 
but eat for health which was written
more<00:00:39.480> recently<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.920> has<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.129> much<00:00:41.399> higher<00:00:41.430> rate

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
more recently it has a much higher rate

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.610 
more recently it has a much higher rate
of<00:00:42.030> turning<00:00:42.629> people<00:00:42.989> over<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.350> make<00:00:43.500> the

of turning people over to make the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.010 
of turning people over to make the
change<00:00:43.920> necessary<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:44.940> logic<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
change necessary because logic and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.380 
change necessary because logic and
science<00:00:46.050> isn't<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.920> enough<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.250> people

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
science isn't just enough for people

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.430 
science isn't just enough for people
because<00:00:48.390> they<00:00:48.539> make<00:00:48.719> their<00:00:48.899> decisions<00:00:48.930> based

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
because they make their decisions based

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.529 
because they make their decisions based
on<00:00:49.590> feelings<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.190> emotions<00:00:50.610> unless<00:00:51.360> you

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
on feelings and emotions unless you

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.750 
on feelings and emotions unless you
teach<00:00:51.780> them<00:00:51.989> sufficiently<00:00:52.500> about<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.129> how

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
teach them sufficiently about the how

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.760 
teach them sufficiently about the how

human addiction health food addiction
affects<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.430> really<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.730> make<00:00:56.820> judgments

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
affects there really to make judgments

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.660 
affects there really to make judgments
and<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.989> make<00:00:58.140> choices<00:00:58.340> then<00:00:59.340> they're<00:00:59.520> not

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and to make choices then they're not

going to give in move move to the next

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.260 
going to give in move move to the next
level<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.170> that's<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.670> problem<00:01:02.940> need<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
level and that's so the problem need to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.520 
level and that's so the problem need to
live<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.780> what<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.930> little<00:01:04.170> too<00:01:04.260> advanced

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.499 
in a few different steps I don't have to
jump<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> hundred<00:01:17.460> percent<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.119> yeah<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.299> on

they're all the myths and misinformation
has<00:01:23.130> caused<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> way<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.150> do

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
has caused them to think the way to do

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.030 
has caused them to think the way to do
another<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.229> terminal<00:01:25.619> where<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> people

another the terminal where the people

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
another the terminal where the people
that<00:01:26.159> actually<00:01:26.220> make<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> significant

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
that actually make the significant

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.819 
that actually make the significant
dietary<00:01:27.420> changes<00:01:27.689> could<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.900> much<00:01:28.080> higher<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
dietary changes could be much higher and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.109 
dietary changes could be much higher and
if<00:01:29.100> they've<00:01:29.310> learned<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.729> made<00:01:29.939> some

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.760 
months and they infect Ronnie Valentine
that<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.540> is<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.660> hundred<00:03:52.900> percent<00:03:53.020> other

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
that is it it is a hundred percent other

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.260 
that is it it is a hundred percent other
people<00:03:54.190> are<00:03:54.250> relatively<00:03:54.640> healthy<00:03:54.880> and

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
people are relatively healthy and

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.880 
people are relatively healthy and
they're<00:03:55.930> not<00:03:56.080> ready<00:03:56.320> for<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.530> huge

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
they're not ready for that huge

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.500 
they're not ready for that huge
commitment<00:03:57.220> but<00:03:57.790> they<00:03:57.910> do<00:03:57.970> have<00:03:58.240> to<00:03:58.360> make<00:03:58.480> a

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
commitment but they do have to make a

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.350 
commitment but they do have to make a
significant<00:03:59.050> change<00:03:59.080> in<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.470> wife<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.860> so<00:04:00.640> so

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
significant change in the wife and so so

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.420 
significant change in the wife and so so
I<00:04:01.390> think<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:01.810> we're<00:04:02.680> developing<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:03.250> tools

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
I think that we're developing the tools

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.130 
I think that we're developing the tools
what<00:04:03.730> people<00:04:04.000> can<00:04:04.150> really<00:04:04.750> feel<00:04:05.110> the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
what people can really feel the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.900 
what people can really feel the
information<00:04:05.770> is<00:04:05.860> customized<00:04:06.460> to<00:04:06.610> what<00:04:06.670> their

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
information is customized to what their

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.730 
information is customized to what their
particular<00:04:07.300> needs<00:04:07.510> are<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:08.410> is<00:04:08.560> less<00:04:08.710> chance

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
particular needs are so is less chance

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.740 
particular needs are so is less chance
people<00:04:09.310> will<00:04:09.430> just<00:04:09.580> but<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.240> worst<00:04:10.360> thing<00:04:10.540> is

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
people will just but the worst thing is

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.000 
people will just but the worst thing is
people<00:04:10.870> just<00:04:11.170> throw<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.500> whole<00:04:11.620> thing<00:04:11.680> out

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
people just throw the whole thing out

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.740 
people just throw the whole thing out
the<00:04:12.250> door<00:04:12.460> and<00:04:12.760> I'll<00:04:12.970> make<00:04:13.090> any<00:04:13.240> change<00:04:13.570> and

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
the door and I'll make any change and

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.970 
the door and I'll make any change and
then<00:04:13.840> get<00:04:13.990> some<00:04:14.170> develop<00:04:14.650> some<00:04:14.770> severe

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
then get some develop some severe

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.580 
then get some develop some severe
medical<00:04:15.100> condition
