00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.590 

so<00:00:00.480> what<00:00:00.750> I<00:00:00.780> get

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:04.600 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.320 

display<00:00:05.600> and<00:00:06.200> what<00:00:06.770> it's<00:00:07.040> showing<00:00:07.160> is<00:00:07.880> color

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
display and what it's showing is color

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.470 
display and what it's showing is color
and<00:00:08.920> rapid<00:00:09.920> response<00:00:10.070> time<00:00:10.639> so<00:00:10.969> this<00:00:11.090> is<00:00:11.150> very

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
and rapid response time so this is very

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.350 
and rapid response time so this is very
different<00:00:11.780> than

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
different than

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.420 
different than
traditional<00:00:14.320> reflective<00:00:14.799> displays<00:00:15.160> in<00:00:15.370> the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
traditional reflective displays in the

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.340 
traditional reflective displays in the
marketplace<00:00:15.940> and<00:00:16.600> it's<00:00:16.779> very<00:00:16.930> different<00:00:17.140> from

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
marketplace and it's very different from

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.320 
marketplace and it's very different from
liquid<00:00:17.710> crystal<00:00:18.130> display<00:00:18.490> in<00:00:18.760> the<00:00:18.970> sense<00:00:19.210> that

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
liquid crystal display in the sense that

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.560 
liquid crystal display in the sense that
it's<00:00:19.630> super<00:00:20.500> low<00:00:20.710> power<00:00:20.980> so<00:00:21.820> not<00:00:22.180> only<00:00:22.300> is<00:00:22.540> it

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
it's super low power so not only is it

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.749 
it's super low power so not only is it
super<00:00:23.020> low<00:00:23.290> power<00:00:23.529> but<00:00:23.890> it<00:00:24.040> is<00:00:24.250> also

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
super low power but it is also

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.339 
super low power but it is also
reflective<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:25.480> that<00:00:25.630> means<00:00:25.869> you're<00:00:26.110> going<00:00:26.259> to

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
reflective so that means you're going to

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.800 
reflective so that means you're going to
be<00:00:26.439> able<00:00:26.529> to<00:00:26.710> read<00:00:26.890> your<00:00:26.919> content<00:00:27.810> outside

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
be able to read your content outside

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.040 
be able to read your content outside
while<00:00:29.619> saving<00:00:29.980> power<00:00:30.609> and<00:00:31.060> that's<00:00:31.420> a<00:00:31.570> Mirasol

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
while saving power and that's a Mirasol

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.540 
while saving power and that's a Mirasol
display

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.520 

so<00:00:37.060> it's<00:00:37.180> readable<00:00:37.450> outdoors<00:00:37.960> under<00:00:38.260> direct

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
so it's readable outdoors under direct

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.020 
so it's readable outdoors under direct
sunlight<00:00:39.010> I<00:00:39.130> do<00:00:39.250> direct<00:00:39.520> sunlight<00:00:39.730> actually

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
sunlight I do direct sunlight actually

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.940 
sunlight I do direct sunlight actually
the<00:00:40.300> more<00:00:40.510> light<00:00:40.720> that<00:00:40.750> this<00:00:41.440> display

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
the more light that this display

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.490 
the more light that this display
receives<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.790> more<00:00:43.000> crisp<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.660> readable<00:00:44.350> the

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
receives the more crisp and readable the

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.520 
receives the more crisp and readable the
images<00:00:45.040> because<00:00:45.460> it<00:00:45.700> actually<00:00:45.940> uses<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:47.260> Sun

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
images because it actually uses the Sun

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.770 
images because it actually uses the Sun
and<00:00:47.770> they<00:00:47.860> reflect<00:00:48.370> light<00:00:48.520> back

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
and they reflect light back

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.110 
and they reflect light back
so<00:00:49.840> it's<00:00:50.020> super<00:00:50.559> readable<00:00:50.920> but<00:00:51.550> in<00:00:51.820> dark

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
so it's super readable but in dark

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.150 
so it's super readable but in dark
situations<00:00:52.360> say<00:00:53.020> you<00:00:53.079> were<00:00:53.230> in<00:00:53.350> pitch<00:00:53.559> dark

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
situations say you were in pitch dark

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.549 
situations say you were in pitch dark
we<00:00:54.370> offer<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.789> front<00:00:55.180> light<00:00:55.360> solution<00:00:55.930> so<00:00:56.410> that

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
we offer a front light solution so that

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.380 
we offer a front light solution so that
would<00:00:56.680> illuminate<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.190> front<00:00:58.030> part<00:00:58.210> of<00:00:58.329> the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
would illuminate the front part of the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.009 
would illuminate the front part of the
screen<00:00:58.750> as<00:00:59.469> well<00:00:59.800> and<00:01:00.430> we<00:01:00.670> also<00:01:00.820> have<00:01:01.390> touch

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
screen as well and we also have touch

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.859 
screen as well and we also have touch
capability<00:01:02.769> so<00:01:03.399> it's<00:01:03.579> all<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:04.150> expectations

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
capability so it's all the expectations

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.740 
capability so it's all the expectations
one<00:01:05.440> would<00:01:05.650> have<00:01:05.830> with<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.159> heart<00:01:06.580> display<00:01:07.030> but

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
one would have with a heart display but

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.100 
one would have with a heart display but
it's<00:01:07.899> really<00:01:08.290> cutting<00:01:08.470> into<00:01:08.740> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it's really cutting into that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.170 
it's really cutting into that
battery<00:01:11.110> train<00:01:11.680> that<00:01:12.159> we<00:01:12.280> experience<00:01:12.700> liquid

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
battery train that we experience liquid

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.590 
battery train that we experience liquid
crystalline<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.950> sure<00:01:15.130> would<00:01:15.430> be<00:01:15.610> touchscreen

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
crystalline so sure would be touchscreen

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.170 
crystalline so sure would be touchscreen
and<00:01:16.950> privacy<00:01:17.950> based<00:01:18.130> displays<00:01:18.700> with<00:01:19.030> that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
and privacy based displays with that

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.880 
and privacy based displays with that
effect<00:01:19.510> readability<00:01:19.870> that<00:01:20.260> we<00:01:20.500> are<00:01:20.620> seeing

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
effect readability that we are seeing

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.890 
effect readability that we are seeing
some<00:01:22.080> heaters<00:01:23.080> with<00:01:24.360> touchscreens<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.540> most

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
some heaters with touchscreens and most

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.020 
some heaters with touchscreens and most
people<00:01:26.200> don't<00:01:26.380> like<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.710> later<00:01:26.979> you<00:01:27.940> know

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
people don't like the later you know

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.999 
people don't like the later you know
that's<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.390> very<00:01:28.600> good<00:01:28.840> question<00:01:29.080> because<00:01:29.560> any

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
that's a very good question because any

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.580 
that's a very good question because any
type<00:01:30.340> of<00:01:30.369> touchscreen<00:01:31.119> technology<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:32.350> going

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
type of touchscreen technology is going

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.100 
type of touchscreen technology is going
to<00:01:32.650> be<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.830> layered<00:01:33.160> over<00:01:33.460> but<00:01:34.150> we<00:01:34.390> have<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.660> shown

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
to be a layered over but we have a shown

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.190 
to be a layered over but we have a shown
touchscreen<00:01:35.680> technologies<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.880> we<00:01:37.840> do<00:01:37.990> not

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
touchscreen technologies and we do not

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.650 
touchscreen technologies and we do not
see<00:01:38.619> any<00:01:39.070> kind<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.340> compromise<00:01:39.790> aesthetic

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
see any kind of compromise aesthetic

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.249 
see any kind of compromise aesthetic

smartphones<00:02:06.460> are<00:02:07.350> definitely<00:02:08.350> on<00:02:08.470> the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
smartphones are definitely on the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.250 
smartphones are definitely on the
roadmap<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.880> main<00:02:10.090> focus<00:02:10.539> now<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.810> getting

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
roadmap the main focus now is getting

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.690 
roadmap the main focus now is getting
this<00:02:11.500> vibe<00:02:11.739> like<00:02:11.800> seven-inch<00:02:12.640> XGA

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
this vibe like seven-inch XGA

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.430 
this vibe like seven-inch XGA

factors<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.800> think<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.760> know<00:02:19.940> that

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
factors and and I think so you know that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.630 
factors and and I think so you know that
they<00:02:20.330> dedicated<00:02:20.840> e-reader<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.980> something

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
they dedicated e-reader is something

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.220 
they dedicated e-reader is something
that<00:02:22.790> doesn't<00:02:23.239> have<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.390> lot<00:02:23.599> of<00:02:23.810> functionality

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
that doesn't have a lot of functionality

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.350 
that doesn't have a lot of functionality
is<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.010> imagine<00:02:25.489> if<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.700> had<00:02:25.849> this<00:02:26.090> is<00:02:26.330> a

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
is so imagine if you had this is a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.600 
is so imagine if you had this is a
lighter<00:02:26.660> on<00:02:26.989> key<00:02:27.200> readers<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:28.099> can<00:02:28.129> actually

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
lighter on key readers you can actually

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.850 
lighter on key readers you can actually
access<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:29.030> controller

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
access that controller

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.420 
access that controller
video<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.740> then<00:02:32.860> we<00:02:32.950> start<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.220> fall<00:02:33.370> in

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
video and and then we start to fall in

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.560 
video and and then we start to fall in
tableau<00:02:33.820> so<00:02:34.090> commuters<00:02:34.570> left<00:02:34.840> happens<00:02:35.230> right

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
tableau so commuters left happens right

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.450 
tableau so commuters left happens right
and<00:02:37.570> then<00:02:37.780> do<00:02:37.960> you<00:02:38.050> have<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.320> knees<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:39.340> you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
and then do you have the knees can you

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.010 
and then do you have the knees can you
scale<00:02:39.700> this<00:02:39.850> up<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.150> larger<00:02:40.600> like<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> nine

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
scale this up to a larger like a nine

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.140 
scale this up to a larger like a nine
inch<00:02:41.260> or<00:02:41.530> 7<00:02:41.890> inch<00:02:41.980> right<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:42.850> there's<00:02:43.030> no

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
inch or 7 inch right so there's no

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.900 
inch or 7 inch right so there's no
reason<00:02:43.750> why<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.380> technology<00:02:44.910> fundamentally

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
reason why the technology fundamentally

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.480 
reason why the technology fundamentally
can't<00:02:46.180> scale<00:02:46.690> but<00:02:47.440> our<00:02:47.590> business<00:02:47.860> model<00:02:48.400> is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
can't scale but our business model is

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.550 
can't scale but our business model is
really<00:02:48.820> focused<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.570> it's<00:02:49.750> in<00:02:49.870> all<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.080> medium

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
really focused on it's in all the medium

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.190 
really focused on it's in all the medium
format<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:51.940> 5.7<00:02:52.750> inch<00:02:52.900> has<00:02:53.020> been<00:02:53.170> a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
format and so this 5.7 inch has been a

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.800 
format and so this 5.7 inch has been a
lot<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.490> thinking<00:02:54.490> into<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:54.910> I<00:02:55.090> mean<00:02:55.210> else<00:02:55.510> in

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
lot of thinking into this I mean else in

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.050 
lot of thinking into this I mean else in
that<00:02:56.530> display<00:02:56.980> is<00:02:57.190> super<00:02:58.090> lightweight

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
that display is super lightweight

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.100 
that display is super lightweight
comfortable<00:03:01.060> devices<00:03:01.570> on<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.780> marketplace

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
comfortable devices on the marketplace

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.710 
comfortable devices on the marketplace
are<00:03:02.530> really<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.070> excess

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
are really in excess

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.910 
are really in excess
and<00:03:05.720> that's<00:03:05.959> really<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.349> lot<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.620> weight<00:03:06.739> when

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
and that's really a lot of weight when

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.380 
and that's really a lot of weight when
you're<00:03:07.010> already<00:03:07.280> carrying<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.730> cellphone<00:03:07.970> and

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
you're already carrying a cellphone and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.559 
you're already carrying a cellphone and
possibly<00:03:08.840> carrying<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.319> lot

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
possibly carrying a lot

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.839 
possibly carrying a lot
already<00:03:10.079> so<00:03:10.739> we<00:03:10.829> think<00:03:11.010> form<00:03:11.370> factors<00:03:11.730> that

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
already so we think form factors that

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.699 
already so we think form factors that
are<00:03:11.999> super<00:03:12.359> thin<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:12.659> super<00:03:13.290> light<00:03:13.469> are

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
are super thin and super light are

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.230 
are super thin and super light are
really<00:03:13.950> gonna<00:03:14.069> be<00:03:14.180> realized

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
really gonna be realized

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.330 
really gonna be realized
and<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.480> technologies<00:03:17.020> from<00:03:17.340> welcome

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
and the technologies from welcome

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.090 
and the technologies from welcome
welcome<00:03:18.670> in<00:03:19.060> sociology<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.290> whole<00:03:20.470> entire

welcome in sociology to the whole entire
