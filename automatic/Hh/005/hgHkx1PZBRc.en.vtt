00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
pretty easy one now this guide is

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.890 
pretty easy one now this guide is
assuming<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.390> already<00:00:30.420> know<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
strategy for the normal version so I'm

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.610 
strategy for the normal version so I'm
not<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> go<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> great<00:00:34.050> detail<00:00:34.410> about

not going to go in a great detail about

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.799 
not going to go in a great detail about
that<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.910> focus<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> heroic

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
that but we can focus on the heroic

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.410 
that but we can focus on the heroic

worry about two things and there's a
slight<00:01:06.659> change<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> static<00:01:07.920> burst<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:08.970> static

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
slight change to static burst but static

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.490 
slight change to static burst but static
burst<00:01:09.479> works<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> same<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> does<00:01:10.350> in

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
burst works the same way as it does in

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.179 
burst works the same way as it does in
normal<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.610> will<00:01:12.000> apply<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.570> both<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:16.189> static

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
wound to the tank that takes it and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.429

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.770 
something called the lightning strike
and<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.520> is<00:03:41.610> cast<00:03:42.120> at<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.390> same<00:03:42.540> time<00:03:42.720> as

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
and it is cast at the same time as

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.040 
and it is cast at the same time as
lightning<00:03:43.230> storm<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.730> it'll<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.750> lasts

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
lightning storm and it'll and it lasts

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.410 
lightning storm and it'll and it lasts
the<00:03:46.230> same<00:03:46.410> time<00:03:46.970> amount<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.030> time<00:03:48.180> as

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
the same time amount of time as

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.630 
the same time amount of time as
lightning<00:03:48.780> storm<00:03:48.990> so<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:50.130> just<00:03:50.340> something

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
lightning storm so it's just something

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.550 
lightning storm so it's just something
new<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.330> pay<00:03:51.960> attention<00:03:52.080> to

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
new that you have to pay attention to

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.090 
new that you have to pay attention to
during<00:03:53.010> lightning<00:03:53.130> storm<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.750> this<00:03:55.100> this

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
during lightning storm and this this

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.400 
during lightning storm and this this
makes<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.550> a<00:03:56.730> lot<00:03:57.030> harder<00:03:57.090> because<00:03:57.990> you<00:03:58.230> can't

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
makes it a lot harder because you can't

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.140 
makes it a lot harder because you can't
just<00:03:58.560> stack<00:03:58.830> up<00:03:59.010> in<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.220> middle<00:03:59.460> and<00:03:59.670> hide

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
just stack up in the middle and hide

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.910 
just stack up in the middle and hide
underneath<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.600> priest<00:04:00.810> bubble<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.320> be

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
underneath a priest bubble and be

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.070 
underneath a priest bubble and be
unhappy<00:04:02.070> because<00:04:02.850> you're<00:04:03.750> going<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.020> be

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
unhappy because you're going to be

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.020 
unhappy because you're going to be
taking<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.740> lot<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:05.490> damage<00:04:05.610> from<00:04:05.880> these

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
taking a lot of damage from these

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.810 
taking a lot of damage from these
lightning<00:04:06.630> strikes<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:08.250> it's<00:04:08.490> going<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.640> place

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
lightning strikes so it's going to place

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.060 
lightning strikes so it's going to place
down<00:04:09.030> several<00:04:09.360> beams<00:04:09.600> of<00:04:09.840> lightning<00:04:10.170> very

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
down several beams of lightning very

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.300 
down several beams of lightning very
thick<00:04:11.400> lightning<00:04:11.790> beams<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:13.130> from<00:04:14.130> those

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
thick lightning beams and from those

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.740 
thick lightning beams and from those
lightning<00:04:14.490> beams<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:15.360> gonna<00:04:15.540> be<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:15.660> little

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
lightning beams is gonna be a little

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.140 
lightning beams is gonna be a little
static<00:04:16.320> sparks<00:04:17.220> going<00:04:17.489> out<00:04:17.609> everywhere<00:04:17.910> or

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
static sparks going out everywhere or

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.650 
static sparks going out everywhere or
lightning<00:04:18.480> sparks<00:04:18.810> going<00:04:19.080> out<00:04:19.170> everywhere

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
lightning sparks going out everywhere

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.680 
lightning sparks going out everywhere
and<00:04:20.010> what<00:04:21.010> you<00:04:21.070> have<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.250> do<00:04:21.370> walk<00:04:22.210> away<00:04:22.390> from

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
and what you have to do walk away from

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.300 
and what you have to do walk away from
them<00:04:22.840> don't<00:04:23.440> get<00:04:23.590> hit<00:04:23.710> by<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.860> lightning<00:04:24.220> and

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
them don't get hit by the lightning and

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.530 
them don't get hit by the lightning and
you're<00:04:25.120> great<00:04:25.530> what<00:04:26.530> we<00:04:26.710> found<00:04:27.070> works<00:04:27.610> is<00:04:27.880> if

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
you're great what we found works is if

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.450 
you're great what we found works is if
you<00:04:28.690> have<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:28.840> priest<00:04:29.080> level<00:04:29.320> down<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.890> can<00:04:30.100> run

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
you have a priest level down you can run

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.980 
you have a priest level down you can run
around<00:04:30.550> within<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.180> priest<00:04:31.360> bubble<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:31.780> kind

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
around within the priest bubble and kind

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.780 
around within the priest bubble and kind
of<00:04:32.080> avoid<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.920> lightning<00:04:33.220> strike<00:04:33.760> the

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
of avoid the lightning strike the

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.650 
of avoid the lightning strike the
lightning<00:04:34.300> sparks<00:04:35.200> but<00:04:35.950> still<00:04:36.480> you<00:04:37.480> might

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
lightning sparks but still you might

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.900 
lightning sparks but still you might
have<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:37.990> run<00:04:38.140> out<00:04:38.320> from<00:04:38.530> that<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.610> avoid

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
have to run out from that and to avoid

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.960 
have to run out from that and to avoid
it<00:04:40.030> because<00:04:40.240> there<00:04:40.900> will<00:04:41.050> be<00:04:41.200> multiple<00:04:41.970> sparks

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
it because there will be multiple sparks

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.760 
it because there will be multiple sparks
colliding<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:43.810> it's<00:04:44.200> going<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.380> be<00:04:44.500> hard<00:04:44.680> to

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
colliding and it's going to be hard to

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.560 
colliding and it's going to be hard to
stay<00:04:44.920> in<00:04:45.160> one<00:04:45.190> spot<00:04:45.340> especially<00:04:46.150> one<00:04:46.300> really

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
stay in one spot especially one really

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.620 
stay in one spot especially one really
tiny<00:04:46.780> so<00:04:47.700> you<00:04:48.700> just<00:04:48.850> got<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.060> avoid<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.480> and

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
tiny so you just got to avoid it and

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.370 
tiny so you just got to avoid it and
it'll<00:04:50.230> be<00:04:50.410> great<00:04:50.910> for<00:04:51.910> for<00:04:52.690> normal<00:04:52.990> mechanics

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
it'll be great for for normal mechanics

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.170 
it'll be great for for normal mechanics
it's<00:04:53.740> all<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.130> same<00:04:54.310> you<00:04:54.850> know<00:04:54.940> all<00:04:55.060> the

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
it's all the same you know all the

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.120 
it's all the same you know all the
normal<00:04:55.360> mechanics<00:04:55.840> are<00:04:55.960> still<00:04:56.200> in<00:04:56.320> there<00:04:56.500> you

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
normal mechanics are still in there you

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.760 
normal mechanics are still in there you
still<00:04:57.460> have<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:58.840> know<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.140> water<00:04:59.380> the

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
still have you know the water the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.530 
still have you know the water the
conductive<00:05:00.130> water<00:05:00.340> is<00:05:00.490> still<00:05:00.730> increasing

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
conductive water is still increasing

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.080 
conductive water is still increasing
your<00:05:01.810> damage<00:05:02.200> and<00:05:02.410> healing<00:05:02.650> by<00:05:03.460> forty<00:05:03.820> percent

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
your damage and healing by forty percent

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.370 
your damage and healing by forty percent
so<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.390> want<00:05:04.600> to<00:05:04.660> make<00:05:04.690> sure<00:05:04.810> you're<00:05:05.050> standing

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
so you want to make sure you're standing

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.700 
so you want to make sure you're standing
that<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.830> you<00:05:06.550> still<00:05:06.760> have<00:05:07.030> to<00:05:07.270> deal<00:05:07.450> with

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
that and you still have to deal with

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.440 
that and you still have to deal with
focus<00:05:08.710> lightning<00:05:09.040> which<00:05:09.250> is<00:05:09.430> another<00:05:10.120> spell

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
focus lightning which is another spell

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.420 
focus lightning which is another spell
that<00:05:10.600> puts<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.560> lightning<00:05:11.920> Fisher<00:05:12.190> on

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
that puts the the lightning Fisher on

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.210 
that puts the the lightning Fisher on
you<00:05:12.610> or<00:05:13.480> a<00:05:13.540> ball<00:05:13.930> of<00:05:14.050> lightning<00:05:14.260> which<00:05:14.650> after

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
you or a ball of lightning which after

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.540 
you or a ball of lightning which after
you<00:05:15.670> know<00:05:15.790> it<00:05:16.030> reaches<00:05:16.720> you<00:05:17.220> it'll<00:05:18.220> put<00:05:18.400> down<00:05:18.520> a

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
you know it reaches you it'll put down a

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.710 
you know it reaches you it'll put down a
lightning<00:05:18.880> federer<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.210> still<00:05:19.390> have<00:05:19.540> to<00:05:19.630> put

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
lightning federer you still have to put

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.990 
lightning federer you still have to put
those<00:05:19.870> in<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.140> little<00:05:20.410> side<00:05:20.590> grades<00:05:21.000> if

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
those in the little side grades if

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000 
those in the little side grades if
you're<00:05:22.330> watching<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:22.840> video<00:05:23.050> behind<00:05:23.290> me<00:05:23.620> you

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
you're watching the video behind me you

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.980 
you're watching the video behind me you
will<00:05:24.130> seem<00:05:24.550> that<00:05:24.790> so<00:05:25.180> just<00:05:25.420> make<00:05:25.600> sure<00:05:25.630> you<00:05:25.810> put

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
will seem that so just make sure you put

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.570 
will seem that so just make sure you put
them<00:05:26.140> on<00:05:26.290> that<00:05:26.530> because<00:05:26.800> if<00:05:27.010> those<00:05:27.280> lightning

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
get soaked up because it'll do a lot of

get soaked up because it'll do a lot of
damage<00:06:04.780> and<00:06:06.330> other<00:06:07.330> than<00:06:07.510> that<00:06:07.570> I<00:06:07.960> mean

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
damage and other than that I mean

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.200 
damage and other than that I mean
everything<00:06:08.350> is<00:06:08.530> pretty<00:06:08.710> much<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:08.890> same<00:06:09.100> so<00:06:09.760> if

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
everything is pretty much the same so if

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.400 
everything is pretty much the same so if
you<00:06:10.450> can<00:06:10.660> avoid<00:06:11.169> lightning<00:06:12.270> sparks<00:06:13.270> and<00:06:13.540> tank

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410
