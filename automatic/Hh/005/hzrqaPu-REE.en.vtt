today<00:00:00.900> I<00:00:00.930> dehydrated<00:00:01.770> some<00:00:01.949> okra<00:00:02.310> and<00:00:02.550> I

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
today I dehydrated some okra and I

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.309 
today I dehydrated some okra and I
wasn't<00:00:03.000> sure<00:00:03.210> if<00:00:03.330> this<00:00:03.449> would<00:00:03.629> work<00:00:03.689> out<00:00:04.080> well

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
wasn't sure if this would work out well

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.990 
wasn't sure if this would work out well
because<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:04.710> haven't<00:00:04.920> seen<00:00:05.130> anyone<00:00:05.490> else<00:00:05.549> do<00:00:05.970> it

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
because I haven't seen anyone else do it

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.330 
because I haven't seen anyone else do it
and<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:06.629> wasn't<00:00:06.779> sure<00:00:07.170> exactly<00:00:07.620> how<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.099> go

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
and it wasn't sure exactly how to go

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.450 
and it wasn't sure exactly how to go
about<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:08.880> but<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.900> blanched<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.710> okra<00:00:11.160> for

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
three minutes in boiling water then I

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.359

overnight for nine hours the dehydrator

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.380 
overnight for nine hours the dehydrator
was<00:00:29.910> set<00:00:30.179> at<00:00:30.390> 135<00:00:31.260> degrees<00:00:31.910> now<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> most

that<00:00:45.420> something<00:00:45.870> dehydrates<00:00:46.739> well<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:48.090> sure

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that something dehydrates well be sure

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.600 
that something dehydrates well be sure
to<00:00:48.989> take<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> little<00:00:49.649> bit<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.070> whatever<00:00:50.280> you're

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
to rehydrate back to as close to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.999 
to rehydrate back to as close to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
you there a good example is a lot of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.969 
you there a good example is a lot of
people<00:01:24.930> are<00:01:26.030> rehydrating<00:01:27.259> frozen<00:01:28.259> peas<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
people are rehydrating frozen peas and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.850 
people are rehydrating frozen peas and
corn<00:01:29.220> well<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> tried<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.470> didn't

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
corn well I tried that and just I didn't

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.800 
corn well I tried that and just I didn't
like<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.880> found<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.659> could

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
like it so I found that I could

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.679 
like it so I found that I could
dehydrate<00:01:34.590> canned<00:01:35.520> peas<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.119> corn<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.570> they

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
dehydrate canned peas and corn and they

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.010 
dehydrate canned peas and corn and they
came<00:01:36.900> back<00:01:37.170> more<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.009> my<00:01:38.159> liking<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.990> be<00:01:39.990> sure

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
came back more to my liking so be sure

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.950 
came back more to my liking so be sure
to<00:01:40.350> test<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.360> ever<00:01:42.689> you

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to test a little bit of what ever you

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.950 
to test a little bit of what ever you
dehydrate<00:01:43.340> make<00:01:44.340> sure<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.780> know<00:01:45.899> you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
dehydrate make sure that you know you

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.889 
dehydrate make sure that you know you
will<00:01:46.350> eat<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.729> before<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.060> dehydrate<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.659> whole

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
will eat it before you dehydrate a whole

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.679 
will eat it before you dehydrate a whole
lot<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:50.640> could<00:01:50.790> save<00:01:51.000> yourself<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.509> lot

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
lot of it you could save yourself a lot

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.840 
lot of it you could save yourself a lot
of<00:01:51.750> time<00:01:52.049> money<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.619> aggravation<00:01:52.829> by<00:01:53.490> doing

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
of time money and aggravation by doing

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.450 
of time money and aggravation by doing
that<00:01:54.079> so<00:01:55.079> here's<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.799> okra<00:01:56.070> looked<00:01:56.280> like

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that so here's what the okra looked like

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
that so here's what the okra looked like
after<00:01:56.880> 20<00:01:57.030> minutes<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.750> guess<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> spoon

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
after 20 minutes and guess what a spoon

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.020 
after 20 minutes and guess what a spoon
is<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> good<00:01:59.070> thing<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.369> cut<00:01:59.549> over<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.460> after

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
is not a good thing to cut over so after

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.950 
is not a good thing to cut over so after
20<00:02:03.390> minutes<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:04.049> was<00:02:04.439> not<00:02:05.369> quite<00:02:05.960> rehydrated

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
20 minutes it was not quite rehydrated

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.850 
20 minutes it was not quite rehydrated
enough<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:08.060> strings<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.660> were<00:02:10.590> still

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
enough the strings and it were still

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.480 
enough the strings and it were still
kind<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.340> stringy

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
kind of stringy

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.470 
kind of stringy
and<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.780> gumminess<00:02:14.200> was<00:02:14.590> kind<00:02:14.860> of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and the gumminess was kind of

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.480 
and the gumminess was kind of
intensified<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:16.750> hard<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.110> describe<00:02:17.490> but

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
intensified it's hard to describe but

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.170 
intensified it's hard to describe but
the<00:02:18.790> little<00:02:19.390> end<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.530> oak<00:02:20.740> row<00:02:21.040> was<00:02:21.790> just

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
the little end of the oak row was just

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.830 
the little end of the oak row was just
right<00:02:22.420> here<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:24.280> after<00:02:24.580> 50<00:02:25.210> minutes<00:02:25.360> and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
right here it is after 50 minutes and

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.600 
right here it is after 50 minutes and
you<00:02:26.080> can<00:02:26.230> tell<00:02:26.500> from<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.860> way<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.280> okra

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
you can tell from the way this okra

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.490 
you can tell from the way this okra
slides<00:02:27.910> around<00:02:28.270> with<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.540> spoon<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.260> this

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
slides around with this spoon that this

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.430 
slides around with this spoon that this
is<00:02:29.710> still<00:02:29.920> okra<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:32.050> at<00:02:32.860> this<00:02:33.580> point<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.750> okra

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
is still okra and at this point the okra

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.740 
is still okra and at this point the okra
the<00:02:35.710> stringiness<00:02:36.190> was<00:02:36.580> gone<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.240> it<00:02:37.540> was<00:02:37.720> a

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
the stringiness was gone and it was a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.210 
the stringiness was gone and it was a
bit<00:02:38.020> on<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.920> mushy<00:02:39.340> side<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:40.420> think<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:41.440> if

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
bit on the mushy side so I think that if

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.880 
bit on the mushy side so I think that if
you<00:02:42.550> boil<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.030> for<00:02:43.420> about<00:02:43.630> 30<00:02:44.110> minutes<00:02:44.440> that

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
you boil it for about 30 minutes that

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.110 
you boil it for about 30 minutes that
that<00:02:45.070> would<00:02:45.280> be<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.730> sweet<00:02:46.180> spot<00:02:46.540> as<00:02:46.860> to

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
that would be the sweet spot as to

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.230 
that would be the sweet spot as to
getting<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> good<00:02:50.020> rehydration<00:02:51.240> the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
getting this to a good rehydration the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.750 
getting this to a good rehydration the
okra<00:02:52.660> isn't<00:02:53.050> as<00:02:53.200> tough<00:02:53.530> as<00:02:53.770> it<00:02:53.830> looks<00:02:54.190> like<00:02:54.340> in

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
okra isn't as tough as it looks like in

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.210 
okra isn't as tough as it looks like in
this<00:02:55.000> picture<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:56.230> was<00:02:56.680> having<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:57.010> hard<00:02:57.190> time

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
this picture I was having a hard time

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.340 
this picture I was having a hard time
cutting<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.330> filming<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:58.960> at<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.170> same

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
cutting it and filming it at the same

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.860 
cutting it and filming it at the same
time<00:02:59.410> it's<00:03:00.130> actually<00:03:00.640> very<00:03:01.000> tender<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.570> very

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
time it's actually very tender and very

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.840 
time it's actually very tender and very
mushy<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:04.470> decided<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.680> let<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.040> okra<00:03:06.400> cook<00:03:06.640> a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
mushy I decided to let the okra cook a

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.400 
mushy I decided to let the okra cook a
little<00:03:07.090> longer<00:03:07.330> just<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.870> see<00:03:08.080> what<00:03:08.290> would

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
little longer just to see what would

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.100 
little longer just to see what would
happen<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.010> this<00:03:09.610> is<00:03:09.820> after<00:03:10.390> one<00:03:10.630> hour<00:03:10.660> of

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
happen and this is after one hour of

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.310 
happen and this is after one hour of
cooking<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.740> it<00:03:12.430> seems<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:13.120> start<00:03:14.080> to

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
cooking and it seems to start to

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.700 
cooking and it seems to start to
deteriorate<00:03:14.500> at<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:15.550> point<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:17.140> took<00:03:17.260> it

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
deteriorate at this point so I took it

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.830 
deteriorate at this point so I took it
out<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:19.290> tasted<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.910> it's<00:03:21.910> good<00:03:22.300> but<00:03:22.720> it

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
out and I tasted it and it's good but it

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.430 
out and I tasted it and it's good but it
was<00:03:23.050> just<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.740> bit<00:03:23.920> too<00:03:24.130> mushy<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:25.020> was<00:03:26.020> surprised

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
was just a bit too mushy I was surprised

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.410 
was just a bit too mushy I was surprised
at<00:03:26.650> how<00:03:26.680> well<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.400> seeds<00:03:27.670> in<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:27.940> okra

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
at how well the seeds in the okra

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.270 
at how well the seeds in the okra
rehydrate<00:03:29.140> because<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.530> expected<00:03:30.070> them<00:03:30.250> to

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
rehydrate because I expected them to

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.940 
rehydrate because I expected them to
stay<00:03:30.610> hard<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.060> crunchy<00:03:31.570> but<00:03:31.720> even<00:03:32.440> at<00:03:32.590> 20

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
stay hard and crunchy but even at 20

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.700 
stay hard and crunchy but even at 20
minutes<00:03:33.340> they<00:03:34.150> were<00:03:34.210> rehydrated<00:03:35.020> well<00:03:35.200> and

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
minutes they were rehydrated well and

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.270 
minutes they were rehydrated well and
edible<00:03:36.640> just<00:03:37.120> like<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.660> seeds<00:03:38.230> in<00:03:38.500> fresh<00:03:38.860> okra

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
edible just like the seeds in fresh okra

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.060 
edible just like the seeds in fresh okra
now<00:03:39.970> this<00:03:40.270> does<00:03:40.480> not<00:03:40.510> taste<00:03:40.960> like<00:03:41.110> fresh<00:03:41.650> okra

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
now this does not taste like fresh okra

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.860 
now this does not taste like fresh okra
I<00:03:42.370> don't<00:03:42.550> know<00:03:42.640> if<00:03:42.730> any<00:03:42.850> dehydrated<00:03:43.600> foods

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
I don't know if any dehydrated foods

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.450 
I don't know if any dehydrated foods
that<00:03:44.140> are<00:03:44.260> going<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.470> come<00:03:44.770> back<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.340> know

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
that are going to come back you know

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.770 
that are going to come back you know
exactly<00:03:45.790> like<00:03:46.120> fresh<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:48.310> taste<00:03:48.910> gets<00:03:49.300> a<00:03:49.570> bit

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
exactly like fresh the taste gets a bit

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.900 
exactly like fresh the taste gets a bit
washed<00:03:50.050> out<00:03:50.350> because<00:03:50.800> it's<00:03:51.220> been<00:03:51.490> cooked<00:03:51.760> in

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
washed out because it's been cooked in

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.870 
washed out because it's been cooked in
so<00:03:52.090> much<00:03:52.330> water<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:53.220> think<00:03:54.220> this<00:03:54.670> would<00:03:54.850> work

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
so much water I think this would work

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.070 
so much water I think this would work
out<00:03:55.240> well<00:03:55.480> just<00:03:55.900> tossed<00:03:56.230> in<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.650> stews<00:03:58.080> now

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
out well just tossed in the stews now

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.450 
out well just tossed in the stews now
I'm<00:03:59.200> going<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.470> put<00:03:59.650> this<00:03:59.830> over<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.340> the

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
I'm going to put this over to the

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.370 
I'm going to put this over to the
ultimate<00:04:00.880> test<00:04:01.090> I'm<00:04:01.330> going<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.630> fry<00:04:01.840> some<00:04:01.870> and

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
ultimate test I'm going to fry some and

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.810 
ultimate test I'm going to fry some and
see<00:04:02.500> how<00:04:02.620> that<00:04:02.830> turns<00:04:03.100> out<00:04:03.340> because<00:04:03.640> that's

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
see how that turns out because that's

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.600 
see how that turns out because that's
the<00:04:04.060> way<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.180> like<00:04:04.480> okra<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.990> best<00:04:05.230> now<00:04:06.160> keep<00:04:06.460> in

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
the way I like okra the best now keep in

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.210 
the way I like okra the best now keep in
mind<00:04:06.640> that<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.120> okra<00:04:07.600> has<00:04:07.900> been<00:04:08.230> rehydrated

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
mind that this okra has been rehydrated

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.850 
mind that this okra has been rehydrated
for<00:04:09.459> too<00:04:09.670> long<00:04:09.940> it's<00:04:10.330> just<00:04:10.420> too<00:04:10.810> mushy<00:04:11.110> for<00:04:11.530> my

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
for too long it's just too mushy for my

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.810 
for too long it's just too mushy for my
taste<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:13.680> just<00:04:14.680> rolled<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.100> around<00:04:15.370> in<00:04:15.580> some

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
taste I just rolled it around in some

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.360 
taste I just rolled it around in some
seafood<00:04:16.060> bread<00:04:16.540> or<00:04:16.690> mix<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.320> dropped<00:04:17.859> it<00:04:18.010> into

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
seafood bread or mix and dropped it into

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.849 
seafood bread or mix and dropped it into
some<00:04:18.700> hot<00:04:18.970> vegetable<00:04:19.239> oil<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:20.109> tried<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.680> and

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
some hot vegetable oil and tried it and

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.180 
some hot vegetable oil and tried it and
it's<00:04:21.669> surprising<00:04:22.270> how<00:04:22.510> this<00:04:23.140> okra<00:04:23.770> kind<00:04:24.070> of

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
it's surprising how this okra kind of

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.710 
it's surprising how this okra kind of
plumped<00:04:24.760> up<00:04:24.880> when<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.330> was<00:04:25.360> four

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
plumped up when it was four

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.650 
plumped up when it was four
and<00:04:26.140> it<00:04:26.860> gets<00:04:27.280> back<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:28.240> nice<00:04:28.930> crisp<00:04:29.410> texture<00:04:29.920> to

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
and it gets back a nice crisp texture to

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.150 
and it gets back a nice crisp texture to
to<00:04:31.660> look<00:04:31.870> at<00:04:31.990> this<00:04:32.140> picture<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.680> would<00:04:32.950> think

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
to look at this picture you would think

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.070 
to look at this picture you would think
that<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.520> strings<00:04:33.850> in<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.090> are<00:04:34.330> still<00:04:34.630> tough

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
that the strings in it are still tough

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.020 
that the strings in it are still tough
but<00:04:35.470> they're<00:04:35.620> not<00:04:35.770> they're<00:04:36.130> very<00:04:36.160> soft<00:04:36.700> and

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
but they're not they're very soft and

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.440 
but they're not they're very soft and
edible<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:38.500> fried<00:04:38.950> okra<00:04:38.980> was<00:04:39.400> real<00:04:39.670> good<00:04:39.850> even

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
edible the fried okra was real good even

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.260 
edible the fried okra was real good even
though<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:41.200> okra<00:04:41.740> had<00:04:41.950> been<00:04:42.190> rehydrated<00:04:43.090> for

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
though the okra had been rehydrated for

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.520 
though the okra had been rehydrated for
too<00:04:43.450> long<00:04:43.630> I<00:04:45.210> also<00:04:46.210> wanted<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:46.750> see<00:04:47.020> how<00:04:47.290> well

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
too long I also wanted to see how well

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.410 
too long I also wanted to see how well
the<00:04:47.710> okra<00:04:48.070> would<00:04:48.280> rehydrate<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.180> just

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
the okra would rehydrate in just

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.120 
the okra would rehydrate in just
room-temperature<00:04:49.930> water<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:53.500> here<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:53.980> is

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
room-temperature water so here it is

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.870 
room-temperature water so here it is
three<00:04:54.580> hours<00:04:54.730> later<00:04:55.180> as<00:04:56.070> you<00:04:57.070> can<00:04:57.400> see<00:04:57.640> it

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
three hours later as you can see it

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.580 
three hours later as you can see it
looks<00:04:58.000> like<00:04:58.240> it<00:04:58.390> could<00:04:58.570> rehydrate<00:04:59.230> a<00:04:59.260> little

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
looks like it could rehydrate a little

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.640 
looks like it could rehydrate a little
more<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.210> when<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.240> tasted<00:05:01.840> one<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.140> these<00:05:02.350> it

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
more and when I tasted one of these it

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.520 
more and when I tasted one of these it
was<00:05:02.830> very<00:05:03.070> similar<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.510> one<00:05:04.780> that<00:05:05.140> I<00:05:05.350> had

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
was very similar to the one that I had

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.440 
was very similar to the one that I had
cooked<00:05:05.890> for<00:05:06.100> 20<00:05:06.460> minutes<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:07.060> tried<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:08.590> had<00:05:08.800> a

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
cooked for 20 minutes and tried it had a

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.820 
cooked for 20 minutes and tried it had a
concentrated<00:05:10.450> slime<00:05:10.780> enos<00:05:11.110> it's<00:05:11.380> hard<00:05:11.620> to

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
concentrated slime enos it's hard to

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.510 
concentrated slime enos it's hard to
describe<00:05:12.300> but<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.720> it<00:05:14.230> wasn't<00:05:14.650> string<00:05:14.980> it<00:05:15.280> was

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
describe but the it wasn't string it was

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.150 
describe but the it wasn't string it was
tender<00:05:15.820> so<00:05:16.480> I<00:05:16.510> decided<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.110> fry<00:05:17.410> one<00:05:17.740> and<00:05:18.040> see

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
tender so I decided to fry one and see

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.780 
tender so I decided to fry one and see
how<00:05:18.190> that<00:05:18.460> turned<00:05:18.730> out<00:05:23.100> just<00:05:24.100> fried<00:05:24.430> very

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
how that turned out just fried very

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.880 
how that turned out just fried very
quickly<00:05:25.120> it<00:05:25.450> only<00:05:25.600> took<00:05:25.810> about<00:05:26.080> one<00:05:26.320> minute<00:05:26.560> to

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
quickly it only took about one minute to

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.790 
quickly it only took about one minute to
fry<00:05:27.280> it<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.700> it<00:05:28.300> was<00:05:28.480> good<00:05:28.660> it<00:05:29.020> wasn't<00:05:29.230> stringy

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
fry it and it was good it wasn't stringy

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.270 
fry it and it was good it wasn't stringy
I<00:05:30.250> was<00:05:30.850> a<00:05:30.880> bit<00:05:31.270> wetter<00:05:31.780> inside<00:05:32.530> because<00:05:33.040> it

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
I was a bit wetter inside because it

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.320 
I was a bit wetter inside because it
been<00:05:33.430> soaked<00:05:33.730> in<00:05:33.880> water<00:05:35.130> but<00:05:36.130> it's<00:05:36.460> it's<00:05:37.000> good

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
been soaked in water but it's it's good

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.480 
been soaked in water but it's it's good
fried<00:05:37.630> okra<00:05:38.169> I<00:05:38.200> mean<00:05:38.410> it's<00:05:38.530> not<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.919> best<00:05:39.220> I

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
fried okra I mean it's not the best I

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.580 
fried okra I mean it's not the best I
ever<00:05:39.640> had<00:05:39.970> but<00:05:40.300> I<00:05:40.360> do<00:05:40.810> think<00:05:41.200> that<00:05:41.290> this<00:05:41.530> is

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
ever had but I do think that this is

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.070 
ever had but I do think that this is
worthy<00:05:42.220> of<00:05:42.250> going<00:05:42.700> into<00:05:42.880> my<00:05:43.060> food<00:05:43.270> storage<00:05:43.540> so

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
worthy of going into my food storage so

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.860 
worthy of going into my food storage so
I'm<00:05:44.380> going<00:05:44.680> to<00:05:44.710> dehydrate<00:05:45.460> some<00:05:45.640> more<00:05:45.880> and<00:05:46.150> I

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
I'm going to dehydrate some more and I

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.520 
I'm going to dehydrate some more and I
hope<00:05:47.080> it<00:05:47.230> helps<00:05:48.090> PS<00:05:49.090> if<00:05:49.480> you're<00:05:49.810> growing<00:05:50.169> okra

substitute they ever found they just

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.270 
substitute they ever found they just
roasted<00:06:01.660> the<00:06:01.750> seeds<00:06:02.020> and<00:06:02.470> made<00:06:02.710> the<00:06:02.800> coffee<00:06:03.010> as

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
usual so I'm going to do a video of that

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.740 
usual so I'm going to do a video of that
when<00:06:05.830> my<00:06:06.190> pods<00:06:06.460> are<00:06:06.790> dry<00:06:07.030> I<00:06:07.060> don't<00:06:07.270> want<00:06:07.419> to<00:06:07.600> let

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
when my pods are dry I don't want to let

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.100 
when my pods are dry I don't want to let
those<00:06:07.930> just<00:06:08.260> dry<00:06:08.500> naturally<00:06:09.160> I<00:06:10.090> found<00:06:10.900> that

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
those just dry naturally I found that

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.290 
those just dry naturally I found that
the<00:06:11.380> pods<00:06:11.740> that<00:06:11.919> are<00:06:12.070> just<00:06:12.370> a<00:06:12.490> little<00:06:12.520> too<00:06:12.910> big

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
the pods that are just a little too big

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.540 
the pods that are just a little too big
to<00:06:13.600> eat<00:06:13.780> the<00:06:14.440> seeds<00:06:14.710> aren't<00:06:14.980> mature<00:06:15.130> enough

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
to eat the seeds aren't mature enough

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.790 
to eat the seeds aren't mature enough
and<00:06:15.820> they<00:06:15.910> don't<00:06:16.090> dry<00:06:16.390> they<00:06:17.230> just<00:06:17.440> shrivel<00:06:17.740> up

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
and they don't dry they just shrivel up

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.120 
and they don't dry they just shrivel up
to<00:06:17.980> nothing<00:06:18.480> so<00:06:19.480> you<00:06:19.540> need<00:06:20.020> to<00:06:20.260> use<00:06:20.500> great<00:06:20.919> big

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
to nothing so you need to use great big

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.300 
to nothing so you need to use great big
pods<00:06:21.460> for<00:06:21.760> this<00:06:21.970> so<00:06:22.450> I<00:06:23.169> have<00:06:23.650> some<00:06:24.040> of<00:06:24.160> those

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
pods for this so I have some of those

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.050 
pods for this so I have some of those
set<00:06:24.700> aside<00:06:25.090> and<00:06:25.600> I'm<00:06:25.690> letting<00:06:25.960> them<00:06:26.110> dry<00:06:26.350> and

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
set aside and I'm letting them dry and

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.850 
set aside and I'm letting them dry and
hope<00:06:28.060> to<00:06:28.240> have<00:06:28.330> a<00:06:28.390> video<00:06:28.720> up<00:06:29.169> about<00:06:29.320> that<00:06:29.620> would

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
hope to have a video up about that would

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.290 
hope to have a video up about that would
probably<00:06:30.010> take<00:06:30.280> a<00:06:30.310> month<00:06:30.580> or<00:06:30.760> so<00:06:30.910> for<00:06:31.150> them<00:06:31.240> to

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
probably take a month or so for them to

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.200 
probably take a month or so for them to
dry<00:06:31.480> completely<00:06:31.900> so<00:06:32.650> hang<00:06:33.190> on<00:06:33.370> to<00:06:33.640> those<00:06:33.789> big

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
dry completely so hang on to those big

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.070 
dry completely so hang on to those big
okra<00:06:34.570> pods<00:06:34.750> hope<00:06:35.530> it<00:06:35.710> helps
