00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 so hello everyone friends with you sergey fan 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.859
 and today i'm streaming my video like 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.639
 hack things in mycraft using 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.210
 artmani 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.880
 and since I have already prepared everything here 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.590
 maynkavt and as if already typed 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.420
 diamonds well in my case it's eight 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.859
 Salat is what we will crack and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.180
 so but on the example that you dug 8 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.840
 diamonds and for whom 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.050
 for someone of the young type you say 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.450
 that type 8 diamonds are not lucky not 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.180
 very well of it can be done on I do not know 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.590
 2 picks and shovels period bib so and 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.370
 for this you skip artmani 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.710
 and choose the category of the game which 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.250
 will zone mikroft cell search 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.899
 output this number which 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.410
 which you want evil in our case 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.410
 brakes logic okay and here we have 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.040
 continues addresses 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.020
 our games which are in order 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.610
 to hack as you see 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.970
 addresses and there are a lot of 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.570
 very much so on the right to make them 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.330
 less for that you take off 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.220
 several diamonds but you can still them 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.100
 if you have 8 you can do more 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.140
 anodes can also be counted 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.090
 so you now enter the city ​​of diamonds 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.960
 already checks to weed out 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.479
 6 hours 6 and then how you see 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.250
 addresses already getting a little smaller 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.909
 well, how little was 60,000 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.909
 but here we are waiting 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:01.229
 all so now found addresses 757 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.780
 Follow throws off another 2 diamond and again 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.479
 go into art mani and press ok again 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.959
 now again now now enter this 4 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.380
 and there are already 27 more addresses 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:17.819
 scatter diamonds now you have two minds 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.340
 for these two you will and how you see one 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.269
 the address is what we need to press and 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.930
 two times on the button 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.519
 left click on byte four bytes 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.760
 must be required and enter here 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:35.579
 any number for example there are millions i don't 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.760
 I know so press enter and be sure 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.860
 click on the cross and as you see 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.650
 we are just unreal number of diamonds you 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.709
 you can just throw off and you in 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.900
 infinity is generally necessary you need everything 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.160
 time to bring up and recruit 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.030
 diamond so what I put here 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.970
 this little chest 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.150
 the fact is that when you take off 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.700
 a million diamonds it becomes like 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.980
 like that little diamond hook 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.530
 how not to fit you just the whole 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.660
 the inventory is filled with diamonds so you 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.730
 take here and so you stand near here 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.079
 take these bumps so fold 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.680
 fold like this 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.680
 so here 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:26.370
 tell here already one chest Mazov 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.819
 filled you can still make more 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.860
 still 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.099
 and most importantly standing next to it after 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.549
 go to the game this little bunch disappears 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:38.220
 sorry and so therefore yes and in 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.860
 previous and in the old version of the video me 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.530
 ask for in multiplayer works 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.989
 No, unfortunately, multiplayer does not work 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:51.209
 I do not know why this may be the case. 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:53.220
 that as if the game is progressing well, as if I 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.620
 right now i have a singleplayer 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.200
 Mars just hangs on this or that 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.540
 that some people have 100 who 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.879
 you break and he counts absolutely 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:09.900
 all the numbers that you are the driver 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:12.750
 maybe because of this, but not all 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.959
 talked about daemon's feet wash this 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.690
 it can only be very slow as 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.789
 as if to take off because so here 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.389
 so here is what to keep and 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.610
 throw off 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.280
 and so you can just take a dig 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.389
 billion and you can so flatness here 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.250
 so shorter than a crowd of diamonds so you can 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:36.660
 work at all with any with any resources 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:39.360
 who there do not know the cobblestone ground 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.750
 sand emeralds anything at all and 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.280
 anything important number 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:52.280
 Yes, and I do not know exactly 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:56.510
 it seems as if there is a number 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.190
 still force how to increase I do not know how to 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.250
 you need to install some mod so 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.470
 you somewhere here in the edge 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.389
 it was said about what your strength is but you 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.680
 you can break it too you will just 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:15.620
 Ender dragon with one point to give so 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.840
