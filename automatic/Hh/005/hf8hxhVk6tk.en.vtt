are<00:00:55.989> found<00:00:56.680> within<00:00:56.949> it<00:00:57.840> specifically<00:00:58.840> what

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
are found within it specifically what

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.680 
are found within it specifically what
it's<00:00:59.769> doing<00:01:00.070> is<00:01:00.280> burning<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.730> glycogen<00:01:01.180> the

it's doing is burning the glycogen the

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.630 
it's doing is burning the glycogen the

process I recommend that we do that

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.510 
process I recommend that we do that
every<00:03:18.890> induction<00:03:19.760> ii<00:03:19.880> do<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.989> clean<00:03:21.920> break<00:03:22.220> and

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
every induction ii do a clean break and
