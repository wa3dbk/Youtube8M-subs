00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.360 

and<00:02:59.830> then<00:03:00.810> start<00:03:01.810> by<00:03:01.990> sewing<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.380> loop<00:03:02.680> in<00:03:03.010> two

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
and then start by sewing the loop in two

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.740 
and then start by sewing the loop in two
stages<00:03:04.290> pass<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.320> thread<00:03:05.770> up<00:03:06.010> through<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.430> hole

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
stages pass a thread up through the hole

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.150 
stages pass a thread up through the hole
don't<00:03:07.750> pull<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.170> thread<00:03:08.410> tight<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:08.920> have

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
don't pull the thread tight so you have

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:16.120 
don't pull the thread tight so you have
some<00:03:09.370> height

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.400 

and<00:03:16.310> then<00:03:17.210> pass<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.690> thread<00:03:17.960> down<00:03:18.140> back

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
and then pass the thread down back

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:31.270 
and then pass the thread down back
through<00:03:18.710> the<00:03:18.830> button

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.039 

again<00:03:32.280> don't<00:03:32.549> pull<00:03:32.879> tight<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.659> then<00:03:33.840> on<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
again don't pull tight and then on the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.630 
again don't pull tight and then on the
underneath<00:03:34.319> create<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.860> little<00:03:35.159> backstitch

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
underneath create a little backstitch

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.080 
underneath create a little backstitch
and<00:03:36.950> that's<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.159> first<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.730> loop<00:03:38.879> that

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
and that's the first of the loop that

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.610 
and that's the first of the loop that
will<00:03:39.180> hold<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.569> button<00:03:39.870> on<00:03:42.260> keep<00:03:43.260> your<00:03:43.500> left

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
will hold the button on keep your left

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.220 
will hold the button on keep your left
hand<00:03:43.739> fixed<00:03:44.239> continue<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.359> loop<00:03:45.569> around<00:03:45.750> the
