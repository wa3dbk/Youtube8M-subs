00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.690
 sauro bazzani owner of the biesse 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.040
 planet this stand is now has become 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.830
 a must 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 this yellow color here at the fair of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.160
 brescia 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.170
 tell us about some news presented 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.189
 from your company to the event e 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.350
 Brescia 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.269
 certainly then basically we have 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.939
 presented some products maybe it comes 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.719
 illustrate a couple starting from one 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.579
 resistant high definition camera 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.000
 to water in aluminum that weighs only 60 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.590
 grams is also equipped with audio and we have 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.809
 really had a remarkable success 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.789
 because even there is a little this change of 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.430
 mentality precisely in hunters where 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.920
 maybe they have this desire to live again 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 shares even after a day a month 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.039
 a year and this is also very nice a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.420
 real jewel of technology 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.610
 I see 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.620
 let's talk about a camera really 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.940
 then used in authorized at 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.620
 water resistant definition 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.100
 polymer rechargeable internal batteries 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.159
 of lithium manages a memory up to 32 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.260
 gb can be applied in the rifle a 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.090
 beautiful you could see we say that it 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.049
 stereotype of the soccer player with the boot 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.700
 broken as it is not torn apart leaves a 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.960
 step the exact act 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.500
 let's say we had some results 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.880
 fantastic also equipping our dog 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.070
 own exile both for pointing dogs 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.630
 even for follow-up dogs we succeeded 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.860
 to equip this camera and going to 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.180
 insert in our jackets of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.820
 security we use to ignite not 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.110
 particular special you can live the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.939
 actions that maybe even we thought 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.530
 that our dog could have done 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.290
 therefore, for better or for worse 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.850
 to live the true step actions 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.310
 for step that our dog made 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.799
 let's disfigure in tintin is going to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.840
 exactly understand one another exactly 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.000
 very nice thing we had 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.040
 really very successful at 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.600
 presentations we made both in 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.490
 france which are these in germany 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.049
 glasses high definition glasses 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.810
 because obviously we only present it 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.430
 high-tech products 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.079
 high definition also these are in 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.520
 able to film up to about two three 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.340
 hours of battery life 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.590
 in video mode and about 78 ri 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.330
 photo mode the nice thing that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.170
 they have great sound 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.660
 opening 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.220
 we are on 160 degrees and a novelty 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.200
 truly extraordinary that a 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.550
 remote control that maybe for how long 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.840
 concerns filmmakers can also be 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.580
 excessive instead regarding 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.040
 photo talk is very important 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.900
 because if we go to take a picture 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.480
 pressing the key is obvious that almost 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.100
 definitely the real c pictures move but 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.530
 very curious about this thing because 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.720
 when we met adv each 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.000
 so I saw you with these glasses not 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.370
 I could understand why he is now at 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.650
 sun yes yes indeed and in germany one 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.269
 what a little strange facts is not 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.069
 easy but basically with this 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.600
 remote control is beyond that we can 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.920
 managed by the button we have the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.620
 possibility to choose between photos 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.390
 movies to exclude or to include also 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.519
 so let's say audio is one thing 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.500
 really new, maybe equipping ours 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.880
 wake up rather than equipping us with 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.290
 these glasses are various types of lenses 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.049
 then also remove lenses maybe that ad 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.810
 really every kind of eyeglasses 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.760
 feeling every moment at a distance of 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.950
 time here sitting comfortably on the sofa 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.280
 vs planet is always at the forefront 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.140
 really these technological goodies 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.880
 a thank you from me was missing 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.829
 part of retiring left thank you 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.160
 thank you Italian hunters 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.160
 thank you
