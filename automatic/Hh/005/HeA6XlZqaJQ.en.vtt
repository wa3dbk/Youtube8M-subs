the first color I started out with was a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.040 
the first color I started out with was a
light<00:00:17.340> blue<00:00:17.580> from<00:00:17.850> paradise<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.840> used

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
light blue from paradise and the used

light blue from paradise and the used
sponge<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.800> apply<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.130> all<00:00:20.400> over<00:00:20.520> the

now this is just the first layer of the
base<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.189> cancel<00:00:26.580> out<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
base and it's really to cancel out the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.830 
base and it's really to cancel out the
skintone<00:00:27.060> underneath

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
skintone underneath

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.290

don't<00:00:28.320> worry<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.830> blotchy<00:00:29.099> or<00:00:29.490> patchy<00:00:29.849> it

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
don't worry if it's blotchy or patchy it

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.820 
don't worry if it's blotchy or patchy it
doesn't<00:00:30.689> matter<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.140> we're<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> go

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
doesn't matter because we're going to go

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.549

of<00:00:34.559> different<00:00:35.160> colors<00:00:35.460> next<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.630> swap<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
of different colors next I swap to a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.869 
of different colors next I swap to a
grimace<00:00:37.440> light<00:00:37.770> blue<00:00:37.980> which<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.489> slightly

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
darker in shade than the paradise blue

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.619 
darker in shade than the paradise blue
and<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.610> used<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.879> around<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.270> outside

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
and I just used this around the outside

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.450 
and I just used this around the outside
edges<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> face<00:00:43.290> bringing<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.010> into<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
center slightly to add a little bit of

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.279 
center slightly to add a little bit of
dimension<00:00:47.210> then<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.390> exactly<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> same<00:00:48.899> thing

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
dimension then do exactly the same thing

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.110 
dimension then do exactly the same thing
with<00:00:49.500> some<00:00:49.680> grimace<00:00:50.010> mullick<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.760> adding<00:00:51.059> a

color out so there's not a harsh edge
and<00:01:53.510> I'm<00:01:53.660> also<00:01:54.020> overlapping<00:01:54.619> all<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.100> colors

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
and I'm also overlapping all the colors

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.920 
and I'm also overlapping all the colors
of<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.610> stencil<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.360> blends<00:01:56.660> together

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
of the stencil so it blends together

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.270 
of the stencil so it blends together
nicely

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.000 

and<00:02:03.490> then<00:02:04.270> finally<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.050> last<00:02:05.350> step<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:05.770> the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
and then finally the last step of the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.890 
and then finally the last step of the
base<00:02:06.190> is<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.670> take<00:02:06.850> some<00:02:07.060> paradise<00:02:07.510> white

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
base is to take some paradise white

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.840 
base is to take some paradise white
paint<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.350> fill<00:02:08.920> in<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.100> area<00:02:09.460> between<00:02:09.610> the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
brush up and down so the pressure

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.720 
brush up and down so the pressure
changes<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.920> lines<00:02:57.190> get<00:02:57.400> thicker

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
changes and the lines get thicker

more<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:51.020> just<00:03:51.319> use<00:03:51.440> my<00:03:51.620> finger<00:03:52.069> to<00:03:52.100> smudge<00:03:52.459> them

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670

up

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.720 

after<00:04:06.470> adding<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.740> few<00:04:06.860> more<00:04:06.920> strokes<00:04:07.370> on<00:04:07.610> the

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
after adding a few more strokes on the

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.520 
after adding a few more strokes on the
center<00:04:08.060> part<00:04:08.210> I<00:04:08.420> decided<00:04:08.780> that<00:04:08.960> I<00:04:09.050> didn't<00:04:09.380> like

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
center part I decided that I didn't like

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.980 
center part I decided that I didn't like
too<00:04:09.860> much<00:04:10.010> of<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.310> orange<00:04:10.670> stencil<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.690> I<00:04:11.720> just

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
too much of the orange stencil so I just

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.810 
too much of the orange stencil so I just
took<00:04:12.140> some<00:04:12.380> more<00:04:12.560> neon<00:04:12.770> pink<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.370> went<00:04:13.580> over

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
took some more neon pink and went over

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.660 
took some more neon pink and went over
the<00:04:13.910> top<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.210> this<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:15.040> then<00:04:16.040> I<00:04:16.130> use<00:04:16.280> this<00:04:16.459> same

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
the top of this and then I use this same

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.340 
the top of this and then I use this same
color<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.120> paint<00:04:17.329> on<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.540> tiger<00:04:17.870> nose<00:04:18.079> and

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
color to paint on the tiger nose and

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:27.080

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.939 

followed<00:04:28.090> by<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.300> very<00:04:28.449> small<00:04:29.139> amount<00:04:29.409> of<00:04:29.500> neon

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
followed by a very small amount of neon

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:38.090

purple<00:04:30.159> just<00:04:30.909> on<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.270> outside<00:04:31.719> corners

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.860 

with<00:04:39.100> black<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.610> added<00:04:39.910> a<00:04:39.970> straight<00:04:40.330> line<00:04:40.600> from

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
with black I added a straight line from

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.720 
with black I added a straight line from
the<00:04:40.960> nose<00:04:41.260> down<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.010> top<00:04:42.190> lip<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.640> I

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
the nose down to the top lip and I

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.850 
the nose down to the top lip and I
rounded<00:04:43.090> out<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.330> bottom<00:04:43.660> edge

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.340 

and<00:04:49.220> then<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.120> just<00:04:50.240> continued<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.900> shape<00:04:51.140> up

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350

and then it just continued the shape up
and<00:04:51.650> round<00:04:51.950> towards<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.490> nose<00:04:52.670> to<00:04:53.030> create

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
and round towards the nose to create

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.480 
and round towards the nose to create
that<00:04:53.510> tiger<00:04:53.810> mouth<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.350> I<00:04:54.650> just<00:04:54.920> thickened<00:04:55.340> up
