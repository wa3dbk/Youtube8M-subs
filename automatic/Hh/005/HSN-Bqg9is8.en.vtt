00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 so greet you dear people I still have 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.080
 to clarify one it is not an irokese that 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.670
 is not an eu cable is simply the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.070
 normal insanity it's easy 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.960
 still eating it again coming back like this 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.080
 many ask what is after that 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.480
 from league total now happens on league 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.900
 totally run then the colleagues of sky 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.580
 which concerns me personally 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.380
 I promised that I would say how 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.810
 it goes is not all in 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.179
 dry towels that are sound like that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.329
 as if you wanted to make yourself interesting 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:35.750
 I also really want to run it completely 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.210
 exciting ideas exciting stories 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.520
 my parents will not come around me 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.890
 also in the future also in the tv endure 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.600
 need and on the net i really believe 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.440
 that there is something really nice there 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.879
 we are extremely close but you have to be very 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.039
 Be careful and not before that 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.590
 I really want to fix everything 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.629
 not much to say okay because always 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.710
 again not at all if you like the side 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.289
 really reads me 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.640
 I'll say yes if there is something then 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.040
 So there is, as I said, it is 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.100
 there is nothing to say but it works 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.350
 things and I refer to the beginning 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.869
 May we happen there strange 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.900
 Things also in the net and I would say 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.500
 middle of may is just about everything 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.549
 clarified 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.299
 or not and until then dominated 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.250
 now you come along 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.990
 because I have these insights back into 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.970
 my braunau the sun the sun in mine 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.030
 privacy so far dominated by the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:37.979
 colleague here the one here dominates that 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.630
 is surprisingly a grill of 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.640
 will dominate 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.549
