00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.080 
actually have a config it was about fish
and<00:00:41.420> this<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.719> how<00:00:42.899> after<00:00:43.260> them<00:00:44.090> there's

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and this is just how after them there's

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.990 
and this is just how after them there's
still<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> kind<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> half<00:00:46.079> full<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:47.000> tap

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
still a kind of a half full with tap

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.500 
still a kind of a half full with tap
water<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.629> then<00:00:49.469> put<00:00:50.160> one<00:00:50.370> potato<00:00:50.730> walk<00:00:51.059> into

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
water and then put one potato walk into

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.260 
water and then put one potato walk into
a<00:00:51.570> few<00:00:51.809> small<00:00:52.110> slices<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.850> thinner<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
a few small slices and the thinner of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.330 
a few small slices and the thinner of
the<00:00:54.329> slice<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.170> faster<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.219> them

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the slice is the faster it is for them

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.029 
the slice is the faster it is for them
to<00:00:56.520> cook<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.870> put<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> whole<00:00:58.410> potato<00:00:58.829> in

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
to cook so if you put a whole potato in

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
to cook so if you put a whole potato in
the<00:00:59.129> pan<00:00:59.370> it's<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.270> take<00:01:00.329> quite<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> while

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the pan it's going to take quite a while

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.529 
the pan it's going to take quite a while
but<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.129> kind<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.520> cut<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:03.000> into<00:01:03.210> slices

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
but if you kind of cut it up into slices

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.010 
but if you kind of cut it up into slices
and<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.189> take<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.519> long<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> i

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and it's not going to take as long so i

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.240 
and it's not going to take as long so i
put<00:01:07.740> them<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> high<00:01:08.220> gas<00:01:08.540> very<00:01:09.540> high<00:01:09.780> gas<00:01:10.250> in

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
put them on a high gas very high gas in

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.450 
put them on a high gas very high gas in
thin<00:01:11.549> slices<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:12.299> 15<00:01:12.810> minutes<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
thin slices for 15 minutes and that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.910 
thin slices for 15 minutes and that
softens<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.090> month<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:16.049> softens<00:01:16.500> them<00:01:16.740> off

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
softens a month that softens them off

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.160 
softens a month that softens them off
enough<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> shrimp<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.060> eat<00:01:18.240> them<00:01:18.450> for

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
enough for the shrimp to eat them for

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.770 
enough for the shrimp to eat them for
the<00:01:19.290> quarry<00:01:19.560> cassidy<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.270> yeah<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the quarry cassidy them so yeah just the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.520 
the quarry cassidy them so yeah just the
cutoff<00:01:22.530> very<00:01:23.340> thin<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> put<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> high<00:01:25.229> gas

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
cutoff very thin and put on a high gas

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.630 
cutoff very thin and put on a high gas
for<00:01:26.030> about<00:01:27.030> 15<00:01:27.479> minutes<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.310> i'll<00:01:29.310> come<00:01:29.490> back

there's just too many Fisher on this

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.160 
there's just too many Fisher on this
area<00:03:12.070> so<00:03:13.070> what<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.250> do<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.820> put<00:03:13.880> 2<00:03:14.360> into<00:03:14.750> 10<00:03:14.989> and

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
area so what I do is I put 2 into 10 and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.490 
area so what I do is I put 2 into 10 and
reduce<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.620> amount<00:03:15.770> of<00:03:15.920> competition<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:17.500> as

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
reduce the amount of competition and as

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.040 
reduce the amount of competition and as
you<00:03:18.680> can<00:03:18.800> see<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:19.010> guys<00:03:19.160> a<00:03:19.190> shrimp<00:03:19.520> and

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
you can see you guys a shrimp and

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.050 
you can see you guys a shrimp and

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
there's a shrimp down there as well so

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.850 
there's a shrimp down there as well so
at<00:03:23.420> least<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.780> shrimp<00:03:24.020> and<00:03:24.230> get<00:03:24.410> something

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
at least the shrimp and get something

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.740 
at least the shrimp and get something
you<00:03:25.010> know<00:03:25.209> because<00:03:26.209> if<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:26.360> don't<00:03:26.600> have<00:03:26.690> one

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
you know because if you don't have one

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.280 
you know because if you don't have one
potato<00:03:27.260> in<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.739> it's<00:03:27.860> mobbed<00:03:28.100> with<00:03:28.400> fish<00:03:28.700> and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
potato in and it's mobbed with fish and

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.900 
potato in and it's mobbed with fish and
often<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.440> shrimps<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.580> Cardinal

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
often in the shrimps and the Cardinal

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.360 
often in the shrimps and the Cardinal
tetras<00:03:32.030> don't<00:03:32.480> really<00:03:32.750> get<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.930> look-in<00:03:33.370> so

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
tetras don't really get a look-in so

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.120 
tetras don't really get a look-in so
yeah<00:03:34.820> it's<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:35.870> worth<00:03:36.050> having<00:03:36.410> two<00:03:36.590> potatoes

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
yeah it's it's worth having two potatoes

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.970 
yeah it's it's worth having two potatoes
in<00:03:37.250> your<00:03:37.370> tank<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:38.600> all<00:03:38.989> of<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.380> fish<00:03:39.620> and

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
in your tank so all of the fish and

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.530 
in your tank so all of the fish and
animals<00:03:40.250> in<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.730> tank<00:03:40.970> can<00:03:41.120> actually<00:03:41.390> get

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
animals in the tank can actually get

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.810 
animals in the tank can actually get
something<00:03:41.989> see<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.950> shrimp<00:03:43.220> just<00:03:43.459> got<00:03:43.610> pushed

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820

something see the shrimp just got pushed
away<00:03:43.970> by<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.330> quarry<00:03:44.690> cat<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.980> its<00:03:46.489> back<00:03:46.970> in

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000
