that<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> questions<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.220> people

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that one of the questions that people

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
that one of the questions that people
always<00:01:41.790> ask<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.270> why<00:01:42.600> isn't<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.869> head<00:01:43.020> clashes

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409

always ask is why isn't the head clashes
and<00:01:43.530> that's<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> reason<00:01:44.070> why<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.520> you're

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and that's the reason why so you're

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.880 
and that's the reason why so you're
always<00:01:45.600> trying<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> move<00:01:46.110> away<00:01:46.200> from<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.619> voy

always trying to move away from the voy

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.920 
always trying to move away from the voy
a<00:01:47.130> little<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> noise<00:01:48.000> players<00:01:48.780> will

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
a little bit all the noise players will

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.090 
a little bit all the noise players will
hear<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> void<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.470> move<00:01:49.590> away<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.860> they

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
hear a void and move away and they

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.319 
hear a void and move away and they
travel<00:01:50.310> very<00:01:50.549> quickly<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.210> out<00:01:51.299> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
travel very quickly in and out of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.670 
travel very quickly in and out of
players<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.049> should<00:01:52.229> come<00:01:52.350> towards<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
players and then should come towards a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.319 
players and then should come towards a
goal<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.860> rate<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.189> face<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:53.790> that's<00:01:54.180> one

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
goal a rate of face and then that's one

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.069 
goal a rate of face and then that's one
issue<00:01:55.490> it's<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.640> based<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.090> being<00:01:57.540> reacting

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
issue it's all based on being reacting

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.859 
issue it's all based on being reacting
very<00:01:58.229> quickly<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.009> not<00:01:59.820> guessing<00:02:00.119> standing

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
very quickly and not guessing standing

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:01.969 
very quickly and not guessing standing
up<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.079> as<00:02:01.170> long<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.860> then

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
up for as long as you can and then

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.709 
up for as long as you can and then
reacting<00:02:02.399> from<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.939> where<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
quite a long time to get to a level

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.940 
quite a long time to get to a level
where<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.050> can<00:02:15.200> play<00:02:15.380> with<00:02:15.590> these<00:02:15.650> players

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
where you can play with these players

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.070 
where you can play with these players
because<00:02:16.280> they<00:02:16.880> hit<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> ball<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:17.540> hard<00:02:17.720> and

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
because they hit the ball so hard and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.199 
because they hit the ball so hard and
they<00:02:18.470> all<00:02:19.160> kick<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.520> ball<00:02:19.670> very<00:02:19.819> differently
