00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
splitter a Y splitter cables so you need

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.350 
splitter a Y splitter cables so you need

with a what their male male what do you

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.000 
with a what their male male what do you
call<00:00:42.129> that<00:00:42.870> jack<00:00:43.870> that<00:00:44.140> goes<00:00:44.320> straight<00:00:44.410> to<00:00:44.650> the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
call that jack that goes straight to the

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.490 
call that jack that goes straight to the
you<00:00:45.489> know<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.820> same<00:00:46.059> jack<00:00:46.750> that<00:00:46.989> go<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.230> the

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
you know the same jack that go to the

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.410 
you know the same jack that go to the
headphones<00:00:47.980> but<00:00:48.610> you<00:00:48.790> put<00:00:49.000> it<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.269> the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
headphones but you put it to the

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.319 
headphones but you put it to the
microphone<00:00:50.230> port<00:00:50.530> so<00:00:51.190> basically<00:00:51.610> you<00:00:51.940> have<00:00:52.150> to

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
microphone port so basically you have to

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.649 
microphone port so basically you have to
go<00:00:52.510> by<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:53.320> Y<00:00:53.530> splitter<00:00:53.920> cable<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:55.150> female

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
go by the Y splitter cable to female

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.780 
go by the Y splitter cable to female
port<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.409> red<00:00:56.589> and<00:00:56.769> white<00:00:57.010> one<00:00:57.339> that<00:00:57.549> will

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
port the red and white one that will

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.600 
port the red and white one that will
take<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.269> playstation<00:00:58.930> male<00:00:59.309> red<00:01:00.309> and<00:01:00.549> a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
take the playstation male red and a

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.140 
take the playstation male red and a
white<00:01:00.640> one<00:01:01.089> and<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.739> will<00:01:02.890> actually<00:01:03.150> transfer

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
white one and it will actually transfer

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.450 
white one and it will actually transfer
the<00:01:04.180> sound<00:01:04.600> as<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.080> microphone<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.830> computer

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
the sound as the microphone to computer

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.600 
the sound as the microphone to computer
so<00:01:07.590> basically<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.830> good<00:01:09.010> thing<00:01:09.159> about<00:01:09.189> this

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
so basically the good thing about this

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.450 
so basically the good thing about this
is<00:01:09.850> you<00:01:10.630> don't<00:01:10.780> need<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:10.990> driver<00:01:11.650> when<00:01:12.369> you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
is you don't need a driver when you

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.609 
is you don't need a driver when you
already<00:01:12.670> have<00:01:12.790> you<00:01:13.689> know<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.960> computer<00:01:14.290> already

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
already have you know a computer already

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.190 
already have you know a computer already
have<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.799> microphone<00:01:15.250> port<00:01:15.580> or<00:01:15.880> Jack<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:17.110> you

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
have a microphone port or Jack so you

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.370 
have a microphone port or Jack so you
just<00:01:17.470> put<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.159> inside<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.939> it<00:01:19.930> will<00:01:20.140> take<00:01:20.350> it

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
just put it inside and it will take it

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.289 
just put it inside and it will take it
very<00:01:20.799> simply<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.549> without<00:01:21.850> having<00:01:22.030> any

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
very simply and without having any

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.300 
very simply and without having any
problems<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.439> only<00:01:23.619> thing<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:23.860> got<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:24.070> do

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
problems the only thing you got to do

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.450 
problems the only thing you got to do
and<00:01:24.580> when<00:01:24.790> you<00:01:24.820> start<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.509> video<00:01:26.430> recording

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
and when you start the video recording

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.630 
and when you start the video recording
you<00:01:28.030> gotta<00:01:28.270> specifically<00:01:29.259> say<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:32.640> we

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
you gotta specifically say that what we

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.910 
you gotta specifically say that what we
call<00:01:33.909> it<00:01:34.119> what<00:01:34.840> what<00:01:35.409> where<00:01:35.770> is<00:01:35.799> the

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
call it what what where is the

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.830 
call it what what where is the
microphones<00:01:36.520> are<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.789> microphone<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.450> USB

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
microphones are the microphone the USB

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.330 
microphones are the microphone the USB
ports<00:01:38.200> are<00:01:38.289> basically<00:01:38.649> you<00:01:38.770> said<00:01:38.979> that's<00:01:39.130> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
ports are basically you said that's the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.639 
ports are basically you said that's the
microphone<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.929> will<00:01:41.079> take<00:01:41.289> it<00:01:41.319> very

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
microphone and it will take it very

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.260 
microphone and it will take it very
simply<00:01:42.100> without<00:01:42.219> having<00:01:42.640> any<00:01:42.729> problem<00:01:43.119> is

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
simply without having any problem is

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.109 
simply without having any problem is
that<00:01:43.539> simple<00:01:43.960> again<00:01:44.950> I<00:01:44.979> mean<00:01:45.249> our<00:01:45.460> conclusion

interface it might be actually the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.360 
interface it might be actually the
device<00:03:29.870> not<00:03:30.080> working<00:03:30.470> probably<00:03:30.710> but<00:03:31.280> the
