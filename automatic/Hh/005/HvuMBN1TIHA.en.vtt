00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
we can actually fix this ourselves and

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.780 
we can actually fix this ourselves and
spend<00:00:51.440> a<00:00:51.559> fraction<00:00:51.860> of<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.280> time<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:52.519> a

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
spend a fraction of the time and a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.369 
spend a fraction of the time and a
fraction<00:00:53.210> of<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.360> money<00:00:53.449> because<00:00:53.809> also<00:00:53.989> think

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
fraction of the money because also think

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.810 
fraction of the money because also think
