finally my final tip for improving the
game<00:02:27.750> would<00:02:27.900> be<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.110> implement<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.590> penalty<00:02:29.010> for

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
game would be to implement a penalty for

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.800 
game would be to implement a penalty for
leaving<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.550> game<00:02:29.730> early<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.150> we<00:02:30.390> know<00:02:30.600> we

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
leaving the game early and we know we

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.960 
leaving the game early and we know we

other dead town is really bad and it

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.610 
other dead town is really bad and it
leads<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.210> lot<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.390> poor<00:02:48.810> game<00:02:49.080> plays

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
leads to a lot of poor game plays

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.710 
leads to a lot of poor game plays
I<00:02:49.650> mean<00:02:50.430> cheating<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.850> problem<00:02:51.180> too<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:51.630> it

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
I mean cheating is a problem too but it

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.420 
I mean cheating is a problem too but it
leaving<00:02:52.080> happens<00:02:52.650> every<00:02:52.920> game<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.250> my<00:02:53.400> opinion

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
leaving happens every game in my opinion

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.280 
leaving happens every game in my opinion
there<00:02:54.210> needs<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.480> be<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> way<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.750> discourage

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
there needs to be a way to discourage

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.540 
there needs to be a way to discourage
people<00:02:55.410> from<00:02:55.680> leaving<00:02:55.920> when<00:02:56.220> they<00:02:56.310> do<00:02:56.430> not

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
people from leaving when they do not

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.040 
people from leaving when they do not
feel<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:56.760> playing<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.240> rest<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.660> game<00:02:57.840> I

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
feel like playing the rest of the game I

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.050 
feel like playing the rest of the game I
mean<00:02:58.650> things<00:02:58.860> happen<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.370> sometimes<00:02:59.940> you

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
mean things happen and sometimes you

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.550 
mean things happen and sometimes you
have<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.240> run<00:03:00.420> yet<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.660> go<00:03:00.780> somewhere<00:03:01.140> but

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
have to run yet to go somewhere but

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.690 
have to run yet to go somewhere but
there<00:03:01.710> are<00:03:01.770> people<00:03:01.920> who<00:03:02.100> leave<00:03:02.220> every<00:03:02.520> game

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
there are people who leave every game

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.010 
there are people who leave every game
until<00:03:02.970> they<00:03:03.090> get<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.330> role<00:03:03.450> they<00:03:03.600> won<00:03:03.810> which

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
until they get the role they won which

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.530 
until they get the role they won which
case<00:03:04.260> why<00:03:04.470> have<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:05.190> game<00:03:05.850> where<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.240> randomly

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
case why have a game where it randomly

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.340 
case why have a game where it randomly
assigns<00:03:06.930> roles

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
assigns roles

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.810 
assigns roles
it<00:03:07.500> ruins<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.220> experience<00:03:08.310> for<00:03:08.730> other

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
it ruins the experience for other

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.880 
it ruins the experience for other
players<00:03:09.090> perhaps<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:10.080> timer<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.590> prevents

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
players perhaps a timer that prevents

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.200 
players perhaps a timer that prevents
you<00:03:10.950> from<00:03:10.980> joining<00:03:11.280> another<00:03:11.640> game<00:03:11.850> after<00:03:12.000> you

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
you from joining another game after you

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.090 
you from joining another game after you
leave<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.660> maybe<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.380> timer<00:03:13.620> could<00:03:13.800> increase

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
leave and maybe the timer could increase

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.790 
leave and maybe the timer could increase
for<00:03:14.340> each<00:03:14.460> consecutive<00:03:14.850> game<00:03:15.240> that<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.570> leave

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
for each consecutive game that you leave

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.200 
for each consecutive game that you leave
an<00:03:16.800> Edition<00:03:17.250> better<00:03:17.430> policing<00:03:17.700> harsher

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
an Edition better policing harsher

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.640 
an Edition better policing harsher
consequences<00:03:18.330> for<00:03:19.200> leaving<00:03:19.440> could<00:03:19.530> also

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
consequences for leaving could also

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.170 
consequences for leaving could also
reduce<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.010> frequency<00:03:20.490> we<00:03:20.610> see<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.850> happening

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
reduce the frequency we see it happening

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.300 
reduce the frequency we see it happening
so<00:03:21.810> there<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:21.990> go<00:03:22.140> there<00:03:22.530> was<00:03:22.650> five<00:03:22.950> different

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
so there you go there was five different

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.220 
so there you go there was five different
ways<00:03:23.460> where<00:03:23.670> blank<00:03:24.000> media<00:03:24.300> could<00:03:24.540> potentially

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
ways where blank media could potentially

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.380 
ways where blank media could potentially
improve<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.650> game<00:03:25.800> hope<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.460> guys<00:03:26.640> agree<00:03:27.210> and

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
improve the game hope you guys agree and

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.640 
improve the game hope you guys agree and
if<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.510> don't<00:03:27.780> agree<00:03:27.960> please<00:03:28.230> tell<00:03:28.410> me<00:03:28.500> why

improve<00:03:31.980> this<00:03:32.310> game<00:03:32.490> it<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.210> good<00:03:33.450> game<00:03:33.660> as

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
improve this game it is a good game as

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.710 
improve this game it is a good game as
is<00:03:34.500> but<00:03:35.160> as<00:03:35.280> always<00:03:35.640> every<00:03:36.270> game<00:03:36.420> could<00:03:36.600> use<00:03:36.690> a

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
is but as always every game could use a

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.910 
is but as always every game could use a
little<00:03:36.810> bit<00:03:36.960> of<00:03:37.020> improvement<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.560> think<00:03:37.800> we

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
little bit of improvement and I think we

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.530 
little bit of improvement and I think we
know<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.340> some<00:03:38.820> of<00:03:38.850> these<00:03:39.000> issues<00:03:39.180> mentioned
