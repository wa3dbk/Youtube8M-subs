00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello with you ivan and today i have 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.520
 quick video on how to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.660
 wind strings on electric guitar 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.460
 so that they don't 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.160
 were upset 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:16.170
 unusual strata figurative guitar 6 rite 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.100
 in line pegs to corners to onion care 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.810
 very much you understand and they are completely ordinary 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.330
 traditional without any locks there without 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.189
 returned mechanisms the most 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.140
 simple pads 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.140
 let's get closer to the camera 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:38.550
 catch focus 1 moment strings naturally 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.530
 put in the direction of travel i.e. they 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.739
 must be straight the same take 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.950
 when the nut is also after they should 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.059
 wrap up here and so here so here 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.579
 on every beat the second moment is perfect 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.809
 do not need to do 100 500 turns on 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.579
 pin 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.300
 as you can see I have a fat country 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.210
 literally got turns made more 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.210
 thin strings by 12 turns but just 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.490
 because thin strings have friction worse 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.780
 and therefore it is better to make turns 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.180
 a little more in principle 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.780
 2 is enough and the most important secret is 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.110
 here is this secret string 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.720
 coming out of the bag is wrapped in 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:33.600
 the opposite side i mean i 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:36.740
 literally take and finger there doing here 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.240
 each is easy it is easy enough 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.979
 bent in the opposite direction 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.439
 in such a way that the string make the letter y 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.950
 like a legend quarrel or harry's forehead 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.130
 potter 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.790
 such a simple simple manipulation 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.200
 allows much faster faster 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.530
 faster strings 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.960
 put in throughout the design details 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.460
 they hold much better 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.460
 try it you will like it
