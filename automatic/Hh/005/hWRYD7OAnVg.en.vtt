00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
would still have it be the most basic

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.990 
would still have it be the most basic
entry<00:01:39.140> level<00:01:39.650> model<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.159> still<00:01:40.250> be<00:01:40.790> able<00:01:40.939> to

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
entry level model and still be able to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
ralphe the bat see the little thing that

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.130 
ralphe the bat see the little thing that
says<00:01:49.070> shutter<00:01:49.939> speed<00:01:50.299> if<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.600> raise<00:01:51.110> that

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
says shutter speed if you raise that

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.230 
says shutter speed if you raise that
number<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.770> make<00:01:51.979> it<00:01:52.130> longer<00:01:52.280> whenever<00:01:53.000> you

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
number to make it longer whenever you

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.210 
number to make it longer whenever you
take<00:01:53.329> a<00:01:53.509> picture<00:01:53.630> now<00:01:54.110> your<00:01:54.530> camera<00:01:54.590> will<00:01:55.189> be

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
take a picture now your camera will be

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.760 
take a picture now your camera will be
on<00:01:55.310> for<00:01:55.520> several<00:01:56.180> seconds<00:01:56.840> taking<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.740> picture

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
on for several seconds taking a picture

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.130 
on for several seconds taking a picture
for<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.610> amount<00:01:58.790> of<00:01:59.360> time<00:01:59.420> now<00:01:59.869> this<00:02:00.079> is

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
for that amount of time now this is

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.780 
for that amount of time now this is
really<00:02:00.500> cool<00:02:00.619> because<00:02:00.950> what<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:01.340> can<00:02:01.369> do<00:02:01.640> is

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
really cool because what you can do is

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.670 
really cool because what you can do is
take<00:02:01.969> a<00:02:02.030> light<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:02.750> then<00:02:03.020> move<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.350> around<00:02:03.439> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
take a light and then move it around the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.950 
take a light and then move it around the
frame<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.219> you<00:02:04.280> can<00:02:04.610> actually<00:02:04.850> record<00:02:05.119> light

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
frame and you can actually record light

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.319 
frame and you can actually record light
trails<00:02:06.259> with<00:02:06.469> that<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.680> people<00:02:06.950> if<00:02:07.939> you've

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:08.329 
trails with that and people if you've

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:09.580 
trails with that and people if you've
heard<00:02:08.600> of<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.840> technique<00:02:09.200> before<00:02:09.410> it's

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
heard of this technique before it's

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.990 
heard of this technique before it's
called<00:02:09.739> light<00:02:09.950> painting<00:02:10.489> but<00:02:10.520> most<00:02:10.729> people

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
called light painting but most people

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.809 
called light painting but most people
think<00:02:11.209> that<00:02:11.510> oh<00:02:11.810> I<00:02:11.900> just<00:02:12.140> I'm<00:02:12.410> just<00:02:12.860> wave<00:02:13.790> a

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
think that oh I just I'm just wave a

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.110 
think that oh I just I'm just wave a
flashlight<00:02:14.180> around<00:02:14.450> and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
flashlight around and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.880 
flashlight around and
it's<00:02:15.330> done<00:02:15.569> well<00:02:15.870> actually<00:02:16.110> it's<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.650> whole<00:02:16.680> art

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
it's done well actually it's a whole art

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.039 
it's done well actually it's a whole art
form<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.819> itself<00:02:18.150> because<00:02:18.480> there<00:02:18.989> are

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
form in and of itself because there are

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.860 
form in and of itself because there are
dozens<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:20.220> different<00:02:20.310> types<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.390> lights<00:02:21.690> that

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
dozens of different types of lights that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.170 
dozens of different types of lights that
you<00:02:21.989> can<00:02:22.110> use<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.890> light<00:02:23.099> painting<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:24.030> of

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
ways in order to create certain shapes

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.119 
ways in order to create certain shapes
and<00:02:30.569> things<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:32.010> the
