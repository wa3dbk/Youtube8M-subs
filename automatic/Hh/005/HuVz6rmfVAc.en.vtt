00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.380
 hello without tony things and as he says in the 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.320
 video title this mod 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 is for our baby to be free 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.740
 and then if we can not only 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.349
 we have to put the paste one as 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.079
 we usually do it but also 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.030
 bed or even on the floor where so 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.210
 like all babies in the whole saga 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.360
 now they can also be free 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.670
 the 64 percent seam I'm going to 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.890
 leave this page in link of the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.260
 description so they can download 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.840
 this much and then what we do is 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.789
 follow here below where the two says 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.520
 sites to download them I'll go to 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.570
 mediafire we hope you load the page 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.510
 and now once you have already commissioned 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.259
 and we give you here the little button 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.380
 download and it goes downloading down here 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:14.820
 We hope it is downloaded and we give it to 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.810
 give me that has several files what 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.810
 they're going to do is pass these two files 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.680
 for Kate because they are pay for keita 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.220
 there to my documents electronic arts 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.090
 the 64 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.450
 mods and they are going to stick in that folder 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.330
 this is now now just stay 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.880
 start the game then start at the 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.490
 game if you already have babies to find 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.660
 to babies floating in the air and it's 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.480
 because this mod 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.330
 makes their cribs disappear and so 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.760
 allowing the baby to put on 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.410
 anywhere anywhere 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.500
 where it literally is to put and 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.510
 Well, do not think that the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.560
 cradle and that you will not be able to with some 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:11.400
 anything like that can not go the way 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.870
 build or buy and if you look at the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.909
 baby section 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.610
 and you will never find in a stream 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.610
 brook wealth this is part of 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.930
 of the mod that allows our babies 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.819
 they can be fine if you want 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.310
 buy the crib there is no problem 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.739
 here it is 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.739
 they go to the crib is going to have another name 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.230
 but he's going to do the same thing just 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.510
 they have changed the name the mod changes the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.099
 name of the crib and makes the same 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.400
 functionality 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:48.720
 the difference between leaving a baby at 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.269
 air after saying it and leaving it in the crib 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.220
 it's not a difference at the same time if 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.430
 we leave it in bed or if we leave in 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.730
 either side the only thing is that they should 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.090
 have space to fix that we say the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.620
 mom or dad or whoever is going to 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.810
 attend have space to be able to 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.750
 attending to him this way also allows us 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.930
 to be able to handle the baby and what to do 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.450
 that's because there are cases in which 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.580
 We can mothers or children who 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.190
 they want to have the baby attend them 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.200
 etcetera not to be able to catch babies 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.140
 because we say they are in bed and not 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.630
 they have enough space or there is some 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.880
 object that is retaining that she 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.270
 can do this but any type 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.280
 of action with the baby then we can 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.010
 move the baby we have the possibility of 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.660
 do it without any problem and if 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.910
 we want to put in the cradle again 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.920
 we can hit it here but there's no 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.140
 no option that you have for 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.020
 take it to the crib or anything like that 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.810
 so if you want to take it back to 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.240
 the crib or take it to the crib you will have 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.900
 do it yourself for example the mother what 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.330
 is going to cuddle then the mother or the 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.280
 zinc that wants to attend it will come and 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.280
 it does it is going to be the option 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:20.030
 and once you have done this option 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.450
 to leave it in the same place where 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.450
 picked up 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.680
 we are basically serving more like to 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:31.219
 take pictures of all three and so as to 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.830
 feel a little more free thank you for 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:37.189
 watch this video I'm nani and we'll see each other 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.610
 the next one and if we go to the next one 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:43.669
