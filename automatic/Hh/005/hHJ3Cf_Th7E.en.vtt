00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
heavyweight champion of the world I

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.920 
heavyweight champion of the world I
think<00:06:59.160> that's<00:06:59.310> a<00:06:59.430> very<00:06:59.580> very<00:06:59.820> strong<00:07:00.000> as<00:07:00.330> we

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
think that's a very very strong as we

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.100 
think that's a very very strong as we
can<00:07:01.110> get<00:07:01.290> both<00:07:01.470> of<00:07:01.680> them<00:07:01.740> forms<00:07:02.190> within<00:07:03.110> 2015

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
can get both of them forms within 2015

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.650 
can get both of them forms within 2015
it<00:07:04.800> would<00:07:04.950> be<00:07:05.040> fantastic<00:07:05.450> that's<00:07:06.450> what<00:07:06.570> the

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 
it would be fantastic that's what the

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.080 
it would be fantastic that's what the
goal<00:07:06.810> is<00:07:06.840> and<00:07:07.410> we're<00:07:08.340> going<00:07:08.490> to<00:07:08.520> push<00:07:08.700> hard<00:07:08.940> to

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
goal is and we're going to push hard to

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.230 
goal is and we're going to push hard to
do<00:07:09.240> it<00:07:09.390> but<00:07:10.080> can<00:07:10.230> you<00:07:10.260> imagine<00:07:10.730> them<00:07:11.730> to<00:07:11.970> fight

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240
