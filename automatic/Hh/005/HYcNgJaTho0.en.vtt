00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:11.280
 hello I'm cooking a potato soup 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.220
 Can you prepare as time or 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.660
 for days where you score points 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.320
 then you then with sausage 20 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.160
 give 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:25.720
 Of course, I need potatoes for that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.330
 leek carrots parsley and 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.940
 meat broth I take for it water and 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.069
 my homemade meat fit like 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.870
 nicole the prepared that I can you 

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:39.249
 the link 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.949
 for sarah days little ham than 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:45.940
 insert and taste the whole thing 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.879
 cream cheese light off but I do it 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:54.190
 Today has not he do I take 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:56.289
 some cafÃ© cream and sliced â€‹â€‹sausage 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.019
 purely then I take the go sorry 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.780
 Sausages there has only one sausage 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.390
 point 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.360
 I have the vegetables in rough now 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.380
 pieces cut and washed 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.299
 I have from at presentation of the ingredients 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.320
 still forget that something else 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.840
 olive oil needs a tablespoon for the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.840
 Big pot was not okay 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.200
 even if it has been days since you need one 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.230
 two servings of oil 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.690
 That's why I think it's ok if you are in such 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.490
 a big pot because also something pure 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.620
 gives 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.860
 I now advise the run something 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.860
 on 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.250
 to run 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.620
 are you looking forward to yet 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.690
 who are now also making it well 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.690
 encountered 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.030
 that was one and a half liter of 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.440
 mine will fit for now about 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.440
 three teaspoons 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.780
 which is fit is very salty 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.890
 There is therefore no additional 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.620
 salt more 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.599
 the whole comes now the treasures 20 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.599
 minutes then everything is well white 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.360
 but a little longer that cooks about one 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:05.549
 hour 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:08.959
 of course you could eat like that now 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:13.440
 tee with breakfast or they can be 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.450
 Press potato mash something small or 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.760
 with the magic wand through 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.860
 I do it master so I take that 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:45.290
 potato mash and crushed ones are 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:45.290
 what do I take something then 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.090
 the rest has to be with the 12 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:26.240
 then the study breaks down again so 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.760
 For one I have the cream of the 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.670
 patient sugar on the other, 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:37.760
 some of the little pieces of the dish 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.240
 said mama make dashing ham 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.400
 small and give him to the cream cheese 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.140
 I would always give first if I did 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.730
 the serve because I do not know exactly 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.880
 how he behaves when you get the 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:53.000
 Cream cheese does not warm it that way 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.880
 stable because its lead product is me 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:05.510
 Now give about 100 milliliters 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:09.530
 ten percent cafe creams like 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.370
 Sausages have very fine rings 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.500
 sliced 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.330
 Of course you could also sausage him 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.900
 to give that completely pure 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.900
 a matter of taste 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:36.389
 I have this big pot now 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:39.740
 cut eight small sausages like that 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.740
 Now comes some parsley 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:51.629
 the whole pot is about three and a half 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:58.080
 kilo has 34 points that means such a 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:06:00.449
 ladle has just 21 I will 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.909
 super portionwise freeze that works 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.539
 it's alright so I always have one 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:08.339
 tame dinner 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:11.059
 You could also have some in the fridge 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:11.059
 keep it for a few days 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:18.919
 that's what the potato soup looks like 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.919
 served out
