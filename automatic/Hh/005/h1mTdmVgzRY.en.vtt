can see the hatch is loose from the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.730 
can see the hatch is loose from the
molded<00:01:15.420> boat<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.520> if<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.640> take<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> cup<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.299> water

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
molded boat and if I take a cup of water

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.749 
molded boat and if I take a cup of water
and<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> run<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:22.049> way<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.009> I

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and it's going to run in this way and I

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
and it's going to run in this way and I
pour<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> deck

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:38.990 

I<00:01:33.710> think<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.770> leaks<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.320> i<00:01:37.470> move<00:01:38.000> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
I think that leaks and if i move the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.620 
I think that leaks and if i move the
hatch<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.479> little<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:46.940> mean<00:01:47.940> it's<00:01:48.119> even<00:01:48.420> less

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
hatch a little I mean it's even less

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:57.740 
hatch a little I mean it's even less
