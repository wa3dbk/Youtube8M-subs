 3 art will go to that flank trying somehow 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.260
 to fight 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.660
 why us from the stage on prokhorovka 454 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:34.469
 plus 251 you have not replaced 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.570
 mouth 251 on another 54 you will consider what 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.829
 request not understanding the difference between pis 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.170
 four ru 251 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.210
 these are completely different tanks this is not 2 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.010
 same fast non-drum lts 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.469
 slightly different charging characteristics 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.590
 armor they have completely different uses 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.420
 and one went to this factor very badly 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.160
 the battle is regular and here is success with the kid 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.160
 ice people with writers 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.439
 before the next shit fight for what you can 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:20.470
 pursed to fight because 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:20.470
 leave from here I will not leave already 2 120 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:42.410
 now he's on the ball or at least promptly inserted 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:51.980
 good since I thought he wasn't so 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:55.610
 to call in normal muscles will still give a couple 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:02:03.500
 Hole here and there, too, can play 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:07.300
 be like something like from the tower it is better 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.300
 it was not necessary to turn around the case 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.209
 we will not do it and what they do 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.350
 I really wonder why he 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:26.260
 shoots the manipulation of our fool 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:29.970
 rather than touching sadness what happens 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.970
 that they so rarely shoot at me 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.850
