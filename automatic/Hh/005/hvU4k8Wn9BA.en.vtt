times over the course of these three

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490 
times over the course of these three
days<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.420> pretty<00:01:36.900> much<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.290> pay

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
days and you pretty much have to pay

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.429 
days and you pretty much have to pay
attention<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:38.450> well<00:01:39.450> very<00:01:39.840> strict<00:01:40.170> attention

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
attention to well very strict attention

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.749 
attention to well very strict attention
to<00:01:40.619> when<00:01:40.860> they're<00:01:41.009> happening<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.640> you

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
to when they're happening because if you

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.340 
to when they're happening because if you
miss<00:01:41.939> one<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.299> can't<00:01:42.810> really<00:01:42.899> pick<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
miss one you can't really pick up the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.719 
miss one you can't really pick up the
story<00:01:43.560> again<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.130> you'll<00:01:44.280> probably<00:01:44.579> just

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
story again and you'll probably just

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.569 
story again and you'll probably just
want<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.119> reload<00:01:45.390> your<00:01:45.420> game<00:01:45.720> after<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.579> so

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
want to reload your game after that so

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.460 
want to reload your game after that so
in<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.240> sense<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.630> don't<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
in that sense you don't have all that

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.179 
in that sense you don't have all that
much<00:01:50.009> free<00:01:50.280> time<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:50.909> around<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.570> check

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
much free time to go around and check

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.219 
much free time to go around and check
everything<00:01:53.189> out<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.640> that's<00:01:54.360> that's<00:01:54.780> sort<00:01:55.200> of

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
everything out and that's that's sort of

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.530 
everything out and that's that's sort of
made<00:01:55.439> its<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.040> even<00:01:56.310> more<00:01:56.430> difficult<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.939> to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
made its it's even more difficult to to

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.789 
made its it's even more difficult to to
see<00:01:57.719> everything<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.170> first<00:01:58.320> time<00:01:58.560> through

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
see everything the first time through

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.139 
see everything the first time through
just<00:01:59.009> because<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.369> save<00:01:59.579> system<00:01:59.969> there's

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
just because the save system there's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.850 
just because the save system there's
only<00:02:00.240> one<00:02:00.509> slot<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.049> save<00:02:01.229> your<00:02:01.380> game<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.710> every

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
only one slot to save your game so every

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.910 
only one slot to save your game so every
time<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.040> save<00:02:02.509> whether<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> safe

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
time you save whether it's in the safe

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.190 
time you save whether it's in the safe
room<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> security<00:02:05.939> room<00:02:05.969> or<00:02:06.329> any<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
room in the security room or any of the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.710 
room in the security room or any of the
mall<00:02:07.590> bathrooms<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> override

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
mall bathrooms it's going to override

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.540 
mall bathrooms it's going to override
the<00:02:09.840> same<00:02:10.020> slot<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.560> there's<00:02:10.739> no<00:02:10.860> real<00:02:11.099> going

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
the same slot so there's no real going

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.450 
the same slot so there's no real going
back

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.840 
story mode and you can save and exit
which<00:02:58.990> cancels<00:02:59.500> your<00:02:59.590> your<00:03:00.160> story<00:03:00.400> progress

which cancels your your story progress

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.540 
which cancels your your story progress
basically<00:03:01.330> but<00:03:01.660> it'll<00:03:01.960> keep<00:03:02.200> your<00:03:02.920> statistics

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
basically but it'll keep your statistics

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.550 
basically but it'll keep your statistics
for<00:03:03.790> Frank<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.990> start<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.410> story

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
for Frank so that you start the story

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.170 
for Frank so that you start the story
mode<00:03:05.830> over<00:03:05.980> with<00:03:06.370> all<00:03:06.520> these<00:03:06.640> augmented

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
mode over with all these augmented

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.700 
mode over with all these augmented
abilities<00:03:07.570> making<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.020> easier<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.590> move

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
abilities making it easier to move

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.770 
abilities making it easier to move
through<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:09.670> dead<00:03:10.060> rising<00:03:10.330> is<00:03:10.420> definitely

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
through and so dead rising is definitely

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.090 
through and so dead rising is definitely
a<00:03:10.840> game<00:03:11.020> that<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.470> need<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.710> play<00:03:11.860> through

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
a game that you need to play through

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.100 
a game that you need to play through
multiple<00:03:12.640> times<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.090> really<00:03:13.330> see<00:03:13.660> everything

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
multiple times to really see everything

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.720 
multiple times to really see everything
and<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.920> know<00:03:15.010> that's<00:03:15.220> not<00:03:15.280> really<00:03:15.520> such<00:03:15.700> a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
and you know that's not really such a

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.030 
and you know that's not really such a
bad<00:03:15.820> thing<00:03:16.030> it's<00:03:16.900> it's<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.290> lot<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.500> fun<00:03:17.710> to<00:03:17.860> do

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
bad thing it's it's a lot of fun to do

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.590 
bad thing it's it's a lot of fun to do
the<00:03:18.250> first<00:03:18.430> time<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.760> get<00:03:18.940> through<00:03:19.240> you're

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
the first time you get through you're

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.880 
the first time you get through you're
definitely<00:03:19.870> going<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.200> want<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.470> charge
