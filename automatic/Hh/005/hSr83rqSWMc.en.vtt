00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the inner ear behind the headset and I

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.750

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
really hadn't had anything to compare it

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.609 
really hadn't had anything to compare it
to<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:02.449> had<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> couple<00:01:03.660> problems<00:01:03.960> with<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.470> in

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
to I had a couple problems with it in

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.520 
to I had a couple problems with it in
that<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.369> was<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.580> her<00:01:05.670> ear<00:01:06.110> if<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.290> warm

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
that because it was in her ear if I warm

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.810 
that because it was in her ear if I warm
for<00:01:07.740> an<00:01:07.799> extended<00:01:08.130> period<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.369> time<00:01:08.430> they

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
for an extended period of time they

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.670 
for an extended period of time they
would<00:01:08.939> kind<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.180> start<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.570> put<00:01:10.260> some<00:01:10.500> pressure

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
would kind of start to put some pressure

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.270 
would kind of start to put some pressure
in<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.070> ears<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.580> little<00:01:11.820> headache<00:01:11.970> or<00:01:13.280> they

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
in my ears in a little headache or they

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.240 
in my ears in a little headache or they
were<00:01:14.340> pretty<00:01:14.580> rigid<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.710> didn't<00:01:17.130> love

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
were pretty rigid and so I didn't love

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.280 
were pretty rigid and so I didn't love
that<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.790> also<00:01:17.909> found<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:18.930> buttons

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that I also found that there was buttons

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
that I also found that there was buttons
on<00:01:19.409> both<00:01:19.590> sides<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> unit<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.060> would

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
on both sides of the unit so I would

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.880 
on both sides of the unit so I would
always<00:01:21.540> try<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.810> remember<00:01:22.200> which<00:01:22.560> side<00:01:22.830> I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
always try to remember which side I

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
always try to remember which side I
should<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.340> pushing<00:01:23.759> buttons<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.450> increase

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
should be pushing buttons on to increase

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.020 
should be pushing buttons on to increase
or<00:01:25.409> decrease<00:01:25.500> volume<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.280> change<00:01:26.490> track<00:01:26.820> or

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
or decrease volume or change track or

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.179 
or decrease volume or change track or
accept<00:01:27.600> an<00:01:27.689> incoming<00:01:27.960> call<00:01:28.080> plus<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> buttons

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
accept an incoming call plus the buttons

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.190 
accept an incoming call plus the buttons
were<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:29.640> small<00:01:29.970> because<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.509> unit

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
were a little bit small because the unit

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.800 
were a little bit small because the unit
was<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> inner<00:01:31.799> ear<00:01:32.040> sort<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.520> thin<00:01:33.150> piece<00:01:33.780> of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
was a inner ear sort of thin piece of

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.520 
was a inner ear sort of thin piece of
plastic<00:01:35.329> but<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.630> turns<00:01:36.810> out<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.990> lost<00:01:37.290> them

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
plastic but as it turns out I lost them

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.170 
plastic but as it turns out I lost them
I<00:01:37.680> left<00:01:37.979> them<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.250> an<00:01:38.400> airplane<00:01:38.670> coming<00:01:38.939> back

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
I left them on an airplane coming back

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.390 
I left them on an airplane coming back
from<00:01:39.329> London<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> kind<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> went<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
from London and so I kind of went to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100 
from London and so I kind of went to
bestbuy<00:01:41.640> looking<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.240> another<00:01:42.360> solution<00:01:42.780> I

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
bestbuy looking for another solution I

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.480 
bestbuy looking for another solution I
thought<00:01:43.500> about<00:01:43.680> buying<00:01:43.890> another<00:01:44.009> pair<00:01:44.460> there

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
thought about buying another pair there

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.520 
thought about buying another pair there
100<00:01:45.210> bucks<00:01:45.659> hundred<00:01:46.020> ten<00:01:46.140> bucks<00:01:46.320> something

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
put a lot of pressure in my ears they

put a lot of pressure in my ears they
just<00:02:33.810> sit<00:02:33.989> comfortably<00:02:34.379> so<00:02:34.890> they're<00:02:35.040> not<00:02:35.159> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
just sit comfortably so they're not the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.559 
just sit comfortably so they're not the
most<00:02:35.310> attractive<00:02:35.579> thing<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.269> world<00:02:36.480> but

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
most attractive thing in the world but

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.699 
most attractive thing in the world but
actually<00:02:37.049> they're<00:02:37.230> they're<00:02:37.500> quite

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
actually they're they're quite

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.800 
actually they're they're quite
comfortable<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:39.030> second<00:02:39.329> thing<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.540> really

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
comfortable the second thing I really

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.649 
comfortable the second thing I really
liked<00:02:39.989> about<00:02:40.140> them<00:02:40.439> is<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:41.030> all<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.299> units

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
liked about them is that all the units

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.170 
liked about them is that all the units
buttons<00:02:43.049> are<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.230> one<00:02:43.560> piece<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.670> everything<00:02:45.090> I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
buttons are on one piece so everything I

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.699 
buttons are on one piece so everything I
need<00:02:45.329> to<00:02:45.389> control<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.870> unit<00:02:46.139> is<00:02:46.290> right<00:02:46.530> here

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
need to control the unit is right here

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.319 
need to control the unit is right here
on<00:02:46.799> this<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.430> guess<00:02:48.000> would<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.209> my<00:02:48.450> left<00:02:48.720> ear

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
on this one I guess would be my left ear

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.199 
on this one I guess would be my left ear
the<00:02:52.129> if<00:02:53.129> you're<00:02:53.310> wearing<00:02:53.459> them<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.970> top

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
the if you're wearing them the top

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.789 
the if you're wearing them the top
button<00:02:55.139> does<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:56.069> volume<00:02:57.030> control<00:02:57.480> ok<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.530> I

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
button does the volume control ok so I

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.589 
button does the volume control ok so I
can<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.370> don't<00:02:59.670> know<00:02:59.760> if<00:02:59.819> you<00:02:59.909> can<00:03:00.060> see<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.450> on

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
can I don't know if you can see that on

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.960 
can I don't know if you can see that on
the<00:03:00.689> video<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.200> lets<00:03:01.709> me<00:03:01.829> toggle<00:03:02.280> volume

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
the video but it lets me toggle volume

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.539 
the video but it lets me toggle volume
up<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.299> down<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:04.170> bottom<00:03:04.620> toggle<00:03:05.129> lets<00:03:05.370> me

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
up and down the bottom toggle lets me

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.210 
up and down the bottom toggle lets me
change<00:03:05.819> track<00:03:06.269> forward<00:03:07.109> or<00:03:07.230> backward<00:03:07.620> then

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
change track forward or backward then

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.759 
change track forward or backward then
there's<00:03:08.489> also<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.090> ability<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.720> make<00:03:10.139> and

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
there's also the ability to make and

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.000 
there's also the ability to make and
receive<00:03:11.069> phone<00:03:11.280> calls<00:03:11.519> on<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.750> side<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.409> then

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
receive phone calls on the side and then

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.729 
receive phone calls on the side and then
where<00:03:14.639> you<00:03:14.790> change<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.299> tracks<00:03:15.599> are<00:03:15.930> all<00:03:16.019> is

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
where you change the tracks are all is

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.490 
where you change the tracks are all is
also<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.250> microUSB<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.319> connection<00:03:19.319> for

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
also the microUSB a connection for

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.710 
also the microUSB a connection for
charging<00:03:19.919> so<00:03:20.340> everything<00:03:20.819> happens<00:03:21.209> just<00:03:21.510> on

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
charging so everything happens just on

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.180 
charging so everything happens just on
the<00:03:21.810> one<00:03:22.019> side<00:03:22.049> so<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.620> don't<00:03:22.799> ever<00:03:22.949> have<00:03:23.010> to

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
the one side so I don't ever have to

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.129 
the one side so I don't ever have to
guess<00:03:23.370> which<00:03:23.549> hand<00:03:23.699> I<00:03:23.879> should<00:03:24.030> be<00:03:24.150> using<00:03:24.510> so

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
guess which hand I should be using so

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.649 
guess which hand I should be using so
that<00:03:25.319> was<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> really<00:03:25.739> nice<00:03:25.980> feature<00:03:26.389> the<00:03:27.389> next

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
that was a really nice feature the next

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.000 
that was a really nice feature the next
thing<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.870> really<00:03:28.139> like<00:03:28.319> is<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.709> fact<00:03:28.739> that

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
thing I really like is the fact that

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.430 
thing I really like is the fact that
they're<00:03:29.190> extremely<00:03:29.819> flexible<00:03:30.269> they're<00:03:31.019> very

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
they're extremely flexible they're very

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
flexible I can just literally slide them

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.309 
flexible I can just literally slide them
into<00:03:33.750> my<00:03:33.900> laptop<00:03:34.349> bag<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.859> flatten<00:03:35.819> them<00:03:35.909> out

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
into my laptop bag and flatten them out

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.539 
into my laptop bag and flatten them out
usually<00:03:37.319> I<00:03:37.379> go<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.709> way<00:03:37.949> where<00:03:38.220> they're<00:03:38.370> in

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
usually I go this way where they're in

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
back and really don't take up any space

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.149 
back and really don't take up any space
pushing<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.239> laptop<00:03:45.659> bag<00:03:45.870> out<00:03:46.109> so<00:03:46.859> for<00:03:47.099> those

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
pushing the laptop bag out so for those

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.860 
pushing the laptop bag out so for those
of<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.459> travel<00:03:47.849> a<00:03:47.879> lot<00:03:47.909> you<00:03:48.269> know<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.659> less

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
of you travel a lot you know the less

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.479 
of you travel a lot you know the less
space<00:03:49.139> if<00:03:49.409> they<00:03:49.560> slide<00:03:49.799> nicely<00:03:50.010> into<00:03:50.340> like<00:03:50.459> a

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
space if they slide nicely into like a

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.360 
space if they slide nicely into like a
CD<00:03:50.909> pocket<00:03:51.299> inside<00:03:51.569> your<00:03:51.780> laptop<00:03:52.109> bag<00:03:52.370> and

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
CD pocket inside your laptop bag and

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.559 
CD pocket inside your laptop bag and
then<00:03:53.519> they<00:03:53.609> snap<00:03:53.879> right<00:03:54.030> back<00:03:54.090> into<00:03:54.419> position

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
then they snap right back into position

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.140 
then they snap right back into position
so<00:03:55.319> they're<00:03:55.799> very<00:03:55.829> very<00:03:56.400> flexible<00:03:57.030> in<00:03:57.090> that

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
so they're very very flexible in that

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.830 
so they're very very flexible in that
way<00:03:58.669> the<00:03:59.669> battery<00:04:00.000> life<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.209> excellent<00:04:00.780> on

one little adapter and two chords if
they<00:05:01.410> were<00:05:01.470> micro<00:05:01.919> would<00:05:02.040> be<00:05:02.130> a<00:05:02.160> little<00:05:02.310> better
