00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.900
 good today as you see touches techniques 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.580
 short gun weapon we will perform 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.580
 more little as always 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.629
 we have a gun cut a gun 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.690
 heading into the center of our 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.660
 head 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.629
 first difference if it is a short weapon 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.519
 a gun for being positive by looking 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.949
 the positive side when it comes to fighting 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.559
 I can grab the gun if I had a 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.899
 Razor could not grab the gun not what 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.699
 would use from the joints of the 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.860
 members of the body because if I do not 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.199
 would cut in agreement then in this 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.299
 case as always quiet submission 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.610
 that the hands do not see that they are a 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:04.149
 threat of agreement and I will make a 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.600
 move two movements in 11 grab 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.580
 the weapon 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.229
 and 2 remove my head to this side 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.689
 when I am here in this division 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.540
 grab the weapon and if it is always towards 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.340
 up always up never the 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.320
 sideways or down because you can 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.930
 having people there can be children women and 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.330
 we do not want to hurt anyone when I do not 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.970
 I have here you are not strong human at the same time 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.509
 hit on his testicles and shot towards 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:34.940
 down at this moment it would break the 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:37.610
 arms fingers down he pointed at me 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.960
 around I have it held until 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.170
 come the police 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.960
 in agreement 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.040
 important concepts when I take a 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.710
 weapon is first very quiet I know 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.259
 that impresses a lot but almost almost 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.330
 I prefer to disarm a encaÃ±onado 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.000
 gun that does not a knife just 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.590
 violence that I can grab add to the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.230
 war your weapon the lever is double 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.360
 with which a dislocation 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.280
 It always does a lot more damage from the 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.460
 doll because it lengthens its 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.770
 articulation that only what is the 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.690
 Agreed doll grabbed the gun makes 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.810
 much more damage very much careful because the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.050
 finger will work 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.300
 when he was pointing and running the 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.380
 risk that that tension when using it 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.550
 is hitting shots that make the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.150
 little tugs that he performs in the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.150
 charger 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.740
 and well I hope you liked the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.300
 technique and as always visit our 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.920
