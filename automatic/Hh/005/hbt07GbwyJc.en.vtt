00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.810
 Italian football obviously needs no introduction because everyone knows who 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.519
 six 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.070
 but here in a slightly different version dressed as you soundtrack 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.900
 you hold in yourself themes that I wanted to know what it is and then you are too 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.300
 here to present his photography book weave by destop io -.- 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.839
 everything except that I am always dressed like this is normal for my life 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.189
 plays the horses and then 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.779
 you can always my hat my favorite shoes to work 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.270
 and then my boots so it's not zalman you would give particular but they are really 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:35.990
 so 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.370
 then with regard to the canine breed I hope minimally 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.710
 a place because many have been looking for a person you were looking for wanted 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.550
 come along too 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.040
 in reality it is a school where we teach people to live with horses a 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.930
 doing real life above all is writing all the trades 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.069
 behaves 

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:58.069
 have cattle have horses and work with them 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.999
 and therefore we often also in America from our friends this time 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:06.549
 we brought the Americans that hurts milano and bay area. to illustrate 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.649
 all the beautiful beautiful things also tiring and because the front life does not 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.490
 it's really a very simple thing 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.409
 at the moment 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.770
 I must say that the Milanese public is very intrigued by 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.090
 from this from this aspect of life with horses and this is what we have 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.710
 also brought to our workshops if there is a couple of times a day 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.420
 just to show precisely 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.530
 all that we combine every day some story of the 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.070
 life 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.640
 avella - are 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.720
 omg racconti there would be many one of the last stories and own book 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.410
 because we did a photo book just to tell 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.410
 all our stories all our stories 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.600
 it is in the world in fact in this book I could to see the photographs taken 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.690
 in spain with red berries in andalusia eni in france because there are tamaris 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.260
 exist butteri of the exact maremma - aifa oboe 7 of the American west and that 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.250
 of course, I too am following these cattle herds, for example 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.720
 and long kilometers and kilometers 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.300
 or we are also in the midst of snow storms because sometimes there is 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.129
 also happened to be in situations 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.290
 a little difficult forbidden I left it to look also inas trieste 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.219
 know if they want to come here to take a look 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.129
 and this is my life practically in here is everything I did in 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.549
 these last few years since then this new runway lends 10 to the sea are 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.629
 passed quickly because when one does what one likes 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.189
 and when passion becomes your job or vice versa 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.719
 it is wonderful everything passes quickly 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.879
 we used to see you in my shoes 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.669
 if however not formal it has always been a precise choice 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.990
 if we say that it forms part of my life I used to work a classic line 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.119
 where I returned to television 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:03:00.180
 now i'm with horses and i think my heart will stay here because it's one 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:04.329
 passion so strong I think I never had it for home 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:05.220
 I don't know not there 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.990
 I am a person who closes says I want to do this until the last of the 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.939
 my days 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.149
 yo don't know 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:16.979
 life valve with a philosophy of versano I don't want certainties 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:20.759
 and I always want some surprises because until now the ones he had 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:24.859
 they have all been beautiful for that night I am not afraid to say welcome that 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.979
 which is why I have always been positive things that have helped 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.109
 to grow 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.389
 the passion for the world of horses was born 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.080
 it was born a little by chance i'm doing the last you know 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.659
 he is a friend claudio lippi who presented how the transmission told me mariano 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.659
 good Sunday we go to the country I introduce you to you 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.940
 and he has horses if you want we can go out so you can do 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.600
 but what comes to you is one who is better than beautiful horses e-mail than pleasure 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.260
 find yourself 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.959
 horse does not talk about it 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.019
 then I had to dance the rehearsal rooms if I didn't lose her dangerously 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.079
 certainly 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.389
 instead they convinced me of the theater inside this story 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.970
 because water started to do some English and then English lessons 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.139
 with my daughter 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.299
 we got passionate together we started to fly thinking about having a 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.329
 then we bought our horse from there the long endless list 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.289
 the horses that came back after him and 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.909
 and now I am 12 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.319
 photo craft 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:27.659
