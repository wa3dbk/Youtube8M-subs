00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 all together with again clear and today 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.870
 I'm going for you again 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.849
 often less on the way because I wanted 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.160
 show you a little trick here 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.099
 and that it comes here to this 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.809
 access fragments or the apex pension and 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.970
 we need them for a daily 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.670
 uncertain invisible catches that means 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.410
 whole and yes I wanted to show now 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.300
 how to get that pretty fast because 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.740
 this is always a little bit by 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.609
 the source if you have a lot of people 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.260
 on the way 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.820
 in the beginning I convincing my level 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.750
 relatively fast about these treasures 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.550
 However, the problem is so 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.579
 far advanced that I am here 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.000
 now has and guess though 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.590
 the 50 pieces or 51 are me and believe 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.149
 I'll get it elsewhere now 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.690
 does not have to be from the mob either 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.100
 always there 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.480
 That's why I wanted to give you one 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.489
 show others where you all this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.199
 gets relatively fast and we do 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.719
 we are down here at the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.149
 passage between the upper lower 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.850
 part of firs jungle and there run 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.510
 Let's just go in and give 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.180
 There are some spots where you can find very fast 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.310
 accordingly this yes this 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.229
 text fragments will get up though we have 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.560
 grant a Wrabetz on the spot 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.580
 Although there is passport where it is 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.150
 a box there and that once here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.280
 this just not up here then then here 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.290
 there is still a spot and here there is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.880
 still a spot okay these spots are 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.880
 just not all there 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.979
 the same must have still saved and 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.930
 Although what we do now is in the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.790
 tool go in that accordingly 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.780
 has already shown a few times and indeed 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.689
 here in christinas is press here 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.090
 Just go in for a go 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.670
 the first group in and you see here 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.189
 have a box there when the box 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.880
 and let's see if he's outside too 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.490
 another box 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.680
 I do not have a box, okay 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.450
 we'll do it now and we'll pick it up 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.659
 now the mobs here and that the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.729
 thick and then it is something completely 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.259
 important is when you make the stuff on 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.020
 and then because in the raid time you get it 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.720
 no progress for the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.700
 That's why we love now for the quest 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.080
 the group we stay so long on the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.670
 server you see we are still up 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.250
 silver moon as long as I'm fighting here 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.910
 so we make it now 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.650
 the box on three patents do not get 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.840
 but go now to the next one 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.220
 even further can do that from me 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.170
 blow we are now infight 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.130
 women back to the lost mock away 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.220
 have this back on it 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.370
 next to the a bit with then he would have 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.660
 makes me now the box comes up 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:49.940
 quickly talk a bit fix that 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:56.180
 Something great had to do with him somehow 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:59.580
 if we get away then a box on 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.100
 Tricks again that fits differently 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.970
 Engament on it then we were the crate 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.820
 let's get two out in there again 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.900
 luck has got you three out 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.310
 and now we can do the same 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.640
 do it again now we have the order 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.630
 and we are back to mine 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.760
 original server so here 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.810
 antoni that and all you can now 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.890
 make a little twisted video search 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.690
 Of course, I'll stay that long now 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.890
 on antoni that up to accordingly 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.250
 here again comes from the fight house 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.140
 Now I'm out of the fight 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.820
 again we look at the new server 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.209
 if they do that here are not 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.209
 do 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.160
 theoretically there is one more 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.990
 if you long to other gang here 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.760
 now you get back there 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:50.910
 Accordingly, a box 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.470
 but you can also just then so 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.560
 long the strap hop in the end 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.060
 here with this add on to her one 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.120
 Crate there I will now too 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.400
 do it here again 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.459
 went well and seem pure again 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.720
 we have, of course, times can 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.720
 you just fix it in a jarring way 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.200
 and as soon as you get out of the fight 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.940
 time off he comes accordingly 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.979
 again on the server we'll take a look 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:27.220
 now in tournaments already on the 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:29.759
 market a box read and again 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.759
 new 1 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.000
 is always just that look out of here 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.169
 fight ahead time practically natural 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.169
 if stays are great 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.220
 look at which rihm is already 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:48.639
 gone is the team out later then 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.599
 the market my box on 8 no I am 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:57.159
 Of course, not from space is that 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:59.229
 that's exactly where we go in 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:01.599
 Accordingly, the box is normal 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.699
 forest we are the mox in the year is 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.340
 always look very important when I am 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.080
 of course intentionally done because of me 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.900
 Accordingly, it wanted to show you 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.000
 So if you are still in the raid 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.500
 then it is in the southwest 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.840
 simply these caste do not live the 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.969
 thick because they still have to 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.039
 there is a little carsten here 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.610
 couple does not want to drive our world 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.389
 can do this then a little too 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.530
 We would be back on it 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.050
 end of the video i hope i could 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.009
 help the team 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.210
 Should that be the case I have to 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.389
 me of course, thumbs up 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.310
 or if you like more such short 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.599
 Watching videos you can see me 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.770
 Of course, subscribe or 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.770
 dish until next time
