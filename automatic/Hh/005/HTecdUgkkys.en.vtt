00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.080 

there<00:02:27.760> we<00:02:27.849> go<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:29.769> took<00:02:30.099> a<00:02:30.370> hundred<00:02:30.760> and

there we go and it took a hundred and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.770 
there we go and it took a hundred and
eight<00:02:31.300> seconds<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.360> powermac<00:02:34.360> to

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
eight seconds for the powermac to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.900 
eight seconds for the powermac to
complete<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.290> task<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.920> same<00:02:36.220> task<00:02:36.580> took

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
complete this task the same task took

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.690 
complete this task the same task took
124<00:02:37.840> seconds<00:02:38.230> on<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.380> Pentium<00:02:38.769> 3<00:02:38.980> running<00:02:39.610> at

124 seconds on the Pentium 3 running at
a<00:02:39.760> gigahertz<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.600> if<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.380> calculate<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.090> it

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
a gigahertz and if you calculate this it

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.780 
a gigahertz and if you calculate this it
yields<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> result<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.440> power<00:02:44.950> mac<00:02:45.250> g4

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
yields the result that the power mac g4

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.270 
yields the result that the power mac g4
running<00:02:46.239> at<00:02:46.360> 500<00:02:46.989> megahertz<00:02:47.319> is<00:02:47.739> the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
running at 500 megahertz is the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.699 
running at 500 megahertz is the
equivalent<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.060> 1<00:02:49.330> point<00:02:49.690> 1<00:02:49.959> gigahertz

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
equivalent of a 1 point 1 gigahertz

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.570 
equivalent of a 1 point 1 gigahertz

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
Pentium 1 point 1 gigahertz Pentium in

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.770 
Pentium 1 point 1 gigahertz Pentium in
performance<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:56.170> we<00:02:56.560> thought<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.890> was<00:02:57.069> great

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
performance so we thought this was great

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.740 
performance so we thought this was great
but<00:02:58.780> we<00:02:59.350> got<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.890> think<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:01.140> if<00:03:03.239> 1g4<00:03:04.239> was<00:03:04.540> this

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
but we got to think it if 1g4 was this

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.569 
but we got to think it if 1g4 was this
fast<00:03:05.970> two<00:03:06.970> brains<00:03:07.330> are<00:03:07.540> better<00:03:07.599> than<00:03:07.870> one<00:03:08.579> so

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
fast two brains are better than one so

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.300 
fast two brains are better than one so
what<00:03:09.880> if<00:03:10.000> we<00:03:10.200> took<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.650> g4s<00:03:13.530> running<00:03:14.530> at<00:03:14.680> 500

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
what if we took to g4s running at 500

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.610 
what if we took to g4s running at 500
megahertz<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:16.030> said<00:03:16.660> how<00:03:16.900> does<00:03:17.109> that<00:03:17.290> compare

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
megahertz and said how does that compare

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.259 
megahertz and said how does that compare
to<00:03:18.220> 1<00:03:19.079> pentium<00:03:20.079> 3<00:03:20.380> running<00:03:20.680> at<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.829> gigahertz

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.240 
down three two one go so the same image
file<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.209> same<00:03:55.480> actions<00:03:56.049> now<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.799> course<00:03:57.040> we

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
file the same actions now of course we

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.849 
file the same actions now of course we
can<00:03:57.519> take<00:03:57.730> that<00:03:57.760> same<00:03:58.239> file<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:58.959> run<00:03:59.410> it<00:03:59.470> from

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
can take that same file and run it from

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.640 
can take that same file and run it from
the<00:03:59.950> single<00:04:00.609> g4<00:04:01.209> now<00:04:01.450> on<00:04:01.660> dual<00:04:01.930> g4s<00:04:02.500> and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
the single g4 now on dual g4s and

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.460 
the single g4 now on dual g4s and
photoshop<00:04:03.569> automatically<00:04:04.569> has<00:04:04.959> built-in

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
photoshop automatically has built-in

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.920

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.349 
support for the dual process of g4 chip
and<00:04:08.170> so<00:04:08.680> you'll<00:04:08.829> see<00:04:09.010> much<00:04:09.190> faster<00:04:09.730> speech<00:04:10.060> now

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
and so you'll see much faster speech now

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.870 
and so you'll see much faster speech now
as<00:04:10.630> it's<00:04:11.200> breaking<00:04:11.680> up<00:04:11.769> its<00:04:11.980> tasks<00:04:12.400> across<00:04:12.609> the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
as it's breaking up its tasks across the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.270 
as it's breaking up its tasks across the
two<00:04:13.030> processors

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.410 

so<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.370> powermac<00:04:18.790> is<00:04:18.940> laid<00:04:19.120> in<00:04:19.150> its

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
so the powermac is laid in its

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.240 
so the powermac is laid in its
background<00:04:19.660> with<00:04:20.140> its<00:04:20.320> transforms<00:04:20.980> and<00:04:21.160> its

each equals a 2 gigahertz Pentium you
can't<00:05:45.850> buy<00:05:46.030> such<00:05:46.270> a<00:05:46.300> thing<00:05:46.540> but<00:05:46.660> when<00:05:46.810> you<00:05:46.900> can

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
can't buy such a thing but when you can

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.850 
can't buy such a thing but when you can
it<00:05:47.350> will<00:05:47.440> be<00:05:47.620> equal<00:05:48.160> so<00:05:48.990> it's<00:05:49.990> amazing<00:05:50.620> and

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
it will be equal so it's amazing and

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
what are we going to do with this well

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.280 
what are we going to do with this well
it's<00:05:54.310> running<00:05:54.640> at<00:05:54.730> over<00:05:54.940> seven<00:05:55.360> gigaflops<00:05:55.840> and

it's running at over seven gigaflops and

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.740 
it's running at over seven gigaflops and
we<00:05:56.950> want<00:05:57.280> to<00:05:57.400> get<00:05:57.550> this<00:05:57.730> performance<00:05:58.420> out<00:05:58.600> to

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
we want to get this performance out to

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.100 
we want to get this performance out to
everybody<00:05:59.020> so<00:05:59.470> as<00:05:59.650> you<00:06:00.010> know<00:06:00.040> we<00:06:00.940> make<00:06:01.150> three

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
everybody so as you know we make three

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.250 
everybody so as you know we make three
models<00:06:02.530> of<00:06:02.710> power<00:06:03.130> max<00:06:03.460> and<00:06:03.990> what<00:06:04.990> we're<00:06:05.110> going

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
models of power max and what we're going

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.530 
models of power max and what we're going
to<00:06:05.410> do<00:06:05.590> is<00:06:05.860> take<00:06:06.700> the<00:06:06.850> foreigner<00:06:07.180> megahertz

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
to do is take the foreigner megahertz

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.570 
to do is take the foreigner megahertz
model<00:06:07.870> and<00:06:07.990> keep<00:06:08.170> it<00:06:08.290> a<00:06:08.350> single<00:06:08.650> processor<00:06:09.190> but

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
model and keep it a single processor but

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.150 
model and keep it a single processor but
we've<00:06:09.760> now<00:06:10.000> made<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.600> 450<00:06:11.350> and<00:06:11.530> the<00:06:11.620> 500

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
we've now made the 450 and the 500

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.310 
we've now made the 450 and the 500
megahertz<00:06:12.400> models<00:06:12.970> dual<00:06:13.510> processors

standard built-in standard you can't
even<00:06:18.370> buy<00:06:18.640> them<00:06:18.880> with<00:06:19.000> one<00:06:19.180> processor<00:06:19.720> anymore

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
even buy them with one processor anymore

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.240 
even buy them with one processor anymore
and<00:06:21.570> these<00:06:22.570> are<00:06:22.630> incredible<00:06:23.260> machines<00:06:23.680> we've

and these are incredible machines we've

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.550 
and these are incredible machines we've
gone<00:06:24.460> even<00:06:24.730> further<00:06:24.760> we've<00:06:25.360> built<00:06:25.720> in<00:06:25.960> gigabit

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
gone even further we've built in gigabit

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.130 
gone even further we've built in gigabit
ethernet<00:06:26.710> on<00:06:27.280> the<00:06:27.460> motherboard<00:06:27.760> now<00:06:28.210> it<00:06:28.930> does

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
ethernet on the motherboard now it does

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.160 
ethernet on the motherboard now it does
not<00:06:29.290> even<00:06:29.560> take<00:06:29.830> a<00:06:29.860> slot<00:06:30.280> so<00:06:31.060> you<00:06:31.120> have<00:06:31.300> gigabit

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.170 
not even take a slot so you have gigabit

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.590 
not even take a slot so you have gigabit
ethernet<00:06:32.320> built<00:06:32.950> into<00:06:33.220> every<00:06:33.370> one<00:06:33.850> of<00:06:34.090> these

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
ethernet built into every one of these

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.440 
ethernet built into every one of these
three<00:06:34.810> powermac<00:06:35.380> models<00:06:36.180> we've<00:06:37.180> also

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
three powermac models we've also

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.870 
three powermac models we've also
increased<00:06:37.900> the<00:06:38.110> mass<00:06:38.350> storage<00:06:38.620> to<00:06:39.040> 20<00:06:39.430> 30<00:06:39.700> and

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
increased the mass storage to 20 30 and

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.810 
increased the mass storage to 20 30 and
40<00:06:40.270> gigabytes<00:06:40.860> we've<00:06:41.860> included<00:06:42.250> the<00:06:42.640> new

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
40 gigabytes we've included the new

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.230 
40 gigabytes we've included the new
optical<00:06:43.390> mouse<00:06:43.690> and<00:06:44.050> pro<00:06:44.350> keyboard<00:06:45.030> and<00:06:46.030> these

incredible<00:06:46.870> machines<00:06:47.230> with<00:06:47.410> all<00:06:47.560> of<00:06:47.680> this<00:06:47.830> are

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
incredible machines with all of this are

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:58.220 
incredible machines with all of this are
the<00:06:48.460> same<00:06:48.760> price<00:06:49.300> as<00:06:49.570> before<00:06:50.310> so
