00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello to all we find ourselves for a 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.740
 video a bit special I'm going to 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.550
 show a particular house in 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.260
 which things are happening 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.300
 abnormal 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.280
 so the people there are these 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.890
 ghosts of people who really came 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.449
 in this house before dying when 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.010
 you go there at night you hear and 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.160
 months and less than in English 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.990
 and a half and we do not know if it comes 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.720
 from the garden or if it comes from 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.550
 inside the house 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.439
 besides the ghost that we see on the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.559
 mountain between midnight and one o'clock 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.730
 morning they would have escaped said if 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.739
 you will see when you interfere 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.140
 with people they fall strangely to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.760
 earth as if their ghosts were going away 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.110
 and that remained more than the body without 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.480
 soul and lifeless and besides that they have 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.390
 all look scared but there are none 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.239
 who are trying to escape as if they are 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.160
 were jailed when you told them 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.620
 shoot it's the same it does not move 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.960
 as if they did not exist and you 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.430
 can make the comparison with 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.180
 people you find in the street you 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.170
 go see it's totally different 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.750
 so what happened in 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.970
 this house why there is no 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.299
 surrounding houses and why when we 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.689
 arrives on a wall in the middle of the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.140
 road 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.000
 there is the indication 1807 on the wall with 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.479
 an arrow heading towards this 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.250
 house as we know that 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.450
 some houses and some buildings 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.939
 which will open up and it is also who 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.659
 happened a big event here there is 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.560
 had a huge impact on the various 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.470
 secrets of de gta 5 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.579
 I'll let you listen to the excerpt from 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.040
 what is actually happening in this 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.030
 house the day a discussion between 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.950
 a man and a woman inside 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.890
 and if we can decipher what they 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.700
 say we'll already know a little bit more about 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.700
 the secret of the house 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.520
 there is yet another surprise that I 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.799
 did not put you in the video 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.110
 is that if you arrive with the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.720
 hearse may 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.490
 not the original hearse the one that has 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.350
 the coffin inside you you 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.470
 will see something going on 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.470
 weird
