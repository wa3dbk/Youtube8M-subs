00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
released it for the consoles I believe

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.770 
released it for the consoles I believe
that's<00:01:36.840> because<00:01:37.430> just<00:01:38.430> simply<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.210> much<00:01:39.450> going

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that's because just simply so much going

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.289 
that's because just simply so much going
on<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.140> snow<00:01:40.439> falling<00:01:41.040> snow<00:01:41.790> falling

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.480 
on you know snow falling snow falling
you<00:01:42.479> know<00:01:42.600> lights<00:01:42.899> everywhere<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:44.189> just

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
you know lights everywhere I I just

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.280 
you know lights everywhere I I just
don't<00:01:44.670> think<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.600> consoles<00:01:46.049> could

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
don't think that the consoles could

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.310 
don't think that the consoles could
handle<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.540> stuff<00:01:48.540> within<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.140> map

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
handle all that stuff within the map

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.819 
handle all that stuff within the map
without<00:01:49.560> lagging<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:51.110> that's<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:52.470> very

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
without lagging and that's that's very

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.760
