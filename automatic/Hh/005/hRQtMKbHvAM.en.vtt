00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
your address as well which I don't

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
your address as well which I don't
really<00:01:45.479> understand<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:45.899> they<00:01:45.990> need<00:01:46.020> your

really understand what they need your

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.370 
really understand what they need your

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
address but I guess since we determined

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.260 
address but I guess since we determined
that<00:01:49.409> shooting<00:01:50.040> someone<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.520> game<00:01:51.030> does<00:01:51.240> not

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
that shooting someone in game does not

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.620 
that shooting someone in game does not
automatically<00:01:52.110> kill<00:01:52.350> them<00:01:52.530> IRL<00:01:53.329> death<00:01:54.329> gun
