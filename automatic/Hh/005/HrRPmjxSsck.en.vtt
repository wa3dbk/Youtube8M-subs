00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.339
 hello and beat today we will see 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.719
 how to put a bath then laid 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.790
 a small bathtub in a small 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.790
 manon room which is well suited 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.480
 So the bath is here so it's 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.310
 one of the blacks at craywick says bathtub 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:27.670
 hoof since we can sit here 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:31.720
 first thing we go I started well 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:36.160
 laid down that's what it's like 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.110
 walk so his feet did come 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.230
 below and they are adjustable in height 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.690
 we aim thoroughly at the bottom threaded rod have 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.090
 do one thing and then we see that there 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.060
 there is a nut and screw and it will be possible 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.320
 more or less so the feet for the 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.840
 put at the right height the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.700
 position my tub and then I'm going 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.040
 put it two levels already to know 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.239
 how accurate she is going to go 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.340
 to then be able to set below 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.189
 temaru reinforcements have once she is 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.659
 level like this and like that I will 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.659
 drawn only between my wall 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.899
 this is the trait that will serve me 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.270
 So mark once I showed 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.100
 landmarks makes it the apron of the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.319
 bathtub they have to press on 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.899
 this part they have to come 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:34.110
 press here so I'm going to remove three 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.640
 and a half and that will give me the height to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.340
 which I will fix 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.840
 I have prepared the bar that will serve as 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.759
 support so the tub this side 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.920
 mulhouse so if you notice well 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.929
 so I trace my level and then 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.450
 especially I left a withdrawal that is 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.819
 recommended by the manufacturer of 5 cm 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.500
 this side of the tub and 8 cm of this 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.590
 next to the bath 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.500
 so that my bar will come as 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.500
 that but no it's so I'm going to scream 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.369
 so here we are good so the next 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.299
 step 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.660
 it's going to be preparing the city ​​age of 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.129
 sale and his side of the bathtub 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.840
 so I'm going to measure so the length 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.209
 waving wrap that is maybe from 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:28.079
 104 and the height so I'm going to add 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.790
 as earlier to rest me in 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.620
 I'm taking the measure 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.819
 here I add one and three centimeters 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.049
 and a half which gives me 51 cm for 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:41.130
 as much my panel that will slip in there 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:47.040
 below we put so I prepared my 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:49.669
 panels that goes here then whoever goes 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.669
 go here 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.250
 I'll have to take a picture 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.680
 angle to aim on here the same 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.739
 armor and the same there before 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.739
 finish to fix my apron my dress up 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.370
 to not be bored I'm going first 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.769
 laid down my escape bond and then 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.569
 in another video we'll see how 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.870
 ask faucets that are faucets 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:40.959
 mureaux then there i will install so 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:45.790
 first the overflow the siphon we have 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.530
 a 1st of June that there is what is going on 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.959
 place under the bathtub so the same 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.060
 principle it is removed of course the 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.510
 plastic protective groups 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.510
 poppy 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:14.830
 we will prepare evacuations so we have 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:20.790
 put our siphon just now we're going 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.790
 prepare thuaut in 42 outings and on 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.930
 the evacuation here so we'll put a 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.660
 hard blow that will help to recover 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.910
 our duo 40 out and I took my 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.919
 measures to find out how high and 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.070
 complements huillo so i'm going to put 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.229
 my elbow a pipe of 40 and then we 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.060
 surely hope siphon I'm going to cut 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.290
 my pipe then a little tip when 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.570
 we want complete right that we are in a 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.740
 position that is not great in three 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:54.010
 pieces of couple pipes and so we put 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.000
 on their doing and that helps guide 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.000
 when we will accompany 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.979
 to put a siphon that still has a 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.530
 certain height so when you set 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.180
 your feet high is careful of 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.889
 sails and set too good if not your 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.919
 if fo will hit by doing second 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.259
 siphon system thing deported and 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.960
 that we can turn the siphon as we 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:21.889
 wants it's extremely useful since 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:26.539
 in the other cola for example our 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:28.159
 exit being relatively close to the wall the 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.560
 being able to deported the siphon 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:35.319
 allows you to approach the bathtub 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.319
 maximum against account nos of speech 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.440
 So there it will allow me to identify the 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.650
 laser level to fix my bracket 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.650
 plate 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:04.020
 once we have fixed back there a 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:08.100
 other second support we will be able 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.270
 so high school to slip it under the 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.780
 bathtub as we saw earlier 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.390
 and then the next step will be 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.680
 to forget this facade has it there 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.190
 will see it will be dressed in the same 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.420
 matter that the floor lay the tile this 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.480
 so we'll see in another video 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:28.680
 is the tap then think well 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:31.440
 that you must black will be silicone all 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.330
 the turn so we do not now in 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.860
 silicone not now since there we go 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.340
 need to move the bathtub 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.980
 So the silicone age of the bathtub 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.030
 will really be at the last moment before the 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:47.940
 laying of tiles and that's what will fix 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:50.540
 skiing will be done and we talk about tightness 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.590
 and on the other hand that will stick the bathtub 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.570
 so what do I advise you too 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.040
 it is to make a trap of visit 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:00.140
 that is, you cut out a 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:03.000
 piece of 25 by 25 or 30 by 30 same 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.440
 which will allow you to visit your 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 siphon it's a problem on the 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.000
 bath that's important to do 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.460
 this well then you try it if you 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.460
 attempted
