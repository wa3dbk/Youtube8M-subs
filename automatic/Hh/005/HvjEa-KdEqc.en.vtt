00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello youtube friends 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.710
 I am Anna Bon and this time I 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.080
 I will teach how to apply the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.240
 conditioner if you drop a lot 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.670
 your hair or you have it badly damaged in 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.650
 three simple steps that you'll see how easy 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.359
 which is to take care of your hair but before you 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.949
 I'm going to talk a little bit about the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.930
 conditioners for hair the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.820
 first myth that many have about the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.890
 conditioner is that you pull your hair 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.869
 but the hair loss is not 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.690
 determined by the growth cycle 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.670
 of hair that is born grows and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.559
 finally it falls and the hair that is 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.540
 comes off of our scalp is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.550
 the one that has already completed this natural cycle of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 growth the conditioners do not 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.149
 cause hair loss at 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 otherwise they help to untangle what 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.410
 reducing breakage and damages 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.360
 caused by the hairstyle some of 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.370
 the things that a conditioner brings 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.949
 They are keeps the hair manageable 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.469
 Provides softness hydration shine 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.359
 and silkiness to the hair forms a layer in 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.340
 the surface of the hair fiber that 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.840
 Helps protect hair from damage 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.909
 caused by mechanical factors 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.740
 chemical and thermal network 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.509
 the freeze since it eliminates the burdens 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.729
 electric that are generated in the hair 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.859
 helps prevent fall due to 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.929
 break protect and prevent damage 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:18.439
 of the hair and help prevent 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.439
 split ends 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.549
 Now let's apply it after 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.649
 have applied and rinsed the shampoo 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.329
 we take some conditioner in the 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.250
 palm of the hand and we apply it 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.200
 means to ends in each of the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.030
 strands the causes of damaged hair 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.179
 It can be from the use of plates 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.649
 dryers dyes for health reasons 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:42.000
 hormonal imbalances and of course 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.000
 Sun rays and pollution 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.930
 Now what we have to do is leave 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.850
 act the conditioner for three or 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.830
 four minutes so we have better 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.260
 results and I remind you that it is very 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.680
 important not to apply it directly in 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.680
 the scalp 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.810
 and we come to the final step we are going to 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.700
 rinse with warm water as the water 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.860
 extremely hot can mistreat 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.100
