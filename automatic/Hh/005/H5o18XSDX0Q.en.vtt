00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.980
 corinthians 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.099
 do not waste time 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.989
 recently 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.979
 Besides that 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:13.999
 to 1 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.499
 we do not want it to be fulfilled 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.259
 lugo the eyes economy 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.259
 It's a shame, Paul, in a thicket. 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.619
 now you can try out the bids you've played on the track 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.700
 not good 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670
 You can not stay confined. 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.670
 we teach 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.130
 the clash will catch free entrance 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.520
 the moment 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520
 I was like this 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.090
 Meanwhile, what happened? 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.320
 operating with br 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.420
 who reads 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.680
 What happens is that I have 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.400
 at the end of normal time 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.310
 we are on the right path 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 the command 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 no scares 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.810
 it's from those 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.300
 right 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 while much of the plans the baraunas 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.060
 my way of leading 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.990
 the pottery 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.180
 the 30 years ago 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.860
 m 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 in chain analysis is nothing 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.560
 because 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.370
 leo miner 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.730
 O 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.610
 I'll try 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.610
 it's a case 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.339
 it's not him 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.339
 but think now the 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.949
 among Brazilians 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.689
 and allows you to increase 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.689
 in the last Sunday 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.339
 I took time to understand that he has 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.619
 well 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.379
 there he will have another half marquinho 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.169
 drama
