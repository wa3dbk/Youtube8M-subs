00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello how are you greeted by tuk sativa and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.779
 this we see now on the playstation 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.769
 vita which has already been launched 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.840
 update in 2.2 in which it goes to 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.599
 improve the stability of the playstation 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.220
 vita and some little things not so this 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.529
 is 100% confirmed by the people of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.439
 playstation so if you have your 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.050
 playstation vita it's time to update 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.779
 the option is good this download is 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.550
 optional but this download is optional 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.920
 but if it's going to improve stability 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.870
 because you do not have to make a small 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.520
 vital edition tail so you know 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.350
 update the view to 2.12 which is very 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.840
 cool another thing is also about 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.149
 playstation and sony sony if sony thinks and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.329
 do this playstation3 there in brazil 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.010
 put a plant and start 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.079
 manufacture playstation 3 is easy 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.079
 it was also confirmed that it would come from the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.079
 sofas and big banos 5 for those 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.199
 to receive getting in Portuguese like this 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.019
 that sony announced this of what he thinks 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.080
 make playstation3 perform manufacturing 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.710
 of ps3 there in Brazil for them 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.090
 give better technical support to the 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.000
 South American clients so this I think 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.520
 that has been very good news since 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.950
 if for example you buy a playstation 3 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.560
 not in peru in chile be or of 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.470
 suddenly this can give a chance that 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.960
 instead of sending the console to the US 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.580
 I know if in Mexico they will also be 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.560
 manufacturing consolat and 3 but for 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.780
 example I put there instead of sending 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.429
 US to another country better they kill Mexico 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.380
 Sorry to Brazil that is much more 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.970
 close and obviously there's that 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.360
 faster console not if you have your 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.640
 console 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.770
 I do not know if you have a guarantee if the copy 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.810
 original understand that is very good and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.940
 obviously also the costs go to 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.860
 go down so if a play 3 was a 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.780
 bit expensive because he had to bring her 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.960
 of the USA and others 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.750
 now it's going to be in brazil 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.540
 if you want clear is something very good like that 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.880
 what gentlemen already know are and thinking about 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.100
 the South American consumers so 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.260
 I said goodbye agent was ducsa live 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.670
 favorite comments and obviously we 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.250
 we will see the next video that is a very 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.180
 good idea the truth I say yes a 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.180
 hug people and we'll see each other
