you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.789> see<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.450> cue<00:02:09.660> ball<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.929> back<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
you can see the cue ball is back in the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.759 
you can see the cue ball is back in the
same<00:02:10.619> position<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.870> pink<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.380> its<00:02:13.500> spot

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
same position the pink is on its spot

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.890 
same position the pink is on its spot
both<00:02:14.640> balls<00:02:14.970> are<00:02:15.150> exactly<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.510> same<00:02:15.540> to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
both balls are exactly the same to

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.509 
both balls are exactly the same to
standard<00:02:16.260> set<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.470> balls<00:02:16.769> so<00:02:17.220> there's<00:02:17.400> no

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
standard set of balls so there's no

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.910 
standard set of balls so there's no
small<00:02:17.819> or<00:02:18.090> large<00:02:18.390> cue<00:02:18.720> ball<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.830> this

small or large cue ball and in this

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.330 
small or large cue ball and in this

something in this region the cue ball

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.330 
something in this region the cue ball
finishes<00:02:36.780> roughly<00:02:37.380> in<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.530> area<00:02:37.739> comes<00:02:38.190> up

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
finishes roughly in this area comes up

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.850 
finishes roughly in this area comes up
the<00:02:38.430> cushion<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> little<00:02:39.000> bit<00:02:39.180> more<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.590> as<00:02:40.709> he

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
the cushion a little bit more and as he

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.240 
the cushion a little bit more and as he
says<00:02:41.190> there<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.030> are<00:02:42.209> check<00:02:42.660> side<00:02:42.959> half<00:02:43.890> ball

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
says there you are check side half ball

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.300 
says there you are check side half ball
black<00:02:44.690> as<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.930> see<00:02:46.200> there<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.380> played<00:02:46.830> one<00:02:47.100> ball

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
black as you see there I played one ball

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:55.990 
black as you see there I played one ball
the<00:02:49.010> final<00:02:50.010> shot<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.850> absolutely<00:02:51.420> check<00:02:51.660> side

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.130 

now<00:02:57.000> because<00:02:57.329> there<00:02:57.450> are<00:02:57.540> two<00:02:57.690> sides<00:02:57.930> to

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
now because there are two sides to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.940 
now because there are two sides to
keyboard<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.930> get<00:03:01.049> two<00:03:01.200> effects<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.680> is

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
keyboard you get two effects one is

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.390 
keyboard you get two effects one is
running<00:03:02.250> one<00:03:02.579> is<00:03:02.700> check<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.900> now<00:03:04.140> check<00:03:04.470> side

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
running one is check so now check side

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.180 
running one is check so now check side
and<00:03:05.959> check<00:03:06.959> side<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.500> quite<00:03:07.739> simple<00:03:08.130> to

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
and check side is quite simple to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.250 
and check side is quite simple to
explain<00:03:08.609> and<00:03:08.910> you'll<00:03:09.540> see<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.810> for<00:03:09.840> yourself

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
explain and you'll see it for yourself

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.520 
explain and you'll see it for yourself
in<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.470> video<00:03:11.480> it's<00:03:12.480> two<00:03:12.690> o'clock<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.230> cue

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
in the video it's two o'clock on the cue

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.340 
in the video it's two o'clock on the cue
ball<00:03:13.560> which<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.609> the<00:03:14.790> opposite<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.269> 10<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:16.320> now

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
ball which is the opposite of 10 so now

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.460 
ball which is the opposite of 10 so now
when<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.769> cue<00:03:16.980> ball<00:03:17.190> hits<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.549> side<00:03:17.880> cushion

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
when the cue ball hits the side cushion

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.069 
when the cue ball hits the side cushion
let's<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:19.650> if<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.859> chaps<00:03:20.220> up<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.579> rail<00:03:21.079> and

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
let's see if you chaps up the rail and

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.440 
let's see if you chaps up the rail and
come<00:03:22.260> straight<00:03:22.590> up<00:03:22.769> across<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:24.150> as<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.359> can

come straight up across and as you can

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.729 
come straight up across and as you can
see<00:03:24.660> now<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:25.560> comes<00:03:25.920> back<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.700> other<00:03:26.730> way<00:03:27.030> and

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
see now it comes back the other way and

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.740 
see now it comes back the other way and
as<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.859> see<00:03:29.010> as<00:03:29.609> you<00:03:29.670> get<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.120> low<00:03:30.239> on<00:03:30.420> on

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
now as I also stated on this clip the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.250 
now as I also stated on this clip the
correct<00:03:38.880> way<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.060> play<00:03:39.329> this<00:03:39.569> shot<00:03:39.780> because

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
correct way to play this shot because

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
side increases the difficulty about shot

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.710 
side increases the difficulty about shot
it's<00:03:43.470> not<00:03:43.739> an<00:03:43.859> easy<00:03:44.069> shot<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.549> play<00:03:44.790> he<00:03:45.450> says

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
it's not an easy shot to play he says

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.729 
it's not an easy shot to play he says
it's<00:03:45.870> quite<00:03:46.019> easy<00:03:46.319> I<00:03:46.769> can<00:03:47.370> tell<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:48.000> isn't
