00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.459 
it's dark outside so it's insanely
bright<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.659> obnoxious<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
bright and really really obnoxious and

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.260 
bright and really really obnoxious and
the<00:02:01.770> only<00:02:01.890> way<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> turn<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.670> off<00:02:03.030> would<00:02:03.240> be

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the only way to turn that off would be

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
the only way to turn that off would be
to<00:02:03.450> open<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.869> up<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.170> pull<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.680> led<00:02:05.070> out<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.340> it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
to open it up and pull the led out of it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.429 
to open it up and pull the led out of it
which<00:02:05.549> I'm<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:05.850> going<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> what<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.350> do

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
which I'm not going to do so what I do

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.369 
which I'm not going to do so what I do
is<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.710> take<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.390> my<00:02:09.390> headphones<00:02:09.810> case<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.349> I

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
is I take this my headphones case and I

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.630 
is I take this my headphones case and I
stick<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.679> over<00:02:10.800> there<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:11.310> really

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
stick it over there but that's really

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.600 
stick it over there but that's really
obnoxious

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
obnoxious

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.070 
obnoxious
if<00:02:12.760> it's<00:02:12.910> with<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.090> desktop<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:13.870> behind

if it's with the desktop and it's behind
the<00:02:14.260> computer<00:02:14.680> it's<00:02:14.830> probably<00:02:15.220> going<00:02:15.430> to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
the computer it's probably going to

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.050 
the computer it's probably going to
light<00:02:15.670> up<00:02:15.700> your<00:02:16.000> whole<00:02:16.240> room<00:02:16.630> bright<00:02:17.290> blue<00:02:18.060> but

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
light up your whole room bright blue but

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.460 
light up your whole room bright blue but
that's<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.390> only<00:02:19.630> thing<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.050> do<00:02:20.110> not<00:02:20.260> like

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
that's the only thing that I do not like

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.470 
that's the only thing that I do not like
about<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.490> keyboard<00:02:21.910> is<00:02:22.150> really

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
about that the keyboard is really

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.580 
about that the keyboard is really
comfortable<00:02:22.780> there's<00:02:23.200> not<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.380> lot<00:02:23.560> of

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
comfortable there's not a lot of

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.770 
comfortable there's not a lot of
feedback<00:02:23.860> with<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> buttons<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.660> my

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
feedback with the buttons this is my

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.950 
feedback with the buttons this is my
thinkpad<00:02:26.230> obviously<00:02:26.650> but<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:28.120> feels<00:02:28.630> really

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
thinkpad obviously but it feels really

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.130 
thinkpad obviously but it feels really
good<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.230> type<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:29.710> its<00:02:30.010> mean<00:02:30.880> it's<00:02:31.030> quiet<00:02:31.360> it's
