00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.470
 the handling of food in the home 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.870
 It is very important to prevent 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.760
 health problems although in summer 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.890
 we have to conserve food 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.050
 so they do not lose the cold chain 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.179
 there are many cares to be had in 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.230
 account all the care actually of 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.270
 the foods that we have to have 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.160
 throughout the year that is the chain 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.570
 of cold be careful the chain 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640
 cold when we go to buy a 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.600
 supermarket that we are going to buy 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.580
 first those are the first foods 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.070
 that are not perishable we leave them for 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.320
 the last moment but there between the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.020
 supermarket travel and waiting 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.210
 in the queue time goes by and it's good 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.430
 time out there the food is more 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.360
 exposed let's say at a temperature that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.440
 is not appropiate 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.770
 we are talking about food 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.800
 perishable and milk meat food 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.500
 fresh the days of the year the washing of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.469
 fruits and vegetables should always be done 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.960
 with water and should be avoided 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.420
 cross contamination with meat ni 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.329
 that suits me no time of year 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.860
 obviously washing with drinking water 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.100
 this from the vegetable that out there people 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.350
 I usually put it out there in pans or 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.990
 with vinegar and others are not others the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 vinegar but previously always the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.759
 washed sheet by sheet and with clean water 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.310
 and in a place or a base where it is 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.710
 in conditions where it has not been washed or 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.320
 remains of the best of 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.780
 some meat or some meat juice 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.680
 because in this case you can also 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.500
 produce what is called the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.750
 cross contamination when a food 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.240
 it thaws you can not go back to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.640
 Freeze must also be taken into account 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.190
 the hand washing when we manipulate 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.810
 food that is the fundamentals in the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.880
 hygiene that should also be in 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.509
 our hands because in the washing of 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.080
 correct hands is the best vaccine that 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.310
 exists and this is fundamental the washing 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.280
 hands every time it is 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.159
 necessary later also between a 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.350
 elaboration and another between when we are 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.110
 and while working in the food 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.800
 raw and we go to the cooked ones that already 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.080
 they are direct to consumption also the washing 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.200
 good as many times as necessary 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.760
 our hygiene is fundamental and in 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.760
 each processing process
