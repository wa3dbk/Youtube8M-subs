 and we have it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.899
 alluded at gamescom 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.090
 this time you fight in the role of 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.070
 Former Assassin shape patrick tree 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.700
 corner for the first time for the side of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.350
 Templar 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 the action is during the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.250
 settled and seven years of war 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.289
 guide you through north america river 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.390
 valley and the north Atlantic 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.670
 she also fits in between the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.239
 events from Assassin's creed 3 and 4 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.730
 1 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.280
 that, of course, means that and 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.930
 one or the other old known as eg 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.949
 can help way on our journey 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.770
 will accompany 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.449
 as already in part three and four become 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.850
 spend some time in the game on ships 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.689
 Spend some time here too 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.549
 innovations 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.799
 for example, you have one 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.930
 Variety of new cannons available 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.060
 You can also do the water surface 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.799
 cover with burning oil and use it 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.680
 to fuel your enemies 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.810
 the icy new setting can be without the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.820
 Proper equipment becomes a problem 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.130
 thick layers of ice must be broken 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.259
 and icebergs are cleared out of the way 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.210
 The weather can also be sudden 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.159
 snowstorms and tornadoes surprise 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.299
 So you should make sure that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.420
 Ship always for all situations 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.820
 is prepared for your new animal 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.070
 Meetings include, among others, normal 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.229
 polar bears and cute little giants 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.530
 old the latter probably hardly one 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.090
 pose danger to you 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.090
 land, among other things, we defend ourselves 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.159
 with the help of grenade launchers and poison gas 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.990
 but please do not use the gas mask 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.840
 forget that too is one of the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.399
 new features in the game 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.899
 But we all know how difficult 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.390
 the templars fight against them 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.009
 Assassins have what does it mean then 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.009
 this time on the other side too 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.050
 are located 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.060
 When we started the US interest rates as a side 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.910
 to look at we open up under him 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.370
 new enemy types of the assassins captain 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.440
 for example, it is a very tough boulder 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.569
 all his skills are at the maximum 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.700
 driven he moves around freely and 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.709
 shoot on sight also in crowds 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.900
 down and is super strong lay anita 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.489
 ideally you should get them this 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.989
 strong rain so better turn off 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.000
 before they discover themselves 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.440
 it should nevertheless come to a fight 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.390
 then you have to have something on it 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.250
 to defeat him 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.230
 Everyone's an Assassin's creed adventure 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.030
 not enough in the year or even 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.580
 no nextgen console is his own 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.890
 also gets this with ssd speedrock 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.810
 year the full program from 11 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.450
 november is the big assassin hunt 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.450
