00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.200 
able to speak to people now I there is a
huge<00:01:55.530> xoxx<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:56.969> would<00:01:57.119> imagine

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
huge xoxx going on but I would imagine

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.399 
huge xoxx going on but I would imagine
they<00:01:57.630> were<00:01:57.689> going<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> patch<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.350> up

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
they were going to patch that up

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.459 
they were going to patch that up
eventually<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.780> that<00:02:00.780> has<00:02:00.899> nothing<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.290> do

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
eventually but that has nothing to do

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.620 
eventually but that has nothing to do
with<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> headset<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.369> let's<00:02:03.270> totally

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
with the headset but let's totally

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.240 
with the headset but let's totally
positive<00:02:03.840> things<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.680> find<00:02:04.860> about<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
positive things that I can find about it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.789 
positive things that I can find about it
man<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.210> guess<00:02:06.390> let<00:02:07.259> me<00:02:07.290> go<00:02:07.439> ahead<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.590> jump

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
man and I guess let me go ahead and jump

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.479 
man and I guess let me go ahead and jump
into<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:10.110> negative<00:02:10.470> part<00:02:10.649> since

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
into this up the negative part since

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.589 
into this up the negative part since
it's<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.879> be<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> little<00:02:12.120> bit<00:02:12.239> lengthy

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
it's going to be a little bit lengthy

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.460 
it's going to be a little bit lengthy
let<00:02:12.750> me<00:02:12.840> enjoy

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
let me enjoy

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.170 
let me enjoy
one<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.070> main<00:02:14.220> reasons<00:02:14.520> why<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:15.030> it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
one of the main reasons why this like it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.650 
one of the main reasons why this like it
is<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.900> length<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.980> cord<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.940> cord<00:02:18.240> like

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
is the length of the cord the cord like

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.290 
is the length of the cord the cord like
I<00:02:18.750> said<00:02:18.990> in<00:02:19.170> my<00:02:19.200> unboxing<00:02:20.160> video<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.850> roughly

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
I said in my unboxing video is roughly

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.230 
I said in my unboxing video is roughly
right<00:02:21.450> around<00:02:21.630> three<00:02:21.930> feet<00:02:22.170> long<00:02:22.200> at<00:02:22.620> best<00:02:23.240> you

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
right around three feet long at best you

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.450 
right around three feet long at best you
have<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.420> plug<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.780> into<00:02:25.050> your<00:02:25.320> gamepad<00:02:25.830> so

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
have to plug that into your gamepad so

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.400 
have to plug that into your gamepad so
that<00:02:26.820> means<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.480> keep<00:02:27.750> your<00:02:27.900> gamepad

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
that means you have to keep your gamepad

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.610 
that means you have to keep your gamepad
relatively<00:02:29.310> close<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.300> now<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> understand

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
relatively close to you now I understand

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.980 
relatively close to you now I understand
when<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.980> do<00:02:32.160> gameplays<00:02:32.970> like<00:02:33.240> on<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> xbox

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
don't know maybe they have those maybe

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.790 
don't know maybe they have those maybe
it<00:04:31.180> oh<00:04:31.300> maybe<00:04:31.510> I'm<00:04:31.690> just<00:04:31.810> wishful<00:04:32.260> thinking

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
it oh maybe I'm just wishful thinking

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.730 
it oh maybe I'm just wishful thinking
right<00:04:32.950> now<00:04:32.980> i<00:04:33.130> don't<00:04:33.280> but<00:04:34.060> i<00:04:34.470> guess<00:04:35.470> those<00:04:35.680> are

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
right now i don't but i guess those are

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.770 
right now i don't but i guess those are
the<00:04:35.920> main<00:04:36.100> reasons<00:04:36.310> why<00:04:36.670> truly<00:04:37.300> dislike<00:04:37.510> the

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
the main reasons why truly dislike the

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.780 
the main reasons why truly dislike the
headset<00:04:38.080> so<00:04:38.260> i<00:04:38.470> guess<00:04:38.920> ultimately<00:04:39.160> if<00:04:39.550> i<00:04:39.640> have

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
headset so i guess ultimately if i have

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.030 
headset so i guess ultimately if i have
to<00:04:40.000> give<00:04:40.420> a<00:04:40.630> thumbs<00:04:40.990> up<00:04:41.170> or<00:04:41.320> thumbs<00:04:41.350> down<00:04:41.590> i

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
to give a thumbs up or thumbs down i

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.410 
to give a thumbs up or thumbs down i
would<00:04:42.340> definitely<00:04:42.580> give<00:04:42.790> two<00:04:42.970> thumbs<00:04:43.000> down

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
would definitely give two thumbs down

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.780 
would definitely give two thumbs down
there<00:04:43.770> just<00:04:44.770> not<00:04:44.950> a<00:04:44.980> fan<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.490> even<00:04:45.610> the

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
there just not a fan of it even the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.160 
there just not a fan of it even the
people<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.180> i've<00:04:46.270> spoken<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:46.960> i<00:04:47.020> have

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
people and i've spoken to that i have

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.470
