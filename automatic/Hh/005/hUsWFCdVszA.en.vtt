between Class A and a Class C in the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.819 
between Class A and a Class C in the
same<00:00:39.120> length<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.570> Class<00:00:39.809> C<00:00:39.840> as<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.649> see

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
same length of Class C as you can see

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.049

the driver's seat is back behind the the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.240 
the driver's seat is back behind the the
wheels<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.750> you're<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.320> give<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.950> four

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
wheels so you're you give up like four

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.569 
wheels so you're you give up like four
feet<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.550> room<00:00:47.940> whereas<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> Class<00:00:49.379> A<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
feet of room whereas on a Class A the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.029 
feet of room whereas on a Class A the
driver's<00:00:51.030> seat<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.480> over<00:00:52.350> top<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.800> wheels

driver's seat is over top of the wheels

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.869 
driver's seat is over top of the wheels
so<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.670> 29<00:00:54.570> foot<00:00:54.840> Class<00:00:55.140> A<00:00:55.469> has<00:00:55.879> considerably

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
so a 29 foot Class A has considerably

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.680 
so a 29 foot Class A has considerably
more<00:00:57.210> room<00:00:57.629> than<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.620> Class<00:00:59.010> C

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
