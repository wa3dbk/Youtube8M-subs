apples down people think that the press
squeezes<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.889> Apple<00:01:19.219> until<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.819> juice<00:01:19.969> comes

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:20.209

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:22.120 
squeezes the Apple until the juice comes
out<00:01:20.389> and<00:01:20.509> that's<00:01:20.719> not<00:01:20.899> true<00:01:21.229> we<00:01:21.619> have<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:21.829> crush

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130

out and that's not true we have to crush
them<00:01:22.280> make<00:01:22.520> them<00:01:22.639> into<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:22.880> pulp<00:01:23.149> and<00:01:23.389> they're

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
them make them into a pulp and they're

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.120 
them make them into a pulp and they're
going<00:01:24.049> to<00:01:24.139> go<00:01:24.289> into<00:01:24.439> this<00:01:25.399> bag<00:01:26.829> which<00:01:27.829> has<00:01:27.979> got

going to go into this bag which has got

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.949 
going to go into this bag which has got
holes<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.429> it<00:01:28.549> allows<00:01:28.819> the<00:01:29.209> that<00:01:29.509> used<00:01:29.719> to<00:01:29.810> come

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
holes in it allows the that used to come

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.989 
holes in it allows the that used to come
out<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:30.229> keep<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.560> pulp<00:01:30.770> behind<00:01:31.249> so<00:01:31.819> let's

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:31.999 
out and keep the pulp behind so let's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:35.199 
out and keep the pulp behind so let's
start<00:01:32.270> crushing<00:01:33.549> we've<00:01:34.549> cut<00:01:34.729> these<00:01:34.880> apples

start crushing we've cut these apples
into<00:01:35.359> quarters<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.229> that<00:01:36.679> we<00:01:36.920> can<00:01:37.069> get<00:01:37.279> them

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
into quarters so that we can get them

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.940 
into quarters so that we can get them
