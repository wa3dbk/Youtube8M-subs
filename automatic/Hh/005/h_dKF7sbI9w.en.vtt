00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
character is like the pair because on

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
character is like the pair because on
this<00:00:41.250> pair<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.550> shoes<00:00:41.940> i<00:00:42.239> did<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.809> same

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
this pair of shoes i did the same

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.830 
this pair of shoes i did the same
background<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.280> each<00:00:44.399> character<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:45.270> that

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
background for each character if that

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.400 
background for each character if that
makes<00:00:46.050> sense<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.680> we'll<00:00:47.100> start<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.820> Finn

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
makes sense so we'll start out with Finn

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.180 
makes sense so we'll start out with Finn
so<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.770> Finn<00:00:50.039> looks<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.570> Finn<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.079> did<00:00:52.530> kind<00:00:53.070> of

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
so for Finn looks for Finn I did kind of

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.130 
so for Finn looks for Finn I did kind of
a<00:00:53.340> grassy<00:00:53.879> background<00:00:54.539> i'm<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:54.989> loving

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
because it would start to just look a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.940 
because it would start to just look a
little<00:01:26.130> bit<00:01:26.310> blurry<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:27.619> same<00:01:28.619> thing<00:01:28.829> with

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
little bit blurry but same thing with

her<00:01:29.070> some<00:01:29.340> different<00:01:29.460> facial<00:01:29.759> expressions

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
her some different facial expressions

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.740

although<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.900> one<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.110> added<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.650> cake<00:01:32.280> I

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
although on this one I added in cake I

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.319 
although on this one I added in cake I
think<00:01:33.750> cake<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.200> such<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> cutie<00:01:34.829> pie<00:01:35.329> so

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
think cake is such a cutie pie so

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.800 
think cake is such a cutie pie so

Bubblegum for her i did a blue
background<00:01:43.350> normally<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.070> would<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> darker

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

background normally I would do a darker
pink<00:01:45.060> background<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:45.750> since<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.259> a

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
pink background but since this was a

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.139 
pink background but since this was a
boy's<00:01:46.530> pair<00:01:46.920> i<00:01:46.950> tried<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.399> use<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:47.790> colors

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that were a little less girly so I did a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.300 
that were a little less girly so I did a
blue<00:01:52.110> backgrounds<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.920> pink<00:01:53.130> background

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
blue backgrounds and a pink background

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.090 
blue backgrounds and a pink background
and<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.960> Marshall<00:01:55.350> Lee<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.590> Marceline<00:01:56.070> I

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
and on the Marshall Lee and Marceline I

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.760 
and on the Marshall Lee and Marceline I
used<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.640> red<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.750> purple<00:01:57.930> instead<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.530> pink

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
used a red and purple instead of pink

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.359 
used a red and purple instead of pink
and<00:01:58.950> purple<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.729> usually<00:02:00.180> would<00:02:01.369> so

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
