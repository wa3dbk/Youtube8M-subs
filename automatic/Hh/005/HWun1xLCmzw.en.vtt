00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
guess our personal opinion but i will

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.619 
guess our personal opinion but i will
dive<00:00:59.190> more<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.550> into<00:00:59.760> segments<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.390> kind

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
dive more to this into segments all kind

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.869 
dive more to this into segments all kind
of<00:01:00.719> sparse<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> little<00:01:01.530> basic<00:01:01.789> and<00:01:02.789> that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
of sparse and a little basic and that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.630 
of sparse and a little basic and that
does<00:01:03.030> not<00:01:03.059> sort<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.400> give<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> good

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
does not sort of give you a good

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.060 
does not sort of give you a good
indication<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.180> how<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.450> gameplay<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.920> be

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
indication of how the gameplay is to be

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.840 
indication of how the gameplay is to be
honest<00:01:08.479> because<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:10.350> quite<00:01:10.590> fun<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.430> what

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
honest because it's quite fun about what

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.160 
honest because it's quite fun about what
we<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.570> perhaps<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.080> best

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
we have here is perhaps not the best

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.380 
we have here is perhaps not the best
package<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> let's<00:01:15.000> check<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.240> inventory

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
package for it let's check my inventory

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.990 
package for it let's check my inventory
and<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:15.960> i<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.200> anything<00:01:16.470> i<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:17.400> not

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.910 

anyway<00:01:21.000> let<00:01:21.689> us<00:01:21.720> dive<00:01:22.320> straight<00:01:22.590> into<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
anyway let us dive straight into the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.679 
anyway let us dive straight into the
gameplay<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.759> then<00:01:24.210> all<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.630> will

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
gameplay then and then all of this will

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.080 
gameplay then and then all of this will
make<00:01:24.900> more<00:01:25.110> sense<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.799> second<00:01:26.130> alright

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
make more sense in just a second alright

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.789 
make more sense in just a second alright
let's<00:01:27.420> continue<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.990> game<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
let's continue the game and I do have a

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.370 
let's continue the game and I do have a
checkpoint<00:01:29.340> saved<00:01:29.729> i<00:01:30.030> believe<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.020> here's<00:01:31.229> how

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
checkpoint saved i believe so here's how

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.929 
checkpoint saved i believe so here's how
it<00:01:31.530> works<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.070> go<00:01:32.189> along<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.729> i<00:01:32.790> will<00:01:32.909> be

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it works as you go along and i will be

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.730 
it works as you go along and i will be
very<00:01:33.210> terrible<00:01:33.689> at<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.590> little

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
very terrible at this for just a little

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.080 
very terrible at this for just a little
while<00:01:37.159> in<00:01:38.159> fact<00:01:38.340> i'm<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.790> terrible

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
while in fact i'm going to be terrible

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.219 
while in fact i'm going to be terrible
at<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.720> quite<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:40.049> while<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
at this for quite a while so it's a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.260 
at this for quite a while so it's a
typing<00:01:43.560> game<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.070> did<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.880> learn<00:01:45.030> to

down<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.729> those<00:01:53.850> kind<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
down and you know one of those kind of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.010 
down and you know one of those kind of
classic<00:01:54.509> ways<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.040> your<00:01:56.040> mission<00:01:56.700> here<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
classic ways and your mission here is to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.560 
classic ways and your mission here is to
type<00:01:58.409> them<00:01:58.590> out<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.920> they<00:01:59.100> fall<00:01:59.399> as<00:01:59.640> quickly<00:02:00.329> as

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
type them out as they fall as quickly as

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.270 
type them out as they fall as quickly as
possible<00:02:01.079> likewise<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.890> don't<00:02:02.040> want<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> make

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
possible likewise you don't want to make

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
possible likewise you don't want to make
any<00:02:02.460> mistakes<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.060> i<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.210> did<00:02:03.479> quite<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.960> bit

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
any mistakes like i just did quite a bit

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.260 
any mistakes like i just did quite a bit
I<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.950> pop<00:02:05.159> up<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.520> advertisement<00:02:06.000> in

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
I just pop up this advertisement in

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.760 
I just pop up this advertisement in
between<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:08.700> my<00:02:09.619> obviously<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
between so that was my obviously the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.680 
between so that was my obviously the
fewer<00:02:11.400> mistakes<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.819> make<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.150> higher<00:02:12.450> your

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
fewer mistakes you make the higher your

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.790 
fewer mistakes you make the higher your
bonuses<00:02:13.260> are

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
bonuses are

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.440 
bonuses are
which<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.010> desirable<00:02:14.820> because<00:02:15.000> then<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.420> have

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
which is desirable because then you have

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.320 
which is desirable because then you have
a<00:02:15.660> much<00:02:15.930> higher<00:02:16.110> score<00:02:16.730> along<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> way<00:02:17.970> we<00:02:18.120> do

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
a much higher score along the way we do

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.110 
a much higher score along the way we do
have<00:02:18.540> these<00:02:18.810> sort<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.200> chains<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:20.490> do<00:02:20.670> pop<00:02:20.880> up

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
have these sort of chains that do pop up

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.820 
have these sort of chains that do pop up
as<00:02:21.360> well<00:02:21.540> as<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.690> couple<00:02:21.840> other<00:02:22.050> variations<00:02:22.620> on

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
as well as a couple other variations on

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.040 
as well as a couple other variations on
the<00:02:22.980> concept<00:02:23.460> every<00:02:24.150> letter<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.690> i<00:02:24.840> missed

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
the concept every letter that i missed

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.630 
the concept every letter that i missed
us<00:02:25.260> hit<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.530> bottom<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.130> then<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.340> am

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
us hit the bottom and then I am

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.760 
us hit the bottom and then I am
penalized<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.320> I'm<00:02:28.410> trying<00:02:28.440> to

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
penalized for that so I'm trying to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.350 
penalized for that so I'm trying to
avoid<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.010> not<00:02:29.730> doing<00:02:29.910> for<00:02:30.060> well<00:02:30.210> because

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
avoid that not doing for well because

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.240 
avoid that not doing for well because
I'm<00:02:30.420> trying<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.660> concentrate<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:31.410> two<00:02:32.010> things

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
I'm trying to concentrate on two things

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.500 
I'm trying to concentrate on two things
at<00:02:32.370> once<00:02:32.520> shooting<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> video<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.300> and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
at once shooting a video of you and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.470 
at once shooting a video of you and
doing<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.040> anyway<00:02:35.040> there<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.430> go<00:02:35.520> along<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
doing this anyway there you go along the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.760 
doing this anyway there you go along the
way<00:02:36.570> you'll<00:02:36.720> get<00:02:36.870> various<00:02:37.230> power-ups<00:02:37.560> that

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
way you'll get various power-ups that

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.530 
way you'll get various power-ups that
you<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:38.070> purchase<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:39.090> will<00:02:39.210> do<00:02:39.330> things

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
you can purchase that will do things

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.480 
you can purchase that will do things
like<00:02:39.690> destroy<00:02:40.320> all<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.650> them<00:02:40.800> slow<00:02:41.070> down<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
like destroy all of them slow down the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.410 
like destroy all of them slow down the
progress<00:02:41.730> etc<00:02:42.180> all<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:45.260> there<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.470> go

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
progress etc all of that there you go

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.110 
progress etc all of that there you go
and<00:02:48.440> interestingly<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.890> course<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.850> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
and interestingly of course the the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.030 
and interestingly of course the the
concept<00:02:51.570> at<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.900> core<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.170> all<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.830> it's

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
concept at the core of all this is it's

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.330 
concept at the core of all this is it's
trying<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.430> teach<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:55.230> better<00:02:55.560> type<00:02:56.040> on

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
trying to teach you to better type on

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.840 
trying to teach you to better type on
your<00:02:56.940> iPhone<00:02:57.360> um<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:59.010> I'm<00:02:59.100> blocking<00:02:59.700> out<00:02:59.820> a

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
your iPhone um so I'm blocking out a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.480 
your iPhone um so I'm blocking out a
text<00:03:00.210> message<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.600> receive<00:03:01.250> just<00:03:02.250> in<00:03:02.370> case

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
text message I just receive just in case

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.790 
text message I just receive just in case
anyway<00:03:04.490> as<00:03:05.490> mentioned<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.060> idea<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.510> to

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
anyway as mentioned the idea is to

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.710 
anyway as mentioned the idea is to
improve<00:03:07.800> your<00:03:07.980> typing<00:03:08.370> speed<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:09.420> fact

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
improve your typing speed and in fact

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.240 
improve your typing speed and in fact

about 85 or 86 percent which if you
think<00:03:43.200> about<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.530> for<00:03:43.739> this<00:03:43.830> tiny<00:03:44.010> little

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
think about it for this tiny little

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.910 
think about it for this tiny little
keyboard<00:03:44.520> is<00:03:45.330> pretty<00:03:45.690> great<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.739> course

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
keyboard is pretty great so of course

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.460 
keyboard is pretty great so of course
you<00:03:47.130> do<00:03:47.250> get<00:03:47.459> streaks<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.660> streaks<00:03:49.050> are<00:03:49.200> good

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
you do get streaks and streaks are good

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.190 
you do get streaks and streaks are good
here<00:03:49.940> anyway<00:03:50.940> that's<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.450> basic<00:03:51.810> concept

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
here anyway that's the basic concept

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.050 
here anyway that's the basic concept
behind<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.709> do<00:03:52.860> get<00:03:53.040> leaderboards<00:03:53.790> and

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
behind this you do get leaderboards and

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.030 
behind this you do get leaderboards and
you<00:03:54.540> can<00:03:54.660> change<00:03:54.810> commanders<00:03:55.410> commanders<00:03:55.860> are

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
you can change commanders commanders are

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.870 
you can change commanders commanders are
the<00:03:56.190> names<00:03:56.720> attached<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.440> game<00:03:58.620> itself<00:03:58.980> as

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
the names attached to the game itself as

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.580 
the names attached to the game itself as
you<00:04:00.060> can<00:04:00.180> see<00:04:00.390> again<00:04:00.840> not<00:04:01.380> our<00:04:01.620> favorite<00:04:03.590> not

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
you can see again not our favorite not

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.250 
you can see again not our favorite not
are<00:04:04.860> not<00:04:05.040> our<00:04:05.160> favorite<00:04:05.520> design<00:04:06.110> but<00:04:07.110> then

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
are not our favorite design but then

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.949 
are not our favorite design but then
again<00:04:07.410> that's<00:04:07.620> not<00:04:08.190> necessarily<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:09.360> bad<00:04:09.900> thing

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
again that's not necessarily a bad thing

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.530 
again that's not necessarily a bad thing

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
complaining too much and the game is
