 frankfurt and that's what it's about today 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.779
 they will definitely be 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.580
 have often asked how the jump 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.230
 traffic light yes, if we experience the city ​​of rome 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.269
 wants to be green at the moment 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.160
 on red and why then around the corner 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.700
 the moment exactly parallel from red on 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.530
 green 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.480

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.890
 blackboard on the outskirts of the city to the twelve

 minutes to downtown needs yes 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.000
 How does the blackboard of the or 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.899
 just just the meat of the question 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.309
 how do we want to clarify 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.989
 that 's why we are here in the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.360
 frankfurter traffic control center and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.030
 Next to me, the schettler is next to me 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.010
 The Schettler welcomes you 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.489
 Thank you very much for being here 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.100
 allowed 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.480
 But I have my question with your monitor 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.270
 i have more like it is elsewhere 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.600
 there's something broken office customer the right 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.600
 traffic 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.049
 technology impressed 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.460
 the lot would be nothing because of the up 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.780
 Today the bell has to press you 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.619
 he picked me up in the morning and that 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.570
 after all these years 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.420
 not to mention that we only have one 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.399
 ring but it is yes that is full 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.350
 spaceship enterprise knife chamber in 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.670
 principle hair they are actually so what 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.670
 like the captain kirk from frankfurt 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.049
 we can watch the traffic 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.500
 Behavior roads in frankfurt nothing 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.300
 touch and have 80 TV cameras in 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.560
 the city is the traffic constantly 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.720
 watch and we'll see if it's one 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.069
 problem is straw or accident and 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.390
 from here you can see the traffic lights 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.000
 turn off the traffic so that the traffic turns 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.950
 really dissolve that happens again 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.899
 out there for God's sake it would be whole 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.759
 bad if something will happen and 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.840
 that means we can talk with as snappy as 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.190
 they can always turn things around 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.780
 actually principle now times the traffic 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.390
 in Frankfurt for a short time completely paralyze 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.110
 or turn lights to red and then 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.110
 but the chaos is perfect 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.549
 a pity, actually 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.950
 that makes and he now put times 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.340
 simply in theory they could by 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.230
 up here also in wine red 890 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.170
 Year of construction Ford Fiesta with the license plate 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.820
 f mp 7 476 she could see that too 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.290
 Quickly we realize that you have to 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.420
 quickly we could still with the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.280
 cameras and record the license plate 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.370
 and then the driver would have one of you 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:38.180
 problem that is full of george 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:41.859
 Michael moderately successful to stupid 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.859
 But every teacher or teacher sounds 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.180
 but with God's will, God will 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.180
 I will want to touch here 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.190
 and all good schettler is now 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.830
 I even ask for this wine-red ford 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.610
 fiesta year of construction with the label f ​​mp 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.440
 7 476 we could theoretically do that 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.660
 Everything programmed so that this car 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.670
 in the future always green wave has that 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.830
 never gets flashed and never gets one 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.630
 strafzettel gets the low litter already 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.850
 many buyers that I'm going 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.850
 not at all people but also ideas 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:41.400
 and at the nod you could me there 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:43.650
 maybe or when they pay theirs 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.800
 Can you do the loading is not clear 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.930
 Well, I would say that's it 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.390
 I thank you very much here was 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.210
 very interesting in the frankfurter 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.540
 traffic control well then we go 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.540
 now on 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.890
 where is the shuttle from what does it look like 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:13.129
 judicial wine red ford fiesta 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:15.199
 Drivers believe that death is ripped 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.819
 roger has me then it has always been such a 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:23.019
 rad com on 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:23.019
