00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hello, I want to show one more 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.210
 Daddy in my hands a Chinese knife for this 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.179
 box times without any 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 identifying marks are not these marks and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:20.660
 in fact , however, it is enough to open 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.130
 ours so that all questions disappear 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:29.340
 in front of us are fakes of a knife 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 ontario rat folder model 1 in 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.480
 common rat 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.500
 it is extremely popular at 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.230
 least on the side of the knife controversy I heard 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.690
 repeatedly why the chinese still 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.710
 with their fakes I got to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.629
 rats well, the main argument was that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.210
 the cost 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.300
 ontario rat folder 1 and is about 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.300
 40 dollars with delivery and fake 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.219
 such rain tower is beneficial nonetheless 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.180
 for the Chinese, apparently there is nothing 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:08.130
 the impossible knife they made and sell 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.090
 it is priced at less than 20 dollars at 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.869
 this they in the design was made 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.880
 a few small changes that have 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.170
 in my opinion some positive to me 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.030
 don't like the main thing 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.659
 not basic but one of the notable ones 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.530
 the size of the knife has changed Chinese knife 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.890
 longer than about one centimeter wherein 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.079
 cutting edge added 3 millimeters 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.380
 length 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:45.689
 further the blade on the Chinese we see 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:49.740
 stonewash on the original we have small 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.950
 cross sateen matter of taste to anyone what 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.020
 I personally like more like satin 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.030
 table knife in my opinion more 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.500
 contributes to the appearance of spots where 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:06.660
 rust the next difference is 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:14.880
 in addition to the length , the blade thickness has also changed 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:20.470
 the original thickness is 2 and 8 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.959
 millimeter in Chinese on the same 38 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.440
 millimeter that is approximately 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:30.250
 millimeter blade added accordingly 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.100
 changed and without a knife I have not here 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.880
 a completely original knife will be seen replacing 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.850
 lining 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:42.480
 weight is about 160 grams Chinese 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.580
 weighs 175 grams 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.080
 15 grams to someone may seem 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.840
 significant in my opinion this is big 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.720
 does not matter 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.640
 knife lining on the original was used 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.980
 material called frn or uah i.e. 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.270
 is it an eye or fiberglass reinforced 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.430
 Niall many abused by the way taste it 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.090
 for the lining material since he 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.239
 slippery Chinese used g10 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:20.250
 it contributes to more reliable 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:24.160
 hold knife and since 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.980
 the Chinese are already accustomed to release in similar 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.470
 fakes to satisfy as much as possible 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.250
 user needs then released 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.400
 this knife was immediately with lining 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.489
 different color it and orange 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.150
 similar to this and camouflage as nato 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.070
 even who came to me 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.960
 black sulfur and things like that is 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:56.340
 you can choose to your taste well, 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:59.390
 otherwise what else if you look closely 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.860
 you can see that the width of the cutting edge 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.790
 for more Chinese 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.820
 that is, in addition to the thickness of the blade 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.050
 changed to ontario rat 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.920
 note area 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.870
 0 6 millimeter in Chinese mixing 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:24.120
 about 075 millimeters this 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:28.010
 naturally a little worsen the cut but not 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:34.370
 so much so that this knife became a cleaver 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.370
 instead of compared to the original 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:43.650
 further on ontario used steel 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.800
 aus 8 from the Chinese 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:52.280
 this is an analogue of 8-13 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:58.560
 or in another classification t440p 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:04.830
 the chinese used steel 9xs r18 i 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:08.520
 I can this steel corresponds to 440c 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.840
 or aus 10 but approximately of course 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:17.580
 There is basically one of the drawbacks 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:20.030
 as many wanted to purchase a rat with 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.360
 more advanced steel and 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:27.380
 there were custom versions of this knife 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:32.130
 where steel is better including powders 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.990
 The Chinese have put ios 10 and while of course 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.570
 this one of mine was not in use 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.630
 there is nothing you already sausage and I cut 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:47.370
 but still if you try to compare 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:54.090
 in such a stupid way namely shoes about 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:57.470
 their ontario knife slides on the chinese 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.470
 while the Chinese 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:06.540
 removes such very noticeable chips from 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:09.420
 original knife from this can be in 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.050
 principle to conclude that steel is 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.490
 Chinese 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.160
 harder but how will she behave in 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.960
 real in real use say 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.820
 I can not maybe she will crumble 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:27.860
 while it was nothing to me 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:29.780
 notice but none the less apparently 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:35.370
 declared steel grade 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:38.010
 here is correct, that is, steel 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:43.200
 use on what is labeled 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:44.900
 on labeling again in direct in full 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.730
 sense of the word knife is not 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.270
 fakes since 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.760
 logo ontario knife name 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.350
 missing here appeared some 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:59.010
 incomprehensible 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:01.290
 initials keyhole what does it mean I can't 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:08.300
 say maybe this is a knife ontario 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:11.780
 maybe something else clip similarly 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:17.160
 the original is tough enough 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:19.740
 liners in Chinese on the same has the same 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.200
 thickness here is one and a half millimeter but 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.130
 Castle 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:28.830
 comes a little less than the original 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:32.100
 I checked from the blows to the ear not 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:35.730
 fold in principle the knife can 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:39.810
 say quite good and for the money that 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:43.280
 he stands me personally this knife 

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.750
 More like the Chinese clone 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.960
 military or 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.960
 paramilitary and 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.740
 I recommend to buy it 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:08:02.050
 I will not 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:04.890
 who needs to find a knife in general such 

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:09.610
 It turned out in my opinion very much 

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:11.670
 interesting and not bad thanks to everyone 

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.670
 dating
