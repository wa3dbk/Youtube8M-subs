00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
said it was simple is because it really

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.930 
said it was simple is because it really
found<00:00:50.769> that<00:00:50.800> complicated<00:00:51.429> of<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:52.539> I<00:00:53.940> was

purely<00:01:48.700> aesthetic<00:01:48.910> and<00:01:49.480> a<00:01:49.570> blur<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.340> read<00:01:51.340> that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
purely aesthetic and a blur I read that

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.430 
purely aesthetic and a blur I read that
people<00:01:51.700> paint<00:01:52.090> their<00:01:52.180> toenails<00:01:52.480> to<00:01:52.960> harden

people paint their toenails to harden

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.990 
people paint their toenails to harden
the<00:01:53.560> toenails<00:01:54.010> because<00:01:54.190> you've<00:01:54.400> got<00:01:54.520> an<00:01:54.610> extra

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
the toenails because you've got an extra

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.730 
the toenails because you've got an extra
layer<00:01:55.180> sore<00:01:55.540> won't<00:01:55.750> crack<00:01:56.080> it's<00:01:56.290> nothing<00:01:56.590> like

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
layer sore won't crack it's nothing like

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.820 
layer sore won't crack it's nothing like
that<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:58.510> world<00:01:58.720> why<00:01:58.870> would<00:01:58.930> they<00:01:59.320> make<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.680> to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
that the world why would they make it to

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.700 
that the world why would they make it to
do<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.040> clear<00:02:00.790> cloak<00:02:01.120> of<00:02:01.480> clear<00:02:01.780> acrylic<00:02:02.080> to
