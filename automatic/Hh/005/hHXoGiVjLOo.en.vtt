00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 It is known as the allround microphone 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.720
 for singers or, for example, let's play 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.490
 keeps the red nt 1a with his 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.650
 Ten-year warranty on what it 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.360
 promises we show you the positive ones 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.099
 and the negative sides of the big one 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.839
 membrane mic on and wish you 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.119
 Now have fun with the following review 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.920
 for a long time we are always and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.390
 more and more of you after ours 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.130
 used technology and therefore asked 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.480
 Let's start with the Roden dancer 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.369
 and look at the first 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.960
 Processing on this point can be 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.490
 actually not much criticize you 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.430
 should, however, be prepared for it 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.559
 that the red nt 1a with its 3 126 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.300
 not necessarily the easier ones 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.399
 you can take it into the microphone 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.469
 However, it feels very robust 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.600
 or microphone itself is practically not 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.789
 a part of plastic even after about 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.170
 have a year of active use 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.920
 no defects in the workmanship 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.870
 opened 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.820
 also the included spider on thieves 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.710
 will be discussed later 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.879
 a good impression but a lot of dust 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.469
 good as magical 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.199
 we have already hinted at it 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.120
 that accessory ordered that or nth im 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.100
 podcast bundle you are not only 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.870
 owner of the nt 1 in itself but 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.000
 also gets next to a spider and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.720
 a head protection an xlr cable 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.850
 included 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.700
 the pop protection is responsible for it 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.680
 or make tea louder 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.390
 this job really well his attachment 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.220
 But the spider does not quite like me 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.750
 convinced that screw the notice 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.890
 The built-in there are fast 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.060
 lose strength 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.799
 but this is only a small one 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.479
 critical point and has not been 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.670
 distracting to the recordings with the clearing 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.380
 dancers impacted the included 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.479
 spider acts at the first moment something 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.549
 bulky but they are noises 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.079
 diminished by eg on 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.100
 the table on which the microphone stands 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.140
 be generated 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.299
 The spider filters these noises 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.950
 almost completely out and the microphone 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.869
 hovers practical of its bracket 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.430
 also it is due to the intelligent 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.110
 unscrews the microphone in 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.399
 the spider can turn it upside down 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.270
 turn without it afterwards 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.740
 fall out 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.930
 but now we come to everything 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.549
 crucial question how does it sound now 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.140
 that rohde and hence ab during the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.430
 you already have the sound of the whole video 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.110
 of the micro belongs and I must say 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.299
 This one took me for a microphone in the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.520
 Price class of the racing team from real 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.350
 The voice becomes very natural 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.270
 recorded and also for the record 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.399
 of instruments or vocals is the nt 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.140
 1a ideally suited with one 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.700
 post-processing as it is in this 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.900
 Video the case is sounding is even more 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.090
 on 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.530
 better and above all a bit of a heat 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.209
 background noise how to do it 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.400
 for example, some cheaper 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.629
 Microphone knows is only very weak up 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.640
 not to notice 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.049
 a big fire capacitor microphone 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.599
 is especially characterized by his 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.099
 kidney characteristic from this means 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.109
 that the microphone is not the whole 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.629
 sound in the room but only the noise 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.129
 in the immediate vicinity clearly picks up 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.140
 For that reason you should always use the 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.689
 small golden dot on the red 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.819
 carpet turned the better 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.290
 and this is best recorded 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.970
 in their characteristic that makes 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.069
 microphone especially for podcaster and 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.780
 also lex player like us interesting 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.489
 being in any characteristic like 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.409
 could also be a bit stronger 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.940
 in spite of all this, there are also noises 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.010
 further distance still very quiet 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.780
 be recorded but you look now 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.400
 on the bottom of the micro we come across 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.709
 on a problem there is only one 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.780
 xlr cable connection you on your pc 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.090
 surely you will not find like you 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.590
 but still the sound of nt 1 am 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.150
 we can show computers 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.159
 you in a linked here extra 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.900
 video that there are several possibilities 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.450
 But now we come first 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.220
 conclusion that rohde and answer has one 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.900
 good sound for its price range and 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.430
 also the processing as well as the accessories 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.169
 can be seen the kidneys 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.120
 characteristics could be my opinion, 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.889
 to be expanded a little further 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.660
 and you should not assume 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.769
 that rohde without problems on pc 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.269
 to be able to connect 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.699
 All in all, it is special 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.980
 for let's player podcaster and singer 1 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:35.780
 To recommend the microphone purchasing link 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.430
 for tobogganing tsa is also in the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.680
 You still want video description 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.699
 read more reviews on our technology 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.079
 let's just go to the
