00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
back and through about 4 times 2 5 5 is

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.850 
back and through about 4 times 2 5 5 is
probably<00:01:48.649> better<00:01:48.859> that's<00:01:49.610> for<00:01:49.939> little<00:01:51.579> slide

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
probably better that's for little slide

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.669 
probably better that's for little slide
now<00:01:54.860> then<00:01:55.359> turning<00:01:56.359> all<00:01:56.689> round<00:01:57.530> in<00:01:58.399> your<00:01:58.609> hands
