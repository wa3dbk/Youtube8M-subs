00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.900 
blueberries and the Very's that we love
almonds<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.890> lot<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.250> trees<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.520> flower

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
almonds a lot of the trees that flower

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.430 
almonds a lot of the trees that flower
and<00:02:30.150> blossom<00:02:30.300> require<00:02:30.930> honeybees<00:02:31.410> to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
and blossom require honeybees to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.350 
and blossom require honeybees to
pollinate<00:02:31.620> them<00:02:32.190> but<00:02:32.700> we've<00:02:32.850> lost<00:02:33.030> up<00:02:33.330> to

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
pollinate them but we've lost up to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.940 
pollinate them but we've lost up to
forty<00:02:33.930> five<00:02:34.110> percent<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.530> them<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.800> last

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
forty five percent of them in the last

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.770 
forty five percent of them in the last
year<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:35.940> drastic<00:02:36.480> what<00:02:36.630> they're

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
year so this is drastic what they're

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.900 
year so this is drastic what they're
calling<00:02:36.930> colony<00:02:37.590> collapse<00:02:37.800> disorder<00:02:38.160> and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
calling colony collapse disorder and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.580 
calling colony collapse disorder and
it's<00:02:39.120> really<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.390> problem<00:02:39.630> because<00:02:40.020> we<00:02:40.350> are

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
it's really a problem because we are

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.650 
it's really a problem because we are
depending<00:02:40.740> on<00:02:41.070> them<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.460> our<00:02:41.580> food<00:02:41.820> one<00:02:42.540> in

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
depending on them for our food one in

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.720 
depending on them for our food one in
every<00:02:43.050> three<00:02:43.320> bites<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.890> humans<00:02:44.310> eat<00:02:44.580> is

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
every three bites that humans eat is

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.790 
every three bites that humans eat is
actually<00:02:44.940> indirectly<00:02:45.690> or<00:02:45.930> directly<00:02:46.140> affected

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
actually indirectly or directly affected

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.440 
actually indirectly or directly affected
by<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.950> honeybee<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.730> if<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:47.910> lose<00:02:48.120> them<00:02:48.300> we're

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
by a honeybee so if we lose them we're

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.760 
by a honeybee so if we lose them we're
going<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.630> lose<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> lot<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.050> diversity<00:02:49.350> their

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
going to lose a lot of diversity their

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.620 
going to lose a lot of diversity their
major<00:02:50.010> part<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.490> ecosystem<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.360> this

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
major part of the ecosystem and so this

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.020 
major part of the ecosystem and so this
is<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.350> important<00:02:52.830> how<00:02:53.160> did<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.430> choose<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
is so important how did you choose the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.930 
is so important how did you choose the
colors<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:55.020> obviously<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.310> charity<00:02:56.730> has<00:02:56.910> a

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
colors so obviously the charity has a

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.460 
colors so obviously the charity has a
big<00:02:57.210> impact<00:02:57.540> on<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.750> colors<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.230> choose

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
big impact on the colors that I choose

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.810 
big impact on the colors that I choose
to<00:02:58.620> create<00:02:58.860> for<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.040> season<00:02:59.340> but<00:02:59.490> then<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.670> also

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
to create for the season but then I also

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.490 
to create for the season but then I also
keep<00:03:00.180> an<00:03:00.300> eye<00:03:00.390> on<00:03:00.420> fashion<00:03:00.930> because<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.200> feel

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
keep an eye on fashion because I feel

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.780 
keep an eye on fashion because I feel
like<00:03:01.530> when<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.800> woman<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.250> updating<00:03:02.700> her

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
like when a woman is updating her

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.220 
like when a woman is updating her
wardrobe<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.360> season<00:03:03.750> she's<00:03:03.930> gonna<00:03:04.050> be
