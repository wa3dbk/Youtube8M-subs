00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
right side of the map I think that Nonis

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.689 
right side of the map I think that Nonis
probably<00:00:45.690> feeling<00:00:45.989> pretty<00:00:46.680> hurt<00:00:47.339> after<00:00:47.489> that

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
probably feeling pretty hurt after that

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.790 
probably feeling pretty hurt after that
first<00:00:47.909> game<00:00:48.089> this<00:00:48.629> was<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.900> very<00:00:49.170> very<00:00:49.290> simple

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
game that we saw in Game one but at the

game that we saw in Game one but at the
same<00:00:51.690> time<00:00:51.960> very<00:00:52.199> very<00:00:52.559> high<00:00:53.750> level<00:00:54.750> as<00:00:54.839> far<00:00:54.870> as

same time very very high level as far as

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.649 
same time very very high level as far as
responses<00:00:55.710> go<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.909> I<00:00:57.030> said<00:00:57.269> before<00:00:57.390> it's

when these other games very textbook as
far<00:01:00.479> as<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.750> educational<00:01:01.589> when<00:01:02.549> it<00:01:02.610> comes<00:01:02.760> to

Starcraft<00:01:03.119> I<00:01:03.449> really<00:01:03.900> was<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> pretty

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
Starcraft I really was a pretty

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.770 
Starcraft I really was a pretty
impressed<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.549> look<00:01:05.790> one<00:01:06.210> game<00:01:06.390> already<00:01:06.600> down

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
impressed but look one game already down

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.210 
impressed but look one game already down

get to the mid to the late game you have

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.260 
get to the mid to the late game you have
an<00:01:10.350> easier<00:01:10.680> time<00:01:10.710> against<00:01:11.159> Terran<00:01:11.490> big<00:01:11.850> mains

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
an easier time against Terran big mains

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630 
an easier time against Terran big mains
on<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> lot<00:01:13.259> of<00:01:13.290> recalls<00:01:13.740> you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
on there you can do a lot of recalls you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.890 
on there you can do a lot of recalls you
can<00:01:14.790> even<00:01:14.880> go<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.210> quick<00:01:15.330> River<00:01:15.780> for

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
can even go for a quick River for

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.690 
can even go for a quick River for
instance<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.259> take<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.470> islands<00:01:16.920> now<00:01:17.490> we're

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
instance and take the islands now we're

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.999 
instance and take the islands now we're
on<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> different<00:01:18.119> map<00:01:18.479> neo<00:01:19.290> tornado<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.920> this

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
on a different map neo tornado and this

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830 
on a different map neo tornado and this
is<00:01:20.130> probably<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.549> map<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> noni<00:01:21.210> has<00:01:21.450> much

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
is probably a map that noni has much

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.450 
is probably a map that noni has much
less<00:01:22.020> experience<00:01:22.560> playing<00:01:22.829> on<00:01:22.979> because<00:01:23.369> he

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
less experience playing on because he

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.520 
less experience playing on because he
hasn't<00:01:23.610> been<00:01:23.790> active<00:01:24.119> lately<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:25.170> true

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
hasn't been active lately that's true

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
hasn't been active lately that's true
you<00:01:25.680> know<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.979> draw<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.400> course<00:01:26.430> had<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you know I draw of course had to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.820 
you know I draw of course had to
practice<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> quite<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> bit<00:01:27.750> being<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> CJ

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
practice it quite a bit being on the CJ

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.010 
practice it quite a bit being on the CJ
entus<00:01:29.040> pro<00:01:29.340> team<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.150> map<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.570> has<00:01:30.750> been

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
entus pro team it's a map that has been

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.110 
entus pro team it's a map that has been
in<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> league<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.950> obviously<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.790> know<00:01:32.909> he's

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
in the league so obviously you know he's

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.360 
in the league so obviously you know he's
played<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.510> quite<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.720> bit<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.800> therefore<00:01:35.250> his

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
played it quite a bit so therefore his

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.890 
played it quite a bit so therefore his
build<00:01:35.610> should<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.030> pretty<00:01:36.180> good<00:01:36.330> but<00:01:36.570> last

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
build should be pretty good but last

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.080 
build should be pretty good but last
time<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:38.040> felt<00:01:38.220> Nonis<00:01:38.610> should<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:38.970> won

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
time I really felt Nonis should have won

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.030 
time I really felt Nonis should have won
on<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.360> map<00:01:39.570> when<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:39.870> last<00:01:40.110> met<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.770> I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
on this map when they last met so I

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.219 
on this map when they last met so I
don't<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.610> man<00:01:41.850> I've<00:01:42.240> given<00:01:42.540> only<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.930> chance

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
don't know man I've given only a chance

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.070 
don't know man I've given only a chance
still<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.830> I'm<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.659> stoked<00:01:45.930> for

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
still but I'm just really stoked for

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.140 
still but I'm just really stoked for
that<00:01:46.470> he<00:01:46.560> won<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.890> first<00:01:47.250> game<00:01:47.550> that<00:01:47.820> first

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
that he won that first game that first

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.820 
that he won that first game that first
win<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.450> think<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.870> drama<00:01:49.140> was<00:01:49.350> such<00:01:49.650> an

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
win I think in drama was such an

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.610 
win I think in drama was such an
important<00:01:50.250> map<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.760> him<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> win<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:52.260> he

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
important map for him to win I think he

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.820 
important map for him to win I think he
played<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> really<00:01:53.780> really<00:01:54.780> smart<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.799> know

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
played a really really smart you know

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.100 
played a really really smart you know
what<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.280> about<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.000> way<00:01:57.120> idris<00:01:57.630> play<00:01:57.900> has

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
what I like about the way idris play has

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.530 
what I like about the way idris play has
evolved<00:01:58.770> over<00:01:58.950> all<00:01:59.220> this<00:01:59.370> time<00:01:59.640> is<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.450> he

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
evolved over all this time is that he

River is actually the exact counter to
what<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.590> drew<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.070> doing<00:02:50.520> here<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.180> know<00:02:51.270> you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
what I drew is doing here you know you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.180 
what I drew is doing here you know you
push<00:02:51.660> with<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> river<00:02:52.170> on<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.320> bunker<00:02:52.770> you

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
push with the river on the bunker you

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.880 
push with the river on the bunker you
push<00:02:53.400> with<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:54.030> dragoons<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:55.260> know<00:02:55.320> it's

push with the the dragoons you know it's

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.530 
push with the the dragoons you know it's
just<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.340> impossible<00:02:56.910> for<00:02:56.970> Tara<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.330> hold

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
just it's impossible for Tara to hold

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.790 
just it's impossible for Tara to hold
because<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.840> siege<00:02:58.020> tanks<00:02:58.320> are<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.470> bit<00:02:58.590> late

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
because the siege tanks are a bit late

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.430 
because the siege tanks are a bit late
so<00:02:59.180> you<00:03:00.180> know<00:03:00.270> we<00:03:00.510> see<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> probe<00:03:01.050> right<00:03:01.230> now

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
so you know we see the probe right now

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.320 
so you know we see the probe right now
he<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.830> harassing<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.550> command<00:03:02.940> center<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
he is harassing this command center a

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.600 
he is harassing this command center a
little<00:03:03.450> bit<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:04.020> I<00:03:04.830> think<00:03:05.040> he<00:03:05.100> knows<00:03:05.250> pretty

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
little bit and I think he knows pretty

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.330 
little bit and I think he knows pretty
much<00:03:05.760> what's<00:03:06.060> going<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.570> here<00:03:06.990> from<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.800> draw<00:03:08.100> I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
much what's going on here from I draw I

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.460 
much what's going on here from I draw I
think<00:03:09.150> it's<00:03:09.270> not<00:03:09.480> something<00:03:09.660> expected<00:03:10.140> but

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
think it's not something expected but

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.290 
think it's not something expected but
will<00:03:10.740> Nonie<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.640> know<00:03:11.730> think<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:12.120> his<00:03:12.270> feet

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300

really quick and figure out what to do
here<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:15.180> think<00:03:15.960> so<00:03:16.170> he's<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.380> pretty<00:03:16.590> smart

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
here I think so he's a pretty smart

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.270 
here I think so he's a pretty smart
player<00:03:17.100> what<00:03:17.910> what<00:03:18.300> what<00:03:18.510> what<00:03:18.720> what<00:03:18.750> at<00:03:19.320> what

there<00:04:38.669> anymore<00:04:38.700> back<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.419> it<00:04:39.540> even<00:04:39.810> now

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
there anymore back to it even now

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.590 
there anymore back to it even now
because<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.680> escape<00:04:41.070> key<00:04:41.310> is<00:04:41.820> dangerous<00:04:42.419> it's

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
because the escape key is dangerous it's

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.970 
because the escape key is dangerous it's
why<00:04:42.750> it's<00:04:42.900> at<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.050> top<00:04:43.230> left<00:04:43.530> side<00:04:43.620> of<00:04:43.860> your

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
why it's at the top left side of your

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.980 
why it's at the top left side of your
keyboard<00:04:44.130> yes<00:04:45.000> they<00:04:45.330> thought<00:04:45.570> about<00:04:45.660> star

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
keyboard yes they thought about star

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.480 
keyboard yes they thought about star
crap<00:04:46.200> when<00:04:46.440> they<00:04:46.560> designed<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:47.039> keyboard

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
crap when they designed the keyboard

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.710 
crap when they designed the keyboard
that's<00:04:47.700> right<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.120> that's<00:04:48.330> why<00:04:48.450> they<00:04:48.570> put<00:04:48.690> it

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
that's right and that's why they put it

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.200 
that's right and that's why they put it
out<00:04:48.780> there

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
out there

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.420 
out there
would<00:04:50.360> like<00:04:50.509> to<00:04:50.630> point<00:04:50.810> out<00:04:50.960> though<00:04:51.250> Hydra<00:04:52.250> did

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
would like to point out though Hydra did

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.120 
would like to point out though Hydra did
this<00:04:52.639> once<00:04:52.940> before<00:04:53.180> kind<00:04:54.110> of<00:04:54.350> where<00:04:54.740> he<00:04:55.039> was

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
this once before kind of where he was

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.529 
this once before kind of where he was
playing<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.520> believe<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.789> was<00:04:55.850> Phoenix<00:04:56.330> and

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
playing I believe it was Phoenix and

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.439 
playing I believe it was Phoenix and
ESWC<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.740> believe<00:04:58.430> actually<00:04:58.610> we<00:04:58.880> were<00:04:59.000> casting

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
ESWC I believe actually we were casting

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:00.999 
ESWC I believe actually we were casting
that<00:04:59.599> game<00:04:59.810> and<00:04:59.960> he<00:05:00.020> left<00:05:00.319> after<00:05:00.710> like<00:05:00.860> a

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
that game and he left after like a

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.219 
that game and he left after like a
minute<00:05:01.300> because<00:05:02.300> like<00:05:02.750> a<00:05:02.780> probe<00:05:03.080> was

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
minute because like a probe was

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.809 
minute because like a probe was
harassing<00:05:03.560> him<00:05:03.770> too<00:05:03.919> hard<00:05:04.190> or<00:05:04.340> something<00:05:04.699> he

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
harassing him too hard or something he

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.059 
harassing him too hard or something he
was<00:05:04.849> like<00:05:05.030> really<00:05:05.210> angry<00:05:05.569> so<00:05:05.810> this<00:05:06.560> guy<00:05:06.740> you

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
was like really angry so this guy you

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.400 
was like really angry so this guy you
know<00:05:07.220> still<00:05:07.669> has<00:05:07.910> a<00:05:07.940> lot<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.419> anger<00:05:08.690> in<00:05:08.810> him<00:05:08.960> as

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
know still has a lot of anger in him as

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.999 
know still has a lot of anger in him as
well<00:05:09.860> so<00:05:10.160> that<00:05:10.310> might<00:05:10.520> factor<00:05:10.910> into<00:05:11.120> it

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
well so that might factor into it

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.070 
well so that might factor into it
alright<00:05:13.009> so<00:05:13.220> anyways<00:05:13.550> outsider<00:05:14.090> this<00:05:14.780> map

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
alright so anyways outsider this map

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.080 
alright so anyways outsider this map
again<00:05:15.680> of<00:05:15.919> map<00:05:16.130> it's<00:05:16.310> very<00:05:16.639> very<00:05:16.880> good<00:05:16.940> for

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
again of map it's very very good for

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.469 
again of map it's very very good for
arbiter<00:05:17.720> play<00:05:17.900> yeah<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:19.130> is<00:05:19.280> it's<00:05:19.910> also<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.270> map

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
arbiter play yeah it is it's also a map

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.240 
arbiter play yeah it is it's also a map
where<00:05:20.720> dropship<00:05:21.289> play<00:05:21.440> can<00:05:21.620> be<00:05:21.710> pretty<00:05:21.919> tricky

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
where dropship play can be pretty tricky

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.249 
where dropship play can be pretty tricky
I<00:05:22.550> think<00:05:23.120> it's<00:05:23.389> a<00:05:23.419> really<00:05:23.539> cool<00:05:23.780> map<00:05:24.020> it's<00:05:24.229> not

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
I think it's a really cool map it's not

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.439 
I think it's a really cool map it's not
the<00:05:24.410> most<00:05:24.530> balanced<00:05:24.949> map<00:05:25.160> but<00:05:25.310> I<00:05:25.370> think<00:05:25.610> it

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
the most balanced map but I think it

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.120 
the most balanced map but I think it
I<00:05:26.509> really<00:05:26.870> gotta<00:05:26.990> commend<00:05:27.259> the<00:05:27.440> map<00:05:27.590> maker<00:05:27.830> for

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
I really gotta commend the map maker for

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.550 
I really gotta commend the map maker for
this<00:05:28.310> because<00:05:29.300> I<00:05:29.449> love<00:05:29.690> seeing<00:05:30.169> maps<00:05:30.410> like

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
this because I love seeing maps like

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.529 
this because I love seeing maps like
this<00:05:30.740> on<00:05:30.889> in<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.550> game<00:05:31.759> it<00:05:31.970> makes<00:05:32.210> for<00:05:32.419> much
