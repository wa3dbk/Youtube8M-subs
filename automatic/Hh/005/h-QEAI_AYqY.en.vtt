more difficult for them to kill me with
a<00:03:28.250> shotgun<00:03:28.609> and<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.720> find<00:03:30.079> when<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:30.349> have<00:03:30.650> that

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
a shotgun and I find when I have that

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.849 
a shotgun and I find when I have that
kind<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.069> mindset<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.750> usually<00:03:33.290> works<00:03:33.650> out

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
kind of mindset it it usually works out

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.430 
kind of mindset it it usually works out
for<00:03:34.099> me<00:03:34.129> the<00:03:34.819> only<00:03:35.060> time<00:03:35.269> it<00:03:35.599> doesn't<00:03:36.139> work<00:03:36.260> out

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
for me the only time it doesn't work out
