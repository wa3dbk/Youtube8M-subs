contracts but by and large everyone else

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.969 
contracts but by and large everyone else
would<00:04:15.299> be<00:04:15.329> stuck<00:04:15.750> with<00:04:15.989> mostly

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
would be stuck with mostly

would be stuck with mostly
non-guaranteed<00:04:17.459> contracts<00:04:18.329> so<00:04:18.449> we<00:04:19.049> just

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
non-guaranteed contracts so we just

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.620 
non-guaranteed contracts so we just
don't<00:04:19.470> see<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.799> as<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.310> best<00:04:20.519> way<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:21.419> promote

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
don't see it as the best way to promote

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.409 
don't see it as the best way to promote
what<00:04:22.469> we're<00:04:22.650> being<00:04:22.889> told<00:04:23.099> as<00:04:23.400> more<00:04:23.729> parity<00:04:24.150> and

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
what we're being told as more parity and

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.860 
what we're being told as more parity and
better<00:04:24.630> competitive<00:04:25.169> balance

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
better competitive balance
