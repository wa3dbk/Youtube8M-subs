00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.479 
can actually leave it a little bit more
crumbly<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.630> less<00:02:06.840> states<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.890> that's<00:02:08.190> done

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
crumbly with less states so that's done

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.830 
crumbly with less states so that's done
I'm<00:02:08.640> going<00:02:08.790> to<00:02:08.850> just<00:02:08.970> leave<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.270> aside<00:02:09.420> now

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
I'm going to just leave that aside now

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.440 
I'm going to just leave that aside now
as<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.380> can<00:02:10.530> see<00:02:10.770> I've<00:02:11.180> pre-soaked<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
as you can see I've pre-soaked the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.449 
as you can see I've pre-soaked the
almonds<00:02:12.930> if<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.650> haven't<00:02:13.980> tried<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.220> you

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
almonds if you haven't tried it you

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.940 
almonds if you haven't tried it you
should<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:16.080> sprouts<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.680> nut<00:02:16.830> as

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
should and it's it sprouts the nut as

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.850 
should and it's it sprouts the nut as
well<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.400> again<00:02:18.060> higher<00:02:18.360> nutrient<00:02:18.900> content<00:02:19.290> so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
well so again higher nutrient content so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.800 
well so again higher nutrient content so
what<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.610> do<00:02:20.850> with<00:02:21.030> these<00:02:21.209> nuts<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.690> I

adding and I pretty much add this to
everything<00:02:46.650> these<00:02:47.190> are<00:02:47.310> chia<00:02:47.610> seeds<00:02:47.940> they

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
everything these are chia seeds they

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.970 
everything these are chia seeds they
have<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.019> highest<00:02:49.230> content<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.160> omega-3s<00:02:51.980> so

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980
