switch<00:00:03.480> inputs<00:00:04.110> let's<00:00:04.859> talk<00:00:05.069> about<00:00:05.190> them

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
switch inputs let's talk about them

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.860 
switch inputs let's talk about them
electrically<00:00:06.150> now<00:00:06.299> once<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:07.140> get<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:08.040> down

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
electrically now once we get this down

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.810 
electrically now once we get this down
electrically<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.929> designs<00:00:10.469> then<00:00:11.400> we'll<00:00:11.670> be

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
electrically the designs then we'll be

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.600 
electrically the designs then we'll be
able<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.290> accurately<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.559> quickly<00:00:13.799> diagnose

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
able to accurately and quickly diagnose

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.390 
able to accurately and quickly diagnose
any<00:00:14.910> switch<00:00:15.330> input<00:00:15.750> trial<00:00:16.020> monocle<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.740> so

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
any switch input trial monocle and so

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.400 
any switch input trial monocle and so
there's<00:00:17.580> two<00:00:17.850> main<00:00:18.119> designs<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.960> pull<00:00:19.230> up

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
there's two main designs it's pull up

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.870 
there's two main designs it's pull up
and<00:00:19.619> pull<00:00:19.800> down<00:00:19.830> at<00:00:20.160> something<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.609> want<00:00:20.789> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
and pull down at something you want to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.109 
and pull down at something you want to
remember<00:00:21.270> two<00:00:21.720> main<00:00:22.410> design<00:00:23.010> switch<00:00:23.519> inputs

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
remember two main design switch inputs

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.910 
remember two main design switch inputs
called<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.380> pull<00:00:25.680> up<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.189> pull<00:00:26.609> down<00:00:27.890> now<00:00:28.890> I

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
called and pull up and pull down now I

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.890 
called and pull up and pull down now I
don't<00:00:29.130> know<00:00:29.340> if<00:00:29.369> other<00:00:29.880> people<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.810> the

don't know if other people in the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.380 
don't know if other people in the
industry<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:31.289> using<00:00:31.740> those<00:00:31.859> terms<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.759> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
industry are using those terms I do and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.970 
industry are using those terms I do and
I'll<00:00:33.540> show<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.780> why<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.530> go

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
I'll show you why as we go

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.470 
I'll show you why as we go

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
pull up and pull down in here switch

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.319 
pull up and pull down in here switch
clothes<00:00:43.260> what<00:00:43.890> are<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> switch<00:00:44.309> close<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
clothes what are the switch close to it

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.560 
clothes what are the switch close to it
close<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:46.020> ground<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.879> resistor<00:00:48.539> is

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
close to ground and now this resistor is

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.920 
close to ground and now this resistor is
in<00:00:49.079> play<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:50.430> now<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> drop<00:00:51.210> across<00:00:51.629> this

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
in play we now have a drop across this

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.689 
in play we now have a drop across this
resistor<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.039> current

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
resistor because we now have current

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.939 
resistor because we now have current
flow<00:00:53.960> computers<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.289> read<00:00:55.440> zero<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
flow computers going to read zero the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.889 
flow computers going to read zero the
bolts<00:00:56.309> right<00:00:56.460> here<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.420> had<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> voltmeter

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
bolts right here if you had a voltmeter

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.670 
bolts right here if you had a voltmeter
out<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.370> would<00:00:59.520> also<00:00:59.969> read<00:01:00.270> zero<00:01:01.260> volts

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
out here you would also read zero volts

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.549 
out here you would also read zero volts
and<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.699> call<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.300> design<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.379> makes

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and so we call this design and it makes

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.390 
and so we call this design and it makes
sense<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.189> pull<00:01:05.790> down<00:01:06.390> design<00:01:07.320> switch<00:01:07.890> input

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
sense a pull down design switch input

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.940 
sense a pull down design switch input
what<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> switch<00:01:09.360> doing<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.170> closing<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
what is the switch doing it's closing to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.850 
what is the switch doing it's closing to
ground<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.760> pulling<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.840> voltage<00:01:13.320> down

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
ground it's pulling the voltage down

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.130 
ground it's pulling the voltage down

have my my guys get confused is when we

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.170 
have my my guys get confused is when we
put<00:02:20.380> section<00:02:21.160> two<00:02:21.400> which<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:21.880> what<00:02:22.060> we're

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
put section two which is what we're

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.540 
put section two which is what we're
talking<00:02:22.300> about<00:02:22.480> switch<00:02:22.810> inputs<00:02:23.320> pull<00:02:24.190> up<00:02:24.340> pull

down is on and then we start combining

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.620 
down is on and then we start combining
that<00:02:26.980> information<00:02:27.730> when<00:02:27.850> we<00:02:27.910> jump<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.270> section

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
that information when we jump to section

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.900 
that information when we jump to section
3<00:02:28.900> which<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.740> on<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.920> output<00:02:30.070> side<00:02:30.520> where<00:02:30.790> we

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
3 which is on the output side where we

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.970 
3 which is on the output side where we
start<00:02:31.150> turning<00:02:31.360> things<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:31.990> off<00:02:32.320> which<00:02:32.860> is

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
start turning things on and off which is

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.740 
start turning things on and off which is
power<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.400> ground<00:02:33.520> side<00:02:33.820> switching<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
power and ground side switching the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.720 
power and ground side switching the
terminologies<00:02:35.590> get<00:02:35.800> mixed<00:02:36.130> up<00:02:36.220> very<00:02:36.490> easily

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
terminologies get mixed up very easily

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.090 
terminologies get mixed up very easily
so<00:02:37.690> that's<00:02:37.930> where<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> confusion<00:02:38.620> really

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
so that's where the confusion really

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.950 
so that's where the confusion really
comes<00:02:39.340> in<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.790> we'll<00:02:39.910> try<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.210> clarify<00:02:40.780> this

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
comes in and we'll try to clarify this

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.650 
comes in and we'll try to clarify this
as<00:02:41.230> much<00:02:41.410> as<00:02:41.560> possible<00:02:41.800> but<00:02:42.790> inputs<00:02:43.330> will<00:02:43.480> call

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
as much as possible but inputs will call

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.170 
as much as possible but inputs will call
signal<00:02:44.080> wires<00:02:44.460> outputs<00:02:45.460> will<00:02:45.610> call<00:02:45.820> control

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
signal wires outputs will call control

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.570 
signal wires outputs will call control
wires<00:02:46.480> where<00:02:47.320> we're<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:47.710> right<00:02:47.950> now<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.400> is

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
wires where we're at right now this is

wires where we're at right now this is
section<00:02:48.970> 2<00:02:50.310> section<00:02:51.310> 2<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.790> where<00:02:52.060> we<00:02:52.240> are<00:02:52.420> well

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
section 2 section 2 is where we are well

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.740 
section 2 section 2 is where we are well
we<00:02:53.050> dump<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.530> section<00:02:53.980> 3<00:02:54.280> next<00:02:54.520> this<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.480> where

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
we dump the section 3 next this is where

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.790 
we dump the section 3 next this is where

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
we're going to be we're going to be on

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.020 
we're going to be we're going to be on
the<00:02:56.890> output<00:02:57.310> cell<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:59.620> it<00:03:00.370> gets<00:03:00.550> a<00:03:00.640> little<00:03:00.760> bit

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
the output cell and it gets a little bit

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.360 
the output cell and it gets a little bit
more<00:03:01.210> confusing<00:03:02.170> or<00:03:02.440> there's<00:03:03.130> another

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
more confusing or there's another

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.790 
more confusing or there's another
variable<00:03:04.060> here<00:03:04.090> is<00:03:04.390> we<00:03:04.840> can<00:03:05.020> actually<00:03:05.470> watch

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
variable here is we can actually watch

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.120 
variable here is we can actually watch
what<00:03:06.190> we're<00:03:06.340> controlling<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.800> we'll<00:03:08.980> get

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
what we're controlling to and we'll get

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.620 
what we're controlling to and we'll get
into<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:09.910> that<00:03:09.940> gets<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.300> little<00:03:10.420> bit

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
into that and that gets a little bit

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.729 
into that and that gets a little bit
crazy<00:03:10.960> that<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.470> computer<00:03:11.890> actually<00:03:12.090> watches

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
crazy that the computer actually watches

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.220 
crazy that the computer actually watches
its<00:03:14.739> outputs<00:03:15.430> very<00:03:16.270> similar<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.959> how<00:03:17.080> it

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
its outputs very similar to how it

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.250 
its outputs very similar to how it
watches<00:03:17.709> its<00:03:17.890> input<00:03:18.370> so<00:03:18.810> just<00:03:19.810> remember<00:03:20.170> to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
watches its input so just remember to

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.660 
watches its input so just remember to
look<00:03:20.290> that<00:03:20.470> with<00:03:20.650> these<00:03:20.830> twits<00:03:21.190> is<00:03:21.340> what<00:03:21.520> we're

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
look that with these twits is what we're

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.650 
look that with these twits is what we're
talking<00:03:21.880> about<00:03:22.150> right<00:03:22.420> now

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
talking about right now

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.310 
talking about right now
back<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.890> book<00:03:24.520> here<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.050> computer<00:03:26.050> is

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
back to the book here the computer is

you<00:03:28.959> guys<00:03:29.110> see<00:03:29.320> that<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.670> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
you guys see that that that the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.820 
you guys see that that that the
computers<00:03:31.510> just<00:03:31.660> simply<00:03:32.110> watching<00:03:32.680> this

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
computers just simply watching this

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.640 
computers just simply watching this
circuit<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.670> has<00:03:33.880> no<00:03:34.239> decision-making<00:03:35.110> as<00:03:35.410> far

as opening and closing the switch the

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.280 
as opening and closing the switch the
computer<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.860> simply<00:03:39.459> watching<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.690> voltage

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
computer is simply watching the voltage

computer is simply watching the voltage
in<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.310> circuit<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.850> know<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.480> switch

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
in the circuit to know the switch

in the circuit to know the switch
position

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.890 

okay<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:47.860> circuits<00:03:48.370> aside<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:49.330> follow<00:03:49.690> the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
okay so circuits aside you follow the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.540 
okay so circuits aside you follow the
wires<00:03:50.110> you<00:03:50.230> want<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.500> remember<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:51.010> without

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550

a voltmeter do using a wiring diagram
what<00:03:54.400> do<00:03:54.459> we<00:03:54.550> do<00:03:54.700> follow<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.750> wire<00:03:56.050> that<00:03:56.739> does

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
what do we do follow the wire that does

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.970 
what do we do follow the wire that does
not<00:03:57.430> go<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.450> computer<00:03:58.780> if<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.590> goes<00:03:59.709> to<00:03:59.950> the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
not go to the computer if it goes to the

well<00:04:27.210> let's<00:04:27.360> go<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.540> figure<00:04:27.840> three<00:04:28.110> first

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
well let's go to figure three first

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.050 
well let's go to figure three first
figure<00:04:28.740> three<00:04:28.980> is<00:04:29.040> going<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.550> be<00:04:29.610> on<00:04:29.790> page

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
figure three is going to be on page

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.900 
figure three is going to be on page

voltage and then also one last thing is

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.870 
voltage and then also one last thing is
couldn't<00:04:52.230> it<00:04:52.350> also<00:04:52.440> be<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.890> switch<00:04:53.160> is<00:04:53.400> stuck

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
couldn't it also be the switch is stuck

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.510 
couldn't it also be the switch is stuck
in<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.630> closed<00:04:54.960> position<00:04:55.370> keeping<00:04:56.370> the

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.520 
in the closed position keeping the
voltage<00:04:56.670> down<00:04:57.180> all<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.570> time<00:04:57.750> even<00:04:58.410> though

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
voltage down all the time even though

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.560 
voltage down all the time even though
you're<00:04:58.710> moving<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.340> so<00:04:59.520> it's<00:04:59.670> a<00:04:59.820> mechanically

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
you're moving the so it's a mechanically

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.740 
you're moving the so it's a mechanically
that<00:05:01.290> it<00:05:01.440> is<00:05:01.650> stuck<00:05:02.240> internally<00:05:03.240> in<00:05:03.690> the

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
that it is stuck internally in the

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.060 
that it is stuck internally in the
closed<00:05:04.110> position<00:05:04.350> it's<00:05:05.190> possible<00:05:06.050> so<00:05:07.070> what

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
closed position it's possible so what

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.660 
closed position it's possible so what
I've<00:05:08.190> done<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:08.520> I've<00:05:09.150> tried<00:05:09.510> to<00:05:09.840> think<00:05:09.870> about

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
I've done is I've tried to think about

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.240 
I've done is I've tried to think about
what<00:05:11.670> I<00:05:11.700> would<00:05:12.090> do<00:05:12.300> in<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.660> field<00:05:12.960> and<00:05:13.800> list<00:05:14.070> it

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
what I would do in the field and list it

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.080 
what I would do in the field and list it
for<00:05:14.490> you<00:05:14.670> in<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:15.330> speed<00:05:15.810> type<00:05:16.520> format<00:05:17.520> as<00:05:17.640> best<00:05:17.880> I

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
for you in a speed type format as best I

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.720 
for you in a speed type format as best I
could<00:05:18.330> and<00:05:18.830> I'm<00:05:19.830> telling<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.280> what<00:05:20.430> I<00:05:20.490> would

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
could and I'm telling you what I would

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.910 
could and I'm telling you what I would
do<00:05:20.850> next<00:05:21.060> on<00:05:21.420> this<00:05:21.570> is<00:05:22.080> I<00:05:22.260> would<00:05:22.380> eliminate<00:05:22.620> the

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
do next on this is I would eliminate the

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.980 
do next on this is I would eliminate the
switch<00:05:23.190> as<00:05:23.430> a<00:05:23.460> clocks<00:05:23.790> this<00:05:24.360> is<00:05:24.540> the<00:05:24.630> easiest

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
switch as a clocks this is the easiest

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.100 
switch as a clocks this is the easiest
one<00:05:25.230> attack<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:25.920> it<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:26.490> very<00:05:26.910> simple<00:05:27.300> that

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
one attack and it is very simple that

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.620 
one attack and it is very simple that
all<00:05:28.380> we<00:05:28.650> would<00:05:28.830> do<00:05:29.010> is<00:05:29.700> we<00:05:29.970> would<00:05:30.000> disconnect

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
all we would do is we would disconnect

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.290 
all we would do is we would disconnect
the<00:05:30.840> switch<00:05:31.430> while<00:05:32.430> we're<00:05:32.670> monitoring<00:05:33.120> the

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
the switch while we're monitoring the

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.870 
the switch while we're monitoring the
