00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.230
 hello welcome to a new channel in 

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:08.189
 which now I bring you an application 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.130
 for all those who are the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.070
 players of the core 2 or any type 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.609
 by carlos guti in which basically 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.859
 we can fix what are our 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.369
 statistical characteristics 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.989
 classes and so on for those who are the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.179
 Argentina and I do not remember what other 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:31.259
 country the application in the sector is 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.940
 blocked depends on the country then here 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.570
 down in the distribution of villa let 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.640
 a link where you can download the app and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.550
 then with a browser files like 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.410
 can be star for example simply 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.410
 we look for it in the root and richard a 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.570
 what seen elite later in the 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.030
 desktop as it is in the application and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.510
 The first thing we find is going to be 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.220
 a tab that asks for the account of 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.830
 those who take into account him and 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.410
 just look with that and those who do not 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.940
 have afterwards but if you want, I'll leave you 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.530
 a link where they can enter the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.450
 good fight page basically the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.450
 application is the same as we see 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.170
 the same thing we see on the page 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.530
 blender 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:31.220
 optimized for cell phone up 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:36.340
 we really have to be 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:39.110
 captives two by three and it is to regulate 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.560
 then we can put here what 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.780
 we want the games I have the others 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.060
 multiple formations after 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 that shows competitions that there are in 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.560
 progress though they should go and videos of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.560
 elite 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:06.090
 we have also 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.649
 Calculator to see the level 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.679
 that we were when you music for 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.650
 prestige 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.380
 all that statistics are hours 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.840
 plays 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.540
 we can also modify our 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.140
 lessons 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.340
 because in the times 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.340
 they are welcome welcome 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.650
 more now we have all our classes 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.880
 more than more than this nothing and then 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.880
 we can modify them 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:45.720
 he says he grew me already dancing 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.579
 and the leagues challenges recent games 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.579
 we can know how it went 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.550
 vibrations in case I do not agree to law or 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.500
 to see here the challenges 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.980
 because I'm playing and I remember that 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.450
 I had to mourn the first option 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.150
 which are the closest challenges already 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.070
 when the fixed what we're going to see and to 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.170
 finish the game of follow savings 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.000
 time later pressing here in the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.760
 we can mark it white and 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.920
 end one tab every above us 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.540
 sample 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.819
 what we have what we have to mark 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.909
 no need to go and look for everything 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.930
 well basically this is I hope that they 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:34.659
 I liked that I followed favorite better 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.129
