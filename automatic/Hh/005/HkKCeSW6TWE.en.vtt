your<00:03:39.190> body<00:03:39.489> weight<00:03:39.730> but<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.030> ultra<00:03:40.269> G<00:03:40.480> is

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
your body weight but the ultra G is

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.250 
your body weight but the ultra G is
basically<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:42.579> piece<00:03:43.209> of<00:03:43.359> equipment<00:03:43.870> it's<00:03:44.079> a

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
basically a piece of equipment it's a

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.680 
basically a piece of equipment it's a
treadmill<00:03:44.829> that<00:03:45.310> allows<00:03:45.609> either<00:03:45.819> a<00:03:45.970> run<00:03:46.299> with

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
treadmill that allows either a run with

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.569 
treadmill that allows either a run with
less<00:03:47.019> than<00:03:47.319> 100<00:03:47.530> percent<00:03:47.829> of<00:03:48.099> body<00:03:48.250> weight<00:03:48.549> I

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
less than 100 percent of body weight I

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.970 
less than 100 percent of body weight I
believe<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:48.970> goes<00:03:49.120> down<00:03:49.359> to<00:03:49.630> as<00:03:49.720> low<00:03:49.959> as<00:03:49.989> a<00:03:50.139> 40%

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
believe it goes down to as low as a 40%

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.190 
believe it goes down to as low as a 40%
body<00:03:51.220> weight<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.790> allows<00:03:52.120> us<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.599> get<00:03:53.019> in

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
body weight it allows us to get in

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.069 
body weight it allows us to get in
conditioning<00:03:53.980> sooner<00:03:54.970> much<00:03:55.630> sooner<00:03:55.840> than<00:03:56.049> he

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
conditioning sooner much sooner than he

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.270 
conditioning sooner much sooner than he
would<00:03:56.410> later<00:03:56.799> so<00:03:57.669> from<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.180> conditioning<00:03:58.720> stand

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
would later so from a conditioning stand

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.490 
would later so from a conditioning stand
he<00:03:59.490> gets<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.790> cardiovascular<00:04:00.510> exercise<00:04:00.900> he

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
he gets the cardiovascular exercise he

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.440 
he gets the cardiovascular exercise he
retrains<00:04:02.130> his<00:04:02.400> running<00:04:02.820> pattern

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
retrains his running pattern

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.050 
retrains his running pattern
he<00:04:03.840> gets<00:04:04.020> up<00:04:04.140> his<00:04:04.290> leg<00:04:04.560> speed<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.730> then<00:04:05.850> at<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
he gets up his leg speed and then at the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.960 
he gets up his leg speed and then at the
same<00:04:06.240> time<00:04:06.300> we're<00:04:07.170> slowly<00:04:07.590> gradually<00:04:08.040> loading

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970

his<00:04:09.120> knee<00:04:09.330> getting<00:04:09.630> it<00:04:09.810> used<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.380> that<00:04:10.650> feel

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
his knee getting it used to that feel

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.120 
his knee getting it used to that feel
that<00:04:11.460> impact<00:04:11.960> during<00:04:12.960> the<00:04:13.140> rehab<00:04:13.470> process<00:04:13.740> our

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
that impact during the rehab process our

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.890 
that impact during the rehab process our
players<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.670> go<00:04:14.850> through<00:04:15.240> a<00:04:15.420> progression

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
players have to go through a progression

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.539 
players have to go through a progression
where<00:04:16.200> they're<00:04:16.350> proving<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.890> themselves<00:04:17.280> in

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
where they're proving to themselves in

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.610 
where they're proving to themselves in
different<00:04:17.700> stages<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.269> training<00:04:18.630> that

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
different stages of training that

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.140 
different stages of training that
they're<00:04:19.769> prepared<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.310> get<00:04:20.489> back<00:04:20.700> out<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:20.940> the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
they're prepared to get back out to the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.420 
they're prepared to get back out to the
field<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:22.170> the<00:04:22.800> work<00:04:22.980> we<00:04:23.130> did<00:04:23.250> in<00:04:23.310> the

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
field and so the work we did in the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.910 
field and so the work we did in the
weight<00:04:23.610> room<00:04:23.640> was<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:24.570> progression<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.380> lower

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
weight room was a progression of lower

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.070 
weight room was a progression of lower
body<00:04:26.130> training<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:27.420> that<00:04:27.570> he<00:04:27.660> can<00:04:27.810> reestablish

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
body training so that he can reestablish

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.690 
body training so that he can reestablish
the<00:04:28.470> strength<00:04:28.890> in<00:04:29.010> his<00:04:29.100> knee<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:29.430> he<00:04:29.520> had

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
the strength in his knee that he had

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.760 
the strength in his knee that he had
prior<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.390> injury<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.900> then<00:04:31.530> we're<00:04:31.680> gonna

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
prior to the injury and then we're gonna

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.800 
prior to the injury and then we're gonna
go<00:04:31.980> out<00:04:32.160> onto<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.490> field<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:33.030> progress<00:04:33.690> it

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
go out onto the field and progress it

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.210 
go out onto the field and progress it
into<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.080> running<00:04:34.440> format<00:04:34.860> where<00:04:35.010> he's<00:04:35.100> running

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
into a running format where he's running

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.070 
into a running format where he's running
straight<00:04:35.640> ahead<00:04:35.760> and<00:04:36.180> then<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.840> cut

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
straight ahead and then a cut

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.909 
straight ahead and then a cut
progression<00:04:37.669> ultimately<00:04:38.669> leading<00:04:39.540> to

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
progression ultimately leading to

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.350 
progression ultimately leading to
position<00:04:40.919> specific<00:04:41.430> movements<00:04:41.940> that<00:04:42.210> he's

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
position specific movements that he's

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.850 
position specific movements that he's
gonna<00:04:42.450> need<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.690> execute<00:04:43.140> and<00:04:43.410> practice

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
gonna need to execute and practice

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.409 
gonna need to execute and practice
before<00:04:44.250> he'd<00:04:44.520> ever<00:04:44.610> get<00:04:44.760> a<00:04:44.820> chance<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.210> do<00:04:45.330> it

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
before he'd ever get a chance to do it

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.300 
before he'd ever get a chance to do it
in<00:04:45.480> the<00:04:45.540> game<00:04:45.660> this<00:04:46.410> week<00:04:46.680> we've<00:04:46.890> really<00:04:47.160> tried

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
in the game this week we've really tried

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.180 
in the game this week we've really tried
