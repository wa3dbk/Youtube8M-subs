00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
early to mid 40s well this thing has

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.210 
early to mid 40s well this thing has
been<00:01:12.659> sitting<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> flea<00:01:13.590> market<00:01:14.040> for

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
been sitting at the flea market for

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.580 
been sitting at the flea market for
months<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.880> when<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> first<00:01:15.360> saw<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.930> was<00:01:16.229> in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
months and when I first saw it it was in

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.820 
months and when I first saw it it was in
its<00:01:17.040> original<00:01:17.340> finish<00:01:18.110> but<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> guess<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.619> guys

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
its original finish but I guess the guys

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.580 
its original finish but I guess the guys
selling<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.720> thought<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:21.990> move<00:01:22.140> quicker

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
selling it thought it would move quicker

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.670 
selling it thought it would move quicker
if<00:01:22.860> he<00:01:23.009> did<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.759> crap<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> cabinet<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.380> he

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
if he did this crap to the cabinet so he

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.590 
if he did this crap to the cabinet so he
did<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.869> it<00:01:27.869> still<00:01:28.229> sat<00:01:28.590> there<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.009> then

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
did that and it still sat there and then

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.499 
did that and it still sat there and then
today<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> got<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.200> cheap<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:32.240> told<00:01:33.240> him<00:01:33.390> I
