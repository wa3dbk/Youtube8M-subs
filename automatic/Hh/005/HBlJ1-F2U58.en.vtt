what<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.190> know<00:02:24.310> what<00:02:24.640> escape<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.240> right<00:02:25.870> um

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
what I know what escape that is right um

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.770 
what I know what escape that is right um
well<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.490> last<00:02:27.670> couple<00:02:27.910> years<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.450> image

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
well in the last couple years that image

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.080 
well in the last couple years that image
is<00:02:28.900> pretty<00:02:29.140> much<00:02:29.290> fading<00:02:29.620> away<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.670> reason

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
is pretty much fading away the reason

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.790 
is pretty much fading away the reason
the<00:02:31.210> less<00:02:31.390> train<00:02:31.690> did<00:02:31.900> kind<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.260> thing<00:02:32.440> right

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
the less train did kind of thing right

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.980 
the less train did kind of thing right
definitely<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.580> some<00:02:33.880> carried<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:34.720> image

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
definitely it some carried that image

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.110 
definitely it some carried that image
based<00:02:35.320> because<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.950> public<00:02:36.400> sees<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.880> kids

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
based because the public sees the kids

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.210 
based because the public sees the kids
that<00:02:37.420> hang<00:02:38.200> out<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.650> corners<00:02:39.070> are

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
that hang out on the corners are

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.220 
that hang out on the corners are
actually<00:02:39.580> just<00:02:40.090> punked<00:02:40.600> but<00:02:40.840> they<00:02:40.990> use<00:02:41.200> a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
actually just punked but they use a

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.170 
actually just punked but they use a
skateboard<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.010> ask<00:02:42.100> transportation<00:02:43.030> and
