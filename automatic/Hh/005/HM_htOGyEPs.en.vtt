in<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> knot<00:00:25.920> there<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.609> take<00:00:26.640> it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
in the knot there so you can take it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.710 
in the knot there so you can take it
right<00:00:27.090> under<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.109> bring<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.380> back<00:00:28.590> as<00:00:29.720> we

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
right under and bring it back as we

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.389 
right under and bring it back as we
coming<00:00:31.019> over<00:00:31.489> put<00:00:32.489> your<00:00:32.520> crankin<00:00:33.320> do<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.590> lazy

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
coming over put your crankin do a lazy

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.950 
coming over put your crankin do a lazy
loop<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.000> then<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:37.140> your<00:00:37.200> tight<00:00:37.500> loops<00:00:38.960> going

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
loop and then do your tight loops going

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.889 
loop and then do your tight loops going
around<00:00:40.340> three<00:00:41.340> times<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.940> all<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.360> lazy<00:00:42.600> loop

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
around three times and all the lazy loop

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.010 
around three times and all the lazy loop
is<00:00:43.140> important<00:00:43.649> because<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.010> does<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.340> holding

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
is important because it does the holding

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.340 
is important because it does the holding
to<00:00:46.020> break<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.969> get<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.120> gang<00:00:48.809> round<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
to break it get the gang round like the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.990 
to break it get the gang round like the
tail<00:00:49.590> rotor<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> helicopter<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.760> piece

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
tail rotor on a helicopter that piece

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.549 
tail rotor on a helicopter that piece
just<00:00:51.329> start<00:00:51.570> slowly<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.960> flick<00:00:52.230> up<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
just start slowly and flick up and you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350 
just start slowly and flick up and you
get<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> nice<00:00:52.920> smooth<00:00:53.340> break-in<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
get a nice smooth break-in up with a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.760 
get a nice smooth break-in up with a
good<00:00:54.570> knot<00:00:55.460> put<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> insulator<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.649> needs<00:00:58.649> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
good knot put the insulator on needs to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.959 
good knot put the insulator on needs to
come<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.129> about<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.940> five<00:01:00.270> from<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> post

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
come out about one to five from the post

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:08.140 
come out about one to five from the post
so<00:01:02.969> cut<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> wire<00:01:03.570> leaving<00:01:03.899> plenty<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.710> spit

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.640 

to<00:01:09.150> gauge<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.689> insulators<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.530> they

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to gauge with the insulators go so they

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.170 
to gauge with the insulators go so they
look<00:01:10.830> nice<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.220> even<00:01:11.310> down<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> post<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
look nice and even down the post if you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.960 
look nice and even down the post if you
save<00:01:12.540> doing<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.900> five<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.350> electric<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.400> put

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
save doing a five or electric if you put

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
save doing a five or electric if you put
your<00:01:15.060> hand<00:01:15.360> there<00:01:15.509> stick<00:01:15.990> your<00:01:16.170> thumb<00:01:16.380> out<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
your hand there stick your thumb out and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.320 
your hand there stick your thumb out and
bend<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.310> around<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.270> on

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
bend it around and if you do that on

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.030 
bend it around and if you do that on
each<00:01:18.600> why<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:19.170> all<00:01:19.350> come<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.860> same

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
each why they all come out the same

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.149 
each why they all come out the same
distance<00:01:21.200> slide<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> insulator<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:25.159> bring

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
distance slide the insulator on bring

with your right hand then give it a bend
it<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.020> bend<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.470> back<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.920> now<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.400> pulling

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it and bend it back and now it's pulling

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
it and bend it back and now it's pulling
off<00:01:41.850> dead<00:01:42.570> center<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.110> want<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.470> important

off dead center you want it's important

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.899 
off dead center you want it's important
it's<00:01:43.979> pulling<00:01:44.250> off<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.520> middle<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> the

it's pulling off the middle of the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:58.600 
it's pulling off the middle of the
insulator<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.590> do<00:01:46.590> six<00:01:46.920> tight<00:01:47.159> wraps

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.860 

and<00:01:59.090> again<00:01:59.450> just<00:02:01.090> from<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.240> wire<00:02:02.420> over<00:02:02.630> and

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
and again just from the wire over and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.870 
and again just from the wire over and
get<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.290> nice<00:02:03.530> clean<00:02:04.280> break

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
get a nice clean break

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.990 
get a nice clean break
so<00:02:05.510> that<00:02:05.980> don't<00:02:06.980> want<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.220> insulator<00:02:07.580> too<00:02:07.790> far

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
so that don't want the insulator too far

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.359 
so that don't want the insulator too far
