00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.579
 it seems impossible calibur verse broken from the movement and think that we are 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.579
 before an exclusive game for psp 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.630
 three sections 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.800
 bandarÃ­n namco has been able to condense into a one emits a new 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.810
 delivery of the saga solca libor offering a quality very similar to 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:33.940
 the previous ones with scenarios and characters that leave us speechless 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.920
 for its load this waltz and counting on the fast fluidity of movements for 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.530
 that the room has accustomed us 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.400
 In those battles they must also be given as a chador, since each one has 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.180
 his own fighting style 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.300
 you have to know how to master the defense and powerful attacks 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.300
 all this is possible using a very intuitive control that allows us to perform 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.350
 our first battles 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.630
 pd2 will force adair memorizing the attacks and how it is more forceful if 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.960
 we do not want to be killed at the minimum 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.960
 or cast out of the king 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.250
 the roster of almost 30 fighters include the legendary backs in addition to 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.030
 dampier fighter with a curious fighting style 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.380
 and as a special guest, pleasingly pivoted for 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.790
 to annoy a little or how are the star characters of the delivery 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.980
 we are not going to show it in this video noses 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.710
 in general the fighters are fairly well balanced in terms of 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.740
 power attack reference special attacks 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.210
 although there will always be characters that adapt our game style better 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.850
 the editor's plot allows us to create our own fighter even our 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.310
 own weapons 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.770
 let's check winning battles if we add the rank of victories we do not want 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.350
 you are for the characters 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.740
 like new clothes and weapons 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.680
 we also get medals other ugly and complex certain conditions 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.800
 battles won consecutively perfect followed will shoot x enemies of the 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.550
 Rin etc. 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 the only thing that seems strange to us are the game modes 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.650
 well that way in that way and in an arcade way 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.360
 we have an exhibition tutorial and the glove a kind of story 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.859
 particular of each fighter 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.679
 which we are presented with brief tests to overcome a final combat 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.209
 which proved quite repetitive the tests and cut by what lasts each 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.429
 one of the thirty chapters 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:30.569
 luckily we want the challenges or certain tests against other fighters 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.500
 and that also 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.199
 they expropriate these 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.799
 only calibur broken destiny is an exclusive fighting game for psp 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.159
 that if it were not for the lack of more usual game modes in the rear 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.119
 we would have put him more a hospital
