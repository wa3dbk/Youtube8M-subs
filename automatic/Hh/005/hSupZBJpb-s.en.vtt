00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.110
 peter kenyon martin is recording your 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.650
 my angel rafael vanzim returns 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.549
 on here 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.670
 people contacted the service 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.460
 the angel Hello 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.320
 in today's video I came to explain why 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.369
 and I do not answer all the questions 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.060
 on Youtube 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.429
 I answer 99% of the questions and because 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.340
 if it corresponds precisely to its 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.780
 good time the main reason you did not 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.620
 to have answered this question is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.410
 Following 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.350
 sometimes the person does not authorize 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.300
 answer on that google her plan 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.340
 google plus is the deal is along with 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.559
 youtube is type your account on youtube and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.230
 There are people who do not authorize the answer. 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.930
 maybe just left a question and in time 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.949
 does not have that option 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.629
 reply 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.629
 I'll file below you're seeing 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.580
 so the first reason is that the person 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.380
 not authorized in response to iverson 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.850
 same giant period and I think I left 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.380
 on the boat but it is not 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.360
 many times I even try on the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.399
 person answer there but sometimes also 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.659
 is blocked at last the first thing 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.780
 What do you want to have your question? 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.940
 answered is to check that you have authorized 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.920
 answer on google books 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.560
 the second reason is that sometimes the person 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.780
 leave obvious questions or questions 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.979
 so they find it easily in gugu 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.380
 brenna type is cordial meeting reason such 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.850
 to buy this kind of question 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.909
 people can be on google and china 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.060
 imposed brenna on the websites when trying to ration 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.819
 Look, I only had the channel today. 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.560
 40,000 subscribers today 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.270
 because it 's time more than two thousand 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.069
 subscribed per month then some 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.319
 months will have more people 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.720
 so the channel has a lot of people 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.959
 so that it does not respond to all 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.360
 questions just for you to have a notion 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:05.670
 youtube arrive about 120 pms per 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.560
 day out and a half off the terms of 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.550
 facebook off people leaving question 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.869
 on Instagram 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.610
 something else that I'm going to take advantage of for 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.610
 ask not to leave questions in the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.010
 instagram because it is ill will I am not 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.290
 because the instagram I know who uses it should already 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.660
 have seen the instagram it does not give all 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.940
 the updates then it is sometimes is 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.459
 try a person on your profile 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.860
 instagram and enjoy 200 usual photos and 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.930
 come in there's so- and-so 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.819
 constituting a flower are only authorized 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.860
 of that person and sony with these 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.629
 updates so if the person leaves me 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.640
 ask and other pictures I can not 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.280
 see then is not ill will boy for 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.110
 I'll repeat it here, do not ever let it go 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.480
 Would you ask if you want to comment? 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.590
 instagram photos leave comments and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.810
 Great, but it was a question. 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.250
 mainly an important gain not 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.000
 leave there because you end up not getting 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.690
 came then as I was saying in tone 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 of 120 cars per day on youtube has the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.400
 it's instagram questions that I do not 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.590
 able to respond to one - and-a-half events 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.470

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.840
 keep box on facebook so people are a lot 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.819
 thing no idea 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.730
 and people can not imagine but I do not 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.550
 live of collapse quotes yes is the channel of 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.530
 youtube is a hobby the work has other 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.060
 things to do throughout the day then 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.220
 does not spend all day in front of the 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.739
 computer answering questions and from there 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.799
 because I'm talking all this because it's 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.150
 The more questions you have, the more I understand. 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.120
 I arrived at home sometimes at night. 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.790
 has the metal tas no idea and then I 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.620
 end of the b-type hazard in which 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.019
 that usually puts this theme is not 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.840
 as with a conquest not ventou cites 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.000
 each city is a price each type psi has 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.370
 a price depends on the seller anyway then 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.569
 this kind of question I'll finish the 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.310
 because I'm going to prioritize the 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.170
 questions that I can actually help 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.410
 People like I said there are people who 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.120
 Lets ask is obvious on youtube already 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.280
 have had some questions people you do not have 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.870
 so they believe it when I do not believe 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.790

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.049

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.959
 underwater 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.060
 so I want to neither answer 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.370
 not give an answer in the case of people 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.829
 So there's something I believe in. 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.889

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.360
 these people understood then the 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.200
 so random questions will end 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.330
 jumping 6 I'm sorry so this is it 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.139
 if the person has not authorized on google if it is 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.830
 one question is, does not the question find it easy on 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.349

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.919
 my best as I said I do not live on 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.300
 so I try to help the 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.090
 people at most 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.160

 But that's it, folks, I'll keep doing it. 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.280
 my best tale with the understanding and 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.680
 collaboration is if you can 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.479
 also be more objective 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.310
 dips in the doubts that there are people who 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.590
 Let's pop out of your mom stayed half 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.400
 just to read there to answer yes or 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.259
 not 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.330
 so if you could also collaborate 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.560
 and be more objective in the mouth questions 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.210
 also be very 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.580
 this is smaller to enlarge and help 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:38.139
 Everyone here on the channel, that's it. 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:41.009
