00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
like we made it compatible with the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.910 
like we made it compatible with the
Genesis<00:01:17.070> because<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.690> looks<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.380> lot<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.710> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
Genesis because it looks a lot like that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
Genesis because it looks a lot like that
signature<00:01:20.399> or<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.940> looks<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.390> lot<00:01:21.600> like

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
signature or it looks like a lot like

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
signature or it looks like a lot like

even on the selection screen and which

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.010 
even on the selection screen and which
leads<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.820> being<00:01:33.090> better<00:01:33.360> than<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.659> NES

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
leads this to being better than the NES

like<00:01:53.720> I<00:01:53.810> say<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.140> controls<00:01:54.500> are<00:01:54.710> really<00:01:55.990> good

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
like I say the controls are really good

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
like I say the controls are really good
for<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.820> genesis<00:01:58.820> game<00:01:59.920> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
for a genesis game you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.390 
for a genesis game you
and<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.260> I<00:02:04.290> said<00:02:04.590> they<00:02:04.680> used<00:02:04.710> most<00:02:05.190> of

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
and the like I said they used most of

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.540 
and the like I said they used most of
the<00:02:05.660> things<00:02:06.660> um<00:02:07.050> there's<00:02:07.440> nothing<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.310> can't

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the things um there's nothing I can't

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.669 
the things um there's nothing I can't
think<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.270> don't<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.840> an<00:02:10.200> arcade

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
think of that they don't have an arcade

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.570 
think of that they don't have an arcade
version<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:13.740> ladies<00:02:14.100> chasing

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
version you have the ladies chasing

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.370 
version you have the ladies chasing
after<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.690> dogs<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.620> everything

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
after you and the dogs and everything
