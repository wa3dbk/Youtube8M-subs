00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.020
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.580
 video therefore as announced earlier 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.370
 on twitter we go to talk about the new 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.139
 galaxy s 6 presented earlier the first 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.919
 barcelona world dance congress 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.660
 then today Sunday 1st March 2015 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.920
 therefore new top of the range home 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.630
 samsung presents many of the 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.179
 features we have that 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.859
 we have already seen over months ago 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.179
 speculation and varied stuff had 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.820
 many confirmations with that one device 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.499
 which still seems to me appealing 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.990
 however, I do not recommend immediate purchase vi 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.370
 I'll explain a little while trying not to 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.700
 I will dwell too much then we have a 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.920
 available two variants of the s6 led 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.600
 with takes curved display from both 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.060
 so I think sides to consider if 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.740
 you have an interest in this new new one 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.710
 kind of let's say phone move too 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.260
 of screen and s6 flat the one there that 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.940
 we see on the left that it takes 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.040
 standard display without details 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.660
 differences obviously 19 well to specify 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.610
 integrates all the functions seen on notes 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.250
 and therefore also the use of the display 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.360
 curved for different types of uses that 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.950
 can also be useful for 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.220
 save battery to check 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.040
 right time or read the text of the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.350
 sms to escape to point out well that the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.000
 two technical sheets we have in front are 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.390
 exactly the same only changes the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.030
 50 milan battery for and nothing else 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.110
 if I remember correctly 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.930
 let's start immediately with the analysis of the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.790
 technical sheet specifying however side 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.250
 personal that I had seen the body and 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.200
 with the photos there that came out in 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.000
 week and it obviously seems to me like 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.260
 the iPhone 6 seeing the complete product 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.870
 let's say I stayed good or bad 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.390
 satisfied it seems to me a good phone 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.010
 I hope I don't recommend the purchase as soon as it comes out 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.600
 I will obviously explain why 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.479
 then we start birth technical data sheet 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.100
 all the lavas the connectivity is the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.690
 usually the phone will be released on April 10th 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.390
 in 20 countries and if I am not mistaken, Italy 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.100
 included and between all dimensions all 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.810
 remains early and it is right to mention 7 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 mm thick rest anyway 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.840
 you can read it as always there 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.520
 I leave linking screen description 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.530
 corning gorilla glass 4 then 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.229
 extremely durable, always super 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.970
 amoled and is introduced with a 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.210
 diagonal smaller then of 5.1 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.869
 inches equal to 5 the resolution 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.659
 share happens so let's see 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.870
 do with a density of 577 pixels per 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:17.390
 thumbs over 60 to 84 then 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.970
 an unprecedented solution 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.560
 compatible with the payment system 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.379
 samsung which has just been presented 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.299
 however, let's call them payment 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.530
 so you can do all the information 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.810
 also on the official website page 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.920
 of the samsung you will find here I leave you the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.209
 link in description hard on the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.340
 phone is described as the not 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.680
 plus ultra pro there is a nice summary with 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.680
 all the main features 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:46.220
 therefore an android 5.0 operating system 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.709
 I'll talk about it in a moment and chipset 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.970
 exynos 74 20 as mentioned above 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.409
 there is no compatibility with it 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.579
 snapdragon 810 then fans s6 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.409
 will come in a single variant for the 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.709
 so now this here with system on 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.780
 a proprietary samsung chip and then 20 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.489
 we will have two quad core processors for one 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.769
 opta runs totally with architecture 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.540
 bit.ly or use the quad core more 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.129
 slow for fairly simple calculation 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.590
 as soon as the phone put me under 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:16.099
 active effort also the other four 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.359
 valid gpu core 760 to evaluate the 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.220
 all we can do is wait for the gods 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.419
 benchmark but surely data will come out 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.329
 which will show a good level 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:29.269
 performance also because we talk about 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:32.209
 new system on a chip with process of 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.620
 14-nanometer and 64-bit production 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.750
 therefore repentant 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.599
 there is a hint of the future also in this 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.209
 system on a memory chip variant 32 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.620
 64 128 gigabytes it is worth pointing out that 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.930
 the first point is that there is no slot for 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.220
 microsd however always had good to specify 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.919
 that anyway with a memory of this 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.480
 like there is little to do I never have 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.760
 i had no space problems i don't think 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.329
 we will also have it in this case 3 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.060
 gigabyte of ram ddr 4 then launched 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:02.299
 also this court on the new one 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.449
 more performance- generating camera 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.220
 16 megapixel optical stabilization 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.989
 4k video as it was shown 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.540
 we speak in excellent camera a great one 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.040
 color rendering and ok we talk about the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.750
 presentation look forward to the real tests e 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.650
 then the following is a sensor 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.539
 that will be really performing 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.130
 5 megapixel front camera I can 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.520
 also make videos in full hd found 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.979
 here 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.879
 all the info then as always the last one 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.800
 wifi the latest bluetooth the latest gps 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.449
 the last thing to say is that a cons 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.659
 practically we will have two more batteries 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.330
 little ones at 2550 capacity level 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:40.250
 milan for and 2600 but the thing that really 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.810
 I don't like it is the fact that we have 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.659
 a non- removable battery then 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.180
 that's the one we have to keep ourselves for 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:49.099
 the whole duration of the phone to for the 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.659
 samsung memory from even more than 100 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.690
 gigabytes on juan drive for two years 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:55.699
 so you have infinite space on the cloud 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.090
 gradient without any kind of problem 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:03.650
 therefore the fact and the battery is from and to 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.780
 mark because we could incur 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.789
 obviously from the fury of using the 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.319
 phone in performance drops we have 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.389
 to do with a phone a top up 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.810
 ultra-fast even faster than 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.639
 that of the known 4 is recharged and enjoys 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.830
 great autonomy samsung has spoken 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.990
 of four hours of autonomy with 10 per 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.729
 one hundred charges and also compatibility 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.940
 with wireless recharge who pre orders the 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.169
 phone will have the kit with the gift 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.819
 wireless charging base that 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.860
 however it was also quite fast 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:33.139
 with half an hour charge the 20 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.440
 percent if I'm not mistaken then 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.529
 it has practically been studied will also be 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.360
 been calibrated in terms of consumption 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.099
 this we can touch with hand with the 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.330
 first tests eg red-hot 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.219
 there has been samsung's commitment to 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.659
 optimize consumption and therefore maintain 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:52.430
 even the thickness with a battery of 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:54.740
 then it is better to speak less 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.029
 finally the operating system for all 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.099
 however the information I invite you to 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.900
 talk linking description a lot 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.729
 we simply have more flavor 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.229
 a breeze and was also made a 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.969
 comparison with the iPhone that I don't want 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.250
 that I don't want to go into 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.449
 you can student find videos online 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.360
 anyway we have a review 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.800
 full touch wiz the samsung in 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.610
 material design and it seemed like a lot 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.889
 nice 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.650
 extremely fast response times 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:22.080
 however very colorful screen screens 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.460
 excellent color rendering and pleasant from the 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.340
 my point of view also from 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.509
 use both as in 84 but maybe also 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.610
 a little bit more than it is therefore 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.139
 a new product advice was not 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.759
 this just came out though there 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.919
 they give the wireless base that 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.039
 we are talking about a price that knows about 7 7 7 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:39.689
 49 so why should the model 32 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.370
 so the standard one 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:43.590
 we look for a bit of balance 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:48.779
 it became an ascent that we come and a phone 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:50.550
 pinch of balance between the phone 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.439
 which we want to never leave e 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.000
 buy this new top of the range 

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.500
 at the beginning the prices will be high though 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.539
 definitely online already at the exit 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.370
 we will find some strict offer 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.689
 we will follow everything in case I signal it 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.180
 something by finding something good about 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:04.800
 twitter and prefers from my point of 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.590
 given the online purchase that surely 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.349
 he said special offers will come out 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.580
 this is how much for the galaxy s 6 to be able 

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:13.469
 go and find videos and learn more 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.060
 I repeat on the net to go and see later 

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:16.650
 the one on which this device aims 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.259
 however the features beyond the 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.080
 of the excellent technical card really the 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:24.000
 user experience and new 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.110
 features designed specifically for this 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.580
 device 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.370
 I repeat, however, if you are interested 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.990
 to buy a device and could 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.319
 be the right device to do 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.419
 this is my leap from my point of
