00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
the DVI connector as we talked about

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.200 
the DVI connector as we talked about
earlier<00:01:35.020> now<00:01:35.890> we've<00:01:36.159> got<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.490> other<00:01:36.729> end<00:01:37.060> of

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
earlier now we've got the other end of

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.969 
earlier now we've got the other end of
the<00:01:37.299> USB<00:01:37.420> cable<00:01:37.720> we're<00:01:38.080> gonna<00:01:38.170> plug<00:01:38.560> right

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
the USB cable we're gonna plug right

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.240 
the USB cable we're gonna plug right
into<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.640> laptop<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.390> we<00:01:40.479> should<00:01:41.250> very

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
into the laptop and we should very

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.420 
into the laptop and we should very
quickly<00:01:42.549> see<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.110> iPad<00:01:44.110> screen<00:01:44.289> there<00:01:45.159> we<00:01:45.250> go

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
quickly see the iPad screen there we go

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.870 
quickly see the iPad screen there we go
on<00:01:45.780> my<00:01:46.780> laptop<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:47.800> so<00:01:47.979> if<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.340> go<00:01:48.520> back<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.789> the

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
on my laptop and so if I go back to the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.730 
on my laptop and so if I go back to the
iPad<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.270> start<00:01:49.720> scrolling<00:01:50.020> through<00:01:50.440> you'll

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
iPad and start scrolling through you'll

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.510 
iPad and start scrolling through you'll
see<00:01:51.039> that<00:01:51.280> it's<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.580> near<00:01:51.909> instant<00:01:52.600> reaction<00:01:53.520> on

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
see that it's a near instant reaction on

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.010 
see that it's a near instant reaction on
my<00:01:54.970> laptop<00:01:55.479> screen<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.500> so<00:01:56.590> I'm<00:01:56.740> just<00:01:56.920> using

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
my laptop screen and so I'm just using

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.969 
my laptop screen and so I'm just using
Flipboard<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.200> just<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.500> kind<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.740> show<00:01:59.799> you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
Flipboard and just to kind of show you

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.399

some<00:02:00.369> you<00:02:00.850> know<00:02:00.940> house<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.360> browse<00:02:01.750> an<00:02:01.990> app<00:02:02.170> so

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
some you know house you browse an app so

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.719 
some you know house you browse an app so
this<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.740> obviously<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:03.159> great<00:02:03.399> tool<00:02:03.700> for
