00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.880 

okay<00:00:01.020> next<00:00:01.500> part<00:00:01.800> I<00:00:02.720> have<00:00:03.720> added<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.230> coloring

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
okay next part I have added the coloring

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.480 
okay next part I have added the coloring
and<00:00:06.440> it's<00:00:07.440> okay<00:00:08.340> so<00:00:09.269> its<00:00:09.420> function<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.490> pretty

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
and it's okay so its function is pretty

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.169 
and it's okay so its function is pretty
much<00:00:12.259> the<00:00:13.259> same<00:00:13.559> as<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.219> peat<00:00:14.519> moss<00:00:14.700> apart

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
much the same as the peat moss apart

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.820 
much the same as the peat moss apart
from<00:00:15.330> not<00:00:16.039> not<00:00:17.039> affecting<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.550> pH<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> has

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
from not not affecting the pH and so has

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.500 
from not not affecting the pH and so has
a<00:00:19.859> high<00:00:20.100> C<00:00:20.720> CEC<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.550> it<00:00:23.550> will<00:00:23.789> hold<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.300> to

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
a high C CEC and it will hold on to

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.870 
a high C CEC and it will hold on to
nutrients<00:00:25.050> I'm<00:00:26.269> again<00:00:27.269> I'll<00:00:27.539> put<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
nutrients I'm again I'll put the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.690 
nutrients I'm again I'll put the
definition<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.029> CEC<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.140> more<00:00:32.099> explained<00:00:32.489> one

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
definition for CEC a more explained one

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.780 
definition for CEC a more explained one
I'm<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.960> description<00:00:37.010> you<00:00:38.010> know<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.640> can

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
I'm in the description you know you can

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.170 
I'm in the description you know you can
use<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.420> its<00:00:39.570> own<00:00:39.809> without<00:00:41.180> without

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
use this on its own without without

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600 
use this on its own without without
without<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.870> peat<00:00:43.170> moss<00:00:43.350> without<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.129> Osmo

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
without the peat moss without the Osmo

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.630 
without the peat moss without the Osmo
card<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.539> again<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.710> does<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.129> contain<00:00:47.579> any

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
card but again it does not contain any

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.630 
card but again it does not contain any
nutrients<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.559> people<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:50.460> do

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
nutrients so what people can do

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.209 
nutrients so what people can do
sometimes<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:52.370> set<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:54.199> excuse<00:00:55.199> me<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.620> set

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
sometimes is set it up excuse me and set

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.389 
sometimes is set it up excuse me and set
it<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.750> those<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.649> tank<00:01:00.800> with<00:01:01.800> nutrients

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it up and those the tank with nutrients

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.329 
it up and those the tank with nutrients
from<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.619> column<00:01:04.619> nutrient<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.159> liquid

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
from a column nutrient so liquid

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.469 
from a column nutrient so liquid
fertilizer<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.110> put<00:01:08.240> root<00:01:09.240> tabs

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
fertilizer or they can put root tabs

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.840 
fertilizer or they can put root tabs
underneath<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.140> basically<00:01:11.130> when<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> nutrient

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
underneath and basically when a nutrient

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.050 
underneath and basically when a nutrient
neutral<00:01:12.360> ill<00:01:12.540> absorb<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> nutrients<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
neutral ill absorb the nutrients and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.630 
neutral ill absorb the nutrients and
release<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.049> slowly<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.650> roots<00:01:16.920> again<00:01:17.220> so

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
release it slowly for the roots again so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.100 
release it slowly for the roots again so
I've<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.600> two<00:01:18.900> layers<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.380> mean<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:21.630> peat

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
I've kind of two layers I mean the peat

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.660 
I've kind of two layers I mean the peat
moss<00:01:22.140> might<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.740> unnecessary<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:24.170> whatever

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
moss might be unnecessary but whatever

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.490 
moss might be unnecessary but whatever
it's<00:01:26.670> an<00:01:26.820> experiment<00:01:27.479> um<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> yeah<00:01:30.780> hope<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it's an experiment um so yeah hope it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.920 
it's an experiment um so yeah hope it
will<00:01:31.619> last<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> long<00:01:32.280> time

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
will last for a long time

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.140 
will last for a long time
honestly<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.200> want<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> non-clumping<00:01:35.400> run

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
honestly you want the non-clumping run

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
honestly you want the non-clumping run
the<00:01:36.270> non<00:01:36.450> clump<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.930> ones<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:39.140> use<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.860> use

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
the non clump in ones and I use I use

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.649 
the non clump in ones and I use I use
this<00:01:41.990> brand

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.260 

I<00:01:47.149> used<00:01:49.009> low<00:01:50.009> dust<00:01:50.310> lightweight<00:01:50.700> color<00:01:50.939> from

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
I used low dust lightweight color from

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.399 
I used low dust lightweight color from
Tesco's<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.920> perfumed<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.840> smell<00:01:55.259> is

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
Tesco's it is perfumed and that smell is

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.910 
Tesco's it is perfumed and that smell is
rotten<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:56.340> opinion<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.939> mean<00:01:57.409> you<00:01:58.409> know<00:01:58.560> why

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
rotten in my opinion I mean you know why

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.279 
rotten in my opinion I mean you know why
can<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.130> smell<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.490> roses<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.090> stuffing<00:02:00.509> but

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
can it smell it roses and stuffing but

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.389 
can it smell it roses and stuffing but
it<00:02:02.250> took<00:02:02.460> me<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> long<00:02:02.820> time<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.090> wash<00:02:04.009> two<00:02:05.009> hours

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
it took me a long time to wash two hours

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.350 
it took me a long time to wash two hours
maybe<00:02:05.610> honestly<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.890> says<00:02:08.190> low<00:02:08.459> dust<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:09.060> it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
maybe honestly it says low dust but it

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.400 
maybe honestly it says low dust but it
had<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.599> lot<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.989> dust<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.819> smell<00:02:12.209> stinks

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.550 

but<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:17.459> know<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:18.269> it's<00:02:18.769> what<00:02:19.769> color<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.489> a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
but you know it's it's what color is a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.410 
but you know it's it's what color is a
basically<00:02:22.560> more<00:02:23.040> likely<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:25.010> more<00:02:26.010> likely<00:02:26.420> is

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
basically more likely and more likely is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.650 
basically more likely and more likely is
used<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.670> as<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.790> bonsai<00:02:30.299> soil<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:33.450> can
