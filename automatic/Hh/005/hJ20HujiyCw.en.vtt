00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 So let's go, so I'm going today. 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:13.429
 to teach you something very useful 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:16.500
 is the notification bar on a moto g1 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.210
 The bike g did not come with the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.279
 notifications what would be bar of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.039
 Notifications 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:28.580
 this is where the whole phone has to 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:32.480
 magically all come wifi bluetooth gps 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:37.129
 data volume and rotation 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.829
 so today you do not see it when you 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.660
 There is no such thing as a bar. 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.350
 notification only the black party and the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.760
 app notifications 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.920
 So that five years is gone so I'll go 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.309
 show you an application that has 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.309
 this function 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:05.420
 so it's more or less so you go there 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.420
 on google play writes 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.159
 at night 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:24.229
 I notified chan all this app 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:27.979

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.950

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.090

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.420

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:40.929

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.860

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:52.100

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:53.659
 then dial wifi there wifi and bluetooth and 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.210
 thereafter 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.929
 here there is nothing here just the volume mark 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.390

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.319

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:10.220
 I want to play next to here again, I 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:13.400
 I can change the order of them that I put in 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.250

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.340
 guests and rotation change the order 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.840

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:32.470

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:42.260

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:42.910
 There red can the taco that you 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.170
 want 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:51.170
 then you can download 95 and if you want there 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.720

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.910
 change the text you can write from the side 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.510

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.090
 here is why getting real good 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.260

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.870

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.150
