00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.389
 hello welcome to the arrival channel 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.519
 I am enrique and today I am going to draw 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.619
 hello kitty this is a character 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.890
 pretty simple so we're going to 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.050
 start 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.359
 I start by drawing an ellipse for the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.699
 head now I divide it in half with 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.400
 two lines one vertical and another 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.020
 horizontal for the ears strokes 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.329
 simple triangles away from the line 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.610
 vertical the triangles have the 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.220
 rounded tips 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.750
 Now I'm going to make some guidelines for 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.540
 to be able to make the flower that he has in 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.160
 head hello kitty for this I make a 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.010
 circumference from the line 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.720
 vertical in the middle this circumstance 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.700
 will stand out from the ellipse of the 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.800
 head and also going to cross the 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.600
 triangle of the ear 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.110
 now I draw a more circumference 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 small inside the first 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.700
 for the eyes I make very small ones 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.580
 vertical ellipses just below the 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.320
 horizontal line that divides the head a 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.750
 eye goes right to the middle of the side 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.310
 left and the other just in the middle of the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.189
 right side 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.439
 now for the nose after another small 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.780
 horizontal ellipse right in the middle of the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.880
 I'm going to make the flower 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 and I will teach you a method that I discovered 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.899
 to make the petals remain 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.939
 same size and that also serves to 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.670
 make almost perfect stars without 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.649
 rules start by drawing a line 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.079
 straight from the circumference more 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.729
 great that we draw and we make this 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.039
 straight line touch outside the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.929
 circumference from within for those who 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.659
 know of geometry this is a line 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.119
 tangent to the inner circumference and 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.149
 We extend this line until it returns to 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.340
 touch the outside circumference now 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.890
 we repeat the process another four times 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 and we will find that the last 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.509
 line ends right where the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.090
 first so we can get stars 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.580
 the smaller the circle inside 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.869
 more peaks your star will have and for 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.580
 make a flower with five petals 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.740
 you just have to make stockings 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.060
 circumferences guiding us on the peaks 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.069
 from the star 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.679
 Now I give quality to the lines 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.380
 definitive and stroke 3 whiskers of each 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.940
 side of the head the whiskers go in the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.000
 half that is below the line 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.800
 horizontal that divides the head in two 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.410
 for the body after an egg of the same 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.019
 size that the head this egg begins 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.489
 from the nose I draw a line 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.470
 horizontally at the bottom of 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.349
 egg and from there begins to trace 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.720
 legs I make a rounded rectangle in 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.360
 the chest of the character and then two 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.060
 ellipses for the arms as it only has 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.030
 two fingers in each hand I will make a small 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.370
 circumference that will be your thumb ready 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.950
 now I only highlight everything with a marker 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.540
 fine dot I erase the lines in pencil and 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.519
 applied color 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.099
 I hope you liked the drawing
