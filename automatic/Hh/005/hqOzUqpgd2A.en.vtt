00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
there and then you get the rotisserie

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.030 
there and then you get the rotisserie
which<00:04:06.840> we've<00:04:07.019> turned<00:04:07.290> on<00:04:07.470> here<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:07.950> get

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
which we've turned on here so you get

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.220 
which we've turned on here so you get
the<00:04:08.220> stainless<00:04:08.459> steel<00:04:08.849> rod<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.599> get<00:04:09.810> four

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
the stainless steel rod you get four

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.740 
the stainless steel rod you get four
forks<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:11.010> then<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.760> get<00:04:11.909> what<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.299> called

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
forks and then you get what this called

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.690 
forks and then you get what this called
a<00:04:12.870> counterweight<00:04:13.349> so<00:04:13.739> what<00:04:13.890> that<00:04:14.040> does<00:04:14.310> is<00:04:14.549> if

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
a counterweight so what that does is if

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.699 
a counterweight so what that does is if
you<00:04:14.730> have<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.000> heavier<00:04:15.390> side<00:04:15.720> of<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.260> meat<00:04:16.470> like

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
you have a heavier side of the meat like

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.379 
you have a heavier side of the meat like
the<00:04:16.919> breasts<00:04:17.459> or<00:04:17.579> something<00:04:17.910> on<00:04:18.060> your<00:04:18.180> chicken

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
the breasts or something on your chicken

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.529 
the breasts or something on your chicken
that<00:04:19.260> offsets<00:04:19.919> that<00:04:20.160> weight<00:04:20.430> so<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.910> turns

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
that offsets that weight so it turns

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.840 
that offsets that weight so it turns
very<00:04:21.750> evenly<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.740> gives<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.039> nice<00:04:23.310> even

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.270 
very evenly and gives you nice even
cooking<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.449> so<00:04:25.229> that's<00:04:25.740> kind<00:04:25.949> of<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.070> nice

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
cooking and so that's kind of a nice

stainless steel wave rod cooking grids

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.990 
stainless steel wave rod cooking grids
this<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:34.770> going<00:04:34.919> to<00:04:34.979> be<00:04:35.039> the<00:04:35.130> actual<00:04:35.340> cooking

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
this is going to be the actual cooking

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.420 
this is going to be the actual cooking
surface<00:04:36.449> that<00:04:36.630> you're<00:04:36.780> cooking<00:04:36.960> on<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:38.370> you

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
surface that you're cooking on so you

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.560 
surface that you're cooking on so you
can<00:04:38.550> see<00:04:38.580> these<00:04:38.820> are<00:04:38.970> very<00:04:39.000> heavy-duty

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
can see these are very heavy-duty

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.200 
can see these are very heavy-duty
they're<00:04:40.080> very<00:04:40.289> thick<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.770> diameter<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:41.520> so

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
they're very thick and diameter and so

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.330 
they're very thick and diameter and so
what<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.110> does<00:04:43.470> is<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.800> makes<00:04:43.979> them<00:04:44.130> very

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
what that does is it makes them very

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.740 
what that does is it makes them very
durable<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:46.880> there's<00:04:47.880> basically<00:04:48.030> three<00:04:48.389> of

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750

steel wave rods the next component the
barbecue<00:04:56.760> is<00:04:56.910> these<00:04:57.120> are<00:04:57.330> going<00:04:57.510> to<00:04:57.570> be<00:04:57.780> your

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
barbecue is these are going to be your

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.379 
barbecue is these are going to be your
grease<00:04:58.680> diverters<00:04:59.250> now<00:04:59.729> what<00:04:59.880> these<00:05:00.030> do<00:05:00.240> is

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
grease diverters now what these do is

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.900 
grease diverters now what these do is
divert<00:05:00.750> grease<00:05:01.110> away<00:05:01.710> from<00:05:02.370> your<00:05:02.550> actual

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
divert grease away from your actual

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.610 
divert grease away from your actual
stainless<00:05:03.389> steel<00:05:03.570> burners<00:05:03.750> this<00:05:04.169> does<00:05:04.380> two

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
stainless steel burners this does two

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.620 
stainless steel burners this does two
things<00:05:04.650> it<00:05:05.430> helps<00:05:05.580> with<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.940> longevity<00:05:06.150> of

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
things it helps with the longevity of

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.110 
things it helps with the longevity of
your<00:05:06.780> burners<00:05:07.199> and<00:05:07.410> then<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.280> also<00:05:08.460> helps

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
your burners and then it also helps

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.330 
your burners and then it also helps
divert<00:05:09.630> grease<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.199> reduce<00:05:10.560> flare-ups<00:05:11.099> so<00:05:11.250> you

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
divert grease to reduce flare-ups so you

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.550 
divert grease to reduce flare-ups so you
have<00:05:11.460> easy<00:05:11.699> even<00:05:12.330> cooking<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.990> even

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
have easy even cooking and even

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.629 
have easy even cooking and even
temperature<00:05:14.010> control<00:05:14.750> now<00:05:15.750> we<00:05:15.810> have<00:05:16.080> our

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
temperature control now we have our

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.159 
temperature control now we have our
grease<00:05:17.639> diverters<00:05:18.120> out<00:05:18.330> these<00:05:18.990> are<00:05:19.139> the

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
grease diverters out these are the

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.650 
grease diverters out these are the
burners<00:05:19.500> themselves<00:05:20.430> so<00:05:21.030> this<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.360> what<00:05:21.539> it

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
burners themselves so this is what it

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.779 
burners themselves so this is what it
looks<00:05:21.840> like<00:05:22.020> when<00:05:22.169> we<00:05:22.199> take<00:05:22.530> it<00:05:22.650> apart<00:05:22.949> you<00:05:23.220> can

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
looks like when we take it apart you can
