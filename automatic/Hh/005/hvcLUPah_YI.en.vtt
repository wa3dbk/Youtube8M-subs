00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.990
 hi everyone my name is bulo today i am 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.680
 I would like to talk about the fighter's perks for 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.750
 squad they often ask me these questions and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.210
 I honestly want to do 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.980
 just a video that I will send 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.279
 all these questioners to 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.739
 somewhat unload your head from 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.260
 the answers to these questions are not that me 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.070
 right very often this is asked but this one 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.930
 Of the frequent questions that are enough 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.760
 easy just answer and i decided that 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.550
 let it be here such an answer will begin 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.809
 most important to me at least 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.760
 perk and for Stan too naturally this is not 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.309
 means that everyone who plays with me 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.600
 There are many opinions of this opinion 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.640
 for me specifically like that cover 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.619
 cover for the squad for me is 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.560
 paramount perk because when 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.890
 I opened fire 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.869
 it is important for me that I can open fire 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.119
 the answer is and if they put me down 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.340
 Naturally I'll shoot anywhere 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.220
 only not the enemy it is not very important 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.340
 so that this does not happen as far as I am 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.990
 known perk cover leveled 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.820
 repressor well, respectively 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.640
 in some cases naturally he is not 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.560
 so effective but there is even an opinion that 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.000
 he is completely ineffective honestly 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.360
 I always dreamed I put the first thing 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.250
 cover 2 who walks in Squad he puts 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.170
 suppression because the second task 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.509
 crush the enemy that is so that he 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.909
 shot past 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.920
 so 1 and 2 perco is a cover 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.229
 and suppression everything else is very 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.640
 situational if we see that we are good 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.690
 play and no one wants to take 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.260
 machine gunner it will be pouches 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.880
 if we play somewhere where a lot of technology 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.930
 shoot and everything else is 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.060
 explosion protection 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.530
 if we stock an engineer 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.900
 necessarily but accordingly 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.660
 explosion squad and grenades 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.910
 it’s such a perk when we don’t know 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.280
 when everything else doesn't fit it 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.060
 pomegranate and here is a jerk 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.430
 we rarely use naturally 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.780
 periodically in stock which means it 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.050
 The default perk for me is well at least 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.450
 least I notice that for many of those 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.400
 who plays with me here is the perk 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.540
 The default that is my cover and 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.050
 they have a jerk because with a jerk I am enough 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.210
 often play and play without him and you know 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.760
 I do not feel much difference honestly 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.470
 saying that is, I am quite successful 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.260
 operates without a breakthrough and quite successfully 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.490
 It is easy for me to play a big role 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.070
 plays well, that's probably all property 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.709
 all she wanted told 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.270
 I will post next soon 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.000
 a segment of this video i will 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.110
 already talk about their machines about 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.650
 what is on them and i think of the following 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.680
 video all for giving me a question why 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.650
 I run with a silencer or asked me 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.989
 the question is why i run with the hilt they 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.739
 The answer will be received but by the way the answer is I can 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.380
 give it like that now my boy 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.900
 there is no scientific justification for this all but 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.360
 the next video I will be about 20 minutes 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.630
 This reason because everyone 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.360
 get a lot of fun but here 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.160
 actually all thank you for your attention 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.160
 subscribe comment happy
