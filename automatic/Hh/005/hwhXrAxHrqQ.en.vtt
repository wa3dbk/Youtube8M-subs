00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.669
 so julien virgili hello you are 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.200
 sector manager at electrolux 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.050
 we are on the podium of 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.090
 the paris fair innovation is the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.469
 product so ultra silence hours green 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.660
 was nominated in the category 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.410
 environment is what really talked about 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.230
 briefly 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.750
 yes of course then with respect to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.760
 regards the ultra six launchers two 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.560
 very important features like 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.989
 his name the indicated ultra six launchers 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.420
 on one side silence is also the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.950
 ecological green side because it takes 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.730
 know the electrolux group is a 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.350
 swedish group 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.690
 and it's true that the Nordic countries 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.730
 will be significantly ahead of 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.579
 ecology in relation to the year what 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.110
 is it ecological then of three things 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.420
 very important especially the power 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.670
 engine at the start we have a power 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.170
 1000-watt motor compared to a 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.329
 2000 watt vacuum cleaner 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.850
 it will save you money on 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.799
 a year about 50% savings 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.100
 of energy so that's the first of 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.350
 things 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.689
 the second is the equipment of the product 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.469
 since in fact the apparatus constituted 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.729
 70% recycled content and 92% 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.950
 recyclable components 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.729
 so we're really on this step 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.319
 ecological 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.539
 regarding what the silence 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.100
 that we can say about this vacuum then 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.930
 today we have 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.640
 a new ultra vacuum six launchers 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.830
 the sound level of this vacuum cleaner 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.080
 reaches 61 decibels which does not have 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.210
 still been matched by our competitors 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.549
 so that's it we have some pride 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.100
 anyway compared to that now 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.360
 talk about silence or noise 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.369
 relatively subjective 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.580
 listen here that's exactly what 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.550
 I propose everything starts it up 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.230
 hop 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.850
 I suggest you listen to it at this level 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.960
 there then you may not be 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.720
 hear a lot since he is 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.910
 really extremely quiet here 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.950
 knowing that there we are in power 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.230
 maximum and we will still aspire 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.480
 with this level of sound obviously 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.340
 yes silence does not affect 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.010
 the effectiveness of the vacuum cleaner itself 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.200
 simply silence allows comfort 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.300
 of use allows the whole family 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.850
 to go about his business listen to 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.770
 music watch television do 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.900
 a nap for the kids so here 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.880
 we have several occupations while 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.800
 everyone lives in the house so at 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.160
 what price and where can we find this 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.520
 product then is currently happening there 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.680
 is positioned at 299 euros 90 and we can 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.480
 find it exclusively on the internet 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.480
 thank you very much I beg you
