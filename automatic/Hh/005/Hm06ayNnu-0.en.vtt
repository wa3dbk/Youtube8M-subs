together<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:31.720> just<00:03:31.900> want<00:03:32.110> to<00:03:32.170> cut<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.500> in

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
together and you just want to cut it in

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.200 
together and you just want to cut it in
the<00:03:32.710> middle<00:03:35.340> okay<00:03:36.340> here<00:03:36.610> we<00:03:36.730> are<00:03:36.760> at<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.060> front

the middle okay here we are at the front
I'm<00:03:37.510> going<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.780> attach<00:03:38.080> one<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.530> ring

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
I'm going to attach one of the ring

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.820 
I'm going to attach one of the ring
terminals<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.610> ground<00:03:40.090> lead<00:03:43.560> now<00:03:44.560> I've

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
terminals to the ground lead now I've

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.860 
terminals to the ground lead now I've
already<00:03:45.220> installed<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.850> butt<00:03:46.120> splice<00:03:46.510> and

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
already installed the butt splice and

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.960 
already installed the butt splice and
the<00:03:47.080> other<00:03:47.260> ring<00:03:47.560> terminal<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.490> the<00:03:48.610> inline

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
the other ring terminal to the inline

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.170 
the other ring terminal to the inline
fuse<00:03:49.360> you'll<00:03:50.200> see<00:03:50.380> it<00:03:50.500> laying<00:03:50.740> right<00:03:51.040> there

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
fuse you'll see it laying right there

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.000 
fuse you'll see it laying right there
what<00:03:52.180> I'm<00:03:52.300> doing<00:03:52.570> now<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:53.080> I'm<00:03:53.350> cutting<00:03:53.740> this

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
what I'm doing now is I'm cutting this

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.190 
what I'm doing now is I'm cutting this
power<00:03:54.340> lead<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:54.910> length<00:03:55.150> because<00:03:55.630> adding<00:03:56.110> the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
power lead to length because adding the

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
power lead to length because adding the
inline<00:03:56.530> fuse<00:03:56.860> is<00:03:57.100> going<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.430> add<00:03:57.910> some<00:03:57.940> length

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
inline fuse is going to add some length

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.620 
inline fuse is going to add some length
so<00:04:00.220> after<00:04:00.490> I<00:04:00.520> do<00:04:00.610> that<00:04:00.730> I'm<00:04:01.030> going<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.240> crimp

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
so after I do that I'm going to crimp

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.720 
so after I do that I'm going to crimp
the<00:04:02.230> other<00:04:02.440> side<00:04:02.800> of<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.100> butt<00:04:03.280> connector

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
the other side of the butt connector

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.020 
the other side of the butt connector
onto<00:04:04.510> that<00:04:04.750> red<00:04:04.960> power<00:04:05.200> lead<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.790> I'll<00:04:06.790> be

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
onto that red power lead and I'll be

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:24.059 
onto that red power lead and I'll be
ready<00:04:07.300> to<00:04:07.390> attach<00:04:08.200> everything

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:24.069 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.649 

now<00:04:25.069> one<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.550> things<00:04:25.759> I<00:04:25.940> like<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.210> do<00:04:26.479> is

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:26.659 
now one of the things I like to do is

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.330 
now one of the things I like to do is
just<00:04:27.169> take<00:04:27.319> a<00:04:27.349> little<00:04:27.530> notch<00:04:27.860> out<00:04:28.099> of<00:04:28.250> those

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
just take a little notch out of those

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.920 
just take a little notch out of those
ring<00:04:28.669> terminals<00:04:29.090> so<00:04:29.240> that<00:04:29.389> allows<00:04:29.659> me<00:04:29.690> to

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
ring terminals so that allows me to

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.339 
ring terminals so that allows me to
slide<00:04:30.710> them<00:04:30.979> into<00:04:31.970> place<00:04:32.330> instead<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:32.900> taking

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
slide them into place instead of taking

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.350 
slide them into place instead of taking
those<00:04:33.500> bolts<00:04:33.949> out<00:04:34.099> and<00:04:34.370> then<00:04:35.030> having<00:04:35.270> to

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
those bolts out and then having to

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.850 
those bolts out and then having to
fiddle<00:04:35.629> with<00:04:35.750> trying<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.169> get<00:04:36.379> all<00:04:36.590> those

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
fiddle with trying to get all those

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.379 
fiddle with trying to get all those
accessories<00:04:37.759> back<00:04:38.479> on<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.870> terminals<00:04:40.389> after

brake<00:05:04.940> is<00:05:05.120> grabbed<00:05:05.479> and<00:05:05.810> then<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.919> voltage<00:05:07.580> is

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
brake is grabbed and then the voltage is

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.029 
brake is grabbed and then the voltage is
going<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.090> fluctuate<00:05:08.719> on<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:09.319> turn<00:05:09.530> signals

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
going to fluctuate on the turn signals

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.730 
going to fluctuate on the turn signals
as<00:05:10.969> they<00:05:11.270> go<00:05:11.449> up<00:05:11.599> and<00:05:11.719> down<00:05:11.900> so<00:05:12.169> if<00:05:12.289> that's<00:05:12.409> what

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
as they go up and down so if that's what

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.180 
as they go up and down so if that's what
you<00:05:12.860> see<00:05:13.099> when<00:05:13.849> you<00:05:14.000> hook<00:05:14.150> up<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:14.389> voltmeter

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
you see when you hook up the voltmeter

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.290 
you see when you hook up the voltmeter
then<00:05:16.190> you<00:05:16.340> know<00:05:16.460> everything<00:05:16.729> is<00:05:16.940> working<00:05:17.150> like

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
then you know everything is working like

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.540 
then you know everything is working like
it<00:05:17.569> should

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
it should
