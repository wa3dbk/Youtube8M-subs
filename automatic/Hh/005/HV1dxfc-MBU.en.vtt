00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
moisture barrier that it needs to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.120 
moisture barrier that it needs to
maintain<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.929> even<00:01:25.049> worse<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.679> you<00:01:25.859> have

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
maintain but it's even worse if you have

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.819 
maintain but it's even worse if you have
acne<00:01:26.490> prone<00:01:26.899> combination<00:01:27.899> or<00:01:27.990> oily<00:01:28.200> skin

acne prone combination or oily skin

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.730 
acne prone combination or oily skin
because<00:01:29.429> the<00:01:30.119> alcohols<00:01:30.810> drying<00:01:31.200> nature

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
because the alcohols drying nature

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.749 
because the alcohols drying nature
actually<00:01:32.869> signals<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:34.619> skin<00:01:35.069> to<00:01:35.609> produce

for those reasons this product gets a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.700 
for those reasons this product gets a
poor<00:01:45.179> wringing<00:01:45.659> if<00:01:45.840> Mac<00:01:46.139> had<00:01:46.319> left<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.679> that
