00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.450
 What is she doing with this video, my father? 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.989
 because he does not 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.450

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.510

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.630
 I learn to spend my face washed 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.730
 and it's very easy people, very fast and 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.820
 like I said this just only really needs 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.440
 a little bit of time a little bit of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 patience because this time but also 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.079

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.600
 fast okay and it's easy to go scissors 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.509
 solve be fine coladinha alencar 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.820
 It's good, then it's for who it is. 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.450
 likes to do things at home, wants to 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.219
 like the tips, just go on 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.960
 watching the video with the live people 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.580
 to roll the scissors 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.830
 We're going to need a bottle. 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.320
 Anyone who has your home a 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.650
 glass bottle it can not be 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.229
 plastic and housing the pliers we 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:35.760
 we'll need an iron sands is 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:38.880
 Iron dog iron is chump change 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.520
 Kate and a glass bottle for the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.090
 treasure we are going to make with the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.090
 scissors 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.280
 It's not like shoving a little farm here. 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:57.850
 do not live like we 're going to do with 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.850
 the super four blood season campaign 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.640
 It's very careful not to get hurt. 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.220
 If you're a child, do not do it, it's okay. 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.530
 can not because it runs the risk of 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.400
 hurt that this is for adults only 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.400
 so it 's coming back like here 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:26.690
 remembering to open the leg of the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:31.850
 scissors to pack all not just one 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.890
 part of the same things you knife 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.980
 makes this repeated movement of them already 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:46.100
 I danced the test came to scissors love 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:48.620
 America in this movement over and over again 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.510
 until the test came to your scissors 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.310
 It is moist and is tightly coiled to 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.070
 people will not do it right for 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.790
 He always gives it to me then I found 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.519
 Well, that's a good tip, and it's coming to you. 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.420
 making doing until you do is the bottom 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:09.260
 I already told you that your scissors are now 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:13.579
 to make a lot of people roll we go 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:18.260
 light pliers to grind and 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:20.690
 A little list like this is iron and we 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.880
 Let's leave the pliers 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.110
 so use position looks and turn this 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.130
 part here 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.420
 We'll grind in that part that you have. 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:40.670
 That 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:44.570
 this donation here then on that page 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:49.280
 Let's get sandpaper and let's do it in a 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:55.449
 one way is the grinder 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.449
 only team we're very good people 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.010
 both on the outside and on the side of 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.850
 inside the inside also sense 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.980
 so up looks in single movement 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.580
 you can not do it like this because 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:19.030
 people close will not roll 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.450
 and we 'll just see it here and in this 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:26.260
 another part is also up to you 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:31.630
 and check that the pliers are 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:38.230
 I was very careful not to get 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:44.920
 hurt to that other side to 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:47.410
 do the same thing we will stay 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.070
 well fininha tip will be fine fininha 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.890
 Look there, just take the test there. 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.450
 cuticle cuz I already did my nails but 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.760
 just take the test 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:02.440
 You'll see, look how you shoot. 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:06.150
 seeing as if he had as if he had 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.570
 bought and sent grinding in a 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.090
 professional 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.280
 I hope you liked the tip 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.650
 people give the hint 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.960
 I hope it has been useful to someone and 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.960
 A kiss until the next video bye
