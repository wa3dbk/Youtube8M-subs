looks<00:01:44.130> very<00:01:44.189> much<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.640> guitar<00:01:44.939> guitar

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
looks very much like a guitar guitar

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.870 
looks very much like a guitar guitar
pick<00:01:46.049> now<00:01:46.799> these<00:01:46.950> two<00:01:47.189> buttons<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> top

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
pick now these two buttons on the top

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.609 
pick now these two buttons on the top
here<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:48.899> there<00:01:49.079> are<00:01:49.290> actually

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
here you can see there are actually

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.999 
here you can see there are actually
touch<00:01:50.159> enabled<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.030> using<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.930> two<00:01:52.710> dot

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
touch enabled so using the two dot

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.380 
touch enabled so using the two dot
button<00:01:53.490> here<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.939> actually<00:01:54.030> turn<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
button here we can actually turn the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.319 
button here we can actually turn the
volume<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:54.960> down<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:56.189> touch<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.060> hold<00:01:57.119> them

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
volume up or down we touch and hold them

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.760 
volume up or down we touch and hold them
both<00:01:57.509> at<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.750> same<00:01:57.840> time<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.409> turn<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> device

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
both at the same time to turn the device

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.219 
both at the same time to turn the device
on<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.790> now<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.390> green<00:02:00.689> LED<00:02:00.840> now

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
on so now you can see the green LED now

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.569 
on so now you can see the green LED now
the<00:02:01.290> blue<00:02:01.500> LED<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.920> indicating<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.460> it's

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the blue LED is indicating that it's

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.010 
the blue LED is indicating that it's
connecting<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.060> our<00:02:03.090> iPhone<00:02:03.540> which<00:02:03.719> we<00:02:03.869> have

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
connecting to our iPhone which we have

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.559 
connecting to our iPhone which we have
out<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.469> shot<00:02:04.969> to<00:02:05.969> begin<00:02:06.329> streaming<00:02:06.719> music

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
out of the shot to begin streaming music

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.070 
out of the shot to begin streaming music
so<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.629> can<00:02:09.810> probably<00:02:09.959> hear

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
so you can probably hear

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.540 
so you can probably hear
it<00:02:12.080> doesn't<00:02:12.380> sound<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.650> fantastic<00:02:13.070> when

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
it doesn't sound that fantastic when

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.280 
it doesn't sound that fantastic when
when<00:02:14.120> it's<00:02:14.240> not<00:02:14.390> actually<00:02:14.690> resonating<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
when it's not actually resonating on a

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.520 
when it's not actually resonating on a
surface<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:16.280> if<00:02:16.400> we<00:02:16.490> were<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.610> hold<00:02:16.820> it<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:21.440> it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
surface but if we were to hold it so it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.590 
surface but if we were to hold it so it
does<00:02:21.680> sound<00:02:21.920> much<00:02:22.070> better<00:02:25.240> so<00:02:26.240> like<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.480> say

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
does sound much better so like I say

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.540 
does sound much better so like I say
that's<00:02:26.810> surface<00:02:27.140> resonance<00:02:27.560> technology<00:02:28.130> now

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
that's surface resonance technology now

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.740 
that's surface resonance technology now
we<00:02:28.610> really<00:02:28.880> like<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.120> fact<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:29.540> thing

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
we really like the fact that this thing

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.330 
we really like the fact that this thing
does<00:02:29.900> connect<00:02:30.230> via<00:02:30.410> bluetooth<00:02:30.830> let<00:02:31.100> me<00:02:31.160> just

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
does connect via bluetooth let me just

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.710 
does connect via bluetooth let me just
turn<00:02:31.459> that<00:02:31.610> off<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.270> like<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.480> fact<00:02:35.630> that

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
turn that off so we like the fact that

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.150 
turn that off so we like the fact that
this<00:02:35.870> connect<00:02:36.170> via<00:02:36.350> bluetooth<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:36.950> allows<00:02:37.130> us

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
this connect via bluetooth and allows us

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.520 
this connect via bluetooth and allows us
to<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.940> listen<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.270> our<00:02:38.360> music<00:02:38.390> without<00:02:38.870> having

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
to to listen to our music without having

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.350 
to to listen to our music without having
wires<00:02:39.740> dangling<00:02:40.220> dangling<00:02:41.030> all<00:02:41.150> over<00:02:41.300> the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
wires dangling dangling all over the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.449 
wires dangling dangling all over the
place<00:02:41.600> one<00:02:42.170> suggestion<00:02:42.530> might<00:02:42.800> be<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.100> use<00:02:43.280> the

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
place one suggestion might be to use the

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.210 
place one suggestion might be to use the
included<00:02:43.580> cable<00:02:44.320> to<00:02:45.320> actually<00:02:45.590> attach<00:02:45.860> an<00:02:45.980> mp3

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
included cable to actually attach an mp3

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.710 
included cable to actually attach an mp3
player<00:02:46.340> directly<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.030> your<00:02:47.150> helmet<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:47.570> it's

player directly to your helmet so it's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.810 
player directly to your helmet so it's
kind<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:47.900> an<00:02:48.050> all-in-one<00:02:48.500> solution<00:02:48.770> we<00:02:49.550> found

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
kind of an all-in-one solution we found

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.010 
kind of an all-in-one solution we found

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
bug on the helmet which is you obviously

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.430 
bug on the helmet which is you obviously
we're<00:02:55.190> on<00:02:55.280> your<00:02:55.400> head<00:02:55.580> I'm<00:02:56.510> six<00:02:57.050> foot<00:02:57.200> two<00:02:57.410> I

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
we're on your head I'm six foot two I

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.930 
we're on your head I'm six foot two I
found<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.010> sometimes<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.489> music<00:02:58.580> will

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
found that sometimes the music will

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.880 
found that sometimes the music will
actually<00:02:59.209> cut<00:02:59.390> out<00:02:59.570> sometimes<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.560> cuts<00:03:00.800> out

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
actually cut out sometimes it cuts out

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.530 
actually cut out sometimes it cuts out
occasionally<00:03:01.190> sometimes<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:01.970> cuts<00:03:02.150> out<00:03:02.300> with

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
occasionally sometimes it cuts out with

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.120 
occasionally sometimes it cuts out with
each<00:03:02.660> pedal<00:03:02.900> stroke<00:03:03.290> depending<00:03:03.890> on<00:03:04.010> the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
each pedal stroke depending on the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.340 
each pedal stroke depending on the
situation<00:03:04.489> so<00:03:05.390> something<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.020> kind<00:03:06.290> of

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
situation so something that kind of

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.570 
situation so something that kind of
brings<00:03:06.530> your<00:03:06.739> iPhone<00:03:07.010> up<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.220> little<00:03:07.400> closer

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
brings your iPhone up a little closer

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.210 
brings your iPhone up a little closer
maybe<00:03:07.850> keeping<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.330> in<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.510> shirt<00:03:08.720> pocket<00:03:08.750> or<00:03:09.260> or

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
maybe keeping it in a shirt pocket or or

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.860 
maybe keeping it in a shirt pocket or or
maybe<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.700> handlebar<00:03:11.209> mount<00:03:11.510> or<00:03:11.630> something

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
maybe a handlebar mount or something

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.210 
maybe a handlebar mount or something
like<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.020> will<00:03:12.530> actually<00:03:12.680> alleviate<00:03:13.010> that

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
like that will actually alleviate that

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.130 
like that will actually alleviate that
