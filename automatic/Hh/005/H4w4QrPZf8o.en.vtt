00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.370
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.960
 new video 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.660
 today we find ourselves after a 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.580
 long absence I'm sorry I had a 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.890
 microphone problem so I did not 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.779
 moreover besides you must hear the 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.670
 quality of it that was not yet 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.220
 out of the hostel 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.900
 I have nothing on the fly that my father told me 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.350
 brought back I have time to do one 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.170
 video 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.860
 so I'm doing it is sorry for the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.750
 audio quality 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.430
 I am ordering a microphone 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.100
 who will I hope much better than 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.900
 this one with a different budget and 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.280
 so I hope I can then 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.780
 chained the videos without any problem 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.390
 just a quick note on the videos of the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.010
 goultarminator so after the art video 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.739
 video I put so it was on the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.809
 meet and 4 so we come and so 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.239
 following remarks on audio quality 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.799
 which is true is really very weak 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.350
 I decided not to put the following ones 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.630
 them since the second in 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.720
 especially those the victory against 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.670
 raddho desktop and worse audio quality 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.530
 the first so I told myself that 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.149
 it was useless since these videos do not 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.219
 are present only for the conversation 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.909
 if the conversation is not good 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:25.039
 quality happened it's not great so 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.840
 sorry gc finished at the next winner 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.170
 goultarminator if ever hachana there 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.960
 participate so here we go now 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.219
 focus on the new concept of 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.719
 this video so you see a new 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.920
 title a new series so I had it 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.170
 announced on el-aryadh for those who 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.060
 follow the blog so that's it 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.100
 simply a series that carries very well 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.859
 his name 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.439
 destination billion so I'm going 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.460
 try no I'm going to do it in fact I 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.149
 have not even tried I'll do it 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.899
 I'm lucky to get a billion 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:01.070
 kama starting from almost nothing 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.229
 so going through all the ways 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.340
 conceivable raise 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.789
 kamas 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.800
 so here, of course, there will be games 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.099
 I say I'm leaving without anything but 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.410
 I 'm leaving km with my team so it's not 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.900
 why I do not Kamas 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.190
 in mono account so I'll try to 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.540
 really do all that is possible 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.700
 to do to do this cases max either 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.849
 in hand our accounts in useful account in 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.140
 team optimized anti monop team is is in 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:34.500
 mono account optimize with a guild 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.190
 finally really went through all that is 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.120
 possible and I hope that in addition to me 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.980
 bring in a billion 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.290
 this series to help you a little bit 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.819
 to better understand how do we 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.940
 can try to get out of it level 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.379
 cammas in dofus then I see people 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.730
 maybe jump from their chair there is 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.470
 people when I announced that they 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.180
 told me now you do not know that you 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.799
 were saying the things to do kamas 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.200
 because if you say it the next day we 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.290
 will be able to do more sea then already there 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.110
 do not overestimate the impact of a video 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.630
 youtube on the world of dofus and again 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.100
 least one of mine I touch little 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.180
 people in relation to the total number of 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.340
 players and second hand then it takes 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.849
 have the motivation to redo what I 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.440
 present and to finish when a 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.049
 kama trick if we can call it like 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.920
 it disappears is another one that is created 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.599
 since there is always demand and 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.500
 of supply in dofus the economy will only be 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.510
 never dead 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.220
 there will always be ways to 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.900
 to make cammazes you always have 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.099
 people who will seek to advance in the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.019
 game and when we move forward well we 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.639
 spending kamas since we buy 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.560
 outfits have dropped runes we buy 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.329
 some stuff is really stuff 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.500
 inexhaustible in dofus that's what I 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.590
 will try to show you in this 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.620
 story series to arrive at the sum 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.900
 crazy for some is already reached 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.530
 for many more of the billion 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.310
 gama 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.660
 so I'm going to leave with my ectoplasm 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.670
 i'm on the beach going up 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.200
 like I invite you to follow and 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.260
 riaj if you want more news there 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.190
 above it is at 0 cannes so what 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.650
 I'm going to actually do it is that I want 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.870
 pass him a million with a panda and 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:21.639
 this will be the start of that amount here 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.830
 hop a little million so you see them 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.160
 kamas that I currently have on my 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.570
 panda will not be used in this 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.910
 getting billions because I have 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.700
 really from scratch and what 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.010
 will actually go to crescendo 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.110
 in my tips for making me kamas 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.490
 that is, at the beginning 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.690
 a trick that will bring me back I do not know 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.919
 not five hundred thousand with a little bit of 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.320
 farm what will it be something 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.090
 profitable and once exceeded by 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.669
 example the 203 100 million his tricks 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.690
 there will no longer be more profitable the 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.860
 everything compared to the time that I 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.960
 will put the sum that is already theirs 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.340
 on me what will allow me to actually 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.040
 present as and when 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.620
 episodes of other tips for others 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.780
 budget is to show an evolution in 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.300
 the mass mill massage in iran 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.860
 comments as we say we'll say the 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.020
 mass jallet but I take to deceive 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.060
 the massage of caresses 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.060
 so here I hope that this series 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.960
 opera i hope you like the concept 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.169
 I like it because I'm going to 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.030
 to make a billion here so no matter 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.250
 the time I do not announce any time I do not 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.610
 do not know how long it's going to m 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.199
 anyway I will do it and 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.990
 that motivates me and besides having these 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.150
 business episodes so I hope that 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.780
 you will help you in the game to advance 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.419
 and try to progress from going up to 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.620
 character here is so I'm going to you 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.530
 to leave it was the little introduction 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.159
 of the series we find ourselves the fastest 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.780
 possible I hope for episode 1 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.219
 and I do not reveal to you yet what he 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.919
