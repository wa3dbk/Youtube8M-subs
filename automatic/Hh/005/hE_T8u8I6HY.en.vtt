9th grade next year most of them I
believe<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:23.570> probably<00:00:24.570> algebra<00:00:25.080> 2<00:00:25.289> under

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
believe have probably algebra 2 under

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.230 
believe have probably algebra 2 under
their<00:00:25.740> belts<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:28.460> but<00:00:29.460> i'll<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.670> reviewing<00:00:29.880> a

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
their belts and but i'll be reviewing a

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.030 
their belts and but i'll be reviewing a
few<00:00:30.480> concepts<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.850> algebra<00:00:32.850> two<00:00:33.059> before

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
few concepts in algebra two before

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.340 
few concepts in algebra two before
getting<00:00:35.040> into<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> meat<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.120> subject<00:00:37.160> the

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
getting into the meat of the subject the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.770 
getting into the meat of the subject the
park<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.500> end<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.770> using<00:00:41.030> free<00:00:42.030> basic<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:42.719> a

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
park and end up using free basic as a

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.510 
park and end up using free basic as a
programming<00:00:43.410> language<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.190> started

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
programming language to get you started

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.190 
programming language to get you started
because<00:00:44.879> i<00:00:44.969> think<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.300> said<00:00:45.570> well<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.870> free

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
because i think it said well it's free

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.049 
because i think it said well it's free
and<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.920> easy<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.610> install<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:53.059> i'm

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and it's easy to install and a i'm

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.860 
and it's easy to install and a i'm
hoping<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> guys<00:00:54.840> will<00:00:56.690> review<00:00:57.690> these

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
hoping that you guys will review these

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.759 
hoping that you guys will review these
things<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.469> watch<00:00:58.890> them<00:00:59.219> and<00:01:01.129> use<00:01:02.129> them

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
things to watch them and use them

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.740 
things to watch them and use them
critically<00:01:04.769> don't<00:01:05.309> don't<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.600> what

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
critically don't don't just because what

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.390 
critically don't don't just because what
I'm<00:01:06.840> telling<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> truth<00:01:07.950> I'm

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
I'm telling you is not the truth I'm

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.050 
I'm telling you is not the truth I'm
telling<00:01:08.670> me<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> story<00:01:10.189> it's<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.340> true<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
telling me was a story it's not true and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.020 
telling me was a story it's not true and
it's<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.420> precise<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.010> should<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.729> pretty

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it's not precise but it should be pretty

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
it's not precise but it should be pretty
accurate<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.689> what<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.830> guys<00:01:17.009> need<00:01:17.280> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
accurate and what you you guys need to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.640 
accurate and what you you guys need to
do<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.060> argue<00:01:18.930> about<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.380> amongst

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
do is to argue about it amongst

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.679 
do is to argue about it amongst
yourselves<00:01:19.860> well<00:01:20.820> what<00:01:21.030> did<00:01:21.150> he<00:01:21.210> mean<00:01:21.330> by<00:01:21.479> that

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
yourselves well what did he mean by that

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.270 
yourselves well what did he mean by that
or<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.420> what's<00:01:24.750> he<00:01:24.869> wrong<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.530> maybe<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
or you know what's he wrong here maybe I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.969 
or you know what's he wrong here maybe I
am<00:01:26.549> wrong<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.939> some<00:01:27.119> things<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:31.530> although

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
am wrong on some things and the although

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.160 
am wrong on some things and the although
the<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> first<00:01:32.790> few<00:01:33.540> videos<00:01:33.780> were

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the I think the first few videos were

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.109 
the I think the first few videos were
probably<00:01:34.439> pretty<00:01:34.740> simple<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.369> there

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
probably pretty simple and there

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.440 
probably pretty simple and there
shouldn't<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> lot<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.689> problem<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.229> them

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
shouldn't be a lot of problem with them

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.440 
shouldn't be a lot of problem with them
one<00:01:39.450> morning<00:01:40.040> please<00:01:41.040> do<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:41.549> use<00:01:41.610> any<00:01:42.090> real

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
some problems to solve we'll be doing

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.880 
some problems to solve we'll be doing
enough<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.340> those<00:02:17.430> later<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.840> don't<00:02:19.230> plan<00:02:19.440> on
