00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.100 
good for palm muting and they are and to
improve<00:00:52.980> sensitivity<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.030> use<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.420> clean

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
improve sensitivity you can use a clean

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.819 
improve sensitivity you can use a clean
boost<00:00:55.440> pedal<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.510> wah<00:00:58.520> of<00:00:59.520> any<00:00:59.730> type<00:01:00.829> right
