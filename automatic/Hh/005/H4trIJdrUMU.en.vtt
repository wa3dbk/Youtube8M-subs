sound awesome there's the other stuff
there<00:01:30.380> we<00:01:31.380> use<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.560> grills<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:33.800> that<00:01:34.800> way

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
there we use the grills here that way

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.890 
there we use the grills here that way
the<00:01:35.040> sequence<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.670> seat<00:01:36.150> still<00:01:36.360> latches<00:01:36.780> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the sequence it seat still latches and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.810 
the sequence it seat still latches and
everything<00:01:37.260> just<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.190> little<00:01:38.220> bit<00:01:38.490> hard<00:01:38.670> up

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
everything just a little bit hard up

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.010 
everything just a little bit hard up
here<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.180> want<00:01:39.300> to<00:01:39.360> make<00:01:39.479> sure<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> sub

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
here so we want to make sure the sub

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.710 
here so we want to make sure the sub
then<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.290> hit<00:01:40.410> the<00:01:41.000> hit<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> bot<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> seat

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
then it hit the hit the bot on the seat

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.999 
then it hit the hit the bot on the seat
so<00:01:43.020> those<00:01:43.410> grills<00:01:43.740> are<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:45.890> just<00:01:46.890> like

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
so those grills are on there just like

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.770 
so those grills are on there just like
that<00:01:47.130> would<00:01:47.550> you<00:01:47.670> use<00:01:47.940> a<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.240> spacer<00:01:48.660> in

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that would you use a little spacer in

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.630 
that would you use a little spacer in
there<00:01:48.960> go<00:01:49.530> back<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.190> little<00:01:50.369> bit<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
there go back with just a little bit to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.700 
there go back with just a little bit to
shell<00:01:50.910> so<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.810> space<00:01:52.110> them<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.470> little<00:01:52.560> bit

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
shell so we space them up a little bit

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.520 
shell so we space them up a little bit
put<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.190> grills<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.580> there<00:01:54.080> so<00:01:55.080> when<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> seat

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
put the grills on there so when the seat

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.840 
put the grills on there so when the seat
comes<00:01:55.740> down

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.540 

you'll<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.750> worry<00:02:00.900> about<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.550> woofer

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
you'll have to worry about the woofer

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.730 
you'll have to worry about the woofer
hitting<00:02:02.820> or<00:02:02.880> anything<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.450> well<00:02:04.290> I'll<00:02:04.409> give<00:02:04.620> us
