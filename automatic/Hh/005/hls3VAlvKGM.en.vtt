00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:03.620 
when IBM Watson won on the TV quiz show

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.309 
when IBM Watson won on the TV quiz show
Jeopardy<00:00:03.879> it<00:00:04.879> showed<00:00:05.210> how<00:00:05.390> smart<00:00:05.779> computers

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
Jeopardy it showed how smart computers

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.440 
Jeopardy it showed how smart computers
can<00:00:06.529> be<00:00:06.560> but<00:00:07.490> that<00:00:07.609> was<00:00:07.759> just<00:00:07.970> a<00:00:08.060> first<00:00:08.330> step

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
can be but that was just a first step

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.050 
can be but that was just a first step
forward<00:00:09.080> in<00:00:09.290> the<00:00:09.380> era<00:00:09.590> of<00:00:09.740> cognitive<00:00:10.520> systems

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.060 
forward in the era of cognitive systems

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.760 
forward in the era of cognitive systems
Watson<00:00:11.930> we<00:00:12.080> were<00:00:12.170> starting<00:00:12.470> to<00:00:12.530> push

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.770 
Watson we were starting to push

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.280 
Watson we were starting to push
computing<00:00:13.250> into<00:00:13.520> the<00:00:13.610> inductive<00:00:14.000> reasoning

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
computing into the inductive reasoning

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.510 
computing into the inductive reasoning
reasoning<00:00:15.290> about<00:00:15.470> the<00:00:15.530> world<00:00:15.800> as<00:00:15.980> it<00:00:16.129> is<00:00:16.160> and

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
reasoning about the world as it is and

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.090 
reasoning about the world as it is and
the<00:00:17.120> next<00:00:17.420> step<00:00:17.810> going<00:00:18.290> forward<00:00:18.710> is<00:00:18.800> actually

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
the next step going forward is actually

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.650 
the next step going forward is actually
not<00:00:19.250> just<00:00:19.400> reasoning<00:00:19.850> about<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.180> world<00:00:20.330> as<00:00:20.510> it

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
not just reasoning about the world as it

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.420 
not just reasoning about the world as it
is<00:00:20.780> but<00:00:21.380> creating<00:00:21.770> things<00:00:21.950> you've<00:00:22.160> never<00:00:22.190> seen

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
is but creating things you've never seen

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.640 
is but creating things you've never seen
before<00:00:22.789> in<00:00:23.120> the<00:00:23.270> world<00:00:23.480> we<00:00:23.720> thought<00:00:24.050> of<00:00:24.260> what

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
before in the world we thought of what

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.080 
before in the world we thought of what
would<00:00:24.800> be<00:00:24.920> a<00:00:24.950> good<00:00:25.190> way<00:00:25.340> to<00:00:25.400> show<00:00:25.820> how

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
would be a good way to show how

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.640 
would be a good way to show how
computers<00:00:26.750> can<00:00:26.990> be<00:00:27.020> creative<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:28.330> we<00:00:29.650> decided

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
computers can be creative and we decided

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.520 
computers can be creative and we decided
you<00:00:30.890> to<00:00:31.100> apply<00:00:31.430> creativity<00:00:32.029> to<00:00:32.210> food<00:00:32.530> because

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
you to apply creativity to food because

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.860 
you to apply creativity to food because
food<00:00:33.730> is<00:00:34.730> something<00:00:34.940> everybody<00:00:35.300> can<00:00:35.660> relate

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
food is something everybody can relate

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.560 
food is something everybody can relate
to<00:00:35.930> I<00:00:36.290> myself<00:00:37.040> not<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.489> very<00:00:37.760> good<00:00:37.970> cook<00:00:38.149> but<00:00:38.390> I

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
to I myself not a very good cook but I

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.690 
to I myself not a very good cook but I
like<00:00:38.930> to<00:00:39.079> eat<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:39.800> I<00:00:40.190> would<00:00:40.370> be<00:00:40.399> really

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
like to eat and so I would be really

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.250 
like to eat and so I would be really
happy<00:00:41.000> if<00:00:41.090> I<00:00:41.210> had<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.360> machine<00:00:41.570> that<00:00:41.720> told<00:00:42.079> me

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
happy if I had a machine that told me

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.200 
happy if I had a machine that told me
how<00:00:43.130> to<00:00:43.160> create<00:00:43.489> these<00:00:43.670> really<00:00:43.850> amazing

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
how to create these really amazing

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.569 
how to create these really amazing
dishes<00:00:44.680> so<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.860> first<00:00:46.070> step<00:00:46.280> is<00:00:46.430> actually

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
dishes so the first step is actually

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.479 
dishes so the first step is actually
does<00:00:46.910> take<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.450> existing<00:00:47.840> recipes<00:00:48.559> do<00:00:49.220> some

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
does take the existing recipes do some

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.850 
does take the existing recipes do some
remix<00:00:49.850> sing<00:00:50.090> transformations<00:00:50.930> all<00:00:51.440> kinds<00:00:51.800> of

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
remix sing transformations all kinds of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.209 
remix sing transformations all kinds of
things

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
things

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.160 
things
and<00:00:52.760> now<00:00:52.850> you've<00:00:53.000> generates<00:00:53.450> a<00:00:53.630> million<00:00:54.020> new

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
and now you've generates a million new

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.500 
and now you've generates a million new
ideas<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:55.250> now<00:00:55.579> what<00:00:55.880> you<00:00:56.000> want<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:56.239> do<00:00:56.360> is

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
ideas and now what you want to do is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.510 
ideas and now what you want to do is
actually<00:00:56.690> predict<00:00:57.170> which<00:00:57.739> ones<00:00:58.010> are<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.340> most

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
actually predict which ones are the most

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.459 
actually predict which ones are the most
novel<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.239> which<00:00:59.870> ones<00:01:00.079> are<00:01:00.200> the<00:01:00.290> most

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
novel and which ones are the most

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.680 
novel and which ones are the most
flavorful<00:01:00.860> and<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:01.489> that's<00:01:01.700> where<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:02.329> lot<00:01:02.629> of

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
flavorful and so that's where a lot of

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.689 
flavorful and so that's where a lot of
the<00:01:02.899> science<00:01:03.230> comes<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.219> we're<00:01:04.399> able<00:01:04.459> to

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
the science comes in and we're able to

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.099 
the science comes in and we're able to
actually<00:01:04.789> predict<00:01:05.239> these<00:01:05.389> things<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:05.990> then

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:06.109 
actually predict these things and then

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:08.020 
actually predict these things and then
the<00:01:06.679> system<00:01:07.009> generates<00:01:07.490> these<00:01:07.639> lists<00:01:07.909> of

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
the system generates these lists of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.599 
the system generates these lists of
ingredients<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:08.869> we<00:01:09.109> can<00:01:09.350> evaluate<00:01:09.889> them<00:01:10.399> and

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:10.609 
ingredients and we can evaluate them and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:12.639 
ingredients and we can evaluate them and
then<00:01:11.270> we<00:01:11.450> can<00:01:11.600> just<00:01:11.810> start<00:01:11.990> at<00:01:12.109> the<00:01:12.139> top<00:01:12.229> of<00:01:12.499> the

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
then we can just start at the top of the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.859 
then we can just start at the top of the
list<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:13.069> pick<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.429> best<00:01:13.579> ones<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.780> know

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
list and pick the best ones you know

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.469 
list and pick the best ones you know
working<00:01:15.289> with<00:01:15.380> computer<00:01:15.859> is<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.850> great

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
working with computer is a great

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.410 
working with computer is a great
challenge<00:01:17.779> and<00:01:18.229> it<00:01:18.770> is<00:01:19.060> surprising<00:01:20.060> everyday

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
challenge and it is surprising everyday

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.849 
challenge and it is surprising everyday
the<00:01:20.630> things<00:01:20.840> that<00:01:21.020> we<00:01:21.109> come<00:01:21.289> up<00:01:21.319> with<00:01:21.590> every

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
the things that we come up with every

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.129 
the things that we come up with every
time<00:01:22.039> we're<00:01:22.219> in<00:01:22.369> here<00:01:22.659> you<00:01:23.659> know<00:01:23.719> putting<00:01:23.959> out

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:24.139 
time we're in here you know putting out

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:26.349 
time we're in here you know putting out
new<00:01:24.350> things<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:24.829> really<00:01:25.009> pushing<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.029> limits

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
new things and really pushing the limits

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.569 
new things and really pushing the limits
of<00:01:26.509> what<00:01:26.630> anyone<00:01:27.590> has<00:01:27.799> ever<00:01:27.950> done<00:01:28.130> before<00:01:28.189> and

has ever come up with we're really

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.929 
has ever come up with we're really
moving<00:01:36.200> into<00:01:36.560> into<00:01:36.859> exciting<00:01:37.310> new<00:01:37.429> territory

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
moving into into exciting new territory

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.359 
moving into into exciting new territory
this<00:01:38.689> is<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.869> kind<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.380> traditional<00:01:39.889> thing<00:01:40.130> in

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
this is a kind of a traditional thing in

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.080 
this is a kind of a traditional thing in
India<00:01:40.549> boys<00:01:41.539> are<00:01:42.020> not<00:01:42.609> supposed<00:01:43.609> to<00:01:43.909> do

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
India boys are not supposed to do

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.419 
India boys are not supposed to do
housework<00:01:44.359> so<00:01:45.259> I<00:01:45.289> really<00:01:45.740> never<00:01:45.950> introduced

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
housework so I really never introduced

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.599 
housework so I really never introduced
them<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.849> cooking<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:48.289> much<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.069> they<00:01:49.189> never

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
them to cooking that much so they never

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.969 
them to cooking that much so they never
really<00:01:50.060> did<00:01:50.270> cook<00:01:50.569> but<00:01:50.840> they<00:01:50.990> were<00:01:51.049> interested

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
really did cook but they were interested

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.309 
really did cook but they were interested
they<00:01:52.009> would<00:01:52.249> observe<00:01:52.729> what<00:01:53.270> I<00:01:53.299> was<00:01:53.539> doing<00:01:53.869> we

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
they would observe what I was doing we

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.889 
they would observe what I was doing we
tried<00:01:54.560> an<00:01:54.770> experiment<00:01:55.459> why<00:01:56.209> not<00:01:56.389> have<00:01:56.599> labs

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
tried an experiment why not have labs

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.409 
tried an experiment why not have labs
mom<00:01:57.289> choose<00:01:57.739> the<00:01:57.979> variables<00:01:58.549> for<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.029> recipe

00:01:59.409 --> 00:01:59.419 
mom choose the variables for the recipe

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.719 
mom choose the variables for the recipe
creating<00:01:59.810> program<00:02:00.289> and<00:02:00.619> see<00:02:01.099> how<00:02:01.189> things<00:02:01.429> turn

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
creating program and see how things turn

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.959 
creating program and see how things turn
out

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
out

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.479 
out
she<00:02:02.929> chose<00:02:03.200> Brussels<00:02:03.709> sprouts<00:02:04.009> as<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:04.340> key

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:04.489 
she chose Brussels sprouts as the key

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.729 
she chose Brussels sprouts as the key
ingredient<00:02:05.029> and<00:02:05.209> Kenya<00:02:06.049> as<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.380> cooking

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739 
ingredient and Kenya as the cooking

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:09.249 
ingredient and Kenya as the cooking
tradition<00:02:07.360> she<00:02:08.360> didn't<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:08.780> Brussels

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
tradition she didn't like Brussels

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.850 
tradition she didn't like Brussels

so<00:02:10.250> her<00:02:10.369> choice<00:02:10.640> created<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.120> tough<00:02:11.360> challenge

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
so her choice created a tough challenge

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.420 
so her choice created a tough challenge
for<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.140> software<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.590> overcome

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
for the software to overcome

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.160 
for the software to overcome
so<00:02:14.030> when<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.269> think<00:02:14.420> about<00:02:14.569> building<00:02:15.079> a

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
so when you think about building a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.710 
so when you think about building a
computational<00:02:15.950> creativity<00:02:16.579> system<00:02:17.030> how

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
computational creativity system how

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.020 
computational creativity system how
should<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.319> even<00:02:18.530> start<00:02:18.829> and<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.579> the<00:02:19.790> way<00:02:19.879> we

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
should you even start and so the way we

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.850 
should you even start and so the way we
start<00:02:20.299> is<00:02:20.480> we<00:02:20.720> take<00:02:21.049> a<00:02:21.079> lot<00:02:21.439> of<00:02:21.470> existing

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
start is we take a lot of existing

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.339 
start is we take a lot of existing
recipes<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:22.879> we<00:02:23.060> learn<00:02:23.239> from<00:02:23.420> those<00:02:23.659> they're

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
recipes and we learn from those they're

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.319 
recipes and we learn from those they're
kind<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.799> distillation<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.579> human<00:02:25.970> culture

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
kind of a distillation of human culture

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.380 
kind of a distillation of human culture
through<00:02:26.629> 5,000<00:02:27.349> years<00:02:27.700> we<00:02:28.700> also<00:02:28.970> drawn<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.299> lot

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
through 5,000 years we also drawn a lot

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.750 
through 5,000 years we also drawn a lot
of<00:02:29.450> chemistry<00:02:29.840> information<00:02:30.650> what<00:02:31.370> are<00:02:31.609> the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
of chemistry information what are the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.179 
of chemistry information what are the
molecular<00:02:32.000> components<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:33.079> foods<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.859> then

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
molecular components of foods and then

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:35.920 
molecular components of foods and then
also<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.489> lot<00:02:34.609> of<00:02:34.670> psychology<00:02:35.060> information

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
also a lot of psychology information

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.170 
also a lot of psychology information
what<00:02:36.769> kinds<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.129> things<00:02:37.340> do<00:02:37.489> people<00:02:37.760> like<00:02:37.909> and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
what kinds of things do people like and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.360 
what kinds of things do people like and
dislike<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:38.810> using<00:02:39.500> all<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.650> these<00:02:39.920> kinds<00:02:40.310> of

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
dislike and using all of these kinds of

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.339 
dislike and using all of these kinds of
data<00:02:40.579> we're<00:02:40.970> actually<00:02:41.209> able<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.599> build<00:02:41.900> up<00:02:42.079> and

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
data we're actually able to build up and

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.949 
data we're actually able to build up and
compose<00:02:42.739> these<00:02:43.010> new<00:02:43.250> ingredients<00:02:43.939> and<00:02:44.720> new

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
compose these new ingredients and new

00:02:44.959 --> 00:03:14.140 
compose these new ingredients and new
recipes<00:03:11.620> changed<00:03:12.620> my<00:03:12.799> mind<00:03:13.129> about<00:03:13.400> Brussels

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
recipes changed my mind about Brussels

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.740
