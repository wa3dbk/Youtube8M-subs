hello hello everybody how are y'all
doing<00:00:14.150> toxics<00:00:14.630> here<00:00:14.810> for<00:00:14.960> our<00:00:15.080> three

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
doing toxics here for our three

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.620 
doing toxics here for our three
productions<00:00:15.650> with<00:00:15.800> a<00:00:15.830> glitch<00:00:16.309> on<00:00:16.520> buried<00:00:17.210> this

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
productions with a glitch on buried this

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
productions with a glitch on buried this
time<00:00:17.840> we'll<00:00:17.990> be<00:00:18.080> showing<00:00:18.230> you<00:00:18.380> how<00:00:18.410> to<00:00:18.500> get

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
time we'll be showing you how to get

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.490 
time we'll be showing you how to get
duplicate<00:00:19.100> keys<00:00:19.400> after<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:20.540> patch<00:00:20.750> so<00:00:21.170> they

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
duplicate keys after the patch so they

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.410 
duplicate keys after the patch so they
fixed<00:00:21.920> it<00:00:22.010> and<00:00:22.220> now<00:00:22.610> this<00:00:22.880> is<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.180> way<00:00:23.300> that

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
fixed it and now this is the way that

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.120 
fixed it and now this is the way that
you<00:00:23.510> can<00:00:23.599> still<00:00:23.900> get<00:00:24.020> duplicate<00:00:24.410> keys<00:00:24.800> and

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
you can still get duplicate keys and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.830 
you can still get duplicate keys and
it's<00:00:25.310> pretty<00:00:25.700> straightforward<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:26.599> might<00:00:26.750> be

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
it's pretty straightforward it might be

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.180 
it's pretty straightforward it might be
a<00:00:26.869> little<00:00:27.020> bit<00:00:27.200> confusing<00:00:27.619> but<00:00:27.890> so<00:00:28.010> you<00:00:28.100> might

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
a little bit confusing but so you might

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.920 
a little bit confusing but so you might
watch<00:00:28.430> it<00:00:28.580> a<00:00:28.640> few<00:00:28.670> times<00:00:28.789> but<00:00:29.150> it<00:00:29.420> should<00:00:29.840> be

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
watch it a few times but it should be

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.029 
watch it a few times but it should be
pretty<00:00:30.080> straightforward<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.800> should<00:00:30.920> be

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
pretty straightforward and should be

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.650 
pretty straightforward and should be
easy<00:00:31.190> to<00:00:31.279> do<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:31.760> you<00:00:31.970> can<00:00:32.090> do<00:00:32.180> it<00:00:32.270> by<00:00:32.330> yourself

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
easy to do and you can do it by yourself

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.780 
easy to do and you can do it by yourself
so<00:00:32.809> that's<00:00:32.960> also<00:00:33.230> a<00:00:33.260> plus<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:34.340> was<00:00:34.460> found<00:00:34.610> by

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
so that's also a plus this was found by

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.580 
so that's also a plus this was found by
ex<00:00:34.970> andrew<00:00:35.180> 2007<00:00:35.720> x<00:00:35.870> he's<00:00:36.080> always<00:00:36.290> putting<00:00:36.440> up

stuff finding stuff so thank you to him
for<00:00:38.030> kind<00:00:38.180> of<00:00:38.239> finding<00:00:38.570> this<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:38.840> everything

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
for kind of finding this and everything

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.380 
for kind of finding this and everything
and<00:00:40.070> let's<00:00:40.640> get<00:00:40.790> started<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:41.180> glitch

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
and let's get started the glitch

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.780 
and let's get started the glitch
basically<00:00:42.070> to<00:00:43.070> do<00:00:43.220> it<00:00:43.340> you<00:00:43.430> need<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.640> get<00:00:43.760> a

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
basically to do it you need to get a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.490 
basically to do it you need to get a
time<00:00:44.030> bomb<00:00:44.180> from<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.480> mystery<00:00:44.750> box<00:00:44.899> that's

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
time bomb from the mystery box that's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.479 
time bomb from the mystery box that's
the<00:00:45.649> most<00:00:45.739> important<00:00:46.160> thing<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.399> you're

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.930 
of the cage and then shoot them again
and<00:01:29.959> it'll<00:01:30.140> close<00:01:30.319> the<00:01:30.500> cage<00:01:30.819> when<00:01:31.819> that

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
and it'll close the cage when that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.730 
and it'll close the cage when that
happens<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.599> can<00:01:32.780> go<00:01:32.899> get<00:01:33.080> that<00:01:33.259> old<00:01:33.380> key<00:01:33.590> that

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
happens you can go get that old key that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.589 
happens you can go get that old key that
you<00:01:33.770> swapped<00:01:34.039> out<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:34.459> swap<00:01:35.149> it<00:01:35.270> again<00:01:35.479> with

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:35.599 
you swapped out and swap it again with

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.330 
you swapped out and swap it again with
either<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.869> boozer<00:01:36.259> candy<00:01:36.679> or<00:01:36.770> somewhere<00:01:37.130> just

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
either a boozer candy or somewhere just

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.490 
either a boozer candy or somewhere just
so<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.550> know<00:01:37.670> where<00:01:37.819> it<00:01:37.910> is<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.270> since<00:01:39.200> he<00:01:39.319> ran

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
so you know where it is and since he ran

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.990 
so you know where it is and since he ran
back<00:01:39.709> into<00:01:39.890> his<00:01:40.009> cage<00:01:40.190> again<00:01:40.459> now<00:01:40.610> since<00:01:40.910> you

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
back into his cage again now since you

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.540 
back into his cage again now since you
shot<00:01:41.209> him<00:01:41.590> another<00:01:42.590> key<00:01:42.830> will<00:01:42.950> respond<00:01:43.369> that

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
shot him another key will respond that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.490 
shot him another key will respond that
means<00:01:43.700> there's<00:01:43.940> two<00:01:44.240> keys<00:01:44.630> located<00:01:45.289> on<00:01:45.319> this

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
means there's two keys located on this

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.169 
means there's two keys located on this
map<00:01:45.679> this<00:01:46.069> is<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.190> one<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:46.369> swapped<00:01:46.700> out<00:01:46.910> and

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
map this is the one you swapped out and

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.480 
map this is the one you swapped out and
the<00:01:47.569> one<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:47.869> just<00:01:47.899> spawned<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:49.099> there's<00:01:49.250> two

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
the one that just spawned so there's two

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.499 
the one that just spawned so there's two
of<00:01:49.520> them<00:01:49.670> from<00:01:50.660> there<00:01:50.959> they<00:01:51.530> will<00:01:51.679> be<00:01:51.830> infinite

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
of them from there they will be infinite

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.760 
of them from there they will be infinite
not<00:01:53.509> too<00:01:53.660> difficult<00:01:53.840> right<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.380> tried<00:01:54.649> to

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
not too difficult right I tried to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.639 
not too difficult right I tried to
explain<00:01:55.009> that<00:01:55.069> clearly<00:01:55.539> but<00:01:56.539> but<00:01:56.959> it's<00:01:57.229> it's<00:01:57.560> a

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
explain that clearly but but it's it's a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.169 
explain that clearly but but it's it's a
lot<00:01:57.800> of<00:01:57.920> just<00:01:58.130> keep<00:01:58.340> swapping<00:01:58.550> making<00:01:59.030> sure

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
lot of just keep swapping making sure

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.699 
lot of just keep swapping making sure
you<00:01:59.300> keeping<00:01:59.569> track<00:01:59.660> where<00:02:00.050> your<00:02:00.170> key<00:02:00.349> is<00:02:00.380> and

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
you keeping track where your key is and

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.749 
you keeping track where your key is and
making<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.640> pretty<00:02:02.450> pretty<00:02:03.020> kind<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.349> a<00:02:03.759> smart

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759
