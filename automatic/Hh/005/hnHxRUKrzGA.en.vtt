back fence I normally do like this
checkerboard<00:02:46.730> cut<00:02:47.090> out<00:02:47.270> pattern<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.900> where

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
checkerboard cut out pattern in it where

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.390 
checkerboard cut out pattern in it where
I<00:02:48.170> can<00:02:48.230> reach<00:02:48.440> my<00:02:48.590> hands<00:02:48.800> all<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.190> there

probably if there's a need I'll add some
some<00:03:16.850> plant<00:03:17.920> string<00:03:20.050> across<00:03:21.050> here<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.680> there

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
some plant string across here in there

some plant string across here in there
if<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.130> need<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.519> just<00:03:22.850> kind<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.150> time<00:03:23.390> as<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.720> go

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
if I need to just kind of time as I go

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.680

so they'll be tied to poles and have the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.259 
so they'll be tied to poles and have the
fence<00:03:26.900> as<00:03:27.230> protection<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.120> hopefully<00:03:29.120> those

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
fence as protection and hopefully those

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.400
