take<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.610> pills<00:02:09.820> for<00:02:10.060> they<00:02:10.539> did<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.869> for<00:02:10.899> 12

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
take the pills for they did it for 12

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.340 
take the pills for they did it for 12
weeks<00:02:11.650> only<00:02:12.329> that<00:02:13.329> you<00:02:13.540> work<00:02:13.720> yes<00:02:14.049> you<00:02:14.200> guys

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
weeks only that you work yes you guys

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.580 
weeks only that you work yes you guys
interested<00:02:14.530> in<00:02:14.769> this

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.030 

this<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.610> raw<00:02:19.819> material<00:02:20.420> for<00:02:20.450> coffee<00:02:21.440> that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
this is the raw material for coffee that

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.500 
this is the raw material for coffee that
we<00:02:22.129> drink<00:02:22.370> why<00:02:22.550> would<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:22.970> drinking<00:02:23.300> coffee

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
we drink why would just drinking coffee

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.720 
we drink why would just drinking coffee
do<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:23.959> yeah<00:02:24.349> because<00:02:24.800> when<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.459> coffee

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
do this yeah because when the coffee

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.699 
do this yeah because when the coffee
that<00:02:26.030> we<00:02:26.209> drank<00:02:26.599> is<00:02:26.840> roasted<00:02:27.379> and<00:02:27.530> when<00:02:27.620> they

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
that we drank is roasted and when they

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.110 
that we drank is roasted and when they
roast<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.220> they<00:02:28.370> roasted<00:02:28.790> at<00:02:28.959> 475<00:02:29.959> degrees

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
roast it they roasted at 475 degrees

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.119 
roast it they roasted at 475 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.959> changes<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.500> color<00:02:33.739> turns

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
Fahrenheit so it changes the color turns

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.280 
Fahrenheit so it changes the color turns
brown<00:02:34.489> changes<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.150> aroma<00:02:35.480> changes<00:02:36.140> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
brown changes the aroma changes the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.350 
brown changes the aroma changes the
taste<00:02:36.530> changes<00:02:37.040> everything<00:02:37.310> but<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.150> most

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
taste changes everything but the most

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.210 
taste changes everything but the most
important<00:02:38.870> thing<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.080> does<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.620> removes

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
important thing it does is it removes

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.420 
important thing it does is it removes
the<00:02:40.580> chlorogenic<00:02:41.060> acid<00:02:41.930> that's<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.950> key<00:02:43.190> to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
the chlorogenic acid that's the key to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.460 
the chlorogenic acid that's the key to
what<00:02:43.610> we're<00:02:43.790> talking<00:02:43.819> about<00:02:44.330> today<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.349> how

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
what we're talking about today so how

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.100 
what we're talking about today so how
does<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.650> work<00:02:45.709> well<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:47.000> amazing<00:02:47.269> it's<00:02:47.930> what

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
does it work well it's amazing it's what

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.229 
does it work well it's amazing it's what
we<00:02:48.200> call<00:02:48.349> a<00:02:48.410> triple<00:02:48.799> threat<00:02:48.830> okay<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.030> it's

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
we call a triple threat okay and it's

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.089 
we call a triple threat okay and it's
the<00:02:50.390> chlorogenic<00:02:50.750> acid<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.590> causes<00:02:51.980> the

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
the chlorogenic acid that causes the

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.830 
the chlorogenic acid that causes the
effect<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.670> works<00:02:52.880> three<00:02:53.209> ways<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.660> first

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
effect and it works three ways the first

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.830 
effect and it works three ways the first
way<00:02:54.049> is<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:55.130> goes<00:02:55.370> in<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:55.970> causes<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.690> body

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
way is it goes in and it causes the body

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.009 
way is it goes in and it causes the body
to<00:02:57.019> burn<00:02:57.410> glucose<00:02:58.099> or<00:02:58.310> sugar<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:59.000> burn<00:02:59.630> fat

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
to burn glucose or sugar and burn fat

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.350 
to burn glucose or sugar and burn fat
mainly<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.650> liver<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.579> second<00:03:02.000> way<00:03:02.120> and

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
mainly in the liver the second way and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.720 
mainly in the liver the second way and
the<00:03:02.450> most<00:03:02.630> important<00:03:03.110> way<00:03:03.200> is<00:03:03.379> it<00:03:03.860> slows<00:03:04.400> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
the most important way is it slows the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.199 
the most important way is it slows the
release<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.360> sugar<00:03:05.930> into<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.829> bloodstream<00:03:07.209> so

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
release of sugar into the bloodstream so

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.819 
release of sugar into the bloodstream so
when<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.510> don't<00:03:08.750> have<00:03:08.900> sugar<00:03:09.170> building<00:03:09.620> up<00:03:09.709> in

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
when you don't have sugar building up in

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.650 
when you don't have sugar building up in
the<00:03:09.860> bloodstream<00:03:10.129> you<00:03:10.849> don't<00:03:11.090> have<00:03:11.329> fat

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
the bloodstream you don't have fat

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.259 
the bloodstream you don't have fat
building<00:03:12.110> up<00:03:12.260> because<00:03:12.590> sugar<00:03:12.950> turns<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:14.060> fat

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
building up because sugar turns to fat

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.319 
building up because sugar turns to fat
and<00:03:14.599> everybody<00:03:15.200> must<00:03:15.560> remember<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.329> when

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
and everybody must remember that when

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.630 
and everybody must remember that when
the<00:03:17.450> two<00:03:17.660> are<00:03:17.690> combined<00:03:18.319> together<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:19.489> get

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
the two are combined together you get

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.300 
the two are combined together you get
this<00:03:19.879> synergistic<00:03:20.569> effect<00:03:21.230> that<00:03:21.829> basically

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
this synergistic effect that basically

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.599 
this synergistic effect that basically
burns<00:03:22.730> in<00:03:23.030> blocks<00:03:23.389> and<00:03:23.720> stops<00:03:24.109> fat<00:03:24.620> but<00:03:25.489> it

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
burns in blocks and stops fat but it

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.990 
burns in blocks and stops fat but it
also<00:03:25.819> is<00:03:26.650> natural<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.799> safe<00:03:28.069> to<00:03:28.609> folks<00:03:28.850> have

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
also is natural and safe to folks have

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.539 
also is natural and safe to folks have
to<00:03:29.120> take<00:03:29.299> in<00:03:29.450> order<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.690> get<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.930> benefit<00:03:30.549> 800

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
to take in order to get the benefit 800

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.460 
to take in order to get the benefit 800
milligrams<00:03:31.819> twice<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.420> day<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.260> want<00:03:33.410> to

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
milligrams twice a day and you want to

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.039 
milligrams twice a day and you want to
take<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.829> before<00:03:34.040> meals<00:03:34.970> about<00:03:35.420> 30<00:03:35.690> minutes

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
take it before meals about 30 minutes

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.110 
take it before meals about 30 minutes
before<00:03:36.109> with<00:03:36.560> a<00:03:36.590> large<00:03:36.889> glass<00:03:37.099> of<00:03:37.459> water<00:03:37.760> and

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
before with a large glass of water and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.780 
before with a large glass of water and
it<00:03:38.660> just<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.139> looks<00:03:39.349> like<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:39.769> right<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:40.489> it's

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
it just it looks like this right so it's

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.370 
it just it looks like this right so it's
council<00:03:41.329> capsules<00:03:41.840> you're<00:03:41.930> not<00:03:42.049> gonna<00:03:42.200> take

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
council capsules you're not gonna take

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.629 
council capsules you're not gonna take
the<00:03:42.530> actual<00:03:42.829> bean<00:03:42.980> you're<00:03:43.160> not<00:03:43.250> having<00:03:43.549> a

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
the actual bean you're not having a

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.849 
the actual bean you're not having a
coffee<00:03:43.880> variant<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:45.380> probably<00:03:45.680> wouldn't

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
coffee variant it probably wouldn't

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.680 
coffee variant it probably wouldn't
taste<00:03:46.010> that<00:03:46.130> great<00:03:46.250> anyway<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.299> capsules

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
taste that great anyway so the capsules

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.930 
taste that great anyway so the capsules
you<00:03:47.750> can<00:03:47.930> buy<00:03:48.049> where<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:48.709> buy<00:03:48.889> it<00:03:48.950> online<00:03:49.160> you

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
you can buy where you buy it online you

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.490 
you can buy where you buy it online you
