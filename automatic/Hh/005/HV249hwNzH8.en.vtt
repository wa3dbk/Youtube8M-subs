and had this laying around and luckily
it<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.680> brown<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.430> exactly<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.090> same

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it was brown it's not exactly the same

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.149 
it was brown it's not exactly the same
color<00:01:12.600> Brown<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:13.500> bit<00:01:13.650> off<00:01:13.860> but

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
color Brown it's a little bit off but

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.620 
color Brown it's a little bit off but
nonetheless<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.970> looks<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.180> lot<00:01:15.270> better<00:01:15.330> than

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
nonetheless it looks a lot better than

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.240 
nonetheless it looks a lot better than
the<00:01:15.930> red<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.040> said<00:01:17.070> I

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the red that was on there like I said I

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.830

tried<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.729> off<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.000> much<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> red<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.720> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
tried to get off as much of the red as I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.140 
tried to get off as much of the red as I
possibly<00:01:19.320> could<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:20.250> because<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.090> was

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
possibly could but because that was

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.090 
possibly could but because that was
seeped<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.020> much<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.710> tried<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> use

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
seeped in so much and I tried to use

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
sandpaper in this I just didn't want to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.039 
sandpaper in this I just didn't want to
remove<00:01:25.920> any<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> lettering<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.900> is

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
then behind the glass is a reflective

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.690 
then behind the glass is a reflective
shield<00:02:27.810> now<00:02:28.320> if<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.560> get<00:02:28.710> any<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.070> those<00:02:29.220> mixed

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
shield now if you get any of those mixed

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.430 
shield now if you get any of those mixed
up<00:02:29.790> or<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.180> get<00:02:30.300> any<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.570> those<00:02:30.750> backwards

up or you get any of those backwards

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.870 
up or you get any of those backwards
what<00:02:31.680> you'll<00:02:31.830> notice<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.430> screen<00:02:32.670> will<00:02:32.760> be

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
what you'll notice is the screen will be

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
too dark or the screen won't show at all

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.230 
too dark or the screen won't show at all
it'll<00:02:35.880> be<00:02:35.970> too<00:02:36.150> light<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.690> there<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.380> a

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
it'll be too light so there is a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.130 
it'll be too light so there is a

specific way that you got to put these

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.200 
specific way that you got to put these
things<00:02:40.350> back<00:02:40.560> together<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:41.700> order<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.090> get

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
things back together in order to get

things back together in order to get
them<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.360> show<00:02:42.600> up<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.020> work<00:02:43.290> again<00:02:43.590> but

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
them to show up and work again but

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.300 
them to show up and work again but
nonetheless<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:45.090> thing<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:45.420> working<00:02:45.720> and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
nonetheless this thing is working and

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.550
