00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.639
 how to cook buckwheat 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:15.420
 for this you need it yourself 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:21.900

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:26.670

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.029
 no less 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.079
 [applause] 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:48.550
 after it was measured out 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.550
 Well, add in a deep bowl and 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.860
 we brought a lady under the stream of water 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:01.129
 help clean the slag and 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.260
 other debris after we spent 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.530
 in lichku 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:19.090
 take the pot put on a small fire 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:23.170
 and pour the contents of the bowl decompose 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:29.960
 evenly over the buckwheat pan 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:33.369
 so that she can dry this 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.380
 the process takes no more than two minutes 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:43.119
 after we laid out evenly 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:51.950
 we wait for buckwheat when we wait for when 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:59.390

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:32.150

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:35.650

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:39.500
 2 2 cups milk 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.639
 room for in advance naturally to us 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.639
 need to warm it up 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.800
 [music] 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.290
 we see it fizzing but it's nothing 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:12.690
 scary buckwheat in takes all the milk in 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:20.739
 yourself and so two minutes have passed 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:25.980
 added milk take salt salt and us 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.980
 need for tasty no more than two pinches 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:37.640

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.080
 [music] 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.840
 2 more minutes have passed and you can add gender 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.200
 lemon 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.200
 half a lemon is not necessary but for taste 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.200
 I advise 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.890
 10 minutes have passed and in principle I can 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.980
 say that porridge is ready from all cereals on 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.510
 my opinion buckwheat porridge is the best 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:18.239
 as it is rich in vitamins and helps 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.239
