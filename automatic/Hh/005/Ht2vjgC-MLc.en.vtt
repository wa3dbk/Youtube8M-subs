to a Maltese it was described to me as

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.629 
to a Maltese it was described to me as
an<00:00:09.090> iron<00:00:09.240> cross<00:00:09.599> holding<00:00:10.200> your<00:00:10.320> body<00:00:10.469> out<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.099> a

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
an iron cross holding your body out in a

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.549 
an iron cross holding your body out in a
horizontal<00:00:11.910> plane<00:00:12.269> another<00:00:13.139> way<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.380> think

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
horizontal plane another way to think

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.860 
horizontal plane another way to think
about<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.190> holding<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.059> planche

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
about it is holding a planche

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.800 
about it is holding a planche
but<00:00:16.470> then<00:00:16.619> lowering<00:00:17.039> your<00:00:17.130> body<00:00:17.279> down<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
but then lowering your body down on the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.960 
but then lowering your body down on the
same<00:00:19.020> plane<00:00:19.260> as<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.470> ring<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.250> your<00:00:20.400> hands<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
same plane as the ring so your hands and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.970 
same plane as the ring so your hands and
your<00:00:21.090> body<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.859> all<00:00:22.859> level<00:00:23.400> or<00:00:23.670> horizontal

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
your body are all level or horizontal

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.560 
your body are all level or horizontal
now<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.160> not<00:00:26.310> mandatory<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.449> an

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
now it's not mandatory that you have an

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.960 
now it's not mandatory that you have an
iron<00:00:27.689> cross<00:00:28.050> before<00:00:28.529> holding<00:00:29.099> or<00:00:29.519> learning<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
iron cross before holding or learning a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.600 
iron cross before holding or learning a
Maltese<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.679> another<00:00:31.920> skill<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.309> you

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
Maltese but it is another skill that you

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.850 
Maltese but it is another skill that you
feel<00:00:32.910> definite<00:00:33.540> stress<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.110> your<00:00:34.469> elbows<00:00:34.829> and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
feel definite stress on your elbows and

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.680 
feel definite stress on your elbows and
shoulder<00:00:35.370> joints<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.030> want<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.360> make<00:00:36.480> sure

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
shoulder joints so you want to make sure

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.420 
shoulder joints so you want to make sure
that<00:00:37.410> you're<00:00:37.680> strong<00:00:37.920> enough<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.309> withstand

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that you're strong enough to withstand

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
that you're strong enough to withstand
that<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.750> make<00:00:39.960> sure<00:00:40.110> you're<00:00:40.260> strong

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
that the way to make sure you're strong

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.860 
that the way to make sure you're strong
enough<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:41.000> withstand<00:00:42.000> those<00:00:42.480> sorts<00:00:42.780> of

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
enough to withstand those sorts of

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.049 
enough to withstand those sorts of
pressure<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.440> learning<00:00:44.250> things<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
pressure are learning things like the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.490 
pressure are learning things like the
back<00:00:45.239> lever<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> would<00:00:45.989> say<00:00:46.140> that's<00:00:46.289> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
back lever so I would say that's a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.020 
back lever so I would say that's a
definite<00:00:46.980> prerequisite<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.879> should

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
definite prerequisite that you should

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.330 
definite prerequisite that you should
have<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.420> back<00:00:48.629> lever<00:00:48.870> pull<00:00:49.260> out<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.649> also<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
have a back lever pull out and also a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.889 
have a back lever pull out and also a
very<00:00:50.550> good<00:00:50.760> understanding<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.600> holding<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
very good understanding for holding a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.040 
very good understanding for holding a
plant<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.949> ground<00:00:53.660> now<00:00:54.660> notice<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
plant on the ground now notice the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.709 
plant on the ground now notice the
similarities<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.680> position<00:00:56.370> from<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.539> lower

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
similarities in position from the lower

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.270 
similarities in position from the lower
to<00:00:57.899> back<00:00:58.079> lever<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.500> nice<00:00:58.680> round<00:00:58.980> hollow

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to back lever a nice round hollow

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.639 
to back lever a nice round hollow
position<00:00:59.520> with<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> shoulders<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.989> also

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
position with the shoulders in and also

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.359 
position with the shoulders in and also
the<00:01:02.690> Maltese<00:01:03.690> position<00:01:04.229> when<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.830> lower<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the Maltese position when you lower and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.789 
the Maltese position when you lower and
your<00:01:05.549> body<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.970> rounded<00:01:06.510> arms<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
your body is rounded arms are in and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.520 
your body is rounded arms are in and
what<00:01:08.520> makes<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:08.970> spread<00:01:09.659> open<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> fact

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
what makes them spread open is the fact

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.960 
what makes them spread open is the fact
that<00:01:10.710> you're<00:01:10.860> resisting<00:01:11.310> all<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.670> force

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that you're resisting all that force

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.820 
that you're resisting all that force
it's<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> start<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.080> widen<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.470> arms

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
it's going to start to widen the arms

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.920 
it's going to start to widen the arms
but<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.520> start<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> same<00:01:15.270> nice<00:01:15.659> round

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
but you start in the same nice round

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.960 
but you start in the same nice round
hollow<00:01:16.229> body<00:01:16.470> position<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.670> would<00:01:17.790> do

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
hollow body position that you would do

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.270 
hollow body position that you would do
for<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.390> back<00:01:18.630> lever<00:01:18.900> when<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> understand

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
for your back lever when you understand

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
for your back lever when you understand
the<00:01:20.369> relationship<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:21.270> these<00:01:21.390> two<00:01:21.720> skills<00:01:22.049> the
