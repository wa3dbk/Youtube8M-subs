 from the television of united nations 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:08.330
 this is the un in action 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.840
 in canning from in the heart of the 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.420
 Brazilian drylands stands one 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.390
 of the largest religious monuments 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.630
 of the world san francisco the saint of the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.390
 poor at their feet, slats are witnesses 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.270
 of millions of destitute pilgrims who 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.400
 have prayed to this revered saint 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.640
 looking for the miracle of water 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.160
 the first drought I saw was in 1958 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.430
 I was 12 years old 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.920
 the pulley or furtado owner of a farm 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.120
 in the region has seen the consequences 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.309
 disastrous from drought the water 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.710
 disappears slowly the pastoral 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.640
 also people see starve their 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.910
 won 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.260
 next to drought hits everyone the people 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.260
 the cattle the animals 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.530
 droughts are frequent in 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.509
 dry lands of the world in this 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.890
 arid ecosystem water is a resource 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:14.290
 scarce and precious but like 40% of the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.420
 globe is dry land where it is produced 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.490
 nearly half of the world's food 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.500
 the agricultural solutions that 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.830
 find here can help protect 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.049
 the food security of the planet in 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.869
 the northeast of brazil the agriculture of 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.830
 subsistence used to be possible although 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.890
 a drought can last up to five years 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.429
 thirty gonzÃ¡lez 30 years all 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.770
 this area was productive there was more 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.770
 vegetation there was erosion that we see 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.049
 now but the last three decades the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.810
 things have changed slowly says the 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.820
 francisco farmer net 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.070
 slash and burn agriculture and the 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.890
 rampant deforestation exhausted the 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.890
 floor to an almost irreversible point 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.680
 this region equivalent to france and 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.140
 germany combined that houses 25 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.700
 millions of people run the risk of 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.700
 become desert 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.420
 this phenomenon is called certification 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.050
 and is affecting the drylands to 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.050
 global level 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.910
 to face the water shortage the 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.250
 government built giant dams 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.260
 how is the largest in america 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.140
 latina 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.299
 but due to desertification during 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.700
 rainy season dry soil was 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.310
 to stop at the reservoirs and they were 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.620
 disappearing slowly 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.900
 an initiative funded in 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.209
 part by the World Bank to help 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.250
 keep the reservoirs clean and 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.340
 soon expanded to also help 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.200
 combat desertification the concept 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.030
 Basic project is to teach 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.610
 Farmers Various farming methods 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.190
 of low-cost land and that with 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.230
 time have proven effective as 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.650
 this ancient technique designed to 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.080
 retain the water another technique consists of 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.250
 create bags of groundwater 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.760
 by inserting barriers 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.220
 plastic in ditches and finally re 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.330
 planting trees on the riverbanks 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:23.170
 essential to retain the soil 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.500
 efforts seem to bear fruit have 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.050
 springs rivulets and water holes 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.940
 the native fauna has returned and the 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.450
 farmers can harvest numerous 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.120
 more months 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.519
 the pulley or a project leader in the 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.100
 region now travels to other communities 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.020
 to share these techniques 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.970
 the region also hosted the 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.160
 international conference that launched the 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.580
 design of the united nations against the 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.770
 desertification here napoleon shared 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.290
 your experience with the world 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.980
 lukla calla head of the convention of the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.520
 UN to combat desertification 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.250
 is what we need to add successes to 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.180
 those already obtained expand and disseminate 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.180
 best practices 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.740
 many think that what happens here is 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.140
 a lesson for the world so that 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.030
 difference from their ancestors the 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.250
 future generations do not depend 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.489
 only of hope and 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.489
 prayers
