that's<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.209> bit<00:02:54.330> better<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.770> see<00:02:55.770> if<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.860> can

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
that's a bit better that see if I can

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.020 
that's a bit better that see if I can
just<00:02:56.040> catch<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.370> pack<00:02:56.870> my<00:02:57.870> next<00:02:58.050> challenge
