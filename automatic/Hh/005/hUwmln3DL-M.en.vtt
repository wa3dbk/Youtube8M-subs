hi<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.170> Craig<00:00:01.709> welcome<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.520> design<00:00:02.820> bro<00:00:03.030> I

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:03.470 
hi this Craig welcome to design bro I

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.110 
hi this Craig welcome to design bro I
wanted<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.560> do<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:04.859> first<00:00:05.130> tutorial<00:00:05.549> on

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
wanted to do this first tutorial on

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.379 
wanted to do this first tutorial on
strategy<00:00:07.160> simply<00:00:08.160> because<00:00:08.429> I've<00:00:08.550> seen<00:00:08.580> tons

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
strategy simply because I've seen tons

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.180 
strategy simply because I've seen tons
and<00:00:09.690> tons<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:10.050> illustrator<00:00:10.530> tutorials<00:00:11.070> out

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
and tons of illustrator tutorials out

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.600 
and tons of illustrator tutorials out
there<00:00:11.360> but<00:00:12.360> nobody<00:00:12.599> talks<00:00:13.049> about<00:00:13.490> planning<00:00:14.490> at

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
there but nobody talks about planning at

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.269 
there but nobody talks about planning at
your<00:00:14.820> drawing<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.660> best<00:00:15.929> plan<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.230> attack<00:00:16.440> so

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
your drawing the best plan of attack so

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.849 
your drawing the best plan of attack so
that's<00:00:17.670> what<00:00:17.789> we're<00:00:17.880> going<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.240> today<00:00:18.859> I've

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
that's what we're going to do today I've

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.550 
that's what we're going to do today I've
got<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.310> really<00:00:20.640> simple<00:00:21.090> drawing<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.840> an

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
got this really simple drawing of an

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.880 
got this really simple drawing of an
ipod<00:00:23.460> remote<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.350> obviously<00:00:25.350> not<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
ipod remote and obviously not the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.890 
ipod remote and obviously not the
greatest<00:00:26.490> drawing<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.630> will<00:00:27.750> certainly

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
greatest drawing but it will certainly

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.620 
greatest drawing but it will certainly
serve<00:00:28.320> our<00:00:28.470> purposes<00:00:29.150> so<00:00:30.150> let<00:00:30.330> me<00:00:30.359> turn<00:00:30.570> off

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
serve our purposes so let me turn off

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.930 
serve our purposes so let me turn off
all<00:00:30.929> these<00:00:31.019> layers<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.759> see<00:00:32.910> that

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
all these layers and you can see that

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.160 
all these layers and you can see that
here's<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.450> template<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.930> we're<00:00:34.050> working

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
here's the template that we're working

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.560 
here's the template that we're working
from<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.820> want<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.300> when<00:00:36.480> you're

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
from and what we want to do when you're

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.840 
from and what we want to do when you're
planning<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.590> draw<00:00:38.280> from<00:00:38.460> front<00:00:38.790> to

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
planning this out is draw from front to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.580 
planning this out is draw from front to
back<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.690> simply<00:00:40.050> means<00:00:40.250> things<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
back and that simply means things that

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.590 
back and that simply means things that
aren't<00:00:43.590> covered<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.160> any<00:00:44.340> way<00:00:44.489> get<00:00:45.239> first

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
aren't covered up in any way get first

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.510 
aren't covered up in any way get first
and<00:00:45.899> then<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:47.010> work<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.370> way

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and then you just work your way

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.510 
and then you just work your way
backwards<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.079> illustration<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
backwards so in this illustration the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.779 
backwards so in this illustration the
first<00:00:50.820> thing<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.300> see<00:00:51.800> are<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.579> be

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
first thing that you see are going to be

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.599 
first thing that you see are going to be
these<00:00:54.390> little<00:00:54.719> buttons<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.469> Ford<00:00:57.530> rewind

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
these little buttons the Ford rewind

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.180 
these little buttons the Ford rewind
plus/minus<00:00:59.609> play<00:01:00.149> pause<00:01:00.539> buttons<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.070> see

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
plus/minus play pause buttons do you see

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.570 
plus/minus play pause buttons do you see
that<00:01:02.660> there<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.040> next<00:01:05.159> thing<00:01:05.339> we're

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
that there so then the next thing we're

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.780 
that there so then the next thing we're
going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.320> behind<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.369> circle

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
going to see behind that is this circle

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.480 
going to see behind that is this circle
okay<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:10.080> reason<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.710> circle<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.100> next

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
okay the reason that this circle is next

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.010 
okay the reason that this circle is next
is<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.060> overlaps<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:13.110> circle<00:01:15.020> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
is because it overlaps this circle so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.350 
is because it overlaps this circle so
there<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.200> go<00:01:16.729> then<00:01:17.729> from<00:01:18.000> there<00:01:18.210> you're

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
there you go then from there you're

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.929 
there you go then from there you're
going<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.570> work<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.990> second<00:01:19.380> circle<00:01:19.939> then

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
going to work to that second circle then

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.080 
going to work to that second circle then
you<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:22.170> shapes<00:01:22.439> behind<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:25.490> then<00:01:26.490> once

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
you go to the shapes behind it then once

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420 
you go to the shapes behind it then once
you've<00:01:27.240> done<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:28.619> know<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.829> get<00:01:29.220> you've

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
you've done that you know you get you've

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.219 
you've done that you know you get you've
got<00:01:29.640> your<00:01:29.820> major<00:01:30.030> things<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.869> place<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
got your major things in place the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.679 
got your major things in place the
reason<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.159> way<00:01:32.400> is

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
reason that you do it this way is

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.560 
reason that you do it this way is
because<00:01:34.250> it<00:01:35.250> makes<00:01:35.579> sure<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.390> don't

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
because it makes sure that you don't

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.469 
because it makes sure that you don't
cover<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.590> anything<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.939> template<00:01:39.299> that's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
cover up anything on the template that's

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.230 
cover up anything on the template that's
necessary<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> draw<00:01:41.090> once<00:01:42.090> you've

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
necessary for you to draw once you've

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.179 
necessary for you to draw once you've
done<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.750> go<00:01:43.020> back<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:43.950> throw

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
done that you can go back you can throw

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.639 
done that you can go back you can throw
in<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:44.579> things<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.909> highlights<00:01:45.649> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
in little things like highlights you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.580 
in little things like highlights you
know<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:47.189> essentially<00:01:48.320> that's<00:01:49.320> your

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
know but essentially that's your

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.550 
know but essentially that's your
strategy<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.310> now<00:01:50.430> your<00:01:50.549> drawing<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.909> done

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
strategy and now your drawing is done

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.230 
strategy and now your drawing is done
from<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.520> take<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> more

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
from there you can take it to more

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.600 
from there you can take it to more
complicated<00:01:54.810> drawings<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.490> you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
complicated drawings you know if you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.569 
complicated drawings you know if you
keep<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:56.909> strategy<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.659> mind<00:01:58.219> there<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.250> no

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
keep that strategy in mind there is no

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.550 
keep that strategy in mind there is no
drawing<00:01:59.909> that's<00:02:00.180> too<00:02:00.390> complicated<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.320> on

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
drawing that's too complicated to do on

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.370 
drawing that's too complicated to do on
illustrator<00:02:02.299> so<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.719> were<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> turn<00:02:04.200> these

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
illustrator so if we were to turn these

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.240 
illustrator so if we were to turn these
off<00:02:04.850> I'll<00:02:05.850> show<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> process<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.990> how

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
off I'll show you the process of how

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.859 
off I'll show you the process of how
this<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.149> drawn<00:02:09.420> front<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.020> back

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
this this is drawn front to back

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.300 
this this is drawn front to back
so<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.349> first<00:02:11.590> thing<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.830> would<00:02:11.920> get<00:02:12.099> are

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
so the first thing you would get are

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.670 
so the first thing you would get are
your<00:02:12.459> headlights<00:02:13.049> then<00:02:14.049> from<00:02:14.260> there<00:02:14.500> your

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
your headlights then from there your

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.640 
your headlights then from there your
grill<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.569> can<00:02:16.720> see<00:02:16.959> that<00:02:16.989> even<00:02:17.319> on<00:02:17.530> the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
grill and you can see that even on the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.360 
grill and you can see that even on the
grill<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:19.390> works<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.140> same<00:02:20.379> way<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:21.220> would

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
grill it works in the same way you would

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.369
