 they do not work to install unofficial versions 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.789
 oki air has added but that in our 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.729
 costs market or in an idea months updates of that version 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.570
 the network that's why the advantages of a rom 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.179
 per hundred good with a percent rose

 game there are different ways to install a rose 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.050
 cl that yes I recommend is 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.500
 together with madrid they can download from the beginning in 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.510
 a savings 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.850
 today installed from the kun 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.130
 one month of sd memory 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.090
 any side in ee de roma you do not have to download and automatically lists 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.230
 and that the whole area 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.230
 and in another way but if you have to enter the recovering 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.800
 i 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.540
 percent 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.930
 the most famous russian husband to the bird 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.570
 the company and did not sign 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.470
 seven nations that know them is something 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.870
 get angry moss 7 is a rude and 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.210
 very famous already have a lot of time doing development 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.480
 currently near update to provide support 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.940
 to more devices that have come out lately 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.250
 i vara adicae side android version 2 points 3 points 7 i think 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.280
 one point 8 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 of hidalgo in which the child sees 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.599
 it cost about 1 so the device is a little faster 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.519
 cd includes three best as are 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.569
 the multitouch gestures 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.049
 which are good multi-touch gestures when doing 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.299
 acz label to know actions 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.849
 with one or more fingers 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.849
 for example this 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.879
 make them intimidated appear the accounts 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.819
 this is what we have to say 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.819
 there they are as they are 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.109
 that of interest that has custom or good s10 if you want 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.059
 activate it 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:53.169
 creation of lowering the term multi-touch 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.219
 and that he learned of crowds can not follow 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.619
 explode in various applications 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:02.359
 and that as browsers music or anything else 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.999
 it was another of the advantages of custom knocks that you have by default 4 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.159
 the uchi 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.229
 what is it like an executor that you secret to the applications that you have 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.499
 by default very insecure claimed 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:19.429
 and any other 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:23.499
 I asked who adjustments do we know that muted I have that version 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.309
 I have the decision is in what we have and this one 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.209
 It is compatible with devices 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.409
 and then also comes the double albelo cello which is very good in 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:36.959
 its free version 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.339
 and you, the peñi, can do many things 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.339
 It is also change the keyboard for one more 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.989
 more accessible faster than normal andrade detects 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.359
 and between the teeth is that having a little more battery the monet in the title 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.599
 bush is a clip in which you use it 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.999
 I for example I have the 3g network I can not believe everyone regretted the time 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:01.939
 urgently 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.929
 and pernía work that if 24 hours 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:07.789
 and if he could not play me it lasts five hours 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.789
 already depends on himself cited videos the island 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:13.220
 the duration that will last you 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.079
 your agent located 300 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.900
 or four that depends 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.060
 oral mixed the minute battery more depends 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.229
 kirchner is also the same on the internet 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.729
 another novelty 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.090
 it cost them a role is who with super user with end 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.409
 things to tell you if you are a registered user 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.699
 you can have a custom one position and that is that the desert is positive and 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.009
 after going as 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.569
 min 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.449
 that are not among them custom products that are fast as I have 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.129
 previously mentioned 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.479
 and it amazed me how a device can as fast as I usually do 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.069
 I currently had 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.069
 the version of some points 3 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.159
 but instead official and then distel this course euros of andréis 2 points 3 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:05.339
 points 5 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.339
 and I ask that I have gone faster 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.689
 today that pesic did not show this age limit 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.129
 that is 99% 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.129
 but that's because I have many indications open 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.719
 and many of them consume a lot of rage 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:27.029
 but and if he had the official version in it, they can not go 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.400
 even state can not even do this 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.020
 I saw very slow 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.330
 guevara then she many mistakes during this day that I am doing 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.289
 and then the Russian still very good friends end I left her months and megalomaniac go 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.460
 colorcon with them they wait for you this Friday the region that they need what 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.159
 it opens it adapts to your needs 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.159
 depending on the device 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.580
 by the way accept 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.680
 for example you think the option b 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.509
 download it 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.759
 they threw us from cdn 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.759
 make updates of the arc pekín aparici 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.869
 the odón version 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:12.209
 of that image mont 7 point 1 point zero rc 1 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:14.779
 i 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.400
 they tell us and they write 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.979
 copious 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.749
 we can make a copy of our roma act 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:23.479
 before moving to one is a point 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.479
 because the animals will be version 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:31.759
 min can thousands of missile printing face the producer the price 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.300
 greenish 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.300
 yes the device that I have selected depends 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.969
 this bridge I understand that Jaime presides 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:43.020
 for themselves 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.020
 I always used 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.960
 by city spy 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.960
