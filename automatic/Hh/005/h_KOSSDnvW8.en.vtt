day and I think it's you know I think

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.020 
day and I think it's you know I think
really<00:01:22.290> those<00:01:22.950> are<00:01:23.100> pretty<00:01:23.189> good<00:01:23.310> numbers<00:01:23.790> but

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
really those are pretty good numbers but

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.440 
really those are pretty good numbers but
the<00:01:24.150> main<00:01:24.390> thing<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:25.460> realize<00:01:26.460> or<00:01:26.729> remember<00:01:27.240> is

good<00:02:04.229> for<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.590> prepared<00:02:05.159> pitcher<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:06.000> you're

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
good for a prepared pitcher if you're

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.880 
good for a prepared pitcher if you're
not<00:02:06.240> prepared<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.840> need<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.110> take<00:02:07.439> more<00:02:07.649> time

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
