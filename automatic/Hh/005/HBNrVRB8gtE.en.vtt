00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.609
 very good everyone is as stage 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.649
 and rammed the channel and today I come to 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.440
 ask you one thing and that is that I am a bank 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.830
 in clash of plants I am glow that for 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.990
 start and I come here not to tell you that 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.289
 I am the best not to show you what 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.510
 good that I am not to teach you to play 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.850
 a clash of class is more that you do 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.860
 you with me what you are in the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.500
 channel the other day I asked myself a question 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.910
 good the subscriber put me that because 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.710
 people were subscribed to my channel if 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.930
 it was terrible even plans that I did not have 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.910
 nothing and I think that people 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.410
 is subscribed to my channel apart from 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.500
 because I have a caratal channel I do not know 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.020
 how many for how bad I am I do not know if I 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.630
 I explain my greatest virtue in this world 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.800
 the class of plants is how bad I am and 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.410
 I realized today talking with the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.480
 subscribers good with one of the clan that 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.000
 I have made a terrible attack since I 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.500
 I have surrendered and everything and the implicated what 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.720
 I said the truth is that I was not going to 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.520
 attack the second time because it was useless 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.650
 I did it to harvest there's a laugh 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.920
 because I say that because now you're going to 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.200
 to know they are the ones I say I am a manco 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.180
 even plans here we are to pass it 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.130
 well to enjoy so that you forget 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.710
 If you have a bad day then that joke 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.619
 some laughter and I know that my videos your touch 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.600
 principal is not humor but always 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.040
 You can look for humor in this world 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.259
 not from the world of video games though 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.660
 I tried to get a serious gameplay between 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.690
 quotes you are going to laugh because 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.210
 for what for me is seriously to see if 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.160
 He has said well what is serious to me 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.229
 for you laughs for example by 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.090
 example we are in this war of 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.770
 agreement is worth a host we are going to see a 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.480
 live attack according to Matías 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.510
 this man yes 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.150
 this man is attacking to death let's go 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.560
 to see what he's doing has gotten what 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.870
 that is being here the whole troop has 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.450
 taken out the castle very well done what 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.220
 wreck with a ray spell 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.470
 perfect man we can not pass it to 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.450
 fast camera but we can stay 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.340
 here watching this battle why then 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.770
 because this man can play if you want 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.810
 live really good game of clash of 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.580
 plants in this channel you're also going to 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.100
 have because I have a clan that knows 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.690
 play well according to what you are going to see 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.330
 here supposedly I already tell you 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.980
 supposedly it 's a good attack so 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.870
 what is here, maybe maybe not 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.850
 be the best matías attack is a good 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.040
 player but maybe this is not the best 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.260
 attack since I have pretty good people 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.730
 in my clan and as you see increase it 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.200
 is posing very well although the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.600
 anti-aircraft is destroying its 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.400
 healer but he is raising it very 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.740
 well at first and I think it can 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.170
 get out very well this attack you want to see 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.090
 good clash of plants I bring you good 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.490
 clash of class here you are watching a 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.140
 good attack of clash of plants but there 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.700
 many channels that also carry 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.240
 a lot of time playing this they know 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.960
 they know everything about this game and really the 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.120
 that you know everything 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.430
 I am your games and he has taught me 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.750
 me because for example my war is not 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.090
 we're going to give it back 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.250
 matías will continue fighting getting 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.200
 Well, we are attacking butt 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.080

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.830

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.620

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.680
 walls that lead to breaking that wall to 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.170
 giants work on 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.360
