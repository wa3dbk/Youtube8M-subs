00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.430 

here<00:03:55.910> just<00:03:56.910> about<00:03:57.150> right<00:03:57.360> maybe<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> bit<00:03:58.170> of

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
here just about right maybe so a bit of

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.520 
here just about right maybe so a bit of
a<00:03:58.560> feel<00:03:58.860> or<00:03:59.100> maybe<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.790> from<00:04:00.060> some<00:04:00.870> 200<00:04:01.170> left

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
a feel or maybe just from some 200 left

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.640 
a feel or maybe just from some 200 left
in<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.100> engine<00:04:02.490> so<00:04:02.730> we<00:04:02.760> really<00:04:03.480> just<00:04:04.050> have<00:04:04.560> to

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
in the engine so we really just have to

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.390 
in the engine so we really just have to
wait<00:04:04.860> for<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.160> go<00:04:05.310> down<00:04:05.870> just<00:04:06.870> recheck<00:04:07.400> so

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
wait for it to go down just recheck so

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.950 
wait for it to go down just recheck so
yeah<00:04:08.610> maybe<00:04:08.880> it's<00:04:09.090> just<00:04:09.150> about<00:04:09.300> right<00:04:09.690> well

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
yeah maybe it's just about right well

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.150 
yeah maybe it's just about right well
