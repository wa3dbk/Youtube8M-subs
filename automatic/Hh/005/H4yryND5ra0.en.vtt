00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.590
 hello guys today we will do this 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.210
 pressure is discarded in 3-d I'm sure 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.630
 that you will love it as much as me 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.630
 well let's see how it is done for this 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.130
 We need cutter tape 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.410
 pen pallet of heart and 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.720
 I little fist pictures of you right now 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.400
 teach how they will get those photos 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.560
 what you have to do is raise your fist 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.119
 towards the camera seeks to explain to the 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.670
 person with whom you are going to take the 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.680
 picture the way you should do it if 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.270
 you can take them among a group of 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.610
 friends and take the same picture for all 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.560
 it is necessary that you leave space from the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.480
 fist down and from the fist towards 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.760
 up the time has come to edit 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.380
 our picture basically what we are going to 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.300
 to do is to put a heart to it if all 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.120
 put some actresses out there for 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.129
 that looks pretty is not necessary but 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.220
 so we adapt it a little bit more to the 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.440
 season if you do not know where to edit it 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.650
 I leave a page in the video entry 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.330
 in the blog we are going to print our 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.830
 photos and once they are ready 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.830
 we will go to the next step 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.229
 ah 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.420
 we take our picture and cut by 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.420
 fist down over fist 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.180
 then we are going to introduce the palette 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.369
 and to hold it we will tape it 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.720
 to finish by the back 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.520
 we will write beautiful things 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.290
