novels not really on purpose but more

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.979

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.799 
due to the writing my novels read faster
and<00:00:49.320> easier<00:00:49.680> than<00:00:49.980> adult<00:00:50.850> fiction<00:00:51.120> that's

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and easier than adult fiction that's

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.130 
and easier than adult fiction that's
just<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.410> fact<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> non-native<00:00:54.300> speaker

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and a language learner that's much

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.330 
and a language learner that's much
easier<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.539> go<00:00:57.719> through<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.649> ever<00:00:58.829> since<00:00:59.100> I'm

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
easier to go through but ever since I'm

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
I wasn't blown away like everyone else

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.050 
I wasn't blown away like everyone else
and<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> was<00:01:46.500> confused<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.579> while

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and it was confused for a while

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.630 
and it was confused for a while
but<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> started<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.140> notice<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.590> reading<00:01:50.430> by

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
but I started to notice that reading by

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.760 
but I started to notice that reading by
a<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.780> my<00:01:52.020> problem<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
a I really have my problem with the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.639 
a I really have my problem with the
contemporary<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.850> focuses<00:01:54.570> highly<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
contemporary that focuses highly on the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.850 
contemporary that focuses highly on the
romance<00:01:56.240> because<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.990> too<00:01:58.469> far<00:01:58.710> away

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
romance because that's just too far away

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.480 
romance because that's just too far away
I<00:01:59.509> cannot<00:02:00.509> really<00:02:01.079> identify<00:02:01.469> with<00:02:02.070> those

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
I cannot really identify with those

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.399 
I cannot really identify with those
characters<00:02:03.210> anymore<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.990> those<00:02:04.140> situations

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
characters anymore of those situations

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.039 
characters anymore of those situations
and<00:02:05.130> sometimes<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.090> feels<00:02:06.180> silly<00:02:06.750> from

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
and sometimes it just feels silly from

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.650 
and sometimes it just feels silly from
my<00:02:07.229> point<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.740> view<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.670> miss<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.179> way<00:02:09.509> it's

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
my point of view I do miss that way it's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.419 
my point of view I do miss that way it's
attractive<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
attractive for you

adults and younger people but being

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.209 
adults and younger people but being
almost<00:02:14.060> 14<00:02:14.569> hell<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:15.170> don't<00:02:15.799> see<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.219 
almost 14 hell I don't see the

almost 14 hell I don't see the
attraction<00:02:16.310> anymore<00:02:17.299> I<00:02:17.599> think<00:02:17.780> I'm<00:02:18.109> also<00:02:18.349> a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
attraction anymore I think I'm also a

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.470 
attraction anymore I think I'm also a
little<00:02:18.739> bit<00:02:18.859> over<00:02:19.219> the<00:02:19.340> dystopian<00:02:20.000> but<00:02:20.299> just

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
little bit over the dystopian but just

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.720 
little bit over the dystopian but just
because<00:02:20.810> they<00:02:20.989> have<00:02:21.140> been<00:02:21.349> so<00:02:21.590> many<00:02:21.829> I<00:02:22.099> still

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
because they have been so many I still

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.089 
because they have been so many I still
liked<00:02:23.000> some<00:02:23.359> of<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.659> but<00:02:24.019> I<00:02:24.230> can't<00:02:24.620> read<00:02:24.890> as

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
liked some of it but I can't read as

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.429

many<00:02:25.340> dystopian<00:02:26.030> as<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.450> rest<00:02:26.629> of<00:02:26.810> why<00:02:26.989> I<00:02:27.019> read

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
many dystopian as the rest of why I read

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.500 
many dystopian as the rest of why I read
but<00:02:27.859> the<00:02:28.010> by<00:02:28.189> a<00:02:28.219> books<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.849> I<00:02:28.879> still<00:02:29.239> enjoy

it's not so serious and more on the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.490 
it's not so serious and more on the
light<00:02:46.459> side<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.299> what<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.540> comes<00:02:47.780> down<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.139> is

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500
