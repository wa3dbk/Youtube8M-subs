does<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.060> looks<00:02:03.270> pretty<00:02:03.600> much<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:03.960> close

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
does and it looks pretty much as close

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.630 
does and it looks pretty much as close

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
system really like for example

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.200 
system really like for example
calculator<00:03:29.400> if<00:03:29.520> you<00:03:29.550> take<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.790> look<00:03:29.940> at<00:03:30.060> that

calculator if you take a look at that
right<00:03:30.390> here<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:31.800> these<00:03:32.130> small<00:03:32.400> apps<00:03:32.670> are

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
right here and these small apps are

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.460 
right here and these small apps are
something<00:03:33.300> that<00:03:33.420> Sony<00:03:33.660> has<00:03:33.870> really<00:03:34.140> had<00:03:34.320> in

Experion<00:03:36.360> really<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:36.930> they<00:03:37.860> continue<00:03:38.310> here

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
Experion really and they continue here

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.300 
Experion really and they continue here
in<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:38.940> a3<00:03:39.530> taking<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.620> look<00:03:40.740> at<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:40.980> camera

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
in this a3 taking a look at the camera

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.740 
in this a3 taking a look at the camera
here<00:03:41.520> you'll<00:03:41.670> see<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.120> operating

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
here you'll see that the operating

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.930 
here you'll see that the operating
system<00:03:42.990> provides<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.040> same<00:03:44.340> type<00:03:44.580> of<00:03:44.610> camera

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
system provides the same type of camera

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.190 
system provides the same type of camera
experience<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.660> you've<00:03:45.780> come<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.080> expect

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
already with all of the modes in here

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.940 
already with all of the modes in here
that<00:03:48.450> have<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> lot<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.290> them<00:03:49.410> that<00:03:49.530> do<00:03:49.650> return

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
that have a lot of them that do return

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.100 
that have a lot of them that do return
but<00:03:50.100> there<00:03:50.190> are<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.340> couple<00:03:50.610> of<00:03:50.820> new<00:03:51.060> ones<00:03:51.110> like

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
options all around that allow it to be

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.260 
options all around that allow it to be
pretty<00:04:35.070> customizable<00:04:35.760> when<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:35.970> comes<00:04:36.150> to

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
pretty customizable when it comes to

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.500 
pretty customizable when it comes to
getting<00:04:36.450> the<00:04:36.570> kind<00:04:36.900> of<00:04:36.990> image

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
to be quite the same only with some

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.370 
to be quite the same only with some
enhancements<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.120> are<00:04:43.330> somewhat<00:04:44.110> on<00:04:44.350> the

far<00:04:46.720> as<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.960> field<00:04:47.260> goes<00:04:47.560> if<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:48.010> did<00:04:48.220> feel

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
far as the field goes if you did feel

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.310 
far as the field goes if you did feel
the<00:04:48.640> Xperia<00:04:49.060> z2<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.630> then<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:49.840> put<00:04:50.020> this<00:04:50.140> in

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
the Xperia z2 and then you put this in

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.360 
the Xperia z2 and then you put this in
your<00:04:50.350> hand<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.740> will<00:04:50.770> think<00:04:51.130> that<00:04:51.190> the

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
your hand you will think that the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.700 
your hand you will think that the
optimization<00:04:52.030> is<00:04:52.150> pretty<00:04:52.390> nice<00:04:52.570> this<00:04:53.170> rounded

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
optimization is pretty nice this rounded

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.610 
optimization is pretty nice this rounded
feel<00:04:53.920> really<00:04:54.250> gives<00:04:54.460> it<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.700> nice<00:04:55.000> touch<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:56.380> it

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
feel really gives it a nice touch and it

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.200 
feel really gives it a nice touch and it
really<00:04:56.800> does<00:04:57.040> make<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.400> feel<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.610> lot<00:04:57.790> sleeker

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
really does make it feel a lot sleeker

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.480 
really does make it feel a lot sleeker
than<00:04:58.420> before<00:04:58.900> this<00:04:59.320> copper<00:04:59.800> color<00:05:00.040> does<00:05:00.310> look

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
than before this copper color does look

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.120 
than before this copper color does look
quite<00:05:00.610> nice<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:01.180> with<00:05:01.840> a<00:05:02.050> lighter<00:05:02.500> form<00:05:02.920> all

quite nice and with a lighter form all
around<00:05:03.400> with<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.610> thinner<00:05:04.030> body<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.600> does<00:05:04.840> feel

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
around with a thinner body it does feel

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.170 
around with a thinner body it does feel
like<00:05:05.140> an<00:05:05.530> even<00:05:06.100> more<00:05:06.250> premium<00:05:06.610> device<00:05:06.910> than

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
like an even more premium device than

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.000 
like an even more premium device than
before<00:05:07.540> with<00:05:07.810> a<00:05:07.840> much<00:05:08.320> easier<00:05:08.350> handling

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
before with a much easier handling

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.670 
before with a much easier handling
experience<00:05:09.880> than<00:05:10.060> before<00:05:10.330> as<00:05:10.570> well<00:05:10.840> so<00:05:11.500> that's

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
experience than before as well so that's

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.820
