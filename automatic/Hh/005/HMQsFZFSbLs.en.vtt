00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.550
 with him 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.509
 now we are entering you see by marta 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.579
 rank and we will present a section 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.500
 dedicated to hypertrophy that is 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.750
 you usually ask us what are 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.960
 the best exercises to improve 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.120
 our steps and I wonder this what 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.400
 to improve a basic the best thing is to do 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.309
 the same basis according what 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.250
 we will deal with today is when you ask us 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.280
 what other exercises can we do to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.860
 the center but agree for example 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.050
 we know that the subject of the bench press 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.180
 which is a power in movement finished 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.850
 the pectoral many times you ask us 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.250
 which are the best singles or which 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.039
 you think it 's the best exercise for 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.469
 miguel hypertrophy improve the 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.899
 pectoral and good in this section what 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.270
 we will do is catch each muscle group and 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.460
 name what a couple are for us 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.130
 more than essential exercises to 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 center level 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.909
 agree and in this case we will leave 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.710
 separate both bench press and weight 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.270
 dead as understanding the basics 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.030
 which they are also are obviously 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.179
 basic for inter trophy but the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.250
 we will leave aside we will talk about others already 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:36.149
 that we always put them like 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.619
 principal since they are mandatory in 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.140
 the issue of strength because we are that 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.480
 will do the competitions we were not in 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.280
 the world to 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.440
 work together with the region of 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.900
 hypertrophy one that I personally 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:56.510
 like it a lot, it's the 3d bench that tilts 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:59.600
 that is to say with paper but as we will see 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.260
 now the baaz bar on top of the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.620
 pegs and this exercise that 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.170
 personally some of us noticed a lot 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.210
 which is superior electoral in theory 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.210
 works more when you are inclined 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.640
 The social exercise is always active 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.580
 we will take electric the hands we know 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.200
 come on or we have not said is mother 40 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:35.019
 total that has a lot and we went up before 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.019
 of blocking we go through again 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.790
 unhurriedly prepared for 04 missing wash 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.940
 hands 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.360
 this is a very important term 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.440
 whenever we nail the game 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.840
 we work tricks 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.270
 and the part is stuck again so 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.060
 exaggerated that is done on the subject of 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.250
 force to finish the movement in case 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.090
 of hypertrophy for pectoral as does 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.870
 lack 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.480
 we go up the clavicle 3 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.660
 that pulls the pectoral a lot in this 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.270
 exercise before nailing cards 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.310
 we go back again 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.020
 we can do bounce but we 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.890
 we recommend it is a small stop 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.410
 because it feels better 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.830
 This is the one we have chosen 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:31.340
 later we will do 3 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.520
 flat but with more strings many times 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.530
 we work as much the bench with bar 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.410
 and its very basic and widely used measurement 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.600
 for mind health rural hypertrophy not 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.820
 does not have the isolation that they can have 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.310
 the cufflinks plus the work 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.010
 unilaterally allows us to work 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.840
 decompensation of any of the 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.050
 two sides 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.110
 therefore the exercise will be banking 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.510
 we will do but with ropes there we have 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.879
 worked the end and here what 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.989
 we will work flat the exercise is 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.989
 simple and we stretch 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.250
 invoking I have the ropes 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.170
 let's remove the covers and always a 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.440
 complete to the proper mind taking steps 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.440
 behind 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.350
 at the moment when it does not 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.060
 we block the game do not cut 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.660
 constantly the attention continues 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:45.010
 about the pectorals in agreement so 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.330
 for us both in the hall with 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.970
 barbell and on three plants dumbbells 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.240
 should be the exercises that will form 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.450
 the axis of freedom the repetitions 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.860
 in three days between 8 and 15 what 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:05.550
 you can do quality 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.550
 or not 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:20.950
 cool for strings flat top 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.950
 work the top part on Friday 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.780
 agree to work more section 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.390
 half of the chest if 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.090
 someone would like to work from below what 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.340
 that we will do this tilt one of the 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.420
 banks working with bar with manuel 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:39.040
 in this case two and these two agree 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.800
 for us, others are both 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.810
 basic exercises of pectoral for 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.460
 hypertrophy leaving you going to face 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:52.570
 leaving the band as we have 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:54.850
 said and good we have enough and 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.790
 working at strength ranges forgiveness of 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.340
 hypertrophy and so are your series every 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.200
 one does not always have to be four 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.920
 you can give more workload 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.920
 we want 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.980
 will grow a lot and you'll get a 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.450
 density that before agree utilities 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.130
 it's good we hope you liked it 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.960
 the video that you liked all the 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.300
 exercises that I advise you to

 intertropical and as always if you want 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.010
