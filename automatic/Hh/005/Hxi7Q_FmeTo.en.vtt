 we got to this observation deck 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.380
 completely free because we 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.810

 playground literally 30 meters but 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.620
 for some reason this is a viewing platform 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.620
 considered the best for a narrow marriage 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.439

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.200

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.330

 female 11 will be a lot of people you 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.670
 there will be such a mood when I 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.370
 visited the observation deck this 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.470
 the ladder consists of articles from steps and 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.470
 waiting at the very top of the observation deck 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.560
 such a robot is also installed here 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.820

 quad bike and here when it's already hours 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.720
 ten eleven is going very 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.280
 many quad bugs which can 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.280
 rent a ride around the island 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.180
 is free 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.650
 we went down to the beach Bulo God and from here 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.240
 this ebb is felt stronger because 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.000
 almost to the horizon there is no water 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.860
 people sing far there 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.160
 they collect the algae whether either 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.160
 looking for lost jewels 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.020
 lovely 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.430
 we all imposed on the heart pounding on 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.110
 This why because we when kopter 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.130
 launched he became angry and with us 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.100
 viewing platform 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.620
 but for some reason when he flew away for her here 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.870
 sharply j breakage he lost that control 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.730
 some kind of flashing amber its 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.780
 dry and down but where the author of the sea is not 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.690
 paid off. 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.700
 but we managed the video turned out cool 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.290
