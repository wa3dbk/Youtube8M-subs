00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.939
 we are going to strike and there he says l 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.159
 xl of m menu this is to configure 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.740

 four serrat jorge internal 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.659
 german and grenades and if you prefer me 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:06.009
 would leave only for the map time of 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.619
 infinite game what spam protection 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.810
 time is of the time that you will have 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.970
 of protection respawn before 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.520
 can shoot 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.700
 and when you are ready you can 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.990
 follow these are the skills 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.360
 configuration are the levels let's say 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:30.780
 older more difficult example we have 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.760
 of m1 easy ability skill skill 165 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.890
 the most difficult of woodley and these are 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.780
 the weapons available or to the same because 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.640
 not all formed by the configure it 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.160
 same here is for csdm and for the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.640
 friendly fire or activate it or we do not give it 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.790
 save 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:56.609
 and we close 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:56.609
 after this we open our 1.6 cessation 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.330
 I will show you later how it works 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.570
 this 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.490
 well here we are inside the game 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.570
 after setting in the menu of the 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.140
 bots 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.930
 open they open the game and to play mario 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.450
 they go to a new game where they can do 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.390
 configure nothing here because this is not 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.200
 necessary because a death match and only 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.840
 we are going to start 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.290
 - they want to choose a map like I do not 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.360
 I have the most downloaded I give to 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.940
 any new and now I'm going to choose a 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.500
 best level as barreal the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.060
 commands to change the magicians are what 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.060
 same that we have a recondite 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:46.590
 and the purchase menu is what is equal to the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:52.560
 a more normal with numbers 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:55.129
 and that the game is restarted and that 's it 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.129
 ready for which 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.310
 and there is always a waiting time but 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.310
 there it becomes normal 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.010
 these are the rarest ones that he avoided for 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.690
 play where else but it serves quite 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.290
 balance what is he 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.290
 tÃ©lam 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:28.500
 the facts of having the reflexes and those 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:31.330
 things because they do not shoot 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.100
 especially see it and now it is 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.020
 configured this game we have cured 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.020
 for online mode 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:45.129
 and I have not activated the mode made for 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:48.629
 try for example 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.629
 record could do 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.419
 yes nadal if ours 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.440
 it revealed that it serves quite well for 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.870
 train reflexes because 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.560
 was bigger followed the subject but 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.560
 even better lesson 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.990
 the configuration of the sea is seen to be 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.420
 every time 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.770
 before opening the game always open 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.370
 before opening the game if they are not 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.850
 we set default and the wrong was 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.850
 horrible 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:53.889
 thanks I'm waiting for it to be 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:56.130
 harder for infinite and does not pick up or 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.130
 be 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.949
 is for how much they want 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.560
 in the other currencies of the game 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.630
 well I think that would be all 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.940
 will connect us and take a departure 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.700
 thanks for the video subscribe a me 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.260

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.390
 they want you to do a tutorial of 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.980

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.270
