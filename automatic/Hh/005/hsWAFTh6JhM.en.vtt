now<00:00:03.000> we're<00:00:03.179> going<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.360> discover<00:00:03.750> where<00:00:04.259> money

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
now we're going to discover where money

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.299 
now we're going to discover where money
is<00:00:04.590> created<00:00:04.800> the<00:00:05.630> process<00:00:06.630> works<00:00:06.840> like<00:00:07.019> this

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
is created the process works like this

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.919 
is created the process works like this
suppose<00:00:08.309> Congress<00:00:09.030> needs<00:00:09.269> more<00:00:09.510> money<00:00:09.720> than

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
suppose Congress needs more money than

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.829 
suppose Congress needs more money than
it<00:00:10.050> has<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.469> know<00:00:11.190> that's<00:00:11.669> a<00:00:11.790> stretch<00:00:12.059> perhaps

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:12.839 
it has I know that's a stretch perhaps

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.480 
it has I know that's a stretch perhaps
it's<00:00:13.019> done<00:00:13.200> something<00:00:13.589> really<00:00:13.860> historically

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
it's done something really historically

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.700 
it's done something really historically
foolish<00:00:14.969> like<00:00:15.209> cutting<00:00:16.049> taxes<00:00:16.560> while

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
foolish like cutting taxes while

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.920 
foolish like cutting taxes while
conducting<00:00:16.980> two<00:00:17.369> wars<00:00:17.610> at<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.940> same<00:00:18.119> time<00:00:18.330> now

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
conducting two wars at the same time now

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.750 
conducting two wars at the same time now
Congress<00:00:19.200> doesn't<00:00:19.590> actually<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:20.340> any<00:00:20.370> money

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
Congress doesn't actually have any money

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.460 
Congress doesn't actually have any money
so<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> request<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:21.870> additional<00:00:22.050> spending

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
so the request for additional spending

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.870 
so the request for additional spending
gets<00:00:22.740> passed<00:00:22.980> over<00:00:23.280> to<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> Treasury

that paid a rate of interest of five

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.309 
that paid a rate of interest of five
percent<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:57.030> you'd<00:00:57.300> pay<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.569> hundred<00:00:57.839> dollars

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
percent then you'd pay a hundred dollars

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:00.139

for<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.649> bond<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.069> you'd<00:00:59.699> get<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.909> hundred

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

it's safe to say that the majority of
these<00:01:06.750> bonds<00:01:07.140> are<00:01:07.200> bought<00:01:07.409> by<00:01:07.439> big<00:01:07.979> banks<00:01:08.189> such

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
these bonds are bought by big banks such

and that's what you see right here at
this<00:03:21.150> stage<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:22.769> process<00:03:23.280> by<00:03:23.430> which<00:03:23.459> money<00:03:23.819> is

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
this stage the process by which money is

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.449 
this stage the process by which money is
created<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.569> so<00:03:24.870> simple<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:26.040> mind<00:03:26.310> is

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
created is so simple that the mind is

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.309 
created is so simple that the mind is

year it must grow by some percentage

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.860

our local banking example in the

previous chapter because of this all the

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.490 
previous chapter because of this all the

society are geared towards avoiding this

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.260 
society are geared towards avoiding this
outcome<00:05:42.870> so<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.890> banking<00:05:44.250> system<00:05:44.430> must

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
outcome so the banking system must

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.600 
outcome so the banking system must
continually<00:05:45.810> expand<00:05:46.290> not<00:05:47.070> necessarily

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
continually expand not necessarily

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.550 
continually expand not necessarily
because<00:05:47.880> it's<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.270> right<00:05:48.570> or<00:05:48.810> wrong<00:05:49.200> thing<00:05:49.530> to

because it's the right or wrong thing to

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.830 
because it's the right or wrong thing to
do<00:05:49.770> but<00:05:50.340> rather<00:05:50.490> simply<00:05:50.790> because<00:05:51.360> that<00:05:51.570> is<00:05:51.720> how

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
do but rather simply because that is how

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.260 
do but rather simply because that is how
it<00:05:51.960> was<00:05:52.080> designed<00:05:52.490> it's<00:05:53.490> a<00:05:53.640> feature<00:05:53.910> of<00:05:54.180> the

it was designed it's a feature of the
system<00:05:54.630> just<00:05:54.810> like<00:05:54.990> using<00:05:55.170> gasoline<00:05:55.530> as<00:05:56.070> a

feature of my car's engine I might wish

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
and hope that my car would run on straw

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.090 
and hope that my car would run on straw
but<00:06:00.930> I'd<00:06:01.050> be<00:06:01.170> wasting<00:06:01.380> my<00:06:01.680> time<00:06:01.890> because

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
but I'd be wasting my time because

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.720 
but I'd be wasting my time because
that's<00:06:02.400> just<00:06:02.670> not<00:06:02.880> how<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.120> was<00:06:03.210> designed<00:06:03.420> by

that's just not how it was designed by

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.530 
that's just not how it was designed by
understanding<00:06:05.730> the<00:06:05.850> requirement<00:06:06.510> for

understanding the requirement for

one<00:06:27.150> more<00:06:27.360> belief<00:06:27.600> of<00:06:27.750> mine<00:06:27.900> is<00:06:28.080> that<00:06:28.199> I<00:06:28.410> will

one more belief of mine is that I will
witness<00:06:28.830> this<00:06:29.310> collision<00:06:29.699> in<00:06:29.910> my<00:06:30.060> adult

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
witness this collision in my adult

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.820 
witness this collision in my adult
lifetime<00:06:30.540> and<00:06:30.930> in<00:06:31.020> fact<00:06:31.199> it<00:06:31.410> may<00:06:31.530> have<00:06:31.680> already

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
lifetime and in fact it may have already

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.249 
lifetime and in fact it may have already
started<00:06:32.190> and<00:06:32.460> I<00:06:32.910> am<00:06:33.030> extremely<00:06:33.270> interested<00:06:33.870> to

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
started and I am extremely interested to

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.100 
started and I am extremely interested to
see<00:06:34.440> how<00:06:34.500> this<00:06:34.560> is<00:06:34.740> all<00:06:34.949> going<00:06:35.130> to<00:06:35.220> turn<00:06:35.370> out

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
see how this is all going to turn out

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.290 
see how this is all going to turn out
now<00:06:37.110> this<00:06:37.530> is<00:06:37.590> admittedly<00:06:38.250> a<00:06:38.340> truly<00:06:38.940> gigantic

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
now this is admittedly a truly gigantic

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.210 
now this is admittedly a truly gigantic
proposition<00:06:40.020> to<00:06:40.139> consider<00:06:40.440> and<00:06:40.650> some<00:06:41.070> would

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
proposition to consider and some would

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.680 
proposition to consider and some would
say<00:06:41.400> that<00:06:41.580> it's<00:06:41.699> not<00:06:41.759> very<00:06:42.090> interesting<00:06:42.210> at

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
say that it's not very interesting at

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.350 
say that it's not very interesting at
all<00:06:42.810> or<00:06:43.440> rather<00:06:43.590> is<00:06:43.770> just<00:06:44.039> frightening<00:06:44.360> well

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
all or rather is just frightening well

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
like the past then I suppose it is

like the past then I suppose it is
frightening<00:06:49.550> but<00:06:50.550> if<00:06:50.669> you<00:06:50.820> are<00:06:50.850> flexible<00:06:51.539> in

frightening but if you are flexible in

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.420 
frightening but if you are flexible in

your view of the future then you have an

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.279 
your view of the future then you have an
