have this problem when I camp in

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.779 
have this problem when I camp in
Colorado<00:00:22.410> which<00:00:23.039> most<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> state<00:00:23.760> is

above<00:00:24.240> 5,000<00:00:25.019> feet<00:00:25.289> here's<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.279> truck<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
above 5,000 feet here's the truck the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.400 
above 5,000 feet here's the truck the
crux<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.210> his<00:00:27.330> question<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> there<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> way<00:00:28.380> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
crux of his question is there a way to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.320 
crux of his question is there a way to
correct<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.070> by<00:00:29.279> adjusting<00:00:29.429> something

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
correct this by adjusting something

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.999 
correct this by adjusting something
while<00:00:30.539> above<00:00:30.869> 5,000<00:00:31.619> feet

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
while above 5,000 feet

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.860 
while above 5,000 feet
it<00:00:32.520> seems<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> other<00:00:33.329> brands<00:00:33.750> and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it seems like the other brands and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.569 
it seems like the other brands and
refrigerators<00:00:34.500> don't<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.250> problem

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
refrigerators don't have this problem

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.600 
refrigerators don't have this problem
will<00:00:36.000> Doug<00:00:36.270> you're<00:00:36.960> absolutely<00:00:37.200> correct<00:00:37.610> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
will Doug you're absolutely correct the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.100 
will Doug you're absolutely correct the
LP<00:00:39.059> function<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> any<00:00:39.750> absorption

LP function of any absorption

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.650 
LP function of any absorption
refrigerator<00:00:40.860> basically<00:00:41.430> relies<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
refrigerator basically relies on the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.779 
refrigerator basically relies on the
amount<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.989> input<00:00:43.260> gas<00:00:43.739> which<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.219> limited<00:00:44.640> by

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
amount of input gas which is limited by

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.310 
amount of input gas which is limited by
the<00:00:44.820> orifice<00:00:45.390> size<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.020> refrigerator

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the orifice size of that refrigerator

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.940 
the orifice size of that refrigerator
and<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.520> pre-mixed<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.629> air<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.710> form

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and it's pre-mixed with the air to form

the proper combustion capabilities for

that particular burner in other words
that<00:00:54.329> refrigerator<00:00:54.870> has<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> hot

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that refrigerator has to have a hot

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.490 
that refrigerator has to have a hot

enough flame in order to make cold now I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.590 
enough flame in order to make cold now I
know<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.859> sounds<00:00:59.250> strange<00:00:59.609> but<00:01:00.000> with

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
know that sounds strange but with

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.869 
know that sounds strange but with

that's<00:01:03.059> basically<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:03.750> happens<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.890> what

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
that's basically what happens so what

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460 
that's basically what happens so what
we're<00:01:05.519> changing<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.330> higher<00:01:06.570> altitudes<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
we're changing at higher altitudes is

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.070 
we're changing at higher altitudes is
not<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> amount<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.280> incoming<00:01:08.700> gas<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
not the amount of incoming gas but the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440 
not the amount of incoming gas but the
lack<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:11.040> fresh<00:01:11.280> air<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.820> mix<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.240> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
lack of the fresh air to mix with that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.990 
lack of the fresh air to mix with that
gas<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:13.530> proper<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:13.950> complete<00:01:14.520> combustion

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
gas for proper and complete combustion

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.719 
gas for proper and complete combustion
so<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> fact<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.320> an<00:01:16.560> overly<00:01:17.460> rich

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so the fact that we have an overly rich

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.789 
so the fact that we have an overly rich
mixture<00:01:18.210> meaning<00:01:18.659> more<00:01:18.900> LP<00:01:19.350> than<00:01:19.530> what<00:01:19.680> we

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
mixture meaning more LP than what we

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.770 
mixture meaning more LP than what we
need<00:01:19.950> compared<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> amount<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.509> air<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
need compared to the amount of air that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.080 
need compared to the amount of air that
we<00:01:22.049> need<00:01:22.290> there's<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:23.159> no<00:01:23.400> adjustments

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
we need there's really no adjustments

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.969 
we need there's really no adjustments
unfortunately<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.840> modern<00:01:25.320> refrigerators

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
unfortunately on modern refrigerators

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.520 
unfortunately on modern refrigerators

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
brands of refrigerators we could adjust

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.130 
brands of refrigerators we could adjust
the<00:01:31.710> burner<00:01:32.040> input<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:33.119> far<00:01:33.150> as<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> pre

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the burner input as far as the pre

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
only way we can do that is to actually

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
only way we can do that is to actually
change<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.630> orifice<00:01:43.079> size<00:01:43.259> now<00:01:43.680> if<00:01:43.799> you'd

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
change the orifice size now if you'd

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.100 
change the orifice size now if you'd
like<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.430> could<00:01:44.549> probably<00:01:44.790> contact<00:01:45.450> norcold

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
like you could probably contact norcold

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.649 
like you could probably contact norcold
to<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:46.860> if<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> smaller<00:01:48.060> orifice

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
to see if there is a smaller orifice
