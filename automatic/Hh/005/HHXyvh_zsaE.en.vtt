quite<00:02:14.200> some<00:02:14.410> time<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.460> would<00:02:15.640> imagine<00:02:15.730> that

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
quite some time so I would imagine that

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.910 
quite some time so I would imagine that
literally<00:02:16.540> as<00:02:16.720> soon<00:02:16.960> as<00:02:17.260> these<00:02:17.500> issues<00:02:17.890> are

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
sorted out and they perhaps find a way

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.140 
sorted out and they perhaps find a way
to<00:02:20.290> stop<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.070> from<00:02:21.190> happening<00:02:21.400> again<00:02:21.730> perhaps

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
to stop it from happening again perhaps

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.910
