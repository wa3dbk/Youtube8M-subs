00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.130
 exports had shown 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.379
 the ministry insists x10 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.199
 nitro 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.249
 who give us sony ericsson 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:22.550
 dvm employed mentioned main characteristics and what contains the 

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:24.269
 box 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.699
 what we can not see the outcome 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.069
 c 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:31.800
 we can not observe 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.290
 comparing 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.630
 with hand 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.880
 we can see what is quite small 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.280
 even though 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.280
 it looks pretty common 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.560
 this session 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.840
 has a keyboard unlike 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.550
 of the other 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.600
 otherwise it does not keep stated we can not do 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.410
 yes 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.840
 the most important in the area 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.920
 let's see 1 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.239
 today he told us 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.330
 we can observe is that it no longer uses the connector 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
 they used all the family are previous 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.160
 with a connector 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.690
 your advances 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.210
 all links 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.720
 of that brand 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.580
 we can see that it is three points and because it is the classic against the normal 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.650
 normalito that soda 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.079
 if we have a 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.220
 hbo cable that month 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.220
 this mayor has mentioned two functions now 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.670
 claimed his charger 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.580
 to 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.330
 we can see that it has a 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.560
 with hector 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.280
 Well l 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.080
 10 is the one that is 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.710
 if it is stable 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.550
 We commented it 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.830
 this style we connect to 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.860
 salazar es cine is going to take out cells in this way 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.680
 Similarly 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.460
 the change of venue does not serve to connect it to the computer 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.460
 and also doubtful assets 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.540
 a we can see in the charger 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.449
 kenji less 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.989
 has the connection is of the redonditos that I think they use in 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.349
 Europe 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.849
 These machines 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.999
 we will include 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.999
 its adopted not to connect it here in mexico in america 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.189
 without any problem 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.769
 this shows that cell phones 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.259
 christie comes 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.059
 he injured the international 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:37.299
 jacqueline contreras whose mission is exclusively but which 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.179
 it is noted that the company wants to continue 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.979
 effort needs 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.749
 and it comes with salvas 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.509
 demonstrate is good 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.509
 these incentives 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:57.109
 main features of sony ericsson xperia x 10 mini pro 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:02.129
 the first thing we can observe of what is the tiny size that they have 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.129
 here we can see it in the hand millions had mentioned 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.119
 weighs 120 grams 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:09.959
 good that unlike him 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.699
 from the previous one that does not have a keyboard 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.339
 it weighs a little more 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.459
 has a touch screen the whole gang that we can see here is 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.000
 tactile 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.290
 is two points 55 inches this fps 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:26.169
 I made a resolution of 240 by 320 pixels 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:30.089
 this one without rushing resolution publicity 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:33.089
 has an accelerometer 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.289
 the application that makes 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:38.719
 when we follow the cell phone in this way 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.409
 and she gets the icons to the little windows 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.689
 rotate in that position this will be the subway link 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.029
 It has 128 megabytes of internal memory 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.679
 Besides that 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:53.429
 has 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:58.559
 with support for micro SD memories up to 16 giga baez apparently wants 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:01.409
 it was bad of factories and 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.139
 etienne 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.139
 the dictators are even now 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:08.439
 has 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.839
 Concon and Songhua Spain 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.949
 and hang on the internet 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.279
 Your camera 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.849
 Do you have a camera 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.419
 5 megapixels 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.949
 has autofocus 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:22.970
 and flash led 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.219
 here we can is the camera 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.090
 and here we see a flash 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.449
 It also has video recording 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.449
 in venice at 30 6 per second 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.860
 the cell value that is the 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.090
 the plot of the spies 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.090
 they have the Andresian operating system 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.419
 in a serene way I understand 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.330
 well factory 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.770
 what version has of android 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.960
 I think it takes 1 points 6 would have to be crazy do not lose it 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.080
 we'll see 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.319
 we are going to be the potato and see what it is that has to replace last 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.520
 mention them 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.629
 tr his stack 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.830
 I knew hidden 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.849
 in practice 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.849
 we can not see how we've been whistled 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:16.469
 who appear in the lower part is where it goes 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.409
 and we think that here 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.949
 micro SD memory 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.659
 I already corroborate that it serves 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.099
 of the wines the island that it brings of factory 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.229
 we can not do more 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.229
 that was subtle 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.039
 the insult 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.389
 3 followed one another 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.710
 91 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.039
 Sony Ericsson 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.770
 the xperia x10 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.949
 Minister 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.550
 the difference of him 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.550
 min split mini pro 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.069
 the keyboard we can not see here 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.069
 that even though it was quite small 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.939
 it looks and feels pretty common 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:11.900
 is that it is no problem we can say 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.419
 to write 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:14.919
 with this keyboard 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.460
 That is the only difference 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.460
 between miguel mini own is the keyboard 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:23.770
 it would be the whole world
