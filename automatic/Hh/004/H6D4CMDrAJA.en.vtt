00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.540
 Willow is illicitly welcome to the 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.910
 one way review for minecraft pocket 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.549
 edition the version obviously 0.8 point 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.240
 1 which is the most updated 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.160
 unfortunately and for those children of 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.080
 all your mobile mauser since nothing else 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.410
 They do not rush him but it's a part of 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.820
 carnal this good let's go to what 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.420
 we come not the mod 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.030
 is the creepers this engine and for something 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.070
 that's what this one is called for, they're different 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.390
 types of cri peris out fall if you want 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.180
 see well that the number is removed title 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.800
 this then well let's start not 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.579
 this consists of two parts is a text 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.970
 pack and the modem but how we make it 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.400
 for this one to avoid more and to install a 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.510
 text so that not what we have to 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.630
 do is go to this key quoted from 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.370
 carnal win here and we're going to go to 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.710
 the part that says launcher options 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.810
 the ideas of the launcher we are going to look for 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.820
 that says to use package of textures that 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.860
 be green and we give to us in 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.840
 textures package to be able to choose 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.729
 some no longer depending on there I'm going 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.950
 to take directly to your sd or your 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.430
 memory and then already looking in this case 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.560
 I put a folder called 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.880
 clippers and we stayed like points and such 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.250
 which is that goes with the description the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.050
 Knicks remember this one, if so 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.610
 without decompressing they put it where 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.050
 you want a live folder 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.270
 his memories that give it no longer the 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.870
 they look for click and automatically they 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.190
 he installed them I liked it in case they did not know 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.590
 now to install the mode we have in 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.530
 a small little review is remember 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.960
 is here in admin mod and we're going to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.010
 import in import we also go in 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.510
 local training feeling and 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.160
 It will also take us directly to the 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.100
 me, we are going to click on 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.020
 where is our our module in 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.630
 this case then to this I had also 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.090
 there exposed like this without any folder and 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.649
 is the creepers and more ok in case you do not know 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.200
 remember I do not remember how it works 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.520
 called here is and then if it goes away 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.500
 in this part of here disabled or something 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.780

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.640
