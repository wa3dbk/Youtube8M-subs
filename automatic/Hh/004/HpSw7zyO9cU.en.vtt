the<00:00:35.880> way<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.030> think<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.390> ugly<00:00:36.510> um<00:00:37.579> so<00:00:38.579> I

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
the way I think it's ugly um so I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.530 
the way I think it's ugly um so I
believe<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:40.890> BPA<00:00:41.370> free<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.940> all<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.180> good

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540

believe it's BPA free and all that good
kind<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.960> stuff<00:00:43.520> um<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.940> basically<00:00:45.950> is<00:00:46.950> just

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
kind of stuff um it basically is just

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.139 
kind of stuff um it basically is just
this<00:00:47.879> comes<00:00:48.239> off<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.219> so<00:00:50.219> what<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> toys

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
hangs and the mounting bracket looks

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.350 
hangs and the mounting bracket looks
like<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.060> didn't<00:01:39.240> use

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
like this this is the one we didn't use

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.960 
like this this is the one we didn't use
it<00:01:39.390> comes<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.840> two<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.640> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
it comes with two so the one we have is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.870 
it comes with two so the one we have is
suction<00:01:42.570> cups<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.040> this<00:01:44.040> one<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:44.759> i<00:01:44.820> guess

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
suction cups and this one is for i guess

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.410 
suction cups and this one is for i guess
like<00:01:45.000> tile<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:46.530> would<00:01:46.710> use<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> sticky<00:01:47.420> pads

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
like tile you would use the sticky pads

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.020 
like tile you would use the sticky pads
to<00:01:48.750> stick<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> tile<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.799> then<00:01:50.579> screws

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
to stick it to the tile and then screws

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.450 
to stick it to the tile and then screws
to<00:01:51.240> reinforce<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.979> we're<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> rental

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
to reinforce it we're in a rental

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
to reinforce it we're in a rental

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
type thing so we didn't use the screwin

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.160 
type thing so we didn't use the screwin
one<00:01:58.350> um<00:01:59.420> we<00:02:00.420> put<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:00.869> suction<00:02:01.049> cups

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
