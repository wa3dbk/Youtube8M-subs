00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
time we've seen this kind of behavior in

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400 
time we've seen this kind of behavior in
sharks<00:02:47.940> right<00:02:48.180> yeah<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:48.959> before<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.380> was

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
sharks right yeah because before it was

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.930 
sharks right yeah because before it was

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
like we've seen it in dolphins we've

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.020 
like we've seen it in dolphins we've
seen<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.330> in<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.750> killer<00:02:52.260> whales<00:02:52.620> yes<00:02:53.550> but

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030

never<00:02:54.330> in<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.630> shark<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.050> maybe<00:02:55.260> they're

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
never in a shark so maybe they're

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.260 
never in a shark so maybe they're
actually<00:02:55.739> more<00:02:56.280> intelligent<00:02:56.850> than<00:02:57.030> when<00:02:57.180> we

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
actually more intelligent than when we

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.640 
actually more intelligent than when we
give<00:02:57.450> them<00:02:57.600> credit<00:02:57.780> for<00:02:57.959> maybe<00:02:58.350> there<00:02:58.500> is

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
give them credit for maybe there is

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.350 
give them credit for maybe there is
something<00:02:58.920> going<00:02:59.100> on<00:02:59.489> up<00:02:59.640> there<00:02:59.820> yeah<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.180> mean
