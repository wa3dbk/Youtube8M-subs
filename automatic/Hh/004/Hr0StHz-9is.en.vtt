00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.590
 this video 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.430
 they wait for signals 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.269
 alba I feel like I've been asked how to tacuara themes so fast 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.259
 well there are some videos on youtube and my colleague tilly c 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.759
 but not only because it was the daughter's way 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.239
 I think my career 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.239
 which is the one of lleida álvarez 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.869
 and he does 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.759
 is with its respective supposed times 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.420
 but they fight against the times very easy it counts cakic 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.650
 For example, we have 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.980
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 there we have a lot of time 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.079
 that same time that you never have to count them in the subject 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.079
 for example 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.100
 from where piece 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
 rhythm 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.310
 we count 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.030
 one did 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 untill there 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.120
 i 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.120
 Akron said at the beginning 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.310
 when selecting this process 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.430
 a shtick is created below 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.270
 the ehec 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.990
 and what we do is copy from the two points onwards 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.960
 procope more 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.960
 and that remains in the memory 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.290
 so 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.290
 we go to the base through double click on and 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.000
 I do not like the speed 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.890
 we select double foot 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.890
 de quirón says the reader 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.630
 wolf 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.630
 and we paste the government number just 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.240
 the automatic mind 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.419
 this base of long time nokia with the base is to finish aquara of the subject 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.419
 the voice or what's 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.869
 and we go 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.869
 before that block 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.609
 let's lower the whole world a little bit so that they realize 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:37.489
 smeltz 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.659
 that's 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.400
 then we have complicated the right button click on duplicate 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:47.309
 of located factor of your fishing we are going to put a yeves 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.099
 10 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.099
 and that's all it's easy 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:07.709
 That would be all
