exactly peeking and you see that flash
peeking<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:38.410> another<00:02:38.980> way<00:02:39.220> to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
peeking it's just another way to

peeking it's just another way to
traditional<00:02:40.090> peeking<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.660> get<00:02:40.810> focus<00:02:41.200> set<00:02:41.380> in

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
traditional peeking to get focus set in

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.520 
traditional peeking to get focus set in
so<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.340> can<00:02:42.430> be<00:02:42.550> for<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> camera<00:02:43.720> op<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.260> could<00:02:44.440> be

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
so it can be for a camera op it could be

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.229 
so it can be for a camera op it could be
