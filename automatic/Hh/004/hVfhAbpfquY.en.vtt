00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
ahead and created this an idea I kind of

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.770 
ahead and created this an idea I kind of
stole<00:00:11.490> from<00:00:11.670> prehistoric<00:00:11.880> pest<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.630> many

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
stole from prehistoric pest so many

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.180 
stole from prehistoric pest so many
different<00:00:13.019> since<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.259> made<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.559> more<00:00:13.769> mobile

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
different since I made this more mobile

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.970 
different since I made this more mobile
to<00:00:14.809> retrieve<00:00:15.809> from<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.230> enclosure<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:16.949> I

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
to retrieve from the enclosure so I

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.080 
to retrieve from the enclosure so I
don't<00:00:17.130> stress<00:00:17.250> up<00:00:17.400> my<00:00:17.490> mind<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.910> couldn't

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090

inch<00:00:45.899> light<00:00:46.110> heat<00:00:46.559> emitters<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.070> couple<00:00:47.640> UV

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
inch light heat emitters a couple UV

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.630 
inch light heat emitters a couple UV
spotlight<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.890> make<00:00:50.010> sure<00:00:50.160> she's<00:00:50.370> comfortable

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640

the<00:00:51.000> UVB<00:00:51.270> helps<00:00:51.770> reinforce<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.370> calcium

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the UVB helps reinforce the calcium

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.139 
the UVB helps reinforce the calcium
intake<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.539> while<00:00:54.690> she's<00:00:54.899> grab<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:56.149> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
intake so that while she's grab it the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.650 
intake so that while she's grab it the
eggs<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> little<00:00:58.980> bit<00:00:59.129> stronger<00:00:59.660> that

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
eggs can be a little bit stronger that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.430 
eggs can be a little bit stronger that
is<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.840> fact

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
is a fact

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.060 
is a fact
so<00:01:02.250> UVB<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.600> correct<00:01:03.930> light<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> UV

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
so UVB is the correct light in the UV

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.490 
so UVB is the correct light in the UV
for<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> heat<00:01:05.820> source<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.960> guys<00:01:07.140> want<00:01:07.409> an

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.980 
for a heat source if you guys want an
audio<00:01:07.860> video<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.310> later<00:01:08.750> but<00:01:09.750> yeah
