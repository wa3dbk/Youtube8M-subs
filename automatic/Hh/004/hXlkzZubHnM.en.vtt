throughs so as I select and knowledge

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.839 
throughs so as I select and knowledge
that<00:00:12.809> it's<00:00:13.620> sliding<00:00:13.889> through<00:00:14.370> different

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
that it's sliding through different

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.790 
that it's sliding through different
sections<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.980> 3d<00:00:17.119> mapping<00:00:18.289> so<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> can<00:00:19.590> change

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
sections of 3d mapping so I can change

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.929 
sections of 3d mapping so I can change
between<00:00:20.359> different<00:00:21.359> resolutions<00:00:22.730> voice<00:00:23.730> to

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
between different resolutions voice to

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.220 
between different resolutions voice to
desire<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:28.279> can<00:00:29.279> change<00:00:29.640> scripts<00:00:30.480> as<00:00:30.660> well<00:00:30.840> so

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
desire I can change scripts as well so

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.010 
desire I can change scripts as well so
this<00:00:31.500> brings<00:00:32.369> me<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.329> next<00:00:33.510> phase<00:00:33.630> I

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
this brings me on to the next phase I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
this brings me on to the next phase I
can<00:00:34.649> draw<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> tablet<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> can

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
can draw on the tablet and so I can

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.470 
can draw on the tablet and so I can
change<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.850> size<00:00:39.120> by<00:00:39.750> pressure<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:42.210> can

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
change the size by pressure and I can

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.779 
change the size by pressure and I can
change<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.649> direction<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> screen<00:00:44.579> shift

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
change the direction of the screen shift

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.170 
change the direction of the screen shift
by<00:00:45.030> tilt

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.210 

now<00:00:50.150> what<00:00:51.150> could<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.540> is<00:00:51.900> actually<00:00:52.260> right<00:00:52.740> so

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
now what could do is actually right so

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:03.540 
now what could do is actually right so
let's<00:00:53.400> actually<00:00:53.760> chord<00:00:54.420> something

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.780 

playback

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.340 

you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.219 
you
and<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.100> i<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.490> change<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> width<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
and what i can do is change the width to

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.370 
and what i can do is change the width to
change<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> width<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.799> our<00:01:17.159> budding<00:01:17.570> i<00:01:18.570> can

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
change the width of our budding i can

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
change the width of our budding i can
also<00:01:19.500> check<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.770> screen<00:01:20.130> same<00:01:20.580> time<00:01:20.820> we'll<00:01:21.090> go

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
also check the screen same time we'll go

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:29.570 
also check the screen same time we'll go
ahead<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.330> burst<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.810> i<00:01:26.420> can<00:01:27.560> click<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.549> of

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
ahead and burst it i can click on one of

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.550 
ahead and burst it i can click on one of
these<00:01:29.700> corners<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:30.600> i<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.869> post<00:01:31.080> colors

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
these corners and now i can post colors

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.910 
these corners and now i can post colors
through<00:01:31.920> i<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:33.210> take<00:01:33.840> those<00:01:34.049> colors<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.799> make

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
through i can take those colors and make

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.950 
through i can take those colors and make
that<00:01:35.070> into<00:01:35.130> my<00:01:35.460> palate<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.570> mix<00:01:36.810> that

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that into my palate I can mix that

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.560 
that into my palate I can mix that
portion<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.530> palate<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.789> previous

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
let's go to live video if you can run it

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.470 
let's go to live video if you can run it
through<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:33.890> 3d<00:02:34.890> space<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.579> like<00:02:36.030> we're<00:02:36.239> doing

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
through a 3d space so like we're doing

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.100 
through a 3d space so like we're doing
with<00:02:36.930> still<00:02:37.290> textures

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
with still textures

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.830 
with still textures
the<00:02:39.320> format<00:02:40.450> or<00:02:41.450> move<00:02:41.990> on<00:02:42.140> we<00:02:42.830> can<00:02:43.750> move<00:02:44.750> it

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
the format or move on we can move it

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.510 
the format or move on we can move it
into<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:46.400> set<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.060> crystalline<00:02:47.570> space<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:49.340> could

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
into a set of crystalline space we could

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.300 
into a set of crystalline space we could
control<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:49.910> as<00:02:50.390> well<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.590> this<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:51.980> more

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
control that as well so this is more

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.550 
control that as well so this is more
like<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.490> traditional<00:02:52.700> kaleidoscope<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.470> a

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
like a traditional kaleidoscope so in a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.830 
like a traditional kaleidoscope so in a
new<00:02:54.770> way<00:02:56.890> on<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:59.420> can<00:02:59.600> also<00:02:59.750> take<00:03:00.080> that<00:03:01.840> 2d

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
new way on you can also take that 2d

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.840 
new way on you can also take that 2d
space<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:05.260> do<00:03:06.260> false-color<00:03:06.709> mapping<00:03:07.250> on<00:03:07.459> to

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
space and do false-color mapping on to

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.590 
space and do false-color mapping on to
the<00:03:08.480> video<00:03:09.880> let's<00:03:10.880> change<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.240> palate<00:03:11.570> a

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
the video let's change the palate a

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.390 
the video let's change the palate a
little<00:03:11.690> bit<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.740> can<00:03:15.890> do<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.070> little<00:03:16.220> bit

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
little bit and you can do a little bit

could do full false or full real color
it's<00:03:34.010> up<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:36.320> can<00:03:36.560> also<00:03:37.930> do

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
it's up to you you can also do

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.430 
it's up to you you can also do
interesting<00:03:39.260> things<00:03:39.500> with<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:41.450> set<00:03:42.410> of

interesting things with a set of

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.840 
interesting things with a set of
sequences<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:43.100> can<00:03:43.160> start<00:03:43.430> scratching

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
sequences you can start scratching

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.770 
sequences you can start scratching
frames<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.720> videos<00:03:45.220> so<00:03:46.220> we<00:03:46.700> can<00:03:46.910> set<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.540> be

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
frames the videos so we can set it be

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.090 
frames the videos so we can set it be
for<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.680> front<00:03:48.950> layer<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.780> we<00:03:50.780> can<00:03:50.989> set<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.530> be

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
for the front layer and we can set a be

setting of course can be applied to

setting of course can be applied to
anything<00:04:01.820> so<00:04:02.450> let's<00:04:02.840> change<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:06.070> sequences

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.740 

in<00:04:10.370> MRI<00:04:11.330> or<00:04:11.630> skull<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:14.330> this<00:04:14.510> could<00:04:14.660> be

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
in MRI or skull and this could be

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.840 
in MRI or skull and this could be
controlled<00:04:15.110> by<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.650> think<00:04:15.920> this<00:04:16.040> is<00:04:16.190> just<00:04:17.080> a

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
controlled by you think this is just a

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.039 
controlled by you think this is just a
tablet<00:04:19.850> but<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.269> could<00:04:20.450> be<00:04:20.540> controlling<00:04:20.989> it

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
tablet but I could be controlling it

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.480 
tablet but I could be controlling it
also<00:04:21.410> with<00:04:21.890> a<00:04:22.430> mouse<00:04:23.419> it<00:04:23.810> doesn't<00:04:24.050> matter<00:04:24.490> this

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
also with a mouse it doesn't matter this

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.560 
also with a mouse it doesn't matter this
is<00:04:25.640> just<00:04:25.850> my<00:04:27.130> interface<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:29.960> whole<00:04:30.470> bunch<00:04:30.770> of

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
is just my interface to a whole bunch of

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.610 
is just my interface to a whole bunch of
renderers<00:04:33.610> okay
