00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
only i but our entire team really loves

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.600 
only i but our entire team really loves
is<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.539> maximum<00:00:09.990> SC<00:00:10.410> one<00:00:10.650> they<00:00:11.219> call<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.519> new

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
is the maximum SC one they call it new

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.470 
is the maximum SC one they call it new
bike<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.000> can

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
bike in a can

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.179 
bike in a can
basically<00:00:13.109> it's<00:00:13.350> like<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.500> clear<00:00:13.770> coat<00:00:13.980> is

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:14.189 
basically it's like a clear coat is

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:16.039 
basically it's like a clear coat is
similar<00:00:14.459> to<00:00:14.580> arm<00:00:14.730> roll<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.389> we<00:00:15.719> think<00:00:15.930> it

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
similar to arm roll but we think it

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.929 
similar to arm roll but we think it
works<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.350> whole<00:00:16.379> lot<00:00:16.650> better<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.699> comes

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
works a whole lot better and it comes

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.970 
works a whole lot better and it comes
out<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.390> doesn't<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.810> squirt<00:00:19.170> out<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.710> more

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
out it doesn't like squirt out it's more

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.589 
out it doesn't like squirt out it's more
like<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.310> more<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.519> a<00:00:20.640> film<00:00:20.970> like<00:00:21.179> a<00:00:21.240> spray

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
like it's more like a film like a spray

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.659

aerosol spray and you can coat the whole
area<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.239> whole<00:00:36.390> lot<00:00:36.540> better<00:00:36.720> and<00:00:37.050> then<00:00:37.590> you

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
area a whole lot better and then you

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.960 
area a whole lot better and then you
don't<00:00:37.770> even<00:00:37.830> have<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.100> wipe<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.430> off<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.850> just

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.090 
gets wore out not the well not wore out
but<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:44.810> mean<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.259> stuff<00:01:45.590> starts<00:01:45.860> looking

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
but I mean this stuff starts looking

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.550
