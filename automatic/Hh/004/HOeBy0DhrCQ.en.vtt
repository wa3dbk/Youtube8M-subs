00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.110

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.300
 little gem this little hd pvr is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.370
 really very portable indeed 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.730
 portable and can record up to 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.570
 1080p full hd on both playstation 3 and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.609

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.229
 pc wii ue wii 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.270
 but let's open this fabulous 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.680
 packet and I'll show you what 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.900
 contains this box 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.950
 here is the magic of editing, here we are 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.540
 with all the already beautiful that open 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.450
 dismantled etc. etc. not to create 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.310
 space to the or the given word goes 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.509
 and here we are, that is the content 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.840
 of the box 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.299
 obviously we have our hd pvr that 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.280
 I'll show you here it's really small 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.049
 enter quietly in one hand and 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.720
 this is the power button 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.820
 this is the level of the microphone e 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.049
 this part that I will explain later 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.979
 here we have the webcam entry itself 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.140
 focuses 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.780
 ok here we have done it here 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.060
 we have the door for the microphone from 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.189
 this part we have the usb port for 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.140
 connect a usb stick 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.119
 in case we did not have a 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.770
 computer but we wanted anyway 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.930
 record because this small 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.149
 little gem allows you to record 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.490
 even on a usb stick 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.619
 on the other side on the back we can 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.890
 find the door for feeding of 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.379
 which I will tell you very soon about the entrance av 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.900
 to be able to connect the composite cable 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.319
 you must take your playstation 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.499
 movie director 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.480

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:21.989

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.099
 given an hdmi cable to connect it 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.920
 to your TV a set of cables 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.799

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.359
 male composite having to plug in 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.370
 followed on your playstation 3 e 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.489
 finally the part I preferred in 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.669
 absolute of this hd pvr ie the cable 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.620
 for feeding is a simple one 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:54.959
 kandahar usb connector connected on the 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.939
 back of the fall as many wars as 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.150
 it works in practice if you want to 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:03.689
 connect to your PC via black usb 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.909
 or to your playstation 3 xbox or other 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:08.370
 through the red cable then you can 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.599
 auto power it while you record for 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.340
 summer example recording on one 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.819
 playstation 3 you don't have a socket 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.739
 current 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.949
 you can safely feed it 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.509
 via USB red as I was 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.769
 saying here you will have the entry for the 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.989
 microphone case 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.120
 so if you need to register 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.790
 commentaries bassarÃ  connect yours 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.889
 microphone at this door and you will come 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.859
 elected your microphone level 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.389
 here and here is the demonstration 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.629
 practice what I was saying 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:38.849
 connected the power cord to the 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.739
 computer and as you can see now here 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.479
 is looking for the microphone that I don't have 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.239
 connected because I don't have a microphone 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:46.319
 headphone and my blue yeti microphone 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.009
 has not 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.259
 entry and does not have the 3.5 jack then 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:55.919
 is not picking up his microphone in 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:58.349
 in case you put a microphone with the entrance 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.180
 jack here in these bars yes 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.949
 they will raise will lower depending on the 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.199
 volume level you will receive on 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.939
 microphone then then it will be up to you to raise 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.280
 or lower the microphone level 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.900
 however this little features will give you 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.120
 the opportunity to record commentaries 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.139
 even without a connected microphone 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.409
 to your pc 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.299
 more below we have a series of 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.829
 colorful law that right now 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.810
 they are flashing because it is not 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.080
 connected to the playstation 3 in case 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.910
 open the program and the hd pvr was 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.890
 connected 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.530
 the donation 3 this light would become 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.630
 completely green and red in the case 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.980
 registration began 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.980
 so also a great way to understand 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.600
 if your device is recording 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.330
 or not so to conclude what 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.780
 say of this little hd pvr that great 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.820
 and fantastic and I registered 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.650
 really great if you want vi 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.170
 I leave on below in description i 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.480
 link to go to the site of peace e 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:57.290
 go check with your eyes 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.730
 anything inherent in this hd 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.290
 more wars or anything else 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.030
 of pages if you want 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.480
 currently the market price of 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:09.290
 this small appliance is on the 180 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.410
 euro therefore not exactly cheap but 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.460
 not even as expensive as others 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.610
 equipment more 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.800
 I repeat if you calculate that ultraportable 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.100
 you can record even without having a 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.120
 pc a socket below i would say 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.920
 that the product is worth a lot 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.380
 purchase in more below in 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.140
 description and I will put a link for a

 couple of videos I recorded on mine 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.670
 TV that I have here next to the PC is 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.920
 however I have to first primates the 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.670
 TV in question does not record 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.740
 1080p but records 480 and then the 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.630
 video quality will not be the best but it is 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.060
 more for a TV problem than for 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.490
 hd more wars then said this time
