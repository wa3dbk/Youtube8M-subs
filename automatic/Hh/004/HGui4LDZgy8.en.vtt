00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.950
 Hello friends with you and face and 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.660
 This video is about German 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.390
 anti-tank self-propelled eighth 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.870
 Ferdinand level created by Ferdinand 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.790
 porsche 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.010
 This Fri-Sau was one of the most 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.600
 heavily armed and powerful armored vehicles 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.910
 period of the second world war 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.929
 and what is it in the game 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.839
 let's see 1266 half tons 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:45.730
 weights and 370 meters of review on these 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.339
 Ferdinand indicators do not stand out 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.710
 among other pt of their level and what 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.229
 do we have with dynamics she put it mildly not 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.329
 very engine power porsche 840 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.249
 horses but enough only to 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.679
 Fedya was crawling at speeds of up to thirty 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.229
 kilometers per hour but even so boring 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.449
 he is gaining maximum speed slowly but 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.970
 chassis turning speed 21 degrees in 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.890
 second but what is worth loving ferdinand 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.930
 so it is for his instrument capable 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.390
 hurt everyone who meets on 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.490
 his ways and everything because in service 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.170
 we have mausgan but having a few 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.870
 overestimated characteristics than those 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.900
 that the alpha mouse has 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.590
 in 490 Fedya is charging faster and more accurately 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.840
 shoots 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.120
 add to that the excellent ugreen and and 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.580
 good veins and go to armor 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.090
 in frontal projection, the hull and deckhouse have 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.800
 200 millimeters a board and feed 80 of 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.480
 this we conclude with competent to 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.010
 Fedya's hull gate can withstand 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.180
 shot and tanks up to level eight 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.190
 inclusive 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.590
 but if we let the enemy in the stern as 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.660
 we can already go to the hangar set 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.460
 the equipment is not quite standard due 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.650
 high forces of this disguise we have 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.690
 use rarely therefore 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.290
 take rammer ventilation and drives 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.540
 tips 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.630
 perks for crew members on your screen 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.630
 I propose to watch the fight go 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.790
 so Ferdinand is in front of us 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.830
 there is a classic pt-sau 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.810
 perfectly balanced and possessing 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.970
 formidable armament but he has 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.370
 competitor and rather even alternative 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.110
 shaking the yaguni stand cutoff certain 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.160
 the number of battles for a century panther you 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.380
 a choice appears 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.870
 sits on a faster and more dynamic 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.560
 yagu 2 or choose power and explore 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.560
 ferdinand 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.470
 in fact, I am friends at all desire 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.330
 I can not find benefits from Fedya 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.680
 that would make me choose him 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.230
 they are panther 2 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.360
 here judge yourself absolutely identical 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.250
 guns but on the one hand you 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.049
 waiting for a great speaker and on the other 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.180
 an armor which is not very decisive 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.220
 when you shoot Golda ie 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.840
 fact for what it may be worth 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.370
 choose ferdinand actually turns out 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.370
 almost empty sound 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.930
 but if you do decide on 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.120
 the choice and your hangar appears 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.430
 Ferdinand then the question is how on it 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.260
 play and here everything is simple in the first place as 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.940
 on any other Fri-Sau try not 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.069
 miss the enemy tank in the stern 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.690
 shoot the tracks and after the shot 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.190
 move back to zoom 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.910
 the distance that the enemy will have 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.769
 to overcome 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.050
 and generally make sure not to 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.849
 stay on the flank alone also not 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.500
 forget about on the case gate which 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.940
 will significantly increase your chances of getting 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.940
 ricochet breakthrough 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.380
 you should also be prepared for 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.000
 Ferdinand glows almost after 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.760
 each shot is to blame 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.560
 quite big and tall silhouette Fri shki 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.550
 so if possible, pick up 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.040
 position on the cards 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.530
 based on what criteria bot position 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.420
 should be protected from artillery if 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.250
 this is an open map then look for points on 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.260
 which will be double bushes if 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.330
 urban then choose loopholes or 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.040
 buildings in which the art does not throw and 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.930
 always try to stay behind 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.520
 allies because Mausgan is free 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.790
 allows you to accurately shoot at large 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.790
 distances 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.710
 let's summarize plus ferdinand it's him 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.510
 exact weapon but don't forget what it is 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.250
 at the same time plus yagi 2 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.950
 for everything else from my point of view 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.570
 Fed ok panther inferior but worth 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.730
 remember that our hero did not exist 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.370
 only on paper but was real powerful and 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.800
 awesome fighting machine unlike yagi 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.690
 remaining only sketches so if you 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.950
 play the world of tanks partly and for that 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.840
 to join the story 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.000
 tank building then maybe ferdinand 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.620
 would be a great choice on this from me 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.930
 all subscribe to wot fan 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.790
 and see reviews from freeda squirrels pony 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.750
 with you as always was good to see you
