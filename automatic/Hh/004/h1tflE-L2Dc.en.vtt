Hi. It’s Mr. Andersen and this AP Physics
essentials video 126. It is on the wave-particle

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.199
duality of light. There is an old story of
four blind men and an elephant and they are

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.589
each touching it at a different point. And
so this guy says it is pointy. This one says

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.869
it is strong and sturdy like a tree. This
one say it is flat like a wall. And this one

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.880
says it is a snake. Now they are all right.
They are all just touching different parts

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.489
of the elephant. And light is like that. Depending
on our scale it can bee both a wave and a

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.199
particle. And so light travels as photons.
And those photons can act as waves and particles.

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.920
Evidence that showed us they are waves is
their interference. They can interfere with

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.190
one another, sometimes build up the waves.
Sometimes build them down. And they also,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.010
if we look at them as a particle, the photoelectric
effect tells us that photons are quantized.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.460
They travel in these discrete units, like
particles. And so if you are a physics student

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.199
or physicist how do you know which model to
use? Well it really depends on a sense of

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.040
scale. And so we would use a wave model if
the size of the objects that we are measuring

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.200
are comparable to the wavelength of the light.
And we would use the particle model if the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.180
energy that we are studying is comparable
to the energy of a photon, remember which

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.200
is described as Plank’s constant times the
frequency of the photon itself. Let me give

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.840
you a little bit of history. The first person
to tackle this issue was Isaac Newton. And

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.990
he thought that it travelled in these small
microscopic corpuscles or these small particles.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.960
And then finally Thomas Young looked at that
evidence, gathered more evidence and said

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.750
that they are waves. And so scientists looked
at this for hundreds of years. And so if we

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.420
kind of look at all of the evidence and kind
of go through those two particle and wave

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.990
models, we could first start with reflection.
Do they bounce off objects? And we would say

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.120
yes and yes. If we look at refraction, can
they bend as they move from one medium to

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.420
another? We would say yes and yes. If we look
at interference, can they interfere with one

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.000
another? The particle model does not hold
up. They cannot interfere with one another.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.480
But the wave does. Do they diffract, do they
bend around objects or as you go through an

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.740
opening? We would say particle no. We would
say wave yes. What about can they be polarized?

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.540
In other words when they are traveling in
one dimension can we use small slits to just

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.300
limit the amount who go through? We would
say no and we would say for waves. So waves

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.670
are looking great. And finally the photoelectric
effect came around. And Einstein came around.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.530
And what it showed is that the wave model
does not work. Only the particle model works.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.790
And so now we have a duality, this view of
light as both a wave and a particle. And so

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.240
what is the answer? Well both are right. And
so how do we know which model to use? Again,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.460
it is a sense of scale. And so if we are looking
at objects that are comparable to the wavelength

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.680
of the light then we use the wave model. But
if we are looking at experiments where the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.040
energy is comparable to the energy of a photon,
it is going to be a really small amount of

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.150
energy, then we have to treat them as a particle.
And so did you learn to select a model that

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.400
is going to be appropriate for measuring photons?
It all comes down to the size of the wavelength,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:33.240
the size of the energy and I hope that was
helpful.
