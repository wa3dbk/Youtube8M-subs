00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.030
 since bought a few small things and 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.710
 I also wanted that very quickly 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.710
 I have three of them 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.970
 new or even three of these new ones 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.160
 nail polish brought to me 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.590
 By this time I'll be that color 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.490
 you like to take pictures and the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.019
 insert here 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.019
 because you do not recognize that much 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:56.280
 it looks quite thickly applied 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.690
 I find the skin tone very nice color 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.449
 really looks really nice yes my 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.290
 Canada returns to watch what I call 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.840
 next, use 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.990
 so that's it just continue with the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.990
 next 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.509
 have I thought for Christmas now 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.509
 also very good 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.520
 kenny macaskill 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.130
 ask very very classy I find them the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.390
 I 'm going to make a fat one 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.710
 layer but there if I always think 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.930
 we need another one for that 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.480
 mostly at these centers at least 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.770
 two layers but needs looks for 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.930
 also quite good 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.220
 also very pretty in a layer 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.430
 First of all, I have a second one 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.720
 make it but they are absolutely beautiful 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.830
 I always find it dry 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.210
 it still has a nail polish 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.250
 now ground the same 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.070
 slide with you from Manhattan 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.459
 a buy by the so cool he found is 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.700
 have experience from this current and 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.760
 where is the name above is the cross 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.110
 berry is a very interesting fact 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.690
 we do for bern looks quite 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:34.200
 different from a vial to bury 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.200
 shade with a green tinge 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.480
 I look up very self 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:44.440
 my fans is so far a 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.390
 sau coal color full of effect I 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.650
 I think you like it sometimes 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.650
 a second layer over it 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.670
 So this end effect really 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.579
 really comes to retribution you're doing 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.290
 really always a second layer 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:06.260
 So those are my nail polishes very much 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.780
 pretty a very nice constellation 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.489
 findig if you incidentally times have information 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.260
 want to do this plastic things 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.989
 nail polish swatch around I have so far 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.239
 yes, this one always uses this one 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.650
 Mails of cosmetics cost and have me 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.859
 also always asked a lot so 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.480
 By the way, yes, I'm writing now 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.829
 but switched to this one knows 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.930
 but fell practically you're easy 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.239
 one can sing here on the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.010
 chopsticks wonderful names so if there 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.569
 want to have over it again where I you 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.389
 have and everything there is no extra 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.040
 By the way, I was the same way 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.049
 right that I'm in the dm times very fast 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.060
 what filmed of these nail polishes 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.859
 I also have a little bit of that 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.090
 filmed a page about it but then 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.980
 no more was then came already 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.419
 saleswoman and I have indeed ever 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.739

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.340

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.799
 come 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.629
 but yes I have just now 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:57.139
 no one is allowed to actually mine 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.189
 because of that a film and mdm 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.389
 especially the nail polishes I have you 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.389
 the movie with the switches 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.000
 the situation is 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.200
 especially good 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.030
 funny about the huge profits 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.509
 si 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.289
 Berlin 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.150
 so is active I have three nail polish 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.510
 bought me now and then I have me 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:53.380
 even me discovered that is that 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:57.610
 strained by the sanity like that is 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.620
 yes I liked that and chaos 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.330
 Chaos and I have my eyelashes 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.960
 Serum after bought because the other almost 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.610
 is empty 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.230
 that was it all over again 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.389
 very small holters and i wanted to go ahead 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.840
 All the same, the p2 nail polishes show the 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.360
 9 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.690
 and now I will be in front of the 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.340
 put fan and madness the 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.930
 Last sunbeams make in this 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.280
 year as well as you should enjoy 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.780
 but I'm not anymore 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.169
 I got used to the feeling that I am 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.700
 again , as I said hardly ever 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.380
 they were a bit cold 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.770
 autumn and very warm and it works 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.060
 not at all 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.070
 No, I 'm so happy about that 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.470
 little sun what we still get and 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.500
 but I am already wondering why 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.940
 I only bought three nail it lies 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.000
 just because I have so many 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.130
 already have and above all this and 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.780
 style varnishes I already have some and 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.000
 this whole glittering effect was there 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.440
 I already have so much at home, yes 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.820
 That's why I decided that now 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.900
 do not take any with you this time 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.250
 maybe this will happen someday 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.789
 that you are after a purchase but only now 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.919
 I do not believe that I am enough 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.240
 the last time at home but I say 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.470
 it really nice bayernhafen though 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.320
 not as much as I got there 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.970
 I am also happy to take some with you 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.789
 then I would say what is it 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:10.050
 again a small tight yes hall video 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:12.640
 in the mini hall really only very small and 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.610
 I will now put it from the fan 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.440
 is overused it next time 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.440
 I want to go back bye bye
