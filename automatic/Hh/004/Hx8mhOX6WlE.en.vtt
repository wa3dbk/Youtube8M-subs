retainer afterwards as long as I was
supposed<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.530> so<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.580> lot<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.789> my<00:00:26.940> teeth<00:00:27.180> shifted

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.170 
supposed to so a lot of my teeth shifted
and<00:00:28.140> my<00:00:28.590> main<00:00:28.830> two<00:00:29.100> issues<00:00:29.550> were<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.970> my

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
and my main two issues were that my

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.880 
and my main two issues were that my
bottom<00:00:30.510> teeth<00:00:30.750> became<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:31.320> crooked<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
bottom teeth became really crooked and

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.299 
bottom teeth became really crooked and
crowded<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:33.390> also<00:00:33.720> have<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.620> cross<00:00:34.920> bite

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
crowded and I also have a cross bite

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.670 
crowded and I also have a cross bite
which<00:00:36.030> you've<00:00:36.449> probably<00:00:36.660> heard<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.470> an

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
which you've probably heard of an

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.470 
which you've probably heard of an
overbite<00:00:38.040> which<00:00:38.430> means<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:38.880> front<00:00:39.120> teeth<00:00:39.300> are

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
overbite which means the front teeth are

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.139 
overbite which means the front teeth are
kind<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.410> protruding<00:00:40.950> an<00:00:41.160> underbite<00:00:41.910> which

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
kind of protruding an underbite which

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.520 
kind of protruding an underbite which
means<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> bottom<00:00:42.720> teeth<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:42.960> protruding

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
means the bottom teeth are protruding

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.729 
means the bottom teeth are protruding
but<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> cross<00:00:44.370> bite<00:00:44.790> means<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:46.380> bottom

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
but a cross bite means that the bottom

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
but a cross bite means that the bottom
half<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.190> jaw<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.670> slightly<00:00:48.149> off<00:00:48.719> of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
half of your jaw is slightly off of

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.870 
half of your jaw is slightly off of
alignment<00:00:49.649> from<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> top<00:00:50.280> half<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.700> jaw

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
alignment from the top half of your jaw

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.020 
alignment from the top half of your jaw
and<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.899> still<00:00:52.230> isn't<00:00:52.440> perfect<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.879> can

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
and it still isn't perfect and you can

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.490 
and it still isn't perfect and you can
still<00:00:54.239> sometimes<00:00:54.390> see<00:00:54.780> probably<00:00:55.200> in<00:00:55.379> my

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
still sometimes see probably in my

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.860 
still sometimes see probably in my
videos<00:00:55.800> or<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.190> pictures<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.760> me<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.450> my<00:00:57.629> jaw

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
videos or in pictures of me that my jaw

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.299 
videos or in pictures of me that my jaw
is<00:00:58.079> slightly<00:00:58.860> crooked

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
is slightly crooked

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.490 
is slightly crooked
but<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.120> lot<00:01:00.360> better<00:01:00.600> than<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.260> before

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
but it's a lot better than it was before

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.680 
but it's a lot better than it was before
the<00:01:01.860> Invisalign<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.149> think<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.390> dentist

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the Invisalign and I think my dentist

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.889 
the Invisalign and I think my dentist
told<00:01:03.840> me<00:01:04.050> that<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.070> full<00:01:05.550> 100%<00:01:06.210> correction

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
told me that to get full 100% correction

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.080 
told me that to get full 100% correction
I<00:01:06.990> would<00:01:07.080> actually<00:01:07.410> need<00:01:07.530> surgery<00:01:08.009> so<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.759> was

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
close-up of my mouth now and you'll see

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.040 
close-up of my mouth now and you'll see
that<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:50.340> snaggletooth<00:01:50.819> is<00:01:51.119> now<00:01:51.300> tucked

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
that that one snaggletooth is now tucked

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.290 
that that one snaggletooth is now tucked
up<00:01:52.259> underneath<00:01:52.739> my<00:01:53.399> top<00:01:53.640> teeth<00:01:53.940> where<00:01:54.209> it's

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
up underneath my top teeth where it's

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.089 
up underneath my top teeth where it's
supposed<00:01:54.599> to<00:01:54.690> be<00:01:57.289> here's<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.440> before<00:01:58.739> picture

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
supposed to be here's the before picture

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.699 
supposed to be here's the before picture
again<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.539> did<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:01.050> quite<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.410> bit<00:02:01.619> of

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
again so I did get quite a bit of

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.740 
again so I did get quite a bit of
correction<00:02:02.099> from<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.280> Invisalign<00:02:02.729> my<00:02:03.479> teeth

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
correction from the Invisalign my teeth

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.870 
correction from the Invisalign my teeth
still<00:02:04.349> aren't<00:02:04.560> perfect<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.399> think<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:05.789> you

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
still aren't perfect I think if you

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760 
still aren't perfect I think if you
actually<00:02:06.030> want<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.690> perfect<00:02:07.229> movie<00:02:07.560> star

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
actually want to have perfect movie star

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.320 
actually want to have perfect movie star
teeth<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.550> would<00:02:08.640> probably<00:02:08.970> need<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.149> get

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
teeth you would probably need to get

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.020 
teeth you would probably need to get
veneers<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.530> was<00:02:10.920> happy<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> results

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
veneers but I was happy with the results

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.160 
veneers but I was happy with the results
and<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.599> would<00:02:12.720> definitely<00:02:13.050> recommend

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
and I would definitely recommend

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.440 
and I would definitely recommend
Invisalign<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.819> think<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.060> best<00:02:15.239> thing

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
Invisalign and I think the best thing

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.050 
Invisalign and I think the best thing
about<00:02:15.480> Invisalign<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.469> the<00:02:17.010> fact<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.819> is

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
about Invisalign is the fact that it is

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.920 
about Invisalign is the fact that it is
close<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> invisible

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
close to invisible

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.509 
close to invisible
and<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:20.230> can<00:02:20.409> still<00:02:20.650> kind<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.099> go<00:02:21.189> about<00:02:21.310> your

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
and you can still kind of go about your

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.910 
and you can still kind of go about your
life<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.090> people<00:02:22.689> don't<00:02:22.780> see<00:02:23.109> big<00:02:23.439> metal

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
little bit just so that the teeth will

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.970 
little bit just so that the teeth will
fit<00:02:58.389> correctly<00:02:58.629> and<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.620> they'll<00:02:59.769> all<00:02:59.859> be

can<00:03:24.310> brush<00:03:24.519> your<00:03:24.669> teeth<00:03:24.790> after<00:03:25.120> eating<00:03:25.150> and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
can brush your teeth after eating and

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.420 
can brush your teeth after eating and
put<00:03:25.629> your<00:03:25.720> liners<00:03:26.049> back<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.440> I<00:03:26.650> know<00:03:27.010> it's<00:03:27.370> a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
put your liners back in I know it's a

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.849 
put your liners back in I know it's a
huge<00:03:27.609> pain<00:03:27.849> in<00:03:27.909> the<00:03:28.090> butt<00:03:28.239> but<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:28.870> still<00:03:29.590> think

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
huge pain in the butt but I still think

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.439 
huge pain in the butt but I still think
it's<00:03:30.010> worth<00:03:30.069> it<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.459> have<00:03:30.609> these<00:03:30.909> instead<00:03:31.359> of

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
it's worth it to have these instead of

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.619 
it's worth it to have these instead of
braces<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.290> my<00:03:33.129> teeth<00:03:33.370> took<00:03:33.639> about<00:03:33.849> a<00:03:33.909> year<00:03:34.000> to

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
braces and my teeth took about a year to

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.229 
braces and my teeth took about a year to
correct<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.379> I<00:03:35.799> think<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:36.370> length<00:03:36.909> of<00:03:37.060> time

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
correct and I think the length of time

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.509 
correct and I think the length of time
can<00:03:37.419> vary<00:03:37.449> depending<00:03:37.959> on<00:03:38.379> how<00:03:38.859> bad<00:03:39.129> your<00:03:39.280> teeth

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
can vary depending on how bad your teeth

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.490 
can vary depending on how bad your teeth
are<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.090> could<00:03:40.269> take<00:03:40.510> maybe<00:03:40.720> six<00:03:41.169> to<00:03:41.349> nine

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
are it could take maybe six to nine

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.500 
are it could take maybe six to nine
months<00:03:41.889> or<00:03:41.979> it<00:03:42.069> might<00:03:42.220> take<00:03:42.459> over<00:03:42.609> a<00:03:42.760> year<00:03:43.180> it

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
months or it might take over a year it

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.909 
months or it might take over a year it
really<00:03:43.750> just<00:03:43.900> depends<00:03:44.260> on<00:03:44.560> what<00:03:44.799> your

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
really just depends on what your

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.920 
really just depends on what your
situation<00:03:45.099> is<00:03:45.609> and<00:03:45.639> how<00:03:45.939> much<00:03:46.180> correction<00:03:46.479> you

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
situation is and how much correction you

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.749 
situation is and how much correction you
want<00:03:47.169> to<00:03:47.260> have<00:03:47.409> on<00:03:47.439> your<00:03:47.590> teeth<00:03:47.919> and<00:03:48.129> once<00:03:48.609> your

a permanent set of retainers which are a

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.879 
a permanent set of retainers which are a
little<00:03:58.269> bit<00:03:58.449> thicker<00:03:58.750> than<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.319> ones<00:03:59.769> that

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
little bit thicker than the ones that

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.530 
little bit thicker than the ones that
they<00:04:00.069> use<00:04:00.280> when<00:04:00.549> you're<00:04:00.699> correcting<00:04:01.449> your

they use when you're correcting your
teeth<00:04:01.810> because<00:04:02.590> your<00:04:02.859> permanent<00:04:03.159> set<00:04:03.400> of

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.670 
teeth because your permanent set of
retainers<00:04:03.879> you<00:04:04.599> are<00:04:04.900> supposed<00:04:05.199> to<00:04:05.259> wear<00:04:05.409> every

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
retainers you are supposed to wear every

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.589 
retainers you are supposed to wear every
night<00:04:05.829> just<00:04:05.859> sort<00:04:06.310> of<00:04:06.340> indefinitely<00:04:06.909> and<00:04:07.509> I

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
night just sort of indefinitely and I

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.539 
night just sort of indefinitely and I
have<00:04:07.750> found<00:04:08.019> that<00:04:08.169> after<00:04:08.349> about<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.739> year<00:04:08.859> you

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
have found that after about a year you

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.039 
have found that after about a year you
can<00:04:09.729> start<00:04:09.970> wearing<00:04:10.180> them<00:04:10.269> every<00:04:10.569> other<00:04:10.599> night

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
can start wearing them every other night

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.420 
can start wearing them every other night
so<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.590> don't<00:04:11.739> have<00:04:11.799> to<00:04:11.919> wear<00:04:12.040> them<00:04:12.159> every

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
so you don't have to wear them every

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.819 
so you don't have to wear them every
single<00:04:12.669> night<00:04:12.970> but<00:04:13.540> for<00:04:14.139> a<00:04:14.169> while<00:04:14.470> at<00:04:14.799> least

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
single night but for a while at least

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.860 
single night but for a while at least
afterwards<00:04:15.819> you<00:04:16.060> will<00:04:16.180> have<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.479> wear<00:04:16.630> them<00:04:16.780> at

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
afterwards you will have to wear them at

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.479 
afterwards you will have to wear them at
night<00:04:17.079> but<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.829> great<00:04:17.979> thing<00:04:18.159> is<00:04:18.190> that<00:04:18.310> you

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
night but the great thing is that you

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.710 
night but the great thing is that you
don't<00:04:18.639> have<00:04:18.789> to<00:04:18.909> wear<00:04:19.000> them<00:04:19.209> during<00:04:19.509> the<00:04:19.630> day

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
don't have to wear them during the day

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.420 
don't have to wear them during the day
anymore<00:04:20.079> once<00:04:20.620> your<00:04:20.769> teeth<00:04:20.889> are<00:04:21.009> corrected

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
anymore once your teeth are corrected

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.700 
anymore once your teeth are corrected
and<00:04:21.639> your<00:04:21.820> teeth<00:04:21.970> will<00:04:22.120> be<00:04:22.240> nice<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.710> straight

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
and your teeth will be nice and straight

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.830 
and your teeth will be nice and straight
and<00:04:23.979> I<00:04:24.340> think<00:04:24.520> once<00:04:24.699> rid<00:04:24.909> of<00:04:25.000> side<00:04:25.270> bonus<00:04:25.659> of

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
and I think once rid of side bonus of

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.769 
and I think once rid of side bonus of
having<00:04:25.900> aligners<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.949> wear<00:04:27.159> at<00:04:27.430> night<00:04:27.460> is<00:04:28.000> that

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:28.779 
having aligners to wear at night is that

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:30.750 
having aligners to wear at night is that
if<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.200> have<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.409> problem<00:04:29.860> with<00:04:30.010> grinding<00:04:30.520> or

with<00:04:57.459> bleach<00:04:57.839> that<00:04:58.839> didn't<00:04:59.019> really<00:04:59.199> sound

00:04:59.369 --> 00:04:59.379 
with bleach that didn't really sound

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.959 
with bleach that didn't really sound

right

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
right
anyway<00:05:00.969> I<00:05:00.999> basically<00:05:01.779> use<00:05:02.169> this<00:05:02.469> syringe<00:05:03.009> and

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:03.989 
anyway I basically use this syringe and

00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:07.199 
anyway I basically use this syringe and
put<00:05:04.989> the<00:05:05.199> bleach<00:05:05.499> into<00:05:05.889> the<00:05:06.369> Invisalign<00:05:06.879> trays

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:07.209 
put the bleach into the Invisalign trays

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:09.779 
put the bleach into the Invisalign trays
every<00:05:07.599> once<00:05:07.809> in<00:05:07.929> a<00:05:08.019> while<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.529> in<00:05:09.399> that<00:05:09.610> way

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
every once in a while and in that way

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.909 
every once in a while and in that way
I'm<00:05:09.999> able<00:05:10.149> to<00:05:10.479> keep<00:05:10.899> my<00:05:11.050> teeth<00:05:11.289> bleached<00:05:11.649> and<00:05:11.860> I

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
I'm able to keep my teeth bleached and I

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.199 
I'm able to keep my teeth bleached and I
actually<00:05:12.099> haven't<00:05:12.490> done<00:05:12.580> it<00:05:12.849> in<00:05:12.909> a<00:05:13.029> while

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:13.209 
actually haven't done it in a while

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:15.239 
actually haven't done it in a while
which<00:05:13.449> hopefully<00:05:13.929> didn't<00:05:14.889> gross<00:05:15.039> you<00:05:15.219> out

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:15.249 
which hopefully didn't gross you out

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.540 
which hopefully didn't gross you out
with<00:05:15.580> my<00:05:15.759> slightly<00:05:16.269> yellow<00:05:16.659> teeth<00:05:16.929> but<00:05:17.550> I'll

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
with my slightly yellow teeth but I'll

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.679 
with my slightly yellow teeth but I'll
probably<00:05:18.729> start<00:05:18.999> doing<00:05:19.029> it<00:05:19.240> again<00:05:19.389> soon<00:05:19.629> so

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:19.689 
probably start doing it again soon so

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:21.299
