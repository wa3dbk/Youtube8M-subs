00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 from 7 May 2014 or from the day in 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.810
 which were announced two remakes of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.849
 are already starting to circulate on the web 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.670
 many many images that should 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.160
 at least presumably contain those 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.740
 that the graphics will be the changes e 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.750
 all the rest concerning pokémon omega 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.310
 ruby and alpha software these images 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.109
 therefore they are running everywhere 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.670
 surely you have already seen it but 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.590
 take advantage of this video to see them 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.500
 together with you analyze them and maybe 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.170
 try to figure out if they are really fake 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 or you could have implications 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 rightly so these images 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.200
 if we really have to take it to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.239
 letter the whole are fake 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.700
 however I can't deny that some 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.789
 elements could be very similar 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.289
 or resumed with more or less fidelity 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.960
 from the images we will go to it a 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.340
 see so let's start this is one 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 of the first images you start a 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.180
 shoot on the web since they have been 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.430
 announced the two remakes in it we see 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.370
 precisely big talk with rayquaza 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.260
 in the center a small screen where there is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.449
 the choice of starter with tricot in 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.979
 ahead leave in which rayquaza more but 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.500
 from heaven to make peace between two 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.700
 autoreti ogre a scene of rayquaza in 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.950
 fight 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.600
 the three starters with a question mark 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.630
 regarding their mega 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.390
 evolution apart to ask ourselves that we already have 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.380
 he has it and therefore he should 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.409
 also allow the other two starters 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.750
 to have it is a hypothetical new form of 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.880
 rayquaza which emerged only as 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.259
 black silhouette could be one 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.600
 evolution could be a new one 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.340
 however no shape is known as I already have 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.840
 said this fake picture therefore not 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.030
 we can expect nothing true for 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.770
 regarding this small element 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.869
 returning to the screenshots the choice would say 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.159
 something that rains from the sky is original 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.229
 obviously of emerald 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.840
 however I do not deny that it could be 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.689
 a good idea to include it also in omega 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.920
 alpha rupees sapphire the image of struggle 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.500
 to say what we see down there 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.350
 it could really be that way 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.110
 the graphics should at least I believe to be 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.630
 like that of pokémon xy the screen 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.399
 some starters could also be 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.380
 this for the averages 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.880
 evolutions of starter pigs that we 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.520
 so I don't see why 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.950
 they should also give it to tricot and markit 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.020
 in the second very small picture 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.400
 unfortunately we can see on the right 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.190
 what would appear to be the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.989
 route 101 while on the left we can 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.550
 see what the should be 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.980
 tour in the maine ferro that connects 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.510
 mentalià in ferrugia coli where we can 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.830
 find at the entrance of course 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.860
 the adventurer who gives us one 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.870
 hidden car and the two guys that 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.430
 I am a right and a left and I am 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.530
 divided by the rocks that can be 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.090
 split the graphic into a rock breaker 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.549
 especially the maine tour 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.250
 iron is really very well made it 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.720
 style is that of xy rightly so 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.640
 at the end it could be reproduced 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.340
 in this way the third image 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.959
 brings us four more elements at the top 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.599
 we can see another small piece 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.450
 of the tunnel man iron precisely that 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.640
 in which we go to recover pico the wing 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.590
 to the of the marine who was kidnapped 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.170
 by a tm recruit as we can 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.569
 see we maticki behind us and 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.310
 which could make you think they could 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.810
 I'm not saying they will but 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.630
 could take inspiration from art 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.519
 gold and soul silver and pokémon yellow and 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.019
 let us be followed once again 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.090
 from the starter would be a good idea 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.650
 however at the bottom we see I believe the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.269
 images and more fake I've ever seen 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.640
 in all my life and I don't talk 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.910
 only remakes of oren or one 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.859
 possible mega evolution of oneself tile that 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.389
 to the wings rios we vern and the back of 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.310
 I really don't want to say anything 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.170
 about why this image is more 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.970
 fake my poles for the viola then 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.650
 forget the other two images 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.340
 they represent what they should 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.519
 being the maps just as we know it is 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.970
 been revealed on twitter of people 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.530
 involved that there will be new areas 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.480
 as well as the map will be changed but that there 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.799
 will be new areas so for now not 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.510
 I want to express opinions on a map 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.760
 because I believe we will have new ones 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.530
 Information later in the last 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.720
 images of today instead we can see 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.269
 three elements at the top we have a 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.190
 small island with a cave in the middle 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.170
 unfortunately I don't remember right now 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.510
 what area is below we can see 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.430
 another small mass island 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.129
 in the water while in the image to the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.319
 center is easily recognized as it comes 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.450
 represented the Mr. cottage 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.299
 marine what we can take from 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.979
 the ship to go to bluvia the cottage e 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.079
 really very well done in 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.410
 this image with two oars resting 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.479
 on a wall a typical sailor porthole 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.150
 and a blue curtain with light and dark stripes 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.400
 with the typical bridge if this were 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.840
 really the graphics of the remakes I have to 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.440
 tell you that I would be really very much 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.030
 happy 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.919
 however I believe we will have new news 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.560
 shortly so for now we do not stay 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.539
 other than waiting and continuing 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.639
 go around on the internet to find out 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.639
 new things to increase our aip
