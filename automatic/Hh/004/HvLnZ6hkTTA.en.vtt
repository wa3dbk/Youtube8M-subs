would recommend going for printed Styles
like<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.640> they're<00:01:29.880> actually<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
like this because they're actually the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.300 
like this because they're actually the
same<00:01:30.659> brand<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.229> also<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.619> plain<00:01:31.920> colors

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
but the plain colors when they do

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.810 
but the plain colors when they do
stretch<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.009> when<00:01:35.220> you're<00:01:35.340> doing<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> squat

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.200 
like sagginess and beginners in the
knees<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.310> ankles<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:45.060> you're

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
knees and ankles so I think if you're

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.609 
knees and ankles so I think if you're
doing<00:01:45.390> cardio<00:01:45.600> you're<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.200> running<00:01:46.530> around

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
doing cardio you're just running around

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.560 
doing cardio you're just running around
definitely<00:01:47.310> go<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.670> plain<00:01:48.030> colors<00:01:48.360> they're

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
definitely go for plain colors they're

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.999 
definitely go for plain colors they're
great<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.320> doing<00:01:49.530> anything<00:01:49.860> that's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
great but if you doing anything that's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.210 
great but if you doing anything that's
stretchy<00:01:50.399> or<00:01:50.939> squats<00:01:51.840> always<00:01:52.290> go<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:52.920> print

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
stretchy or squats always go for print

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.859 
stretchy or squats always go for print
because<00:01:53.610> then<00:01:53.759> nobody<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.360> see<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
because then nobody can see you on the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.410 
because then nobody can see you on the
word<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.200> that's<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.530> plus<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.219> next<00:01:56.299> one<00:01:57.299> of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
word and that's a plus so up next one of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660 
word and that's a plus so up next one of
my<00:01:57.509> favorite<00:01:57.899> ladies<00:01:58.110> number<00:01:58.619> two<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.250> by

I'll put a link below and I just wanted
to<00:02:06.210> say<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.540> I've<00:02:06.659> had

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
to say that I've had

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.400 
to say that I've had
for<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.920> think<00:02:08.640> almost<00:02:08.910> two<00:02:09.270> months<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.840> I

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
for I think almost two months and I

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.890 
for I think almost two months and I
definitely<00:02:10.590> wash<00:02:11.040> them<00:02:11.280> over<00:02:11.670> 15<00:02:12.210> or<00:02:12.300> 20<00:02:12.660> times

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
definitely wash them over 15 or 20 times

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.930 
definitely wash them over 15 or 20 times
and<00:02:13.170> they<00:02:13.770> still<00:02:14.040> keep<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.370> color<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.700> will

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and they still keep the color I will

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.240 
and they still keep the color I will
show<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.150> how<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.420> look<00:02:15.600> again<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.100> they

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
show you how to look again so they

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.190

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
standing or what do you think I would

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.740 
standing or what do you think I would
say<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.800> sometimes<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:39.210> get<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.420> little

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
say is that sometimes you get a little

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.390 
say is that sometimes you get a little
like<00:02:39.930> thread<00:02:40.230> pools<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.890> don't<00:02:41.190> know<00:02:41.250> if<00:02:41.310> you

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
like thread pools I don't know if you

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.820 
like thread pools I don't know if you
can<00:02:41.580> see<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.820> here<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.530> yeah<00:02:43.530> I've<00:02:43.620> heard<00:02:43.770> a

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
can see it here and yeah I've heard a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.500 
can see it here and yeah I've heard a
couple<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.340> thread<00:02:44.640> pools<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.090> once<00:02:45.330> you

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
couple of like thread pools but once you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.390 
couple of like thread pools but once you
pull<00:02:45.720> those<00:02:45.870> threads<00:02:46.200> nothing<00:02:47.100> really<00:02:47.340> is

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
pull those threads nothing really is

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.430 
pull those threads nothing really is
going<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:48.060> definitely<00:02:48.510> great<00:02:48.780> quality

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
going on so definitely great quality

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.130 
going on so definitely great quality
it's<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.610> bit<00:02:50.760> pricey<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.510> if<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.780> live<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.050> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
it's a bit pricey and if you live in the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.560 
it's a bit pricey and if you live in the
UK<00:02:52.260> have<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.770> pay<00:02:52.920> tax<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.520> but<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.390> way

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
UK have to pay tax on it but in a way

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.360 
UK have to pay tax on it but in a way
it's<00:02:54.780> really<00:02:54.870> worth<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.740> every<00:02:56.130> time<00:02:56.280> I

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
it's really worth it and every time I

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.550 
it's really worth it and every time I
wear<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.580> I'm<00:02:56.790> like<00:02:56.940> yes<00:02:57.330> next<00:02:57.810> xx<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.410> this

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
wear it I'm like yes next xx so this

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.440 
wear it I'm like yes next xx so this
actually<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> cheapest<00:02:59.400> leggings<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.880> own<00:03:00.120> and

actually the cheapest leggings I own and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.820 
actually the cheapest leggings I own and
the<00:03:00.570> reason<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:00.960> not<00:03:01.080> because<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.470> brand<00:03:01.710> is

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
the reason is not because the brand is

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.620 
the reason is not because the brand is
cheap<00:03:02.070> but<00:03:02.220> because<00:03:02.460> I<00:03:02.490> go<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.700> my<00:03:02.820> TK<00:03:03.240> Maxx<00:03:03.450> in

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
cheap but because I go to my TK Maxx in

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.590 
cheap but because I go to my TK Maxx in
London<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:05.100> have<00:03:05.460> to<00:03:05.700> say<00:03:05.910> these<00:03:06.420> are<00:03:06.480> the

language<00:03:06.900> number<00:03:06.990> three<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:08.190> brand<00:03:08.490> is<00:03:08.670> key

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
