00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:10.730
 minecraft 126.2 and let's see the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.250
 major changes that do not 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.860
 they have been solved but as 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.600
 forty-something course is not in 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.200
 account and something 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.250
 there are so many right so we're going to 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.250
 see what happened 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.099
 let's see what happens 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:38.610
 serious is that this cost me in a 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.610
 circuit quite boy not boy 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.469
 now we are going to see it 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.430
 and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.620
 so it has been added mainly 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.090
 so it looks at very lively point 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.430
 as you know it and all 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:07.260
 the pre realizes is the reality 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.260
 much much much change 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.910
 it was just a bug fix 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.280
 but enough is pretty enough 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:25.260
 quite rasta is killing a position that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.280
 they are bisbal in these zombies is not 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.280
 so so 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.270
 and what 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.229
 good 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.350
 Health 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.070
 once 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.070
 like 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:05.890
 to see look at the village boy 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:10.649
 I'm pretty hurt yes 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.649
 ok these are 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.590
 worth of these distinguished are going to expose 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.629
 naturally if the probability is so 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.239
 low as finding a group of 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.780
 four emeralds and so down the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:32.120
 probability and one can also 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.750
 expose the zombie pickman described 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.750
 It's worth not who I am 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.669
 that would be all 1.6 points without more 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.669
 I think not 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:54.019
 well it 's 16.1 thing if this from a 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.159
 subject www bing 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.159
 20 20 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.440
 and I hope you liked it, it's all 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:09.310
 weird said random saving because they 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:14.079
 they have added much more than a goodbye 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.079
 the poster is 16 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:25.640
 it is difficult this seems easy 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.640
