00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
McFarland did an excellent job with

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.550 
McFarland did an excellent job with
their<00:02:54.100> first<00:02:54.280> assault<00:02:54.640> elite<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:56.110> colors<00:02:56.440> may

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
their first assault elite the colors may

their first assault elite the colors may
seem<00:02:56.799> blind<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.220> some<00:02:57.430> but<00:02:58.299> I<00:02:58.330> think<00:02:58.630> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
seem blind to some but I think the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.420 
seem blind to some but I think the
crimson<00:02:59.110> works<00:02:59.319> well<00:02:59.530> too<00:02:59.769> light<00:02:59.950> grey<00:03:00.190> and

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
crimson works well too light grey and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.720 
crimson works well too light grey and
the<00:03:01.090> silver<00:03:01.450> ties<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.810> all<00:03:01.870> together

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
the silver ties it all together

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.520 
the silver ties it all together
overall<00:03:03.730> it's<00:03:04.420> another<00:03:04.750> great<00:03:04.989> elite<00:03:05.350> and

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
overall it's another great elite and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.059
