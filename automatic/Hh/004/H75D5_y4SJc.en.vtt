00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.400
 you have this shirt in half I already have 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.460
 something even better watch my ass 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.460
 to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.660
 the band that shows mabel is a 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.519
 parody of the famous cycle group in their 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.620
 epoch and that is also one of the bands 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:46.000
 favorites of spears' sister 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.890
 and you already have me so crazy what you say that 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.120
 it's not love 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.120
 we are not bad 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.850
 I do not know about you, I prefer the 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.850
 backstreet post 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.710
 He says that robbie uses seems to be 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.050
 been found inside the cemetery 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.790
 maybe the strain of a place where 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.370
 find active and haunted objects 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.360
 remember that your family works in what 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.360
 that would be a cemetery 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.250
 what are you doing the apocalypse of 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.290
 that I talked about this could be a reference 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.729
 to the constant warnings of his brother the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.830
 what is the writer of the newspapers 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.049
 besides that stress shows it to 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.810
 a younger booth and a woman called 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.220
 carla which could be the person who 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.110
 is mentioned in the merchant in the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.210
 video episode and you can also 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.740
 believe that she is the mother of equity for 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.300
 more reference to make theories about 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.300
 the language barrier and carla 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.300
 yes 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.960
 kawaii I used to go dancing to the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.299
 rockola a cafeteria from the 70s 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.830
 set in the 50's there's an old 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.940
 theory that shows us that the bands of 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.860
 teenagers are genetically 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.350
 modified to look like perfect beings 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.330
 but nothing further from the reality already 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.890
 that these types of bands are just a 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.990
 product that is sold to young people 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 teenagers each character is worked 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.280
 and embellished with the desire to attract a 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.069
 easily susceptible public if in the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.300
 case of wang address sorry but 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.220
 Feel channel and the wizard can not 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.420
 show videos of this band since this 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.670
 could cause serious psychological damage 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.000
 the audience instead see this 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.000
 cute puppy 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.590
 as for the subliminal messages in 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.780
 the songs we must take into account 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.549
 who have been knowing this for a long time 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.590
 that many authors listening to their 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.290
 upside-down songs hid some 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.819
 messages and according to many statements 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.769
 bands claimed that this was a 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.299
 key match is that you can not 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.310
 check completely and completely what 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.989
 opposite the most famous band to have 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.959
 many messages hidden in their songs 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.760
 are the viruses but the best message is 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.260
 It's the song the stars way to 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.299
 heaven or stairway to led sky 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.250
 zeppelin for more information you should only 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.849
 see the documentary the testament of 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.849
 george harrison 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.030
 we could propose 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.260
 for my beards I deserved a spit for 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.760
 finalize in this episode is where 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.920
 we'll see wendy end up with rob and 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.810
 then in the episode of the god of love 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.090
 of the second season we will see the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.980
 conclusion of the child and we will also see 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.080
 next a couple of the best 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.080
 phrases you can remember from this one 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.680
 I hate these men of them always 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.240
 eating from my garbage waiting at the end 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.380
 a good reason to hit a 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.380
 teenager let's go
