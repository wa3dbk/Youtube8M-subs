00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.800
 I see 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.790
 guys what a beautiful song by god 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.920
 it's amazing the song you chose for 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.420
 this piece of gameplay good two guys 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.430
 how is it and I am horse and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.980
 welcome again to my channel this 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.790
 We are going to comment a little bit about the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.080
 weapon hp r3 insanity is worth as you will 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.970
 read in the title you will know entered is 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.160
 for that but first of all I wanted 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.760
 leave them here in an annotation in a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.379
 link in the video so that it would go through 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.870
 the video that went up yesterday that I uploaded it very 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.300
 very late and it is likely that some of 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.739
 you have not seen it so what 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.720
 you have there to be punctured if you 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.030
 you can see that it's also a game that 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.530
 it's not my nor even because I had 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.150
 some problems with the capture now about 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.320
 problems not directly is that not the 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.000
 I'm an idiot plug and I was not the boss 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.400
 so I took out my 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.130
 same afternoon to upload them and I could not 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.750
 upload it because I'm an idiot and did not have the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.060
 capture plugged in so the gameplay 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.479
 I left it the serious gentleman that I 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.450
 saved the ass and it's more that same game 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.799
 he raised it the same day yesterday and in light 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.750
 2.0 and the truth is a game 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.520
 totally recommendable, it's worth it guys 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.550
 that you have it out there for you to fuck 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.950
 an eye 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.270
 about this example and about this weapon that 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.770
 I have in hand the hbr hp pre3 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.510
 I always tell myself the name of my name 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.320
 they have put this weapon 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:43.460
 and my opinions are is that this weapon is 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.130
 it seems to my opinion it's worth to n 94 of 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.930
 black ops 2 in terms of cadence and damage 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.150
 ok because it's a weapon that has little 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.160
 cadence because as you've seen the 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.570
 has a little cadence and has enough 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.040
 damage is a weapon that kills pretty well 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.170
 over it with silencer kills very well 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.700
 It is also a weapon that I like 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.900
 quite not enough more than the endorsement that 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.460
 has endorsed the whole world in a 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.900
 pedestal and me either that I like 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.510
 much 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.190
 and after all, it's still a rifle that 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.899
 It has little damage and a lot of cadence without more 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.240
 he has no more and by far he is quite 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.860
 pretty bad but this weapon that 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.050
 we carry in the hand has a variation 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.520
 which it is a variation elite elite as 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.410
 are the weapons that 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.730
 they come to you in the supply packages 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.650
 that have some improvements or worse or 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.870
 some worse things like they can be 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.900
 that they take bullets or whatever 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.400
 always with some condition here I'm going to 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.260
 throw bomber are going to kill me and it's 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.010
 when you are going to see that I take the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.770
 hbr to 3 insanity ok now I'm going to 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.300
 kill I'm going to change the screen we're going to 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.150
 put another clip and this is where I kill 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.310
 these two guys that were there and I'm going to 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.410
 catch the echeverria 3 insanity from the ground 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.600
 amazing guys I loved that bone 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.340
 I need I need it for me and for me 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.050
 for for my hands I with this I want 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.620
 live I know I want this weapon for me 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.270
 because guys is the best weapon I've ever 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.560
 tried so far yes things that is 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.930
 A) Yes 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.340
 I have caught some obsidian style some 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.470
 endorsement or if steel floor and 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.630
 etcetera and I liked it I liked it 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.080
 much more is because it has 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.380
 absolutely everything that is missing 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.810
 it takes away a bit of handling that is like 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.730
 You see there he drove a little recharge 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.050
 it takes away a little bit, it puts a little more 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.000
 Dual recharge time costs you a 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.710
 A little more time to recharge and not get 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.700
 lets put any peephole this weapon 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.130
 OK 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.540
 Okay, that's the only bad thing 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.580
 has because on the contrary it is 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.200
 exactly like the other weapon only 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.900
 which does more damage one more point of a year and 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.870
 has three damage points or three points 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.130
 Cadence more outrageous is , 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.770
 as you will see it on the screen 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.630
 has three more points of cadence that is 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.150
 the only thing that needs this weapon that 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.580
 the only bad thing I had was that I had very 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.140
 little cadence as I said yes on top of 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.700
 put a cadence you put one more point 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.310
 of damage this developing dry weapon 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.130
 in my weapon is that it has to be my weapon 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.620
 is my perfect weapon or is it for me already 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.450
 you know that no no no more and as you see 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.360
 I take it from the ground, notice the difference 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.890
 of those of the previous casualties with these 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.900
 not here I ended up taking all the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.730
 gusts with the weapon of caught the ground 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.010
 and in the end the game ends 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.590
 and I have to cut the video but guys 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.970
 this weapon if you have to put a tweet 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.680
 or whatever 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.270
 for to bite gave me no eggs 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.190
 if you want to make me angry 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.620
 tweet if you have touched to make me 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.620
 javier no and guys 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.820
 I need it because it is a weapon is that it is 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.840
 that I do not have words is that every time 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.460
 I try to talk about her 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.000
 and it's that it's amazing, guys, I do not have 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.610
 words for her 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.590
 I have another cool one a3 but it's 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.290
 pretty much worse because over 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.510
 it removes bone cadence if it had little 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.330
 cadence because it still takes away more 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.460
 cadence and I do not like anything if it wins 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.540
 guys here is finishing the 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.830
 gameplay is ending by limit 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.790
 of time because the 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.529
 starting and uncle did nothing but 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.839
 hide and 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:01.909
 and here it ends guys a greeting like 

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:01.909
 If you liked this approach ciao
