00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello all youtube good friends 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:10.030
 here to show you unboxing of my incubator 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.429
 good bator is the egg incubator 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.530
 if some of you know her then 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.070
 characterized by having formed then of 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.810
 egg 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:24.169
 and is ideal for animals like pocona de 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.250
 color brown turtle and snake and in my 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:30.410
 case of brown is the best and if in 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.820
 a future the turtle had eggs then 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.810
 for turtle 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.920
 and this is the box of the incubator that 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:44.699
 is lucky reptile and cool 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.909
 good here the top cover and you see how 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.060
 in the incubator looks at a chameleon like this 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.950
 the incubator inside 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:57.160
 incubator for the egg is removed 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:01.810
 as you will see it has three stickers of 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.030
 snake and chameleon turtle and 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.370
 these are the instructions of the box and 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.010
 you will see what I have done I already know that 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.010
 It has three adjustable temperatures good 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.420
 As you can see, it's in the box 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.549
 inside and we're going to take it out 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.590
 well here is the incubator out 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.140
 and as you will see I have put the three 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.090
 of the chameleon of torture 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.880
 and the snake as I did not decide then to 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.220
 I've put all three and it's very funny 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.520
 because it has an egg shape 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.790
 let's see it inside opens us by 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.790
 other 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.810
 inside has three tuppers of 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.939
 normal chinese convention of 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.280
 currents although the incubator says 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.740
 tupper breeding reptiles but in 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.100
 arias is a normal current tupper 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.100
 from Chinese 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.620
 there are three and a tray 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.500
 here come the instructions attention 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.290
 Do not obstruct the ventilation do not fill 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.140
 water well so here we get the water 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.050
 here the truth is that I do not know yet why 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.640
 serves this I think it 's decoration by 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.010
 what 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.440
 I have no idea to leave because if 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.380
 may not fill with water and not obstruct 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.530
 ventilation venting or something me that 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.530
 he 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.180
 we close it 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.670
 it's like that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.469
 luke and rectal that the brand is not very 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.299
 known as the single by 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.299
 example the jab 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.130
 and so behind you have here the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.060
 ventilation all full of cables 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.319
 as you will see, it only has three temperatures 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.319
 29 degrees 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:54.719
 1 32 degrees 29 degrees and 26 degrees the 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.310
 normal is the 29 that is for them to come out 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:03:01.380
 males and females the 32 only males and the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.100
 26 only females 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.580
 so it's on and here it 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.250
 place the cables and so 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.680
 this is the own 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.530
 and this is done but not yet 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.960
 plugged in and good is a very incubator 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.360
 simple but it suits me very well 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.670
 to be able to wipe them because it's not so 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.310
 as big as the maid coolers that 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.860
 it's immense 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.239
 and it's very good and so far the 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.239
 goodbye video today
