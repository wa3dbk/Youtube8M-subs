music years here's an example that we're
going<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.809> be<00:00:12.960> working<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.099> the

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
going to be working on this is the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.550 
going to be working on this is the
original<00:00:14.790> scene<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.570> we're<00:00:16.080> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.320> turn

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
original scene and we're going to turn

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.470 
original scene and we're going to turn
this<00:00:16.859> into<00:00:17.539> this<00:00:18.539> kind<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.350> looking<00:00:19.619> shot

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
this into this kind of a looking shot

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.420 
this into this kind of a looking shot
this<00:00:21.480> example<00:00:21.840> uses<00:00:22.619> only<00:00:22.800> three<00:00:23.220> lights

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
this example uses only three lights

this example uses only three lights
again<00:00:24.060> like<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.930> most<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.260> my<00:00:25.350> tutorials<00:00:25.800> such

I try to stick to a few lights as

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.200 
I try to stick to a few lights as
possible<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.189> also<00:00:29.550> lights<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.090> are

umbrella lights are basically like you
see<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.530> example<00:00:46.940> it's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
see up here in this example it's

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.080 
see up here in this example it's
basically<00:00:48.539> an<00:00:48.660> umbrella<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> silver<00:00:50.640> kind

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
basically an umbrella with a silver kind

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.810 
basically an umbrella with a silver kind
of<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> lining<00:00:51.510> cloth<00:00:52.289> inside<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.550> allows

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
of a lining cloth inside it which allows

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.490 
of a lining cloth inside it which allows
you<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:53.969> bounce<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.420> light<00:00:54.449> off<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.260> very

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you to bounce the light off of it's very

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.270 
you to bounce the light off of it's very
similar<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.100> any<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> reflector<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
similar to any kind of reflector and

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.900 
similar to any kind of reflector and
there<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.399> used<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.820> photography<00:00:59.940> or<00:01:00.710> film

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
there is used in photography or film

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.660 
there is used in photography or film
video<00:01:02.910> productions<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.739> difference<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
video productions the difference is the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.760 
video productions the difference is the
shape<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.020> its<00:01:07.229> kind<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
shape of it because of its kind of a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.270 
shape of it because of its kind of a
curved<00:01:08.369> shape<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:09.060> bounces<00:01:09.990> light<00:01:10.229> within<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
curved shape it bounces light within the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.670 
curved shape it bounces light within the
umbrella<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.510> internally<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.110> lot<00:01:13.409> more

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
umbrella you know internally a lot more

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.539 
umbrella you know internally a lot more
creating<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:15.330> kind<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.750> even<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.680> soft

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
creating a very kind of even and soft

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.380 
creating a very kind of even and soft
kind<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.060> look<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:20.490> umbrella<00:01:21.090> lights<00:01:21.270> are

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
kind of look the umbrella lights are

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.090 
kind of look the umbrella lights are
sort<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.900> soft<00:01:22.200> boxes<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:22.890> they're<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
sort of like soft boxes but they're a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.399 
sort of like soft boxes but they're a
little<00:01:23.430> bit<00:01:23.580> less<00:01:23.820> directional<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
little bit less directional and the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.460 
little bit less directional and the
shadows<00:01:25.890> are<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:27.000> would<00:01:27.299> say<00:01:27.450> even<00:01:27.630> even<00:01:28.049> softer

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
shadows are I would say even even softer

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.899 
shadows are I would say even even softer
so<00:01:28.860> here's<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> light<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.640> I'm<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so here's the light that I'm going to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.109 
so here's the light that I'm going to

altogether basically what it does is it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.560 
altogether basically what it does is it
mounts<00:01:55.130> on<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.430> standard<00:01:55.850> light<00:01:56.060> stand<00:01:56.360> and

umbrella the umbrella I'm using here in

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.060 
umbrella the umbrella I'm using here in
this<00:02:02.960> example<00:02:03.260> is<00:02:03.500> fairly<00:02:03.920> large<00:02:04.340> it's<00:02:05.060> around

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
this example is fairly large it's around

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.760 
this example is fairly large it's around
45<00:02:07.070> or<00:02:07.310> 50<00:02:07.670> inches<00:02:07.970> even<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.750> believe<00:02:09.350> which<00:02:09.649> is

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
45 or 50 inches even I believe which is

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.290 
45 or 50 inches even I believe which is
probably<00:02:10.040> as<00:02:10.340> big<00:02:10.490> an<00:02:10.640> umbrella<00:02:10.940> as<00:02:11.090> you'll

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
probably as big an umbrella as you'll

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.540 
probably as big an umbrella as you'll
ever<00:02:11.480> want<00:02:11.840> it's<00:02:12.740> going<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.070> allow<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.400> to

light a pretty big area like you can

light a pretty big area like you can
light<00:02:16.570> let's<00:02:17.570> leave<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.020> lighting<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.380> model

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
you can light them you know from head to

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
toe and you can see me up here mounting

toe and you can see me up here mounting
the<00:02:24.080> umbrella<00:02:24.410> into<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:25.420> lights<00:02:26.420> tent<00:02:26.810> and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
the umbrella into this lights tent and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.810 
the umbrella into this lights tent and
then<00:02:27.970> up<00:02:28.970> here<00:02:29.360> I'm<00:02:29.800> going<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.890> put<00:02:31.459> in<00:02:31.580> two

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
then up here I'm going to put in two

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.310 
then up here I'm going to put in two
light<00:02:32.240> bulbs<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.660> these<00:02:32.840> are<00:02:32.990> fluorescent

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
light bulbs and these are fluorescent

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.480 
light bulbs and these are fluorescent
light<00:02:33.770> bulbs<00:02:34.100> they're<00:02:35.060> about<00:02:35.240> 100<00:02:35.660> watts<00:02:35.780> each

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
light bulbs they're about 100 watts each

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.650 
light bulbs they're about 100 watts each
the<00:02:37.490> reason<00:02:37.670> why<00:02:37.790> I'm<00:02:37.880> using<00:02:37.910> fluorescence<00:02:38.540> as

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
the reason why I'm using fluorescence as

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.990 
the reason why I'm using fluorescence as
opposed<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:38.959> tungsten<00:02:39.440> lights<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:39.920> because

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
opposed to tungsten lights is because

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.690 
opposed to tungsten lights is because
this<00:02:41.000> umbrella<00:02:41.270> that<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.720> cannot<00:02:42.110> take

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
this umbrella that I have cannot take

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.280 
this umbrella that I have cannot take
handle<00:02:43.700> very<00:02:43.970> very<00:02:44.300> high<00:02:44.450> temperatures<00:02:45.020> and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
handle very very high temperatures and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.620 
handle very very high temperatures and
since<00:02:46.250> larsson<00:02:46.640> lights<00:02:46.820> produce<00:02:47.150> very<00:02:47.360> little

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
since larsson lights produce very little

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.300 
since larsson lights produce very little
heat<00:02:47.810> they<00:02:48.260> work<00:02:48.530> perfectly<00:02:48.920> if<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.100> were<00:02:49.190> to

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
heat they work perfectly if I were to

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.430 
heat they work perfectly if I were to
put<00:02:49.489> let's<00:02:49.700> say<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.030> 1000<00:02:51.019> watt<00:02:51.110> let's<00:02:51.350> say

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
put let's say and 1000 watt let's say

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.160 
put let's say and 1000 watt let's say
tungsten<00:02:51.980> light<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:53.330> here<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.900> would

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
tungsten light and here it would

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.650 
tungsten light and here it would
probably<00:02:54.920> just<00:02:55.070> melt<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.489> umbrella<00:02:55.910> away<00:02:56.360> or

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
probably just melt the umbrella away or

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.930 
probably just melt the umbrella away or
or<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.500> know<00:02:57.530> set<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.890> whole<00:02:58.100> thing<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:58.670> fire

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
or you know set the whole thing on fire

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.930 
or you know set the whole thing on fire
which<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.390> not<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.780> safest<00:03:00.140> way<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.290> work

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
which is not the safest way to work

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.800 
which is not the safest way to work
whereas<00:03:01.940> these<00:03:02.090> two<00:03:02.150> fluorescent<00:03:02.690> light

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
whereas these two fluorescent light

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.140 
whereas these two fluorescent light
bulbs<00:03:03.140> together<00:03:03.860> they<00:03:04.130> draw<00:03:04.370> around<00:03:04.670> 200

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
bulbs together they draw around 200

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.720 
bulbs together they draw around 200
watts<00:03:05.330> yet<00:03:05.750> their<00:03:06.560> amount<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.340> light<00:03:07.550> the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
watts yet their amount of light the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.009 
watts yet their amount of light the
output<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:08.239> comparable<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.989> probably<00:03:09.590> around

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
output is comparable to probably around

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.520 
output is comparable to probably around
like<00:03:12.019> a<00:03:12.050> 600<00:03:12.769> watt<00:03:12.800> light<00:03:13.250> tungsten<00:03:14.180> light<00:03:14.530> so

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
like a 600 watt light tungsten light so

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.870 
like a 600 watt light tungsten light so
they're<00:03:15.680> pretty<00:03:16.220> nice<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.580> strong<00:03:16.820> and

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
they're pretty nice and strong and

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.060 
they're pretty nice and strong and
basically<00:03:17.840> what<00:03:18.050> you<00:03:18.170> do<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.530> point<00:03:18.860> these

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
basically what you do is you point these

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.190 
basically what you do is you point these
light<00:03:19.400> posts<00:03:19.700> straight<00:03:19.970> at<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.510> umbrella<00:03:20.810> not

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
light posts straight at the umbrella not

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.290 
light posts straight at the umbrella not
at<00:03:21.320> your<00:03:21.500> subject<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.670> you're<00:03:23.180> not

you're allowing the light to kind of

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.140 
you're allowing the light to kind of
bounce<00:03:27.799> all<00:03:28.070> over<00:03:28.130> this<00:03:28.489> like<00:03:28.670> an<00:03:28.880> umbrella

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
and here in the back I just adjust them

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.220 
and here in the back I just adjust them
to<00:03:49.140> spot<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.400> they<00:03:50.609> kind<00:03:51.569> of<00:03:51.720> limit<00:03:52.049> the

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
to spot so that they kind of limit the

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
this shot so once again it's something

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.350 
this shot so once again it's something
that<00:04:33.539> I<00:04:33.690> talk<00:04:33.990> about<00:04:34.139> in<00:04:34.410> tutorial<00:04:35.220> 1<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:36.000> then

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
that I talk about in tutorial 1 and then

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
that I talk about in tutorial 1 and then
later<00:04:36.750> on<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:37.050> tutorial<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.650> believe<00:04:37.860> 3

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
later on to tutorial I believe 3

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.629 
later on to tutorial I believe 3
production<00:04:40.380> value<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:41.039> know<00:04:41.130> location

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
production value you know location

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.189 
production value you know location
scouting<00:04:41.910> all<00:04:42.240> those<00:04:42.449> kind<00:04:42.690> of<00:04:42.750> things<00:04:42.960> they

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
scouting all those kind of things they

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.870 
scouting all those kind of things they
they<00:04:43.440> all<00:04:43.620> add<00:04:43.830> up<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:44.099> the<00:04:44.190> overall<00:04:44.220> look<00:04:44.699> on

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
they all add up to the overall look on

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.409 
they all add up to the overall look on
your<00:04:44.970> shot

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
your shot

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.510 
your shot
so<00:04:46.229> it's<00:04:46.349> something<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.620> pay<00:04:46.710> attention<00:04:47.010> and

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
so it's something to pay attention and

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.750 
so it's something to pay attention and
then<00:04:48.210> here<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.750> had<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.889> 200<00:04:50.310> watt<00:04:50.400> umbrella

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
then here I had the 200 watt umbrella

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.550 
then here I had the 200 watt umbrella
which<00:04:51.060> is<00:04:51.210> just<00:04:51.449> off<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.990> left<00:04:52.080> side<00:04:52.440> of

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
which is just off to the left side of

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.390 
which is just off to the left side of
the<00:04:52.650> camera<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.360> around<00:04:54.360> around<00:04:55.320> 6<00:04:55.650> feet<00:04:55.860> away

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
the camera and around around 6 feet away

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.210 
the camera and around around 6 feet away
from<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.760> subject<00:04:57.180> and<00:04:57.419> then<00:04:58.409> I<00:04:58.500> just<00:04:58.650> put<00:04:58.919> 2

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
from the subject and then I just put 2

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.640 
from the subject and then I just put 2
to<00:04:59.699> the<00:04:59.909> 1000<00:05:00.419> watt<00:05:00.510> lights<00:05:00.780> one<00:05:01.050> aiming

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
to the 1000 watt lights one aiming

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.189 
to the 1000 watt lights one aiming
straight<00:05:01.800> at<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.990> subject<00:05:03.990> in<00:05:04.110> the

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
straight at the subject in the

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.010 
straight at the subject in the
background<00:05:04.699> and<00:05:05.699> just<00:05:05.729> eliminating<00:05:06.479> her<00:05:06.750> and

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
background and just eliminating her and

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.230 
background and just eliminating her and
then<00:05:07.740> another<00:05:07.919> one<00:05:08.190> kind<00:05:08.460> of<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.150> right

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
then another one kind of to the right

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.790 
then another one kind of to the right
side<00:05:09.570> slightly<00:05:09.870> behind<00:05:10.199> our<00:05:10.500> foreground

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
side slightly behind our foreground

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.969 
side slightly behind our foreground
subject<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:12.030> creating<00:05:12.479> this<00:05:12.659> rim<00:05:13.409> light<00:05:13.650> from

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
subject and creating this rim light from

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:14.629 
subject and creating this rim light from
the<00:05:14.130> side

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
the side

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.550 
the side
just<00:05:15.060> kind<00:05:15.210> of<00:05:15.240> adds<00:05:15.449> a<00:05:15.720> more<00:05:15.930> dramatic<00:05:16.320> touch

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
just kind of adds a more dramatic touch

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
just kind of adds a more dramatic touch
to<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.280> shut<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.790> here<00:05:19.419> is<00:05:19.540> the<00:05:19.750> final<00:05:20.139> shot

what it's still missing is a little

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.480 
what it's still missing is a little
color<00:05:23.350> correction<00:05:23.800> which<00:05:23.950> we'll<00:05:24.100> do<00:05:24.220> at<00:05:24.340> the

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
color correction which we'll do at the

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.740
