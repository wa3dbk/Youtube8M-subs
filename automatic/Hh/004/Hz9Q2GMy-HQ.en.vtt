00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
so review what we saw last leaf' first

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.500 
so review what we saw last leaf' first
big<00:00:06.859> organ<00:00:07.370> you<00:00:07.790> first<00:00:08.059> open<00:00:08.269> up<00:00:08.330> the

of the liver from the right lobes and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.279 
of the liver from the right lobes and
humans<00:00:25.730> we<00:00:25.849> have<00:00:25.880> this<00:00:26.000> very<00:00:26.390> same<00:00:26.720> structure

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
humans we have this very same structure

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.950 
humans we have this very same structure
in<00:00:28.220> between<00:00:28.699> these<00:00:28.880> lobes<00:00:29.210> hidden<00:00:29.630> down<00:00:29.779> in

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
in between these lobes hidden down in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.040 
in between these lobes hidden down in
here<00:00:30.410> is<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:32.000> gallbladder<00:00:32.540> you<00:00:32.720> can<00:00:32.810> see<00:00:32.930> it's

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
here is the gallbladder you can see it's

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.900 
here is the gallbladder you can see it's
partially<00:00:33.560> deflated<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.220> actually<00:00:34.610> mostly

partially deflated and actually mostly
empty<00:00:35.180> on<00:00:35.480> this<00:00:35.660> means<00:00:35.900> so<00:00:36.080> right<00:00:36.290> there

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
empty on this means so right there

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.750 
empty on this means so right there
hidden<00:00:36.680> amongst<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.190> right<00:00:37.370> lobes<00:00:37.670> that

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
hidden amongst the right lobes that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.050 
hidden amongst the right lobes that
means<00:00:38.030> liver<00:00:38.330> is<00:00:38.810> the<00:00:38.960> gallbladder<00:00:39.830> they<00:00:40.820> just

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
means liver is the gallbladder they just

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.380 
means liver is the gallbladder they just
found<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.360> liver<00:00:41.600> we<00:00:41.810> had<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:42.290> humongous

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
found the liver we had this humongous

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.760 
found the liver we had this humongous
gigantic<00:00:44.390> stomach<00:00:45.050> I<00:00:45.200> mean<00:00:45.320> that's<00:00:45.500> many

gigantic stomach I mean that's many
times<00:00:46.040> like<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.370> size<00:00:46.610> murder<00:00:47.000> it<00:00:47.150> means

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
times like the size murder it means

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.120 
times like the size murder it means
tummy<00:00:47.600> but<00:00:47.810> a<00:00:47.840> big<00:00:48.230> big<00:00:48.500> stomach<00:00:48.890> kind<00:00:49.010> of

here is the greater Ament in both parts
of<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.619> mesentery<00:01:07.130> out<00:01:07.820> here<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:08.359> was<00:01:08.539> the

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
of the mesentery out here this was the

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.380 
of the mesentery out here this was the
mean<00:01:08.840> spleen<00:01:09.380> located<00:01:10.310> very<00:01:10.460> laterally<00:01:11.270> out

mean spleen located very laterally out
towards<00:01:11.719> the<00:01:11.780> left<00:01:11.990> side<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:12.429> we<00:01:13.429> flipped

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
towards the left side of it we flipped

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.910 
towards the left side of it we flipped
the<00:01:13.729> mesentery<00:01:14.149> back<00:01:14.390> in<00:01:14.659> this<00:01:14.810> fashion<00:01:15.530> and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the mesentery back in this fashion and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.080 
the mesentery back in this fashion and
also<00:01:16.189> you<00:01:16.250> got<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.429> spleen<00:01:16.609> out<00:01:16.880> of<00:01:16.939> the<00:01:17.000> way

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
also you got the spleen out of the way

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.510 
also you got the spleen out of the way
or<00:01:17.270> two<00:01:17.479> we<00:01:18.320> see<00:01:18.530> some<00:01:18.679> other<00:01:18.799> structures<00:01:19.340> with

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
or two we see some other structures with

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.020 
or two we see some other structures with
the<00:01:19.640> small<00:01:19.909> intestine<00:01:20.479> it<00:01:20.570> had<00:01:20.689> three<00:01:20.990> parts

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
the small intestine it had three parts

aorta<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.530> down<00:03:09.680> here<00:03:09.830> we<00:03:09.950> can<00:03:10.070> see<00:03:10.220> where

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
aorta and down here we can see where

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.620 
aorta and down here we can see where
branches<00:03:10.610> look<00:03:10.880> how<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.060> branch<00:03:11.330> is<00:03:11.480> there

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630

remember means don't have a common iliac
like<00:03:21.410> we<00:03:21.560> do<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:22.340> first<00:03:22.579> external<00:03:23.150> then

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
like we do so first external then

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.110 
like we do so first external then
internal<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.250> veins<00:03:25.519> right<00:03:25.730> behind<00:03:26.000> by

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
internal and the veins right behind by

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.280 
internal and the veins right behind by
the<00:03:26.209> very<00:03:26.360> same<00:03:26.420> name<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.019> can<00:03:27.049> see<00:03:27.200> the

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
the very same name so you can see the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.620 
the very same name so you can see the
veins<00:03:27.500> there<00:03:27.799> are<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.190> external<00:03:28.850> iliac<00:03:29.209> veins

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
veins there are the external iliac veins

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.660 
veins there are the external iliac veins
but<00:03:30.620> else<00:03:30.769> we<00:03:30.890> notice<00:03:31.130> here<00:03:31.280> going<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.579> the

renal vein over there there's a right
renal<00:03:43.130> vein<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:44.209> other<00:03:44.329> tiny<00:03:44.600> veins<00:03:44.840> you

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
renal vein and the other tiny veins you

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.390 
renal vein and the other tiny veins you
can<00:03:45.079> see<00:03:45.200> are<00:03:45.350> these<00:03:45.440> little<00:03:45.769> tiny<00:03:45.920> ones<00:03:46.070> like

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
can see are these little tiny ones like

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.039 
can see are these little tiny ones like
that<00:03:46.579> that's<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.970> testicular<00:03:47.390> vein<00:03:47.810> another

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
that that's a testicular vein another

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.380 
that that's a testicular vein another
testicular<00:03:48.470> vein<00:03:48.860> right<00:03:49.100> in<00:03:49.220> here<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:49.760> then

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
testicular vein right in here and then

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.970 
testicular vein right in here and then
the<00:03:50.450> boat<00:03:50.810> will<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.079> tiny<00:03:51.290> arteries<00:03:51.769> that<00:03:51.920> are

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
the boat will the tiny arteries that are

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.039 
the boat will the tiny arteries that are
near<00:03:52.250> them<00:03:52.459> those<00:03:52.820> artistic<00:03:53.239> their<00:03:53.600> arteries

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
near them those artistic their arteries

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.050 
near them those artistic their arteries
so<00:03:54.260> very<00:03:54.470> small<00:03:54.799> they're<00:03:55.040> direct<00:03:55.310> branches<00:03:55.459> we

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
so very small they're direct branches we

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.750 
so very small they're direct branches we
mapped<00:03:56.299> on

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
mapped on

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.229 
mapped on
okay<00:03:58.120> so<00:03:58.569> now<00:03:58.720> as<00:03:58.870> far<00:03:59.079> as<00:03:59.140> today<00:03:59.500> goes<00:04:00.239> we're

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
okay so now as far as today goes we're

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.630 
okay so now as far as today goes we're
going<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.510> look<00:04:01.659> at<00:04:02.220> structures<00:04:03.220> in<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.519> mail

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
going to look at structures in the mail

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.399 
going to look at structures in the mail
system<00:04:04.000> we'll<00:04:04.239> start<00:04:04.569> by<00:04:04.840> looking<00:04:04.870> at<00:04:05.230> right

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
system we'll start by looking at right

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:06.660 
system we'll start by looking at right

really doesn't stand out very much
prostate<00:04:37.840> gland<00:04:38.110> right<00:04:38.440> below<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.830> bladder

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
prostate gland right below the bladder

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.490 
prostate gland right below the bladder
here<00:04:39.510> pull<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.600> bladder<00:04:40.810> back<00:04:41.020> out<00:04:41.320> of<00:04:41.350> the

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
here pull the bladder back out of the

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.370 
here pull the bladder back out of the
way<00:04:42.389> that's<00:04:43.389> a<00:04:43.449> little<00:04:43.570> ball<00:04:43.750> you<00:04:43.930> see<00:04:44.139> right

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
way that's a little ball you see right

down below that's just some tissue here

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.870 
down below that's just some tissue here
so<00:04:47.410> it'll<00:04:47.500> write<00:04:47.979> this<00:04:48.160> little<00:04:48.340> area<00:04:48.520> right

below where the bladder is right in
there<00:04:50.500> that's<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.889> prostate<00:04:51.340> gland<00:04:51.370> just

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
there that's the prostate gland just

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.000 
there that's the prostate gland just
inferior<00:04:52.150> to<00:04:52.599> the<00:04:52.660> bladder<00:04:52.930> in<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.830> mail

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
inferior to the bladder in the mail

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.820 
inferior to the bladder in the mail
system<00:04:54.599> then<00:04:55.599> out<00:04:55.750> here<00:04:55.930> let's<00:04:56.110> find<00:04:56.289> a<00:04:56.470> test

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
system then out here let's find a test

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.610 
system then out here let's find a test
this<00:04:56.979> thing<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.340> see<00:04:57.550> one<00:04:57.699> right<00:04:57.910> here<00:04:58.620> we're

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
this thing I see one right here we're

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.140 
this thing I see one right here we're
look<00:04:59.740> to<00:04:59.860> see<00:05:00.099> again<00:05:00.340> in<00:05:00.460> one<00:05:00.610> test<00:05:00.880> us<00:05:01.030> and

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
look to see again in one test us and

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.689 
look to see again in one test us and
what<00:05:01.240> helps<00:05:01.449> connect<00:05:01.660> system<00:05:01.870> back<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.289> the

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
what helps connect system back to the

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.710 
what helps connect system back to the
abdominal<00:05:03.699> cavity<00:05:03.849> in<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.240> mail<00:05:04.389> system

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
abdominal cavity in the mail system

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.770 
abdominal cavity in the mail system
structure<00:05:05.440> call<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.800> spermatic<00:05:06.340> cord<00:05:06.780> and

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
structure call the spermatic cord and

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.450 
structure call the spermatic cord and
set<00:05:07.990> this<00:05:08.139> out<00:05:08.349> carefully<00:05:08.949> I<00:05:08.979> wouldn't<00:05:09.340> want

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
set this out carefully I wouldn't want

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.550 
set this out carefully I wouldn't want
to<00:05:09.520> cut<00:05:09.639> these<00:05:09.789> off<00:05:10.060> that<00:05:10.660> would<00:05:10.810> just<00:05:10.990> be<00:05:11.169> bad

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
to cut these off that would just be bad

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.540 
to cut these off that would just be bad
karma<00:05:12.370> okay

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.950 

when<00:05:16.970> we<00:05:17.090> sent<00:05:17.300> individually<00:05:17.690> we'll<00:05:17.840> call

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
when we sent individually we'll call

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.629 
when we sent individually we'll call
each<00:05:17.990> of<00:05:18.169> these<00:05:18.259> structures<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.860> test<00:05:19.220> us<00:05:19.430> and

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
each of these structures a test us and

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.290 
each of these structures a test us and
the<00:05:20.030> testees<00:05:20.509> will<00:05:20.660> be<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.840> plural<00:05:21.169> term

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
the testees will be the plural term

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.460 
the testees will be the plural term
actually<00:05:23.300> yep<00:05:23.599> right<00:05:23.720> there<00:05:23.900> is<00:05:23.990> penis

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
actually yep right there is penis

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.869 
actually yep right there is penis
this<00:05:24.740> test<00:05:25.069> is<00:05:25.129> sperm<00:05:25.310> ready<00:05:25.430> courts<00:05:25.729> are

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:25.879 
this test is sperm ready courts are

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.580 
this test is sperm ready courts are
already<00:05:26.150> partially<00:05:26.479> broken<00:05:26.780> off<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.199> expose

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
already partially broken off to expose

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.899 
already partially broken off to expose
some<00:05:27.770> stuff<00:05:28.009> inside<00:05:28.159> of<00:05:28.280> us<00:05:28.490> well<00:05:28.639> I<00:05:28.669> didn't

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
some stuff inside of us well I didn't

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.460 
some stuff inside of us well I didn't
want<00:05:29.060> to<00:05:29.120> do<00:05:29.240> that<00:05:29.270> here<00:05:29.599> is<00:05:30.199> there<00:05:30.319> another

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
want to do that here is there another

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.080 
want to do that here is there another
one<00:05:30.650> here<00:05:30.919> that's<00:05:31.039> still<00:05:31.310> partially<00:05:31.759> attached

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
one here that's still partially attached

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.309 
one here that's still partially attached
now<00:05:32.330> this<00:05:32.449> mean<00:05:32.599> isn't<00:05:32.840> showing<00:05:32.930> really<00:05:33.199> well

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
now this mean isn't showing really well

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.629 
now this mean isn't showing really well
so<00:05:33.530> there's<00:05:33.680> a<00:05:33.710> test<00:05:33.949> us<00:05:34.099> but<00:05:34.129> cirrhotic

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
so there's a test us but cirrhotic

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.070 
so there's a test us but cirrhotic
report<00:05:34.879> is<00:05:34.940> mostly<00:05:35.240> gone<00:05:35.479> all<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.840> one<00:05:35.990> thing

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
report is mostly gone all the one thing

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.390 
report is mostly gone all the one thing
you<00:05:36.139> can<00:05:36.259> kind<00:05:36.379> of<00:05:36.440> see<00:05:36.620> their<00:05:36.830> total

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
you can kind of see their total

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.920 
you can kind of see their total
testicular<00:05:37.699> artery<00:05:38.240> inside<00:05:38.569> there<00:05:38.720> to<00:05:38.810> be<00:05:38.900> a

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
testicular artery inside there to be a

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.110 
testicular artery inside there to be a
testicular<00:05:39.289> artery<00:05:39.800> there<00:05:40.729> stick<00:05:40.909> of<00:05:41.030> their

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
testicular artery there stick of their

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.339 
testicular artery there stick of their
vein<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:41.539> something<00:05:41.810> called<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.139> vas

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
vein and something called the vas

deferens<00:05:42.919> that<00:05:43.069> transports<00:05:43.639> sperm<00:05:43.940> from<00:05:44.120> this

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
deferens that transports sperm from this

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.149 
deferens that transports sperm from this
test<00:05:44.509> is<00:05:44.659> back<00:05:44.840> up<00:05:45.020> into<00:05:45.319> the<00:05:45.500> Minx<00:05:45.710> abdominal

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
test is back up into the Minx abdominal

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.860 
test is back up into the Minx abdominal
cavity<00:05:46.580> so<00:05:47.150> this<00:05:47.300> guy<00:05:47.449> doesn't<00:05:47.479> show<00:05:47.810> it

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
cavity so this guy doesn't show it

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.089 
cavity so this guy doesn't show it
really<00:05:48.110> well<00:05:48.289> let's<00:05:48.530> see<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.710> other<00:05:48.860> side

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
really well let's see the other side

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.080 
really well let's see the other side
here<00:05:49.400> maybe<00:05:49.759> this<00:05:49.970> side<00:05:50.120> shows<00:05:50.330> do<00:05:51.909> once<00:05:52.909> we're

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
here maybe this side shows do once we're

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.770 
here maybe this side shows do once we're
ready<00:05:53.120> for<00:05:53.300> that's<00:05:53.720> still<00:05:53.900> attached<00:05:55.659> see<00:05:56.659> the

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
ready for that's still attached see the

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.550 
ready for that's still attached see the
artery<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:57.139> vein<00:05:57.259> in<00:05:57.560> there<00:05:58.990> usually<00:05:59.990> it's

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
artery and vein in there usually it's

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.490 
artery and vein in there usually it's
very<00:06:00.620> easy<00:06:00.919> to<00:06:01.009> the<00:06:01.190> second

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
very easy to the second

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
yeah it's been frying seems ready for

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.710 
yeah it's been frying seems ready for
tea<00:06:04.480> that's<00:06:04.660> definitely<00:06:05.020> another<00:06:05.140> test<00:06:05.440> is

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
tea that's definitely another test is

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.380 
pool right here you can see these
vessels<00:06:26.470> pulling<00:06:26.860> there<00:06:27.040> the<00:06:27.250> same<00:06:27.460> way<00:06:27.640> that

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
vessels pulling there the same way that

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.940 
vessels pulling there the same way that
to<00:06:28.720> the<00:06:28.900> ghost<00:06:29.110> of<00:06:29.260> the<00:06:29.350> abdominal<00:06:29.830> wall

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
to the ghost of the abdominal wall

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.430 
to the ghost of the abdominal wall
that's<00:06:30.550> called<00:06:30.850> the<00:06:31.000> inguinal<00:06:31.330> canal<00:06:31.600> so

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
that's called the inguinal canal so

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.080 
that's called the inguinal canal so
right<00:06:32.650> there<00:06:32.890> this<00:06:33.070> structure<00:06:33.490> goes<00:06:33.700> into<00:06:34.000> the

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
right there this structure goes into the

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.460 
right there this structure goes into the
abdominal<00:06:34.510> wall<00:06:34.630> that's<00:06:34.900> the<00:06:35.080> inguinal<00:06:35.200> canal

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
abdominal wall that's the inguinal canal

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.590 
abdominal wall that's the inguinal canal
and<00:06:35.920> this<00:06:36.520> thing<00:06:36.670> that<00:06:36.760> connects<00:06:37.030> the<00:06:37.150> test<00:06:37.390> us

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
and this thing that connects the test us

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.290 
and this thing that connects the test us
to<00:06:38.440> the<00:06:38.650> rest<00:06:38.830> of<00:06:38.890> the<00:06:38.980> Domino<00:06:39.340> region<00:06:40.090> on<00:06:40.180> the

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
to the rest of the Domino region on the

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.210 
to the rest of the Domino region on the
weakest<00:06:40.600> call<00:06:40.870> the<00:06:41.080> spermatic<00:06:41.560> cord<00:06:41.590> which<00:06:42.070> is

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
weakest call the spermatic cord which is

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.820 
weakest call the spermatic cord which is
right<00:06:42.430> in<00:06:42.550> there<00:06:42.730> so<00:06:43.000> test<00:06:43.600> us<00:06:43.810> spermatic<00:06:44.800> cord

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
right in there so test us spermatic cord

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.410 
right in there so test us spermatic cord
and<00:06:45.280> then<00:06:45.340> you<00:06:45.460> can<00:06:45.580> see<00:06:45.730> these<00:06:45.820> vessels<00:06:46.240> once

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:46.420 
and then you can see these vessels once

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.610 
and then you can see these vessels once
they<00:06:46.510> get<00:06:46.600> inside<00:06:46.900> the<00:06:47.080> abdominal<00:06:47.200> cavity

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
they get inside the abdominal cavity

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.170 
they get inside the abdominal cavity
well<00:06:47.950> right<00:06:48.100> here<00:06:48.280> see<00:06:48.430> some<00:06:48.550> a<00:06:48.610> white<00:06:48.760> thing

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
well right here see some a white thing

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.640 
well right here see some a white thing
there's<00:06:49.480> the<00:06:49.630> vas<00:06:49.750> deferens<00:06:50.110> all<00:06:50.230> by<00:06:50.380> itself

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
there's the vas deferens all by itself

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.380 
there's the vas deferens all by itself
what<00:06:50.830> do<00:06:50.890> you<00:06:50.980> know<00:06:51.370> throw<00:06:51.850> one<00:06:52.000> around<00:06:52.210> to

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.390 
what do you know throw one around to

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.150 
what do you know throw one around to
dump<00:06:52.630> into<00:06:52.780> the<00:06:53.050> urethra<00:06:53.710> down<00:06:54.010> there

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
dump into the urethra down there

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.780 
dump into the urethra down there
eventually

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.790 
eventually

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.720 
that's pretty cool it's kind of see one
vas<00:06:56.620> deferens<00:06:57.100> there<00:06:57.280> you<00:06:57.370> don't<00:06:57.490> see<00:06:57.610> that

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
vas deferens there you don't see that

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.970 
vas deferens there you don't see that
too<00:06:57.790> often<00:06:58.120> communicate<00:06:58.780> so<00:06:59.590> again<00:06:59.770> right

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.450 
minx I like in humans no erectile tissue

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.850 
minx I like in humans no erectile tissue
here<00:07:13.720> they<00:07:13.870> have<00:07:13.960> a<00:07:13.990> bone<00:07:14.260> in<00:07:14.290> their<00:07:14.560> penis

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:14.860 
here they have a bone in their penis

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.130 
here they have a bone in their penis
that's<00:07:15.010> called<00:07:15.280> the<00:07:15.430> baculum<00:07:15.850> or<00:07:16.240> the<00:07:16.480> auspice

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.140 
that's called the baculum or the auspice

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.000 
that's called the baculum or the auspice
okay

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010 
okay

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.800 
okay
so<00:07:18.280> something<00:07:18.550> you<00:07:18.610> wouldn't<00:07:18.850> find<00:07:19.090> in<00:07:19.360> humans

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.810 
so something you wouldn't find in humans

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.510 
so something you wouldn't find in humans
but<00:07:20.140> same<00:07:20.440> function<00:07:20.979> that<00:07:21.100> we'd<00:07:21.220> have<00:07:21.370> like

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 
but same function that we'd have like

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.620 
but same function that we'd have like
with<00:07:21.640> our<00:07:21.760> erectile<00:07:22.120> tissue

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:22.630 
with our erectile tissue

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.980 
with our erectile tissue
so<00:07:22.990> again<00:07:23.229> penis<00:07:23.669> testes<00:07:24.669> spermatic<00:07:25.419> cord<00:07:25.450> and

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
so again penis testes spermatic cord and

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.870 
so again penis testes spermatic cord and
prostate<00:07:26.650> gland<00:07:26.919> which<00:07:27.070> is<00:07:27.160> just<00:07:27.340> deep<00:07:27.520> just

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:27.880 
prostate gland which is just deep just

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.490 
prostate gland which is just deep just
inferior<00:07:28.270> to<00:07:28.360> the<00:07:28.419> bladder<00:07:28.630> so<00:07:29.200> those<00:07:29.350> are

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.500 
inferior to the bladder so those are

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.950 
inferior to the bladder so those are
major<00:07:29.650> structures<00:07:30.190> in<00:07:30.460> the<00:07:30.640> mail<00:07:31.270> system<00:07:31.870> if

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 
major structures in the mail system if

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.280 
major structures in the mail system if
you<00:07:32.020> want<00:07:32.200> to<00:07:32.260> identify<00:07:32.770> on<00:07:32.979> the<00:07:33.070> meat
