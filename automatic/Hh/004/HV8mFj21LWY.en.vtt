00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
these engineering pictures and we don't

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.020 
these engineering pictures and we don't
know<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.070> real<00:01:11.400> engineering

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
these engineer pictures it looks that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.899 
these engineer pictures it looks that
have<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> same<00:01:32.820> form<00:01:33.210> factor<00:01:33.270> as<00:01:33.930> iphone<00:01:34.860> 4<00:01:35.220> so
