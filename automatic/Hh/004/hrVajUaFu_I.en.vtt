field<00:01:34.689> should<00:01:34.899> be<00:01:35.079> but<00:01:35.799> here<00:01:36.039> we<00:01:36.189> have<00:01:36.219> the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
field should be but here we have the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.819 
field should be but here we have the
exact<00:01:36.819> same<00:01:37.060> block<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.630> like<00:01:38.289> everything<00:01:38.740> is

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
exact same block and like everything is

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.289 
exact same block and like everything is
perfect<00:01:38.859> so<00:01:39.490> it's<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:39.819> much<00:01:39.969> easier<00:01:40.119> to

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
perfect so it's so much easier to

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.539 
perfect so it's so much easier to
practice<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:40.959> get<00:01:41.049> it<00:01:41.200> right<00:01:41.439> and<00:01:41.649> not<00:01:42.249> be<00:01:42.459> in

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
practice and get it right and not be in

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.819 
practice and get it right and not be in
full<00:01:42.909> panic<00:01:43.270> mode<00:01:43.420> you<00:01:44.350> know<00:01:44.380> once<00:01:44.619> you<00:01:44.679> get

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
full panic mode you know once you get

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.620 
full panic mode you know once you get
excited<00:01:45.219> in<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.369> big<00:01:45.549> house<00:01:45.700> going<00:01:46.329> from<00:01:46.539> the

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
excited in the big house going from the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.370 
excited in the big house going from the
blacktop<00:01:47.139> where

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
blacktop where

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.590 
blacktop where
had<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:49.460> didn't<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:50.180> use<00:01:50.329> as<00:01:50.450> much

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
had you didn't have to use as much

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.179 
had you didn't have to use as much
effort<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:50.960> move<00:01:51.200> you're<00:01:51.680> having<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:51.979> bounce

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
effort to move you're having the bounce

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.709 
effort to move you're having the bounce
and<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.729> turf<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.060> have<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.240> work<00:01:53.509> a<00:01:53.630> little

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
and the turf you have to work a little

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.510 
and the turf you have to work a little
bit<00:01:53.869> harder<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.350> that's<00:01:54.920> what<00:01:55.039> we<00:01:55.189> find<00:01:55.369> out

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
bit harder and that's what we find out

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.710 
bit harder and that's what we find out
when<00:01:55.670> we<00:01:55.789> get<00:01:55.880> into<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.090> big<00:01:56.210> house<00:01:56.360> is<00:01:56.509> all<00:01:56.630> we

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
when we get into the big house is all we

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.789 
when we get into the big house is all we
got<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:56.899> work<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.110> little<00:01:57.140> bit<00:01:57.350> harder<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.619> keep

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
got to work a little bit harder to keep

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.710 
got to work a little bit harder to keep
moving<00:01:58.159> well<00:01:58.520> now<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:58.759> can<00:01:59.000> get<00:01:59.119> that<00:01:59.270> practice

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
moving well now we can get that practice

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.630 
moving well now we can get that practice
out<00:01:59.869> on<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.079> field<00:02:00.229> here<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.799> then<00:02:01.340> it's

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
out on the field here and then it's

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.669 
out on the field here and then it's
going<00:02:01.939> to<00:02:02.000> be<00:02:02.090> easier<00:02:02.299> transition<00:02:02.720> into<00:02:03.439> the

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
going to be easier transition into the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:04.779 
going to be easier transition into the
big<00:02:03.829> house<00:02:04.009> with<00:02:04.039> a<00:02:04.280> hundred<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.640> ten

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
big house with a hundred and ten

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.429 
big house with a hundred and ten
thousand<00:02:05.210> people<00:02:05.360> screaming<00:02:05.869> at<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.170> to

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
thousand people screaming at you to

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.290 
thousand people screaming at you to
understand<00:02:07.369> what<00:02:07.579> you<00:02:07.670> have<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:08.000> do<00:02:08.119> to

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
understand what you have to do to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.570 
understand what you have to do to
perform<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.410> simulates<00:02:09.860> our<00:02:10.220> actual

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
perform that it simulates our actual

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.280 
perform that it simulates our actual
performance<00:02:11.090> situation<00:02:11.720> when<00:02:11.900> we<00:02:12.019> go<00:02:12.140> into

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
performance situation when we go into

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.259 
performance situation when we go into
the<00:02:12.500> stadium<00:02:12.739> and<00:02:13.099> so<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.400> makes<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.970> they're

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
the stadium and so it makes it they're

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.360 
the stadium and so it makes it they're
getting<00:02:14.569> used<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.380> feel<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.220> when

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
getting used to the feel of that so when

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.860 
getting used to the feel of that so when
they<00:02:16.459> perform<00:02:16.819> in<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> stadium<00:02:17.330> it'll<00:02:17.660> it'll

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
they perform in the stadium it'll it'll

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.960 
they perform in the stadium it'll it'll
be<00:02:17.989> an<00:02:18.080> easy<00:02:18.230> transition<00:02:18.590> also<00:02:19.580> we're<00:02:19.760> seeing

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
be an easy transition also we're seeing

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.699 
be an easy transition also we're seeing
less<00:02:20.150> injuries<00:02:20.569> we're<00:02:20.840> seeing<00:02:21.080> fewer<00:02:21.260> people

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
less injuries we're seeing fewer people

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.530 
less injuries we're seeing fewer people
with<00:02:21.890> with<00:02:22.190> knee<00:02:22.459> problems<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.209> twisted

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
with with knee problems and twisted

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.150 
with with knee problems and twisted
ankles<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.260> it's<00:02:24.380> just<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.680> healthier

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
ankles and it's just a healthier

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.009 
ankles and it's just a healthier
situation<00:02:25.700> for<00:02:25.819> our<00:02:25.910> students<00:02:26.269> it's<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.810> great

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
situation for our students it's a great

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.530 
situation for our students it's a great
great<00:02:28.010> investment<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.730> they<00:02:28.790> made<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.150> band

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
great investment that they made the band

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.699 
great investment that they made the band
and<00:02:29.780> it'll<00:02:29.989> certainly<00:02:30.230> make<00:02:30.440> our

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
and it'll certainly make our

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.920 
and it'll certainly make our
performances<00:02:31.250> on<00:02:31.430> Saturdays<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.480> wherever

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
performances on Saturdays and wherever

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.519 
performances on Saturdays and wherever
we<00:02:33.230> are<00:02:33.410> much<00:02:34.010> much<00:02:34.310> better
