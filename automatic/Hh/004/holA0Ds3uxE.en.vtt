00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Is the dream of mankind 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 That fly like a bird 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Birds are very agile 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 They fly, and have no rotary elements 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 It flies only by flapping its wings 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 So we looked at the birds 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 We tried to present a model 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Light and strong 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 It must have excellent qualities for airflow 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 He would fly alone 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 And only by fluttering their wings 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 What could be better to use? 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 And the herring, in his free kick 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Hover and then break against the sea 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 And to use this as a model to follow it? 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 So we formed a team 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Includes encyclopedists and specialists 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 In the field of aerodynamics 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 In the construction of gliders 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 The task was to build 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Model shaved indoor 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Capable of flying over your heads 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 So be careful later 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 That was one question 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 It is lightweight 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 No one will be harmed 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 If it fell on him 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 So why do all this? 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 We are a company in automation field 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 We want to build very lightweight structures 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Because these are energy efficient 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 We would like to know more about 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Air pressure and airflow phenomena 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 So I would now like you 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Attach your seat belts 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And wear your hats 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 So maybe we'll try once 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 To fly the smart bird 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 thank you 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 We can do it now 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Take a look at the clever bird 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Here is one without the outer cover 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Its wings are about two meters wide 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Length of one meter and six 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 And weight 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 It is only 450 grams 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 All carbon fiber 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 In the middle we have the engine 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 We also have gears 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 We use gears 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 To move the engine rotation 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Inside the engine, we have three sensitive holes 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 So we know exactly where 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Is the wing 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 If we beat now up and down 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 We have the possibility 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 We have the possibility to fly like a bird 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 So if you go down, you have a lot of space to pay 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 And if you go up 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 The suites are not large 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And it is easier to climb 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 So, the next thing we did 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Or the challenges we faced 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Was to coordinate this movement 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 We have to turn it, to go up and down 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Our suite is divided 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 With split wing 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 We get a lift in the upper wing 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 And we get paid at the bottom of the wing 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Also, we see 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 How can we measure aerobic efficiency 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 We had to know about 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Electromechanical efficiency 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And then we can calculate 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Aerodynamic efficiency 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Therefore, it rises from negative torsion to active twisting 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 From 30 percent to as much as 80 percent 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Next thing we have to do 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Is a control and organization 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 The whole structure 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Unless you can control and organize it 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 You will get aerobic efficiency 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 So the total consumption of energy 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 About 25 watts in take-off 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 And 16 to 18 watts in flight 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 thank you 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Marcos, and I think we should manage it again 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Yes sure
