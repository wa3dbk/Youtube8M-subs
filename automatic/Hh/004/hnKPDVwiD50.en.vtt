light brown and the dark brown together
and<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:40.459> think<00:02:40.670> that's<00:02:41.030> going<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.269> look<00:02:41.689> really

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
and I think that's going to look really

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.849 
and I think that's going to look really
really<00:02:42.379> nice<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:42.829> stick<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:45.170> then<00:02:45.290> finally

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
really nice and stick and then finally

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:52.449 
really nice and stick and then finally
