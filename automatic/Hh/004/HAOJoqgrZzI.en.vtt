 shi 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.540
 today my TV clear martin I 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:29.820
 16 years old and I'm fired at the 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:32.720
 persevering marsannay-la-cÃ´te has 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.290
 never imagined that she would go that far 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.570
 after 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.590
 and still some way there is still 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.250
 a lot of work to be able to 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.250
 continue and then keep his place because 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.040
 that nothing and nothing is acquired and 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.790
 hate rebooting me for the worlds 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.950
 the waves at glasgow so must continue 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.770
 to work 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.650
 I started at the age of three I 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.080
 did the dance before it did not move 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.800
 enough so my parents put me to the 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.780
 gym and I have it killed me I remember 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.390
 yes we were at the time in a room 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.460
 which belonged to us in the middle of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.860
 marsannay a small room where we had 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.630
 not this material there of course and she is 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.800
 came to the baby gym in 2002 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.160
 I had a predisposition of people to 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.729
 fairly flexible physical level and in addition 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.830
 at the mental level and included all very 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:35.770
 very quickly 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:38.540
 no problem I did here in baby gym 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.860
 and after I did tests to enter 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.380
 at the hope pole at dijon where I stayed 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:55.550
 seven years and I've been here for two years 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:58.460
 train at the insep in paris am not 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.040
 put pressure because I did not know 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.520
 what other effect I have not I 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.330
 not wanted to watch and well I knew that 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.600
 it was job for me it's a podium 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.870
 saw my qualifications and I was low 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.550
 serene I did not put myself two I 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.040
 am not asked any questions 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.140
 I thought of my items to the watch 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.200
 I do not want to leave 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.049
 deconcentrate by other little things 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.989
 useless 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:35.739
 I knew what I had to do and then 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.500
 tons results I just hope this 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:43.230
 of joy and I pass my coach in 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.790
 first and I will remember but if 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.250
 I was present in Montpellier so I 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.400
 immediately exploded with joy and when 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.829

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.829
 Burgundy but it's been five years 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.799
 we were waiting for this medal we saw 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.840
 that he had made a beautiful passage we 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.280
 said it must now be possible but 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.410
 well, we're still waiting for the 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.049
 note what and when the note came out c 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.610
 max was my most convincing then 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.650
 the explosion in the canton the hall 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.020
 there was really a great atmosphere 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.650
 and then the whole audience was behind 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.630
 the French 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.120
 I encouraged myself a lot 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.920
 other nations but we felt that there 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.050
 had a big fervor around and that c 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.880
 is huge also respect it postpones 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.050
 all there the whole competition will be given 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.050
 an atmosphere that ordinary 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.050
 I have a lot of emotion I'm happy 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:53.270
 I'm proud to come back here and I hope 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:56.600
 that's going to give that's going to help the 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.700
 small who also take to see 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.810
