00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.720
 pretty happy video to do this 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.639
 past video it's a video that I 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.469
 wanted to do a lot of time 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.780
 it's the video my creations before after 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.580
 because end there are several videos 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.130
 like those of this kind that are turned 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.449
 on youtube end I watched and who 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.000
 finally interested me I think it's nice 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.250
 to see the evolution of people from 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 creating casey before and cra are 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:40.170
 cased after because I find that pretty 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:42.379
 original sees the end there will be ten 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.649
 creative categories that is to say 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.870
 banny creation before after so here I 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.840
 will start with I think what has the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.719
 more changed and you will see everything from 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.969
 Following his job bij 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.160
 so you can make fun of 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.570
 creations before I reread you can 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.070
 you're mocking whose creations after 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.140
 if you're kidding it's a little bit more 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.150
 annoying you but you can 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.840
 mock I recognize you so before 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.840
 mÃ©choui 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.640
 I did it like that even I 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:23.619
 find it horrible to keep hair and 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:27.009
 rule the task here it's just too much 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.630
 ugly and now my diagrams finally 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.280
 my characters call that we lose 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.950
 a lot of chinglish no I have not too much 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:41.100
 I did like that so we can see 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:41.100
 already a size difference and finally 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.840
 can the difference anyway 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.860
 san who tells me that there is no 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.329
 difference already awake no god I 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.520
 few details here I think it's 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:59.229
 still a big difference between 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.390
 these two creations then something 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:06.610
 who still really changed I 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:10.869
 also find these are my pizer then 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.489
 before I fucked like that okay so 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.590
 it's not even textures and so 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.930
 I use and color cognac a 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:23.079
 color that I do not even use anymore and 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.090
 here finally it's just ugly and 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.859
 now my pizzas I did like that 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.790
 so this is the last last pizza 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:36.579
 that I did all well textures and so 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:42.549
 I still find her prettiest 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:44.500
 it 's a pluralism better Thursday four 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.530
 angers matches also level realism 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.870
 it's the sandwiches before it was like 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.670
 so that's the most to the task and outright 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.040
 closed off 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.830
 so that's not even textures and that's the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.770
 cognac yes always play of colors 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.060
 Angevin's champagne is there so it's 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.489
 on my laptop and his box 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.870
 so now the sandwiches I the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.160
 do like that so his superior 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.580
 textures and then that's it 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.110
 still a big difference what 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.880
 has changed these are the hamburgers too 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.750
 before that is losing my first 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.000
 first burger 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.920
 because before the hamburgers I have them 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.530
 all recognize them like that and then 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.569
 she's so ugly so if he's already finished 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.470
 it's ugly and stuff like that i'm 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:32.950
 not have a veil has finished to vary all 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.670
 ugly now so we see the 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.980
 queen difference in the color of 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.330
 salads 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.890
 the meat was more textures and 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.890
 now and then 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.760
 then this case where others 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.220
 forgive me what I actually do 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.820
 my thing and if I shoot too much and see his 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.180
 approach to forgiveness what has changed is 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.709
 the bn so before hesitating like that I 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.070
 do not even know what roxy dry color 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.220
 of copper so you see there the 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.579
 difference and already so I had done 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.370
 by hand so I do not ride bnc with 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.440
 molds so have I've ever seen a 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.220
 bn with yellow inside it's 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.180
 yellow who burned and then he's all 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.770
 rotten and that's it and after indeed like 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.900
 it's already better 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.350
 here and then arrived may 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.500
 last who are like these ci that I 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:42.190
 found relatively well 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.510
 so the tutorial is on the channel hesitate 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.479
 not to go see it it can be 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.380
 interesting if you 're interested 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.660
 then the cupcakes 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.410
 before I have them like that there is even 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.700
 no age textures for the base so 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.960
 it's ugly 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.630
 on the same kind more common on 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.550
 very strong that's all I was I was 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.950
 someone christmas now the team 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:11.740
 so is I showing you this one for 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:25.610
 the chantilly kg the base is textured and 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:30.400
 here and I have this one too, which is not 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:33.430
 bad either here in my last 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.680
 then the cakes have changed a lot 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.290
 before I did them like these have 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.520
 already it is with a knife of the 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.750
 blow all the colors are returned 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.450
 now they are like these so 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.670
 it was spoiled in date that I did 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.170
 that he is a little bit but hey 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.140
 that I find very pretty that me 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.720
 Satisfied a lot 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.970
 then the whiskers have to resist 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.800
 like that frankly you and it's very 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.480
 hot not what it looks like ya no 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.040
 textures I do not call that a mustache 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:10.460
 I call that sounds like nothing 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.520
 No, I do not think it's very pretty 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.870
 very pretty but mustache but I find 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.210
 still better at last I find it 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.470
 is a difference between the two singles 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:23.380
 trained a lot more I say you see there 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:27.620
 materials his wife has changed too 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:29.120
 before like that alone and everything 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.450
 raplapla the texture was not very 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.080
 pretty 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.700
 now you do if society 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.140
 match because I had crossed him too 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:45.320
 that's why we must admit claveau 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:46.040
 I am very pretty this one then 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.230
 you neither pop 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.600
 I put time will indeed be the only 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.950
 to watch does not size to stick to himself 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.560
 say for nobody and I wanted to do 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.790
 a kawaii effect that's all ugly 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.020
 look at the colors getting in between 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.720
 we see even more trait of the 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.530
 the time and now the said popp are 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.530
 like these 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:09.630
 indifference but the donuts 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.450
 I think that's the thing that did not 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.770
 not too changed how to stay like this 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.660
 so it 's not very pretty so that 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.030
 it's a mix of I do not know 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.850
 what color is now they are 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.440
 like that so I have not found 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.990
 hesitated not that bad so I find 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.710
 not that there is a big difference 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:30.510
 here I find it more beautiful that certainly 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.940
 but that was not so me me 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.530
 so here I am I say the biggest 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.500
 difference for me is the falls 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:40.770
 character so here I hope this 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.390
 video will have pleased you and that's it if you 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.160
 did the video tell me I'll go 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.760
 see again and I do crovisier I you 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.760
 will soon say ball
