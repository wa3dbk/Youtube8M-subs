the fact that the AI in the game hears

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.990 
the fact that the AI in the game hears
you<00:03:20.860> move<00:03:21.010> around<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.250> environment<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.880> may

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
you move around the environment and may

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.940 
you move around the environment and may
respond<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.599> that<00:03:22.720> is<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.290> really<00:03:23.590> cool<00:03:23.709> feature

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
respond to that is a really cool feature

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.069

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
but on the other hand the AI is not so

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.960 
but on the other hand the AI is not so
smart<00:03:26.319> as<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.739> can<00:03:26.860> see<00:03:27.099> in<00:03:27.280> this<00:03:27.459> video<00:03:27.700> clip

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
this review and found that the majority

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.270 
this review and found that the majority
of<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.780> executions<00:04:08.319> in<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.590> game<00:04:08.799> are<00:04:09.010> now

more<00:04:09.700> violent<00:04:10.120> than<00:04:10.239> those<00:04:10.420> in<00:04:10.569> manhunt<00:04:10.930> -

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
more violent than those in manhunt -

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.379 
more violent than those in manhunt -
this<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.889> simply<00:04:12.459> because<00:04:12.910> you<00:04:13.090> can<00:04:13.239> actually

get<00:04:27.070> me<00:04:27.160> wrong<00:04:27.310> though<00:04:27.460> because<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.820> game<00:04:27.940> is

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
get me wrong though because the game is

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.240 
get me wrong though because the game is
still<00:04:28.300> very<00:04:28.539> gory<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:29.320> in<00:04:29.590> some<00:04:29.860> occasions

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
still very gory and in some occasions

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.730 
still very gory and in some occasions
it's<00:04:30.430> even<00:04:30.700> scary<00:04:31.060> I<00:04:31.330> would<00:04:32.050> still<00:04:32.380> rate<00:04:32.590> this

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
it's even scary I would still rate this

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.930 
it's even scary I would still rate this
as<00:04:32.979> one<00:04:33.280> of<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.400> goriest
