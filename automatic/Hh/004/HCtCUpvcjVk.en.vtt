00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:20.230
 It 's a sugar to the face. 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.230

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.600

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:38.350
 Interest the things in the room do not speak 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:43.360

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.360

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:31.279
 need counter rings they need 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.479
