00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello everyone, my name is Alexander Kurgan. 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.160
 Is a game designer of Chariot World 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.050
 Today, I want to introduce you to the new model of the guild warfare "fortress" 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.240
 1. What is the "fortress"? 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.560
 First of all, the fortress is completely free 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.320
 Any guild with more than 20 members is available 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.440
 The reason for setting the limit of 20 people is because less than 20 people cannot form a guild. 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.920
 Can't do anything effectively 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.240
 So the guild wants to develop its own fortress. 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.960
 The minimum number of players is 20 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.120
 Fortress is a base of the guild 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.080
 It is a guild property that needs to be carefully protected 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.760
 Developing a fortress is one of the main goals of the guild 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.280
 Players will be able to build fortifications and receive rewards 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.520
 Rewards are also different 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.480
 May be a point reward, an experience reward or a free experience reward 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.960
 It may also be a reward for occupant experience and a reward that can promote the development of the fortress. 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.960
 Or a reward that allows you to plunder other fortresses more effectively 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.200
 2. How can players get these rewards? 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.160
 To get rewards, you need to reserve 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.480
 It operates as an event and is only valid for a specific period of time. 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.720
 The guild commander or deputy commander may be in the best position for the guild 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.280
 Enable reserve 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.280
 To make a reward valid between 7 and 9 pm 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.880
 Can be activated at 7 pm 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.360
 Then all guild members can use it for the next two hours. 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.520
 Increased economic rewards 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.680
 Rewards apply to all types of battles: random battles 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.360
 Armored battles, team battles, and assault battles 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.200
 3. The reserve is prepared in the fortifications 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.520
 What types of work are there? 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160
 When you build a fortification 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.000
 Be able to see the highest reward this fortification can offer 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.480
 Think about what rewards you need. 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.560
 The number of venues for construction work is limited 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.920
 To build new fortifications 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.760
 Need to open a new orientation 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.240
 And this involves a certain amount of risk 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.240
 Ensure that your development work is planned in advance 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.760
 To build fortifications, industrial resources are needed. 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.800
 4. What is industrial resources? 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.840
 Industrial resources are new in-game currency 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.200
 For the fortress 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.680
 Almost all operations related to the fortress require industrial resources 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.720
 Such as construction, upgrade 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.640
 As well as repairing fortifications, preparing reserves, etc. 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.280
 5. How do players get industrial resources? 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.240
 Industrial resources can be obtained by participating in this special type of "attack" 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.560
 The attack is similar to the armored battle 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.320
 Only members of the guild can participate in the attack. 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.480
 Attacks can be divided into intermediate, champion, and top three classes. 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.480
 This game mode has no restrictions on vehicle type or order. 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.240
 The only restriction is the division of the attacking class. 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.480
 The chariots below the sixth order are intermediate 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.760
 The tank below the eighth order is the champion 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.520
 The chariots below the tenth order are top 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.000
 Each class has its ability to acquire special industrial resources. 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.320
 The industrial resources brought by participating in the top battles are better than... 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.920
 More industrial resources brought about by participating in the sixth or eighth order battles 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.320
 Players can use the industrial resources obtained in the attack 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.160
 Construction and upgrading work 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.520
 Create consumables and develop your fortress in your own way 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.240
 In this game mode, players can work with... 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.200
 Also decided to participate in the attack of similar guild battles 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.720
 6. Introduce the test of "Fortress" 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.400
 Fortress is probably one of the most in-game features 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.720
 We need to introduce this model and we need to test it extensively. 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.720
 We hope it is a thoroughly polished product 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.800
 So we have to carry out a long general test on it. 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.640
 During the test, we wanted to evaluate some of the decisions made during the design process. 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.440
 This test gives us a chance to fix the bug. 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.200
 And improve the interface or game features 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.360
 For the player, you can take this opportunity to get a friendly start. 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.040
 Although the test fortress will not be transferred to the main server 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.800
 But it gives players a chance to understand how this game mode works. 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.880
 How players participate in the attack and what they need to build 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.600
 Players can learn the mechanics of this, when there is an updated version of "Fortress" released 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.800
 The player already knows what to do, so he has a certain advantage. 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.600
 This will effectively develop your own fortress. 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.040
 Other guilds that did not participate in the test 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.880
 I just started to understand the interface and function of the fortress. 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.200
 7. Can I form a guild during the test? 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.200
 Guild management is open during testing 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.480
 Players can form and manage guilds 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.800
 If you want to know more about the fortress 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.000
 Can form a new guild to learn all its features 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.280
 You can also invite friends to play together. 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.400
 You can find a special connection path on our official website. 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.600
 8. Can I purchase industrial resources or reserves with in-game gold coins? 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.840
 "Fortress" has nothing to do with gold coins 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.000
 Like creating a fortress, building fortifications 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.480
 And the preparation of reserves does not require any gold trading 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.480
 Even a value-added account will not increase 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.000
 Industrial resource income in the attack 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.040
 Industrial resources can only be obtained in an attack 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.880
 And all economic rewards can only be used in combat 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.400
 9. Why is the current level of the fortress limited to 4? 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.640
 In the beginning, the highest level of fort development was level 4 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.960
 This helps us collect more information about player actions. 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.080
 And understand what we need to improve 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.800
 And what problems need to be solved 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.480
 During the first phase, players will be able to participate in the attack. 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.880
 And get industrial resources, but 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.200
 Can't attack other guild fortresses, nor lose their fortress 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.680
 We have to give players a chance 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.120
 Let them develop their fortress to level 4 in order to prepare for further activities 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.560
 That is to unlock level 5 and attack other guild fortresses 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.320
 10. How was the fortress developed? 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.840
 Once we think the development within the fortress level 4 is working well 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.160
 Players participate in attacks and receive industrial resource rewards 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.720
 We will provide further development levels 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.840
 5 to 10 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.240
 At that stage, the guild can attack each other's fortress. 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.040
 And can obtain industrial resources by plundering the fortress 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.520
 Then, by the third stage, the player will be able to... 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.360
 Create combat consumables in your own fortress 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.280
 Combat consumables include bombers and reconnaissance aircraft 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.040
 Minefield and chariot turret 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.760
 Players can use these consumables in combat 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.000
 They help defend the fortress 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.920
 And the fortress that successfully attacked and plundered other guilds
