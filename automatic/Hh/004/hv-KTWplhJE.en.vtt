50,000<00:02:15.260> kilometers<00:02:15.410> or<00:02:16.370> on<00:02:16.730> someone's<00:02:17.150> they

50,000 kilometers or on someone's they

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.449 
50,000 kilometers or on someone's they

call that a service interval three on

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.100 
call that a service interval three on
the<00:02:19.640> really<00:02:19.880> old<00:02:20.030> mole<00:02:20.270> service<00:02:20.720> schedule

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
the really old mole service schedule

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
the really old mole service schedule
that's<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:23.060> book<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:23.510> looks<00:02:23.720> like

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
that's this the book that looks like

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.830 
that's this the book that looks like
that<00:02:25.130> if<00:02:25.819> you've<00:02:25.970> got<00:02:26.120> one<00:02:26.239> of<00:02:26.330> those<00:02:26.450> service

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
that if you've got one of those service

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.110 
that if you've got one of those service
books<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.380> then<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.280> later<00:02:28.489> model<00:02:28.910> book<00:02:29.090> a

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
books and then the later model book a

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.720 
books and then the later model book a
little<00:02:29.810> bit<00:02:29.959> different<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:31.160> looks<00:02:31.190> like<00:02:31.550> this

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
little bit different it looks like this

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.360 
little bit different it looks like this
one<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.600> that's<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.959> Oh<00:02:32.989> sixth<00:02:33.590> STI<00:02:33.980> or

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
one so that's the Oh sixth STI or

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.210 
one so that's the Oh sixth STI or
similar<00:02:35.090> moles<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.720> then<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.590> current<00:02:37.069> more

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
similar moles and then the current more

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.009 
similar moles and then the current more
ones<00:02:37.459> which<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:37.790> then<00:02:37.970> why<00:02:38.150> eleven<00:02:38.510> now<00:02:38.720> looks

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
ones which is then why eleven now looks

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.080 
ones which is then why eleven now looks
like<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.680> you'll<00:02:39.769> notice<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.760> service

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
like that and you'll notice the service

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.490 
like that and you'll notice the service
intervals<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.660> way<00:02:41.780> it's<00:02:41.930> written<00:02:42.050> down<00:02:42.320> is<00:02:42.470> a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
intervals the way it's written down is a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.360 
intervals the way it's written down is a
little<00:02:42.680> bit<00:02:42.769> different<00:02:43.040> as<00:02:43.100> well<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.310> will

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
little bit different as well it will

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.400 
little bit different as well it will
show<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.610> some<00:02:43.850> scan<00:02:44.180> information<00:02:45.050> during

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
show you some scan information during

show you some scan information during
the<00:02:45.500> video<00:02:45.650> now<00:02:46.540> obviously<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:48.200> important

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
the video now obviously the important

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.720 
the video now obviously the important
thing<00:02:48.800> that<00:02:48.830> I<00:02:48.950> want<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.190> draw<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.489> your

the<00:03:08.600> big<00:03:08.840> mistake<00:03:09.319> that<00:03:09.350> everybody<00:03:09.980> makes<00:03:10.250> an

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
the big mistake that everybody makes an

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.069 
the big mistake that everybody makes an
unfortunate<00:03:11.000> limit<00:03:11.299> of<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.480> subaru<00:03:11.810> dealer

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
unfortunate limit of a subaru dealer

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.050 
unfortunate limit of a subaru dealer
level<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.590> they<00:03:12.950> focus<00:03:13.160> on<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.549> kilometers

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
level is they focus on the kilometers

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.780 
level is they focus on the kilometers
traveled<00:03:14.410> not<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.590> time<00:03:15.860> taken

and<00:03:17.180> often<00:03:17.480> if<00:03:17.569> you've<00:03:17.689> got<00:03:17.840> carbons<00:03:18.260> are<00:03:18.409> very

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
and often if you've got carbons are very

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.429 
and often if you've got carbons are very
low<00:03:18.799> kilometers<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.480> may<00:03:20.629> still<00:03:20.959> be<00:03:20.989> six

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
unfortunately that does need the timing

unfortunately that does need the timing
got<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:25.010> be<00:03:25.099> changed<00:03:25.579> even<00:03:25.819> though<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.180> may

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
got to be changed even though it may

have done have done say 70,000
kilometers<00:03:28.640> on<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.299> speedo<00:03:29.629> as<00:03:30.319> a<00:03:30.379> good

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
kilometers on the speedo as a good

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.559 
kilometers on the speedo as a good
example<00:03:30.980> if<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.400> pop<00:03:31.670> your<00:03:31.970> Subaru<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
example if you pop your Subaru and the

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.780 
example if you pop your Subaru and the
garage<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:33.170> let<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.440> engine<00:03:33.530> idle<00:03:33.860> for<00:03:34.549> four

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.089 
garage and let the engine idle for four
years<00:03:35.200> obviously<00:03:36.200> it's<00:03:36.440> going<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.709> be<00:03:36.829> four

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
years obviously it's going to be four

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.619 
years obviously it's going to be four
years<00:03:37.310> old<00:03:37.579> but<00:03:37.819> it<00:03:37.909> won't<00:03:38.060> have<00:03:38.150> trouble<00:03:38.480> any

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
years old but it won't have trouble any

any<00:03:39.110> distance<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:39.739> kilometers<00:03:40.340> the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
any distance in kilometers the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.750 
any distance in kilometers the
alternative<00:03:42.019> is<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.680> if<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:43.040> drive<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.340> lot<00:03:43.670> of

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
alternative is is if you drive a lot of

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.280 
alternative is is if you drive a lot of
kilometers<00:03:44.359> in<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.540> very<00:03:44.750> short<00:03:44.900> period<00:03:45.049> of

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
kilometers in a very short period of

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.550 
kilometers in a very short period of
time

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
time

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.649 
time
that's<00:03:46.159> why<00:03:46.400> distance<00:03:46.909> and<00:03:47.120> time<00:03:47.299> is<00:03:47.450> very

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
that's why distance and time is very

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.569 
that's why distance and time is very
very<00:03:47.900> important<00:03:48.409> because<00:03:48.530> example<00:03:49.310> brake
