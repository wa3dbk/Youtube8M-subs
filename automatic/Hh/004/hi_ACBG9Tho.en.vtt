difficult<00:00:34.829> um<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.430> originally<00:00:35.969> started<00:00:36.270> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
difficult um I originally started a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.930 
difficult um I originally started a
gameplay<00:00:37.110> video<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.430> got<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
gameplay video on this and I got to the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.459 
gameplay video on this and I got to the
balls<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.360> first<00:00:39.629> stage<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> can't

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
balls to the first stage and I can't

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.830 
balls to the first stage and I can't
beat<00:00:40.649> him<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.219> looked<00:00:41.370> online<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.239> sort

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
beat him and I looked online and I sort

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.660 
beat him and I looked online and I sort
of<00:00:42.960> figured<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:43.350> how<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.680> beat<00:00:43.950> him<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.610> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
of figured out how to beat him but I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.220 
of figured out how to beat him but I
still<00:00:45.090> don't<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.360> I'm<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.079> able

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
still don't think I'm going to be able

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.630 
still don't think I'm going to be able
to<00:00:46.289> beat<00:00:46.410> them<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.950> probably<00:00:47.370> won't<00:00:47.489> even

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
to beat them so this probably won't even

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
to beat them so this probably won't even
make<00:00:47.850> ten<00:00:48.120> minutes<00:00:48.420> we'll<00:00:49.050> probably<00:00:49.320> just

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
make ten minutes we'll probably just

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.189 
make ten minutes we'll probably just
play<00:00:49.800> until<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.430> ass<00:00:50.640> beat<00:00:50.969> by<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> boss

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
play until I get my ass beat by the boss

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.139 
play until I get my ass beat by the boss

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.109 
want to just tell you a little bit more
about<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.869> um<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:44.130> basically<00:01:44.369> play<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> leaf

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
about it um you basically play a leaf

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.550 
about it um you basically play a leaf
character<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.740> unlimited<00:01:46.979> lives
