00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
of them have some very similar features

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.940 
of them have some very similar features
when<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.450> want<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.690> draw<00:00:12.870> one<00:00:13.139> like<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.679> horse

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
when you want to draw one like a horse

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.099 
when you want to draw one like a horse
you<00:00:14.639> can<00:00:14.790> take<00:00:14.940> what<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.269> know<00:00:15.480> from<00:00:15.839> drawing

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
you can take what you know from drawing

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.349 
you can take what you know from drawing
that<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.680> apply<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.640> drawing<00:00:17.940> another

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
that and apply it to drawing another

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.700 
that and apply it to drawing another
animal<00:00:18.750> like<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.230> wolf

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
animal like this wolf

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.890 
animal like this wolf
so<00:00:20.279> let's<00:00:20.490> look<00:00:20.609> here<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> sketch<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.480> one<00:00:21.689> out

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
so let's look here I sketch this one out

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.560 
so let's look here I sketch this one out
I<00:00:22.080> used<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.470> reference<00:00:22.830> photo<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.189> course<00:00:23.570> if

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
I used a reference photo of course if

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.790 
I used a reference photo of course if
you're<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:24.840> sure<00:00:25.050> about<00:00:25.140> how<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.350> draw<00:00:25.619> things

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
you're not sure about how to draw things

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.710 
you're not sure about how to draw things
reference<00:00:26.220> photos<00:00:26.550> are<00:00:26.730> awesome<00:00:27.330> thing<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
reference photos are awesome thing to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.230 
reference photos are awesome thing to
use<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.340> use<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:29.789> shapes

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
use so I use my shapes

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.600 
use so I use my shapes
obviously<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:31.650> bit<00:00:31.769> different<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
obviously a little bit different in the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.600 
obviously a little bit different in the
build<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:33.350> in<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> detailing<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> horse

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
build up in the detailing then a horse

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 
build up in the detailing then a horse
but<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.239> circle<00:00:36.660> for<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> head<00:00:36.930> circle<00:00:37.620> for<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
but I circle for the head circle for the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.950 
but I circle for the head circle for the
chest<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> circle<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> hip<00:00:39.719> area

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
chest and then a circle for the hip area

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.729 
chest and then a circle for the hip area
also<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.160> see<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.550> used<00:00:41.969> my<00:00:42.690> leg<00:00:43.320> bone

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
also you can see I used my leg bone

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.029 
also you can see I used my leg bone
lines<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.539> pivoting<00:00:45.539> joint<00:00:45.780> areas<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.860> help

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
lines and pivoting joint areas to help

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.130 
lines and pivoting joint areas to help
build<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> horse

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
build this in just like I do on a horse

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
build this in just like I do on a horse
it<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:50.250> helps<00:00:50.610> when<00:00:50.789> you're<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it really helps when you're going to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
it really helps when you're going to
draw<00:00:51.360> something<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.199> get<00:00:52.410> some<00:00:52.739> Anatomy

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
draw something if you get some Anatomy

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.369 
draw something if you get some Anatomy
pictures<00:00:53.640> see<00:00:54.239> how<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> bone<00:00:54.719> structure<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
pictures see how the bone structure and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.380 
pictures see how the bone structure and
the<00:00:55.559> muscle<00:00:55.890> structure<00:00:56.340> work<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.850> different

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the muscle structure work on different

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.569 
the muscle structure work on different
kinds<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.780> animals<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.829> let's<00:00:59.010> look<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
kinds of animals so let's look at the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.479 
kinds of animals so let's look at the
wolf's<00:00:59.910> face<00:01:00.770> when<00:01:01.770> drawing<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> will<00:01:02.280> face

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
wolf's face when drawing the will face

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.939 
wolf's face when drawing the will face
I'm<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.910> start<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.570> oval<00:01:04.170> shape<00:01:04.589> on

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
I'm going to start with a oval shape on

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.670 
I'm going to start with a oval shape on
its<00:01:05.129> side

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.370 

then<00:01:08.680> I'm<00:01:08.860> going<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.160> add<00:01:09.340> in<00:01:09.790> a<00:01:10.380> cross-section

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
then I'm going to add in a cross-section

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.730 
then I'm going to add in a cross-section
I'm<00:01:11.440> going<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.620> bring<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.830> line<00:01:12.040> straight<00:01:12.580> down

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
I'm going to bring a line straight down

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.290 
I'm going to bring a line straight down
let's<00:01:14.740> leave<00:01:14.980> the<00:01:15.130> center<00:01:15.550> between<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.030> bed

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
let's leave the center between the bed

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.420 
let's leave the center between the bed
of<00:01:16.390> two<00:01:16.540> moles<00:01:16.720> eyes<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.070> then<00:01:18.160> I'm<00:01:18.250> going<00:01:18.370> to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
of two moles eyes and then I'm going to

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.990 
of two moles eyes and then I'm going to
cut<00:01:18.610> this<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:20.200> one<00:01:20.530> half<00:01:20.830> this<00:01:21.610> will<00:01:21.760> be<00:01:21.880> the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
cut this for one half this will be the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.920 
cut this for one half this will be the
eyeline<00:01:22.510> and<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:24.400> center<00:01:24.700> here<00:01:25.030> then<00:01:25.600> coming

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
eyeline and the center here then coming

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.540 
eyeline and the center here then coming
down<00:01:26.080> just<00:01:27.570> below<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.930> circle<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:30.280> where<00:01:30.460> I'm

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
down just below the circle is where I'm

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.280 
down just below the circle is where I'm
going<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.700> put<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.970> nose<00:01:31.180> at<00:01:31.510> if<00:01:31.690> this<00:01:31.810> is<00:01:32.020> that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
going to put the nose at if this is that

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.350 
going to put the nose at if this is that
this<00:01:32.470> wolf<00:01:32.740> is<00:01:32.920> looking<00:01:33.220> straight<00:01:33.610> at<00:01:33.820> it<00:01:33.970> so

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
this wolf is looking straight at it so

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.330 
this wolf is looking straight at it so
right<00:01:34.660> below<00:01:35.020> my<00:01:35.260> vocal<00:01:35.740> I'm<00:01:35.830> going<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.070> put<00:01:36.220> in

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
right below my vocal I'm going to put in

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.060 
right below my vocal I'm going to put in
a<00:01:36.580> circle<00:01:37.030> shape<00:01:37.060> for<00:01:37.480> the<00:01:37.570> nose<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.110> right

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
a circle shape for the nose and right

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.360 
a circle shape for the nose and right
below<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.580> I'm<00:01:39.760> going<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.940> put<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:41.220> upper<00:01:42.220> lip

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
below it I'm going to put the upper lip

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.950 
below it I'm going to put the upper lip
what<00:01:43.240> we're<00:01:43.360> doing<00:01:43.510> right<00:01:43.630> now<00:01:43.690> is<00:01:43.930> just

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
what we're doing right now is just

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.620 
what we're doing right now is just
pretty<00:01:44.260> much<00:01:44.350> blocking<00:01:45.070> in<00:01:45.310> what<00:01:45.820> we<00:01:45.940> see<00:01:46.210> with

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
pretty much blocking in what we see with

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.350 
pretty much blocking in what we see with
