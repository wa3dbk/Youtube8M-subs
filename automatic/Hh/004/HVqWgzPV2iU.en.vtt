 sites that will stick to their cement 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.060

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.769
 cutaneous ensures its protective function

 in depth the insensitive loss in 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.129

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.390
 a well hydrated skin 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.310
 the thermal water of uriage and so 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.409
 particularly indicated for all 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.750
 even the most sensitive skins and for 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.819
 the altered epidermis 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.170
 the thermal water of uriage a unique water 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.170
 which reinforces the cutaneous barrier
