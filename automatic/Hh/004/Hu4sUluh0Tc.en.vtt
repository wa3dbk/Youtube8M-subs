00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
now speed up every four five cast okay

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.340 
now speed up every four five cast okay
now<00:01:29.150> this<00:01:29.300> is<00:01:29.360> going<00:01:29.660> to<00:01:29.780> do<00:01:29.870> a<00:01:29.900> couple<00:01:30.200> things

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
now this is going to do a couple things

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.410 
now this is going to do a couple things
first<00:01:31.010> off<00:01:31.250> its<00:01:31.520> going<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.700> teach<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.150> two<00:01:32.240> how

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
first off its going to teach you two how

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.110 
first off its going to teach you two how
to<00:01:32.450> form<00:01:33.230> a<00:01:33.350> proper<00:01:33.680> loop<00:01:34.010> and<00:01:34.490> it's<00:01:34.910> also

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
to form a proper loop and it's also

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.240 
to form a proper loop and it's also
going<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.510> bring<00:01:35.660> a<00:01:35.960> build<00:01:36.560> your<00:01:36.770> casting

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
going to bring a build your casting

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.530 
going to bring a build your casting
strengths<00:01:37.790> okay

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
strengths okay

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.090 
strengths okay
now<00:01:39.200> also<00:01:39.770> speed<00:01:40.640> up<00:01:40.810> keep<00:01:41.810> speeding<00:01:42.170> up<00:01:45.100> speed

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
now also speed up keep speeding up speed

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.350 
now also speed up keep speeding up speed
up<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.550> fast<00:01:46.910> as<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:47.300> possibly<00:01:47.330> can<00:01:48.050> go

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
up to fast as you possibly can go

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:59.020 
up to fast as you possibly can go
without<00:01:55.150> now<00:01:56.150> once<00:01:56.479> you<00:01:56.600> tire<00:01:56.869> out<00:01:58.000> sit<00:01:59.000> back

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
without now once you tire out sit back

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.180 
without now once you tire out sit back
up<00:01:59.740> okay<00:02:00.740> now<00:02:01.450> if<00:02:02.450> during<00:02:02.840> any<00:02:03.200> time<00:02:03.530> you

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
up okay now if during any time you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.830 
up okay now if during any time you
create<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.670> tailing<00:02:05.210> loop

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
create a tailing loop

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.130 
create a tailing loop
be<00:02:06.560> sure<00:02:06.800> to<00:02:06.830> slow<00:02:07.340> back<00:02:07.610> down<00:02:07.640> start<00:02:08.630> forming

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
be sure to slow back down start forming

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.400 
be sure to slow back down start forming
that<00:02:09.320> tight<00:02:09.619> loop<00:02:09.860> again<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.570> then<00:02:11.570> once<00:02:12.290> you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
that tight loop again and then once you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.580 
that tight loop again and then once you
start<00:02:12.470> forming<00:02:13.070> your<00:02:13.190> tight<00:02:13.430> loop<00:02:13.670> again

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
start forming your tight loop again

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.240 
start forming your tight loop again
speed<00:02:15.590> back<00:02:15.890> up<00:02:17.350> we<00:02:18.350> want<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.620> start<00:02:18.830> out<00:02:18.980> real

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
speed back up we want to start out real

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.930 
speed back up we want to start out real
slow<00:02:19.520> again

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
slow again

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.140 
slow again
form<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.570> nice<00:02:20.750> tight<00:02:21.110> loop<00:02:21.850> just<00:02:22.850> like<00:02:23.000> I'm

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
form a nice tight loop just like I'm

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.199 
form a nice tight loop just like I'm
doing<00:02:23.390> right<00:02:23.540> here<00:02:27.160> speed<00:02:28.160> up<00:02:28.370> speed<00:02:28.850> your

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
doing right here speed up speed your
