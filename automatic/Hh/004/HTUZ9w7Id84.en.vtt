00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello guys only channel on long 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.020
 career and I knew that today the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.570
 would be sending the first and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.090
 year for you and I asked them 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.590
 let you send this I 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.560
 talking lately with several 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.180
 people from the 1st day about which are 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.519
 living for career resolutions 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.740
 2014 and several people new friends hours 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.570
 has not spoken that he does not even like 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.179
 easier resolution because they are so 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.980
 frustrated with the latter sometimes not 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.230
 leaves the last years 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.829
 they want to avoid this disappointment and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.129
 Who the hell is that horrible then? 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.800
 I decided to make a video to help you 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.399
 make good career solutions in the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.629
 indy life also did not think that good in the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.149
 background on the bottom what we want 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.620
 we want to be happier to solve 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.449
 people are more satisfied with our 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.160
 Life, we have to first think the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.550
 which makes people happier in the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.190
 life then take away the resolutions 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.320
 things that are simply things to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.320
 people have to have our resolutions to 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.840
 projects that will make people 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.760
 feel that we are making progress 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.350
 growing up with the human being 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.960
 So the best thing to think is that you 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.810
 Can change your life is to think that you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.700
 can progress as a human being or as a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.950
 then you can 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.240
 a life and a career with more than 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.490
 purpose you can yes it is a person 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.340
 more productive and balance in life 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.229
 You can do more things than 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.899
 feed your soul, right? 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.030
 Only you have to take this concept away from you. 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.640
 need to change your life you need in 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.729
 somehow progressing in your life. 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.220
 life because change is inherent in life 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.060
 the seasons of the year change in your body 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.790
 change everything changes change is automatic 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.549
 progress is not automatic and progress in 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.960
 Life, you want to do something with 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.700
 In your life you need to take on the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.119
 responsibility 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.650
 your life hold your hand in your resolution 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.170
 and by the way you need to review oo 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.000
 of the word resolution nÃ© 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.400
 because people make a list of 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.099
 resolutions think it creates a list of 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.890
 wishes do not write here webb com 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.739
 hope that will happen but a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.739
 wish list in word resolution 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.730
 it means that you decide to do something 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:39.200
 thing and that will be solved by doing 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.739
 this year with his career in four 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.510
 items that should be present in your 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.860
 list of resolutions for his career in 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.900
 2014 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:54.230
 the first item is at least two 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.660
 great two career projects 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.790
 great goals of every thing 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.810
 makes you excited that it's difficult and 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.810
 challenger 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.970
 so I do not know what it could be to change jobs 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.040
 if that is the case and if you want to change 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.090
 employment can get a promotion can 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.090
 be raising your salary 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.010
 get to do a certain project 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.139
 anyway you know what two would be 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.100
 specific career goals 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.549
 for you 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.280
 the other thing that should also belong to your 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.069
 resolution is to get some new 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.260
 cellular ability is a course that meets 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.299
 who wants to do something 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.120
 ability that you would like 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:39.350
 lack of doing so puts you at 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.760
 least one as third 2014 resolutions 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.930
 investing in self-knowledge will not 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.489
 get nowhere if you will not 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.230
 progress to nowhere if you do not 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.450
 if you know this is a basic principle 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.930
 so I do not know what you 're going to do if you go 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.599
 do yoga martial art only make one 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.109
 course in the mountains with the 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:59.690
 mounts are joseph coutinhas therapy not 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.349
 Whether you know anything goes 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.040
 to get to know and invest in yourself 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.040
 the fourth resolution 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.190
 is another important factor in your 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.550
 resolutions that you can have a 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.489
 picture of you 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.459
 in late 2014 like you're in 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.070
 2014 so if I close my eyes like 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.020
 Can you imagine 2014 if everything 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.170
 possible as you would like to 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.480
 imagine then I do not know what really 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.610
 upset and sees that there are several people 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.500
 new ones that are already giving up doing 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.930
 resolutions so before recording this 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.850
 video I hope you have somehow 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.910
 it has been useful for you to 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.580
 least until a spark has gone well and 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.100
 because if you can go dispatch the 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.919

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.010
