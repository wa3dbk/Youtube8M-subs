00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
about I think Spurs obviously had a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.660 
about I think Spurs obviously had a
pretty<00:01:06.689> poor<00:01:06.990> last<00:01:07.530> week<00:01:07.890> or<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.250> they've<00:01:08.460> lost

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
pretty poor last week or so they've lost

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.899 
pretty poor last week or so they've lost
two<00:01:09.140> consecutive<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> games<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.070> Chelsea

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
two consecutive in the games to Chelsea

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.179 
two consecutive in the games to Chelsea
and<00:01:11.970> Arsenal<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.590> in<00:01:13.590> desperate<00:01:13.920> need<00:01:13.979> of

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
and Arsenal and in desperate need of

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.010 
and Arsenal and in desperate need of
victory<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:14.820> anything<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.330> lift<00:01:15.689> them<00:01:15.840> more

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
victory if anything just lift them more

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.700 
victory if anything just lift them more
out<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.360> they<00:01:18.810> might<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.229> just

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
out and and I think they might just just

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.920 
out and and I think they might just just
come<00:01:19.860> through<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.189> win<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.689> mm-hmm<00:01:21.689> you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
come through the win here mm-hmm you

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.870 
come through the win here mm-hmm you
could<00:01:22.049> also<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.409> sa<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> draw<00:01:23.040> no<00:01:23.220> bet<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.460> suppose

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
could also do sa a draw no bet I suppose

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.149 
could also do sa a draw no bet I suppose
for<00:01:24.119> Spurs<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.320> cover<00:01:25.530> sort<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.830> both<00:01:25.979> of

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
for Spurs there to cover sort of both of

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.350 
for Spurs there to cover sort of both of
those<00:01:26.220> because<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.759> could<00:01:26.939> end<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
those because I think it could end in a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.920 
those because I think it could end in a
draw<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> possibility<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930
