I loved black ops 2 advanced warfare was

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.570 
I loved black ops 2 advanced warfare was
a<00:00:13.170> lot<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.410> fun<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> put<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> lot<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.160> hours<00:00:14.429> into

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
a lot of fun I put a lot of hours into

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.420 
a lot of fun I put a lot of hours into
multiplayer<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.690> let's<00:00:16.190> see<00:00:17.190> where

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
multiplayer on that so let's see where

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.570 
multiplayer on that so let's see where
this<00:00:18.470> this<00:00:19.470> new<00:00:19.710> game<00:00:19.949> goes<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.400> mean<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
this this new game goes I mean the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.040 
this this new game goes I mean the
graphics<00:00:21.000> should<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.420> be<00:00:21.539> insane<00:00:21.900> because

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
graphics should just be insane because

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.560 
graphics should just be insane because
apparently<00:00:22.500> it's<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.859> car<00:00:23.340> engine<00:00:23.580> only<00:00:24.150> title

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
apparently it's a car engine only title

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.670 
apparently it's a car engine only title
which<00:00:25.230> advanced<00:00:25.769> warfare<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:26.430> cross<00:00:26.880> gen<00:00:27.240> so

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
which advanced warfare was cross gen so

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.259 
which advanced warfare was cross gen so
they<00:00:28.680> weren't<00:00:28.890> able<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.250> pull<00:00:29.640> off<00:00:29.820> as<00:00:30.060> much<00:00:30.210> as

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
they weren't able to pull off as much as

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.220 
they weren't able to pull off as much as
they<00:00:30.539> probably<00:00:30.750> wanted<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.980> game

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
they probably wanted to so this game

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.540 
they probably wanted to so this game
should<00:00:34.230> look<00:00:34.410> insane<00:00:34.770> especially<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> Call

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
should look insane especially for a Call

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.850 
should look insane especially for a Call
of<00:00:35.579> Duty<00:00:35.670> game<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.180> let's<00:00:36.600> see<00:00:37.590> what<00:00:37.739> they<00:00:37.829> have

that<00:02:05.360> was<00:02:05.570> about<00:02:05.870> that<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.770> awesome

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:26.670 

black<00:02:17.510> ops<00:02:17.750> three<00:02:21.160> all<00:02:22.160> right<00:02:24.220> November<00:02:25.450> 6

black ops three all right November 6

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:37.620 
black ops three all right November 6
2015<00:02:28.630> which<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.870> zombies<00:02:36.230> all<00:02:36.560> right

first things first

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.190 
first things first
the<00:02:39.620> graphics<00:02:40.630> don't<00:02:41.630> know<00:02:41.750> what<00:02:41.870> happened

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
the graphics don't know what happened

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.840 
the graphics don't know what happened
they<00:02:42.260> look<00:02:42.440> just<00:02:42.650> like<00:02:42.800> advanced<00:02:43.489> warfare

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
they look just like advanced warfare

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.500 
they look just like advanced warfare
which<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.620> kind<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.860> weird<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.760> me<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.120> don't

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
which is kind of weird to me I don't

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.850 
which is kind of weird to me I don't
know<00:02:47.660> if<00:02:47.750> they<00:02:47.840> decided<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.380> only<00:02:48.739> go

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
know if they decided to only go

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.920 
know if they decided to only go
current-gen<00:02:49.430> maybe<00:02:50.090> right<00:02:50.420> at<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.630> end<00:02:50.780> of

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
current-gen maybe right at the end of

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.430 
current-gen maybe right at the end of
this<00:02:51.019> like<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:52.069> development<00:02:52.580> cycle<00:02:53.440> they're

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
this like the development cycle they're

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.110 
this like the development cycle they're
obviously<00:02:54.769> in<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.160> end<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.489> it<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:55.640> mean<00:02:55.880> it

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
obviously in the end of it I mean it

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.610 
obviously in the end of it I mean it
comes<00:02:56.390> down<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.600> November<00:02:57.019> so<00:02:57.200> they're<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.530> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
comes down to November so they're in the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.000 
comes down to November so they're in the
tail<00:02:57.799> end<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.130> six<00:02:58.370> months<00:02:59.470> it<00:03:00.470> just<00:03:00.530> seems

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
tail end the six months it just seems

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.410 
tail end the six months it just seems
odd<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:03.319> doesn't<00:03:03.680> look<00:03:03.799> as<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:05.209> much

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
odd that it doesn't look as that much

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.199 
odd that it doesn't look as that much
better<00:03:05.660> than<00:03:05.930> advanced<00:03:06.860> warfare<00:03:07.370> did<00:03:07.549> I<00:03:07.760> mean

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
better than advanced warfare did I mean

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.979 
better than advanced warfare did I mean
they<00:03:08.330> should<00:03:08.690> be<00:03:08.870> able<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.640> really<00:03:10.640> go<00:03:11.150> all<00:03:11.420> out

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
they should be able to really go all out

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.280 
they should be able to really go all out
with<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.560> current<00:03:12.860> gen<00:03:13.010> hardware<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.930> that's

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
with the current gen hardware so that's

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.240 
with the current gen hardware so that's
surprising<00:03:16.070> um<00:03:16.250> good<00:03:17.000> things<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.690> mobility

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
surprising um good things the mobility

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.180 
surprising um good things the mobility
looks<00:03:19.250> like<00:03:19.940> titanfall<00:03:20.359> which<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:20.930> loved<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.470> I

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
looks like titanfall which I loved and I

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.620 
looks like titanfall which I loved and I
saw<00:03:22.489> a<00:03:22.519> pistol<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.120> kind<00:03:23.390> of<00:03:23.420> looked<00:03:23.600> like

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
saw a pistol that kind of looked like

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.710 
saw a pistol that kind of looked like
the<00:03:23.810> Destiny<00:03:24.260> pistol<00:03:24.650> which<00:03:25.239> it's<00:03:26.239> cool<00:03:26.510> I'll

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
the Destiny pistol which it's cool I'll

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.270 
the Destiny pistol which it's cool I'll
always<00:03:27.019> love<00:03:27.260> pistols<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.829> there<00:03:27.920> was<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.040> bow

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
always love pistols and there was a bow

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.300 
always love pistols and there was a bow
in<00:03:28.430> there<00:03:28.579> and<00:03:29.380> like<00:03:30.380> kind<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.680> like<00:03:30.829> a<00:03:30.859> machine

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
in there and like kind of like a machine

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.670 
in there and like kind of like a machine
gun<00:03:31.549> that<00:03:31.730> pops<00:03:32.209> out<00:03:32.390> of<00:03:32.420> your<00:03:32.540> arm<00:03:32.780> which<00:03:33.530> is

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
slide apparently you could wall jump

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.840 
slide apparently you could wall jump
jump<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.140> air<00:03:39.170> change<00:03:39.950> directions<00:03:40.340> in<00:03:40.700> the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
jump in the air change directions in the

air and then slide on the ground which
is<00:03:43.310> pretty<00:03:43.549> cool<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.790> lot<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.269> mobility<00:03:44.510> um

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
is pretty cool a lot of mobility um

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.479 
is pretty cool a lot of mobility um
that's<00:03:45.590> gonna<00:03:45.799> be<00:03:45.980> awesome<00:03:46.130> during

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
that's gonna be awesome during

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.550 
that's gonna be awesome during
multiplayer<00:03:46.820> I<00:03:47.299> wonder<00:03:48.290> if<00:03:48.380> they're<00:03:48.530> actually

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
multiplayer I wonder if they're actually

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.979 
multiplayer I wonder if they're actually
gonna<00:03:49.010> be<00:03:49.190> able<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.459> incorporate<00:03:50.209> that<00:03:50.540> fully

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
gonna be able to incorporate that fully

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.809 
gonna be able to incorporate that fully
during<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.440> campaign<00:03:51.950> because<00:03:52.250> in<00:03:52.519> advanced

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
during the campaign because in advanced

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.069 
during the campaign because in advanced
warfare<00:03:53.269> one<00:03:53.390> of<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.540> things<00:03:53.690> that<00:03:53.840> didn't

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
warfare one of the things that didn't

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.380 
warfare one of the things that didn't
like<00:03:54.200> is<00:03:54.440> you're<00:03:54.650> only<00:03:54.859> you<00:03:55.730> only<00:03:55.940> have<00:03:56.239> access

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
like is you're only you only have access

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.500 
like is you're only you only have access
to<00:03:56.660> certain<00:03:57.670> mobility<00:03:58.670> functions<00:03:59.120> with<00:03:59.390> the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
to certain mobility functions with the

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.979 
to certain mobility functions with the
exosuit<00:04:00.109> like<00:04:01.120> during<00:04:02.120> different<00:04:02.420> levels<00:04:02.780> and

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
exosuit like during different levels and

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.270 
exosuit like during different levels and
it<00:04:03.079> just<00:04:03.260> seemed<00:04:03.440> odd<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.680> should<00:04:03.859> be<00:04:04.100> able<00:04:04.190> to

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
it just seemed odd I should be able to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.110 
it just seemed odd I should be able to
have<00:04:04.430> access<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.790> all<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.269> but<00:04:05.480> whatever

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
have access to all of it but whatever

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.080 
have access to all of it but whatever
looks<00:04:08.120> cool<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:09.069> wish<00:04:10.069> maybe<00:04:10.370> they<00:04:10.819> did

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
looks cool I wish maybe they did

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.050 
looks cool I wish maybe they did
something<00:04:11.299> a<00:04:11.450> little<00:04:12.040> different<00:04:13.040> with<00:04:13.220> the

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
something a little different with the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.409 
something a little different with the
franchise<00:04:14.269> overall<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:16.430> always<00:04:17.150> kind<00:04:17.359> of

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
franchise overall I always kind of

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.380 
franchise overall I always kind of
wanted<00:04:17.690> a<00:04:17.840> current<00:04:18.320> gen<00:04:18.729> World<00:04:19.729> War<00:04:19.970> 2<00:04:20.180> game

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
wanted a current gen World War 2 game

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.640 
wanted a current gen World War 2 game

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
I'm sure we're going to get it but it's

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.090 
I'm sure we're going to get it but it's
