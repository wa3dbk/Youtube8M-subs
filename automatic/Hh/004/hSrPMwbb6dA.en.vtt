00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.720

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.820
 another vehicle and you see now 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.040

 it was already in your garage 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.259

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.869
 also started and you can only on the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.970
 passenger seat continue to sit 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.560
 Sitting next to you buddy invisible of 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.980
 I have to leave the lobby now 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.390
 just turn off his console or 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.360
 Anyone who does it does not matter the main thing 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.130
 He walks out the lobby, you see 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.720
 My buddy is still on the top left 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.640

 confiscated vehicle easy 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.560
 destroy and that was the whole trick 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.510
 In any case , that would have been so 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.940
 looks complicated but it is heard 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.440
 Not so much and it is clear that 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.720
 the glitches will not be easier than 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.209

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.330
 without buying a rebel or anything else 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.250
