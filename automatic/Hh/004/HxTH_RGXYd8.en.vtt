almost quality of professionals in

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.250 
almost quality of professionals in
England<00:00:34.520> I<00:00:34.820> would<00:00:35.180> say<00:00:35.450> there<00:00:35.630> it's<00:00:35.960> one<00:00:36.140> of

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
England I would say there it's one of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.660 
England I would say there it's one of
the<00:00:36.350> best<00:00:36.530> school<00:00:36.770> because<00:00:37.250> most<00:00:37.460> of<00:00:37.520> the

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
the best school because most of the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.340 
the best school because most of the
school<00:00:37.880> preparing<00:00:38.210> people<00:00:38.480> for<00:00:38.660> animation

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
school preparing people for animation

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.580 
school preparing people for animation
but<00:00:39.890> here<00:00:40.130> there<00:00:40.309> is<00:00:40.340> video<00:00:40.670> games<00:00:40.940> there<00:00:41.239> is<00:00:41.270> a

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
but here there is video games there is a

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.900 
but here there is video games there is a
VFX<00:00:42.590> as<00:00:42.860> it<00:00:43.040> is<00:00:43.160> they<00:00:43.340> form<00:00:43.640> them<00:00:43.790> on

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
VFX as it is they form them on

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.370 
VFX as it is they form them on
everything<00:00:44.150> so<00:00:44.450> I<00:00:44.570> think<00:00:44.600> like<00:00:44.900> it's<00:00:45.140> one<00:00:45.290> of

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
everything so I think like it's one of

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.700 
everything so I think like it's one of
the<00:00:45.530> top-notch<00:00:45.920> school<00:00:46.250> in<00:00:46.610> in<00:00:47.030> UK<00:00:47.390> I<00:00:47.710> decided

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
the top-notch school in in UK I decided

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.070 
the top-notch school in in UK I decided
to<00:00:48.980> come<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.400> heart<00:00:49.670> for<00:00:49.820> chariot<00:00:50.150> as<00:00:50.750> opposed

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
to come to heart for chariot as opposed

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.330 
to come to heart for chariot as opposed
to<00:00:51.170> any<00:00:51.410> other<00:00:51.440> university<00:00:52.040> because<00:00:52.309> I

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
to any other university because I

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.500 
to any other university because I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
solving talent a first year is very

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.140 
solving talent a first year is very
intensive<00:01:41.940> you<00:01:42.090> learn<00:01:42.300> it<00:01:42.480> about<00:01:43.230> 3d<00:01:43.740> 2d<00:01:44.150> VFX

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
intensive you learn it about 3d 2d VFX

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.450 
intensive you learn it about 3d 2d VFX
and<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.960> basically<00:01:46.500> up<00:01:46.650> about<00:01:47.130> all<00:01:47.190> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and all basically up about all the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.070 
and all basically up about all the
pathways<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.120> you<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> real<00:01:48.690> idea<00:01:48.840> of

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
pathways so you get a real idea of

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.990 
pathways so you get a real idea of
what's<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:50.460> second<00:01:50.820> year<00:01:50.970> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
what's going on the second year you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.730 
what's going on the second year you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
first came to the University I could see

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.930 
first came to the University I could see
the<00:02:03.690> quality<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.200> work<00:02:04.410> is<00:02:04.619> really<00:02:04.860> great<00:02:05.190> then

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
the quality of work is really great then

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.190 
the quality of work is really great then
at<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.240> end<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.509> day<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.960> really

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
at the end of the day is just really

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.710 
at the end of the day is just really
impressive<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.770> Hoyer's<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.580> see<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
impressive for Hoyer's to see and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.630 
impressive for Hoyer's to see and
another<00:02:10.380> reason<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.100> really<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.520> a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
another reason that it's really it's a

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
would have to help you out I think the

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.140 
would have to help you out I think the
most<00:02:33.040> important<00:02:33.700> thing<00:02:33.879> that<00:02:33.909> I've<00:02:34.120> learned

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
most important thing that I've learned

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.069 
most important thing that I've learned
is<00:02:34.629> just<00:02:35.409> how<00:02:36.099> many<00:02:36.450> different<00:02:37.450> roles<00:02:37.810> you

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
is just how many different roles you

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.990 
is just how many different roles you
have<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.379> play<00:02:38.560> because<00:02:38.799> you<00:02:39.099> can't<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.700> be

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
have to play because you can't just be

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.970 
have to play because you can't just be
for<00:02:40.629> example<00:02:40.690> as<00:02:41.019> opposed<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:41.409> an<00:02:41.560> art<00:02:41.739> course

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
for example as opposed to an art course

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.220 
for example as opposed to an art course
you<00:02:42.190> just<00:02:42.430> an<00:02:42.879> illustrator<00:02:43.360> or<00:02:43.480> adjustment

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
you just an illustrator or adjustment

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.800 
you just an illustrator or adjustment
and<00:02:44.590> graphic<00:02:44.920> designer<00:02:45.250> but<00:02:46.209> with<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.569> you

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
and graphic designer but with this you

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.839 
and graphic designer but with this you
have<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.049> completely<00:02:47.739> take<00:02:48.129> a<00:02:48.189> whole<00:02:48.519> range<00:02:48.760> of

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
have to completely take a whole range of

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.910 
have to completely take a whole range of
spectrum<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.359> skills<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.200> be<00:02:50.530> able<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.769> sell

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
spectrum of skills to be able to sell

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.550 
spectrum of skills to be able to sell
your<00:02:51.010> work<00:02:51.159> because<00:02:51.489> if<00:02:52.000> you're<00:02:52.720> storytelling

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
your work because if you're storytelling

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.140 
your work because if you're storytelling
and<00:02:53.769> you're<00:02:54.010> writing<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.549> was<00:02:54.670> not<00:02:54.909> fight

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
and you're writing it was not fight

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.550 
and you're writing it was not fight
there<00:02:55.359> then<00:02:55.599> your<00:02:55.750> whole<00:02:55.870> films<00:02:56.170> fall<00:02:56.319> apart

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
there then your whole films fall apart

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.349 
there then your whole films fall apart
and<00:02:56.799> no<00:02:57.010> one<00:02:57.159> will<00:02:57.310> really<00:02:57.940> care<00:02:58.120> for<00:02:58.150> the

and no one will really care for the
visual<00:02:58.599> effects<00:02:58.900> because<00:02:59.200> it's<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.739> rubbish

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
building and professionally so they have

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.730 
building and professionally so they have
all<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.580> professional<00:04:07.180> capacities<00:04:08.050> but<00:04:08.530> also

all the professional capacities but also

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.890 
all the professional capacities but also
creative<00:04:09.370> artists<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.600> is<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.810> only

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
creative artists this is the only

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.510 
creative artists this is the only
University<00:04:11.320> where<00:04:11.650> all<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:12.010> teachers<00:04:12.370> have

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
University where all the teachers have

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.480 
University where all the teachers have
come<00:04:12.550> from<00:04:13.090> industry<00:04:13.600> and<00:04:13.900> teach<00:04:14.650> from<00:04:15.040> the

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
come from industry and teach from the

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.190 
come from industry and teach from the
perspective<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.359> industry<00:04:16.840> rather<00:04:16.989> than

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
perspective of industry rather than

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.550 
perspective of industry rather than
textbooks<00:04:17.920> I<00:04:18.220> think<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.180> this<00:04:19.690> is<00:04:20.260> that

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
textbooks I think that this is that

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.480 
textbooks I think that this is that
extra<00:04:21.549> kiss<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:22.300> get<00:04:22.510> in<00:04:22.750> in<00:04:23.590> something<00:04:23.980> that

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
extra kiss you get in in something that

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.320 
extra kiss you get in in something that
lifts<00:04:25.300> everything<00:04:25.570> up<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.110> makes<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.590> better

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
lifts everything up and makes it better

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.090 
lifts everything up and makes it better
