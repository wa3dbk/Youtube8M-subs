00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
what you think went wrong I think my

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.910 
what you think went wrong I think my
first<00:00:24.359> point<00:00:24.510> as<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> why<00:00:25.140> they<00:00:25.529> were<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:25.710> much

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
first point as to why they were so much

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.339 
first point as to why they were so much
better<00:00:25.980> than<00:00:26.340> us<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:27.000> down<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
better than us it's down to the one and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.919 
better than us it's down to the one and
only<00:00:28.410> Sergio<00:00:29.279> Aguero<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.119> think<00:00:30.570> he<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:30.869> of

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
only Sergio Aguero I think he is one of

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
only Sergio Aguero I think he is one of
the<00:00:31.080> most<00:00:31.170> masterful<00:00:31.710> centre-forwards<00:00:32.430> I've

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the most masterful centre-forwards I've

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.160 
the most masterful centre-forwards I've
ever<00:00:32.759> seen<00:00:32.940> play<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.300> game<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.600> can't<00:00:34.020> actually

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
ever seen play the game I can't actually

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.540 
ever seen play the game I can't actually
think<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> flaw<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:34.890> his<00:00:35.040> game<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.309> think<00:00:35.489> he

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
think of a flaw in his game I think he

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.040 
think of a flaw in his game I think he
can<00:00:35.670> score<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.090> kinds<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.420> goals<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.780> think

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
can score all kinds of goals I think

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.810 
can score all kinds of goals I think
he's<00:00:37.170> lethal<00:00:37.440> outside<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.129> box<00:00:38.250> inside<00:00:38.700> of

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
he's lethal outside of the box inside of

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.549 
he's lethal outside of the box inside of
the<00:00:38.879> box<00:00:39.030> he's<00:00:39.390> lethal<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.870> both<00:00:39.989> feet<00:00:40.350> and

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the box he's lethal with both feet and

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.750 
the box he's lethal with both feet and
he's<00:00:40.710> very<00:00:40.860> good<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> air<00:00:41.280> he's<00:00:41.489> quick

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
he's very good in the air he's quick

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.819 
he's very good in the air he's quick
this<00:00:42.420> isn't<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> floor<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.170> his<00:00:43.320> game<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.500> I

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
this isn't a floor to his game and I

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.319 
this isn't a floor to his game and I
can't<00:00:44.219> actually<00:00:44.370> think<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.789> another<00:00:44.940> striker

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
can't actually think of another striker

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.119 
can't actually think of another striker
in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> entire<00:00:46.020> world<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.890> would<00:00:47.039> have

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
in the entire world that would have

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.290 
in the entire world that would have
scored<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> goal<00:00:47.579> he<00:00:47.730> scored<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.059> other<00:00:48.090> day

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
scored the goal he scored the other day

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.420 
scored the goal he scored the other day
I<00:00:48.480> think<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.280> was

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
I think it was that good and that was

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.430 
I think it was that good and that was
that<00:00:50.640> good<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.969> finish<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.020> when<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> player

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that good of finish and so when a player

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.950 
that good of finish and so when a player
is<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.460> opposite<00:00:53.789> team<00:00:53.850> who<00:00:54.180> plays<00:00:54.420> that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
is on the opposite team who plays that

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.260 
is on the opposite team who plays that
sort<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> capacity<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:56.760> hope<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.120> got

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
sort of capacity what hope have you got

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420 
sort of capacity what hope have you got
um<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.989> he<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.410> definitely<00:00:58.680> point<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.280> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
um so he is definitely point one and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.220 
um so he is definitely point one and
full<00:00:59.850> credit<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.149> him<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.539> he<00:01:00.660> did<00:01:00.870> he

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
full credit to him you know he did he

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.299 
full credit to him you know he did he
deserves<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.680> be<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> winning<00:01:01.980> side<00:01:02.100> he

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
deserves to be on the winning side he

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.009 
deserves to be on the winning side he
played<00:01:02.489> brilliantly<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.840> another

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
played brilliantly I think another

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.230 
played brilliantly I think another
masterful<00:01:04.680> performance<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:06.060> was<00:01:06.150> on

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
masterful performance was that was on

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.660 
masterful performance was that was on
display<00:01:06.270> was<00:01:06.780> by<00:01:07.229> Vincent<00:01:07.890> Kompany<00:01:08.070> think

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
display was by Vincent Kompany think

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.359 
display was by Vincent Kompany think
company<00:01:09.060> looked<00:01:09.409> like<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.650> master<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
company looked like a master and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.280 
company looked like a master and
actually<00:01:11.700> reminiscent<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> his<00:01:12.780> performances

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
actually reminiscent of his performances

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.570 
actually reminiscent of his performances
of<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.500> couple<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.770> seasons<00:01:13.920> back<00:01:14.189> when<00:01:14.520> he

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
of a couple of seasons back when he

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
of a couple of seasons back when he
guided<00:01:14.880> city<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> league<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.720> think<00:01:16.380> he

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
guided city to the league I think he

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.080 
guided city to the league I think he
played<00:01:16.710> brilliantly<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.220> think<00:01:17.460> he<00:01:17.520> had<00:01:17.640> cost<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
played brilliantly I think he had cost a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.390 
played brilliantly I think he had cost a
sewn<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.479> he<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:18.900> did<00:01:19.110> manage<00:01:19.979> costs<00:01:20.250> are

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
sewn up he really did manage costs are

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.160 
sewn up he really did manage costs are
very<00:01:20.430> well<00:01:20.729> he<00:01:21.119> he<00:01:21.570> bullied<00:01:21.900> him<00:01:22.020> where

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
very well he he bullied him where

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.630 
very well he he bullied him where
necessary<00:01:22.290> he<00:01:22.740> let<00:01:22.920> cross<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> term<00:01:23.430> where

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
and and we need to we need to think

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.770 
and and we need to we need to think
about<00:01:44.310> how<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.579> how<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.240> deal<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.659> when

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
about how to how to deal with that when

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.359 
about how to how to deal with that when
cost<00:01:45.990> was<00:01:46.110> off<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.409> maybe<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.829> means<00:01:47.070> he<00:01:47.280> has

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
cost was off for maybe it means he has

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.800 
cost was off for maybe it means he has
to<00:01:47.399> drop<00:01:47.670> deep<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.090> bring<00:01:48.299> company<00:01:48.720> out

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
to drop deep to bring company out

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.200 
to drop deep to bring company out
position<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.619> whatever<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.490> company<00:01:51.030> looked

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
position or whatever but company looked

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.999 
position or whatever but company looked
excellent<00:01:51.570> which<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.020> also<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.409> problem<00:01:52.770> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
excellent which is also a problem and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.160 
excellent which is also a problem and
now<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> suppose<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.630> analyze<00:01:54.840> our<00:01:55.020> own

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
now I suppose we have to analyze our own

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.740 
now I suppose we have to analyze our own
game<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:56.219> think<00:01:56.460> taking<00:01:56.610> Terry<00:01:56.969> off<00:01:57.149> was<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
game and I think taking Terry off was a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.139 
game and I think taking Terry off was a
mistake<00:01:58.110> some<00:01:58.920> people<00:01:59.219> think<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.090> was

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
mistake some people think that it was

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.219 
mistake some people think that it was
good<00:02:00.329> well<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> know<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> was<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:00.930> their<00:02:01.110> way

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
good well you know I was in their way

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.270 
good well you know I was in their way
and<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.469> was<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> upper<00:02:01.920> tier<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
and I was in the upper tier and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.319 
and I was in the upper tier and
everybody<00:02:02.610> thought<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.880> he<00:02:03.060> must<00:02:03.270> have

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
everybody thought that he must have

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.719 
everybody thought that he must have
picked<00:02:03.570> up<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.810> knock<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.740> he's<00:02:05.640> our

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
picked up a knock because he's our

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.429 
picked up a knock because he's our
captain<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.149> when<00:02:06.600> you're<00:02:06.780> struggling<00:02:07.140> away

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
captain and when you're struggling away

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.990 
captain and when you're struggling away
from<00:02:07.619> home<00:02:07.799> at<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.429> team<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.729> are<00:02:08.849> going<00:02:08.940> to

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
from home at the team that are going to

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.279 
from home at the team that are going to
challenge<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.300> all<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.599> way<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.929> title

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
you need your leaders in my opinion and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.940 
you need your leaders in my opinion and
therefore<00:02:13.170> taking

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
therefore taking

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.520 
therefore taking
Terry<00:02:14.160> off<00:02:14.310> was<00:02:14.550> slightly<00:02:15.080> slightly<00:02:16.080> off<00:02:16.319> in

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
Terry off was slightly slightly off in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.780 
Terry off was slightly slightly off in
my<00:02:16.680> opinion<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.980> think<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.310> needed<00:02:17.489> him<00:02:17.640> on

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
my opinion I think that we needed him on

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.460 
my opinion I think that we needed him on
and<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.599> know<00:02:18.690> that's<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.170> take<00:02:19.260> anything

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
and you know that's not to take anything

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.080 
and you know that's not to take anything
away<00:02:19.620> from<00:02:19.739> kutzia<00:02:20.190> my<00:02:20.310> rating<00:02:20.640> very<00:02:20.819> highly

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
away from kutzia my rating very highly

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.089 
away from kutzia my rating very highly
but<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.650> think<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.769> we<00:02:22.860> should<00:02:22.890> have

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
but I think that we should have

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.890 
but I think that we should have
definitely<00:02:23.400> kept<00:02:23.640> John<00:02:23.970> Terry<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.540> I

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
definitely kept John Terry on and I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.790 
definitely kept John Terry on and I
didn't<00:02:25.110> think<00:02:25.170> he<00:02:25.290> was<00:02:25.349> having<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.620> bad<00:02:25.739> game

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
didn't think he was having a bad game

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.360 
didn't think he was having a bad game
actually<00:02:26.569> this<00:02:27.569> brings<00:02:27.840> us<00:02:27.959> onto<00:02:28.370> Branislav

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
actually this brings us onto Branislav

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.820 
actually this brings us onto Branislav
Ivanovic<00:02:29.870> as<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.019> will<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:31.230> I'm<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> huge

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
Ivanovic as you will know I'm a huge

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.020 
Ivanovic as you will know I'm a huge
lover<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.250> defender<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.610> Branislav<00:02:33.000> Ivanovic

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
lover and defender of Branislav Ivanovic

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.880 
lover and defender of Branislav Ivanovic
I<00:02:33.540> think<00:02:33.780> he's<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> fantastic<00:02:34.170> football<00:02:34.709> player

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
I think he's a fantastic football player

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.410 
I think he's a fantastic football player
and<00:02:35.099> there's<00:02:35.459> been<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> player<00:02:35.880> who<00:02:36.060> was<00:02:36.150> served

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
and there's been a player who was served

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.330 
and there's been a player who was served
Chelsea<00:02:36.840> tremendously<00:02:37.800> well<00:02:38.010> over<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.310> years

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
Chelsea tremendously well over the years

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.850 
Chelsea tremendously well over the years
that<00:02:39.180> doesn't<00:02:39.540> mean<00:02:39.660> he<00:02:39.989> or<00:02:40.290> anyone<00:02:40.470> else<00:02:40.709> in

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
that doesn't mean he or anyone else in

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.000 
that doesn't mean he or anyone else in
fact<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.190> above<00:02:41.430> criticism<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.739> therefore<00:02:43.739> I

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
fact is above criticism and therefore I

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.789 
fact is above criticism and therefore I
think<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.430> his<00:02:44.489> performance<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.030> other<00:02:45.120> day

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
think that his performance the other day

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.470 
think that his performance the other day
what's<00:02:46.799> abysmal<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.090> he<00:02:48.239> was

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
what's abysmal I think that he was

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.880 
what's abysmal I think that he was
caught<00:02:48.840> out<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:48.989> position<00:02:49.049> I<00:02:49.560> think<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.830> he

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
caught out of position I think that he

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.410 
caught out of position I think that he
gave<00:02:50.040> sterling<00:02:50.489> too<00:02:50.610> much<00:02:50.760> room<00:02:51.000> i<00:02:51.180> think<00:02:51.330> he

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
gave sterling too much room i think he

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.120 
gave sterling too much room i think he
was<00:02:51.510> caught<00:02:51.780> out<00:02:51.959> with<00:02:52.200> both<00:02:52.500> positionally

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
was caught out with both positionally

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.120 
was caught out with both positionally
and<00:02:53.370> due<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.670> his<00:02:53.760> lack<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.940> pace<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.390> i<00:02:55.380> think

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
and due to his lack of pace and i think

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.080 
and due to his lack of pace and i think
that<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.250> really<00:02:56.430> need<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.819> look<00:02:56.940> it's
