it<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.969> light<00:00:45.090> hiker<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.660> simple<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it a light hiker it's a simple it's a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.959 
it a light hiker it's a simple it's a
subtle<00:00:46.739> difference<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.579> makes<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.820> big

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
subtle difference but it makes a big

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
difference in the shoe so we use

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.910 
difference in the shoe so we use
technology<00:00:51.329> from<00:00:51.510> our<00:00:51.660> running<00:00:52.170> program<00:00:52.559> it's
