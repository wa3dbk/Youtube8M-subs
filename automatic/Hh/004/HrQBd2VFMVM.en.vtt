00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:03.920
 first of all what a workflow is 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.890
 in its simplest form it is a recipe or a series of instructions 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.870
 that starting from some raw material so to speak allows us to obtain a 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.309
 certain result 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.739
 of course since the reality is often a complex workflow 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.859
 not to mention always providing alternatives that can be expressed in form 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.669
 conditional 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.389
 will provide alternatives that can be expressed as if a certain situation occurs 

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:32.389
 do this otherwise do this another 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.690
 it must be said in this sense that ppv is not a totally workflow 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.070
 automated of the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.020
 Different images may present such different features 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.430
 them that it is practically impossible to give precise rules for affects 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.240
 intervene on each of them 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.650
 there cannot be pivot points achievable with a single click on the 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.470
 button on a panel 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.610
 it is instead possible to prescribe which are the most appropriate transactions a 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.090
 depending on the type of images in question 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.740
 this is not a limit but a wealth of the workflow that we will go to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.730
 to examine 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.700
 also because it leaves the operations that we are going to make open a variability 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.570
 which ultimately reflects the freedom of certain artistic choices 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.390
 as well as techniques we must be able to do when we work on an image 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.700
 it must be said however that the individual workflow operations are instead 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.060
 automates skillful 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.460
 and the most recent efforts of dan margulis and go precisely in this direction 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.150
 a panel for photoshop dedicated to ppv is currently in progress 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.860
 which will be available free from autumn 2011 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.300
 of this panel I am not able to show you yet another preview though 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.100
 there is a widely functioning version that I am testing together with 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.120
 some Italian colleagues in turn at limidi margolis 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.770
 of course as soon as it is available I will integrate this lesson into 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.000
 way to show you 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.220
 the operation of the panel the first 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.609
 but essentially 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.360
 the panel will have the function of automating sequences more or less 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.069
 operation complexes 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.719
 in a similar way to the calcium that makes the cpt panel 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.710
 or channel spaur tour 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.029
 christ showing right now 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:23.599
 chang spaur tulle is a channel manipulation utility produced by 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.180
 giuliano have for bg pearls 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.180
 the roberto bigallo group 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.239
 the panel therefore had a series of keys 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.480
 that correspond to the main operations foreseen by the workflow 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.969
 the quality will be reduced in this context to the simple pressure of the 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.919
 appropriate key 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:48.139
 we must therefore begin by examining the main points of our journey 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.299
 operating 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.409
 But first let's list in the next lesson what tools there are 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:54.799
 will serve to work
