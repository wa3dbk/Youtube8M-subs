00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.930
 There are three points that I would like to share 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:09.340
 with all of you 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.650
 the first one was my return to the 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.320
 technical side that was when I did it 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.990
 before pirate morgan which had already 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.050
 dethroned of the championship 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.020
 intercontinental but good was logical 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.630
 that the rivalry continued and he had 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.220
 that getting to this to a climax like this is 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.610
 that then we had to face 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.970
 hair against hair in a duel 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.740
 which was cataloged as the most 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.610
 bloody 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.320
 and the most impressive of the decade was 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.040
 a fight that had to in a moment 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.520
 given being stopped by the commission and by the 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:53.320
 doctor of the commission precisely for 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:56.020
 the bleeding so so deep and so and 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.390
 so good so exaggerated that he had the 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.320
 pirate morgan then it was a fight 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 very very bloody and this one and which 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.420
 good win 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.420
 and that's when he already shaved 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.600
 pirate morgan that I repeat again that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.570
 that fight then marked something significant 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.960
 in my life so for the bloody and 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.320
 especially because of the dramatic nature of the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.530
 second was precisely 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.530
 a fight that I held with hair 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.460
 against ms one that was on the cusp 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.010
 also and that was because he was a companion 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.130
 also within the pirate battles 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.130
 morgan 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:48.850
 and I want to confess something before you in 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:51.520
 I held that fight against it and ms1 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.420
 I did not like my movement and not me 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.500
 liked my way how I saw myself and was when 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.990
 I made the decision to remove Pharaoh from 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.560
 wrestling and the third point that 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.290
 I want to share with you is 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.880
 precisely when I was made a 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:16.720
 official farewell to the fans 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.330
 commemorating the 61st anniversary of the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.620
 implementation of wrestling in the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:28.240
 arena coliseum is where the pharaoh is 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:33.590
 dismisses officially fighting like this 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:37.730
 how the pharaoh got like that he's going 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.849
 always giving me affection the applause 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.390
 so I know that I have nothing more to thank 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.480
 all the public honestly and of 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.760
 very special way of the heart 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.690
 send them a very affectionate greeting and my 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.690
 love forever
