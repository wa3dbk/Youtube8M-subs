00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.680
 section scares me pantheon here may 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.900
 listen to narrations about events 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.240
 supernatural and good I hope that you 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.270

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.250
 boy and his ball I hope you enjoy it 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.120
 Now close your eyes and imagine the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.120
 events 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.710
 Alicia was truly outraged 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.689
 he had paid a small fortune for 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.430
 spend a few days in that exclusive hotel 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.229
 of the city and undergo a 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.939
 beauty treatment and it turns out that 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.590
 it was three in the morning and there was a 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.990
 boy playing with a ball in the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.909
 hallway he could hear their laughter and the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.520
 ball hit from time to time his 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.979
 door I also heard the voice of a woman 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.409
 presumably his mother laughing with him 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.240
 calling him as the management of the 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.970
 hotel that there were children playing in the 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.100
 hallways at those hours after about 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.259
 minutes of enduring the annoying noise 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.119
 Alicia lit the desk lamp 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.789
 He picked up the phone and dialed 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.009
 extension of the administration nobody 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.679
 he answered impatiently almost threw the 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.539
 headset and pushing aside the blankets jumped 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.090
 of the bed willing to put a stop to 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.030
 the situation the ball hit again 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.310
 the door alicia opened it very angry the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.680
 Corridor was empty under the lights 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.410
 bright nobody played or ran in the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.630
 desert hallway bewildered alice 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.030
 He left his room and advanced a few 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.090
 meters it was really cold in that place 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.010
 a cold that burned the bones which 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.290
 weird because they were in the middle of summer and 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.110
 that day the thermometers had reached 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.959
 about 30 degrees the child's laughter rang 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.400
 behind her she turned her head nobody 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.950
 heart began to beat him 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.140
 hastily there was something terribly 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.390
 bad and had heard the boy near her 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.060
 I could even cure it and that cold that 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.650
 I craved for moments without knowing what to do 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.680
 Alicia decided to go back to her room 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.180
 maybe I had imagined everything 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.950
 lately your plaintiff work as 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.319
 editor of an important magazine 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.660
 the ball had caused a lot of stress 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.209
 hit her back malice turn and saw her 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.280
 it was red almost the size of a balloon 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.739
 football took her in his arms and looked 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.989
 towards the corridor two figures seemed 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.299
 leave the walls of the corridor I could see 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.549
 the rough wall through them a 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.650
 It was from a child who smiled at him greeting 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.629
 with her hand and smiling she had the 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.790
 head opened by an ugly wound and 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.560
 plaster of dried blood all over the face 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.019
 the other appearance was of a woman 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.390
 pale and with messy hair and with 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.610
 an expression of deep sadness in his 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.690
 face had a big blood stain 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.700
 in the abdomen 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.480
 the fear began to travel the body of 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.879
 alicante 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.159
 the ghosts had the ball in their 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.379
 hands and the figures were paralyzed 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.060
 ghosts approached her and the 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.640
 boy stretched his arms out 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.340
 unconscious Alice handed him the ball 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.069
 He smiled at her in such a way that Alice 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.710
 read the blood the mother called the child 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.980
 with his voice from beyond the grave 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.930
 all right 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.390
 the child saw again the terrified 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.580
 alicia and went away bouncing the ball and 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.260
 there before their eyes the two disappeared 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.330
 in the air then and only then 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.330
 Alice started screaming 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.709
 he woke up in his room there was a doctor 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.199
 with her and standing by the window 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.329
 was the hotel manager will be fine 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.639
 said the doctor while he kept his 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.300
 stethoscope left the room without 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.400
 say more 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.710
 Alice opened her mouth to say something 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.229
 but the manager was ahead of him I beg 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.030
 he apologizes expressed taking the 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.420
 freedom to sit on the edge of the 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.460
 bed what happened 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.160
 you had a kind of crisis of 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.350
 hysteria commented the manager listen to me 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.810
 I know very well what is coming I demand a 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.030
 explanation or tomorrow the whole press 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.250
 You will know that something very strange is happening here 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.980
 the manager paled and in a start to 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.350
 value decided to be sincere we have maintained 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.690
 secretly this matter the employees and 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.070
 I myself have seen those spectra but 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.810
 So far they had not 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.660
 manifested to no hotel guest 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.520
 how will you understand if this matter is done 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.340
 public will be the ruin for us 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.830
 who are those ghosts because they 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.410
 appear here before telling you I'd like to 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.240
 ask him not to beg him to please 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.130
 Tell anyone what you have seen and tell 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.950
 please do not mention the name of the 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.530
 hotel alÃ­cia looked at the manager so I will 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.210
 well the story is this when the hotel 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.860
 It was under construction about six 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.900
 years the wife of one of the 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.520
 contractors brought their little son to 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.320
 seeing his father was the day of his 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.030
 birthday and the child always wanted 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.950
 visit any work where it was 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.750
 working his father thing what the 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.790
 man refused because the works in 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.540
 construction are dangerous sites for 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.060
 children 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.750
 the little kit as his mother called him 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.310
 I brought 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.860
 red ball to which he had been 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.320
 Gifted his mother that day was a child 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.060
 very restless from one moment to the next 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.490
 boy ran and climbed a 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.380
 wooden scaffolding his mother followed him on 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.300
 father gave voices to stop and 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.700
 called some bricklayers so that 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.190
 they would respect their son but it was too much 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.380
 late the mother also climbed up the 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.300
 scaffolding and without anyone could help it 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.790
 the scaffolding broke the two fell 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.590
 from a considerable height along with 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.540
 a lot of rubble 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.700
 the boy broke his head staying there 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.500
 fourth the mother pierced him a beam 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.350
 through the abdomen causing a severe 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.630
 hemorrhage before dying the woman 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.550
 he made a promise to the contractor he said 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.490
 that he could always find her 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.320
 and your son in this hotel the contractor 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.810
 he resigned the work he left the city 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.820
 but his wife and son converted into 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.560
 specters were left in this hotel 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.940
 waiting for the man who will not come to 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.130
 see them ever 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.560
 the hotel is still running 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.860
 and is one of the most accredited of the 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.740
