actually drain into that hole where

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.149 
actually drain into that hole where
there<00:03:06.049> is<00:03:06.109> peep<00:03:06.319> holes<00:03:06.560> where<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.890> water<00:03:07.069> will

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
there is peep holes where the water will

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.319 
there is peep holes where the water will
then<00:03:07.310> run<00:03:07.489> into<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.790> ground<00:03:07.879> instead<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.209> in

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
then run into the ground instead of in

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:26.309 
then run into the ground instead of in
the<00:03:08.420> beds<00:03:08.599> we're<00:03:08.719> gonna<00:03:08.840> do<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.049> now

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319

and<00:03:27.319> you're<00:03:27.409> going<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.560> run<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.799> hose<00:03:27.950> down

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
and you're going to run the hose down

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.479 
and you're going to run the hose down
through<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.670> tie-down<00:03:29.030> hook<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:31.190> way<00:03:31.340> it

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
through the tie-down hook that way it

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.070 
through the tie-down hook that way it
stabilizes<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.209> tube<00:03:32.420> for<00:03:32.659> moving<00:03:32.810> around

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
stabilizes the tube for moving around

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.110 
stabilizes the tube for moving around
and<00:03:33.379> then<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.310> have<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.549> option<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.940> leaving
