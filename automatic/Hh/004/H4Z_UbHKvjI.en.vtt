00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.969
 today we are going to do the first review 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.260
 night of soloporteros and this is with 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.390
 the reason for the presentation of the 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.369
 explosive mercurial vapor 9 of Christian 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.840
 ronaldo as we can see all the 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.430
 boot decoration is a decoration 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.660
 of a starry sky some motifs 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.770
 galactic that have led us to do 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.809
 the presentation in this environment so 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.419
 special is the material chosen for the 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:33.610
 housing of this mercurial vapor 9 cr es 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.559
 the kanga light as you know nike manages 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.690
 two finishes to submerge the steam 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.829
 of jean and kanga light on this occasion 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.149
 The kanga light is the most 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.829
 similar to natural skin but it has 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.780
 two properties that do not have the skin and 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.489
 is that it does not absorb water and also we 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.170
 allows to make a boot without seams 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.730
 much lighter as we can see in 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.899
 the whole area both the external lateral 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.879
 as internal side there is no 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.289
 sewing and only in the area of 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.640
 heel we find a small 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.690
 sewing that what is useful is for the 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.850
 material encompass our foot 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.399
 another very important feature is the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.019
 all condition control the ac is a 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.580
 finish that nike gives his range boots 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.140
 high and what it is going to allow is 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.520
 waterproof the boot in such a way 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.320
 that once we have the foot footwear 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.390
 the inclement weather does not 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.890
 they will also affect it also prevents 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.990
 is formed a thin film of water your 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.670
 surface and a planing occurs every 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.020
 time the ball contacts her if 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.520
 we went on to talk about the chassis of the boot 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.200
 we find a boot very 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.640
 similar to an athletic shoe what 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.409
 which aims to boost the speed 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.670
 of the players therefore we have to 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.380
 make a boot as stable as possible 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.149
 as we can see the loop is 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.590
 completely centered is not a loop 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.000
 displaced outward as in the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.770
 boots that they want to release 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.090
 a hitting area because here what 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.069
 we want is that once we press the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.720
 the boot is the most stable 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.640
 possible the same as if we happened to talk 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.289
 of the insoles other boots in the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.640
 templates have a few pieces more 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.409
 thickness to get a cushion 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.210
 little in the footsteps on the impacts 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.560
 but on this occasion there is what 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.509
 is to bring the maximum game on the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.979
 terrain create stability for him 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.690
 we found a template a lot 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.690
 lighter and even microperforated 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.020
 the most important part of america and the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.340
 steam 9 is the sole the sole is the one 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.500
 will transmit all the power against 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.060
 legs generate the field so there's no 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.020
 than to use two fundamental elements 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.300
 to get the players 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.830
 maximize your speed by a 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.810
 side the plate on which we settle 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.310
 It's a fiberglass plate that I eat 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.630
 you all know it is a very reactive material 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.190
 what we will do is that after 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.140
 each step the boot recovers quickly 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.970
 its shape and therefore without spending 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.100
 energy we are prepared for 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.510
 following footsteps and it is also very 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.040
 important the provision of the tacos 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.420
 the heels armory the steam has a 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.190
 special arrangement that we have not seen 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.050
 in almost no boot are tacos in 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.940
 triads that means that each of 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.410
 the tacos will have three edges 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.600
 we are going to have traction whatever 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.920
 movement with which we do and is very 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.390
 important within this provision of 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.890
 tacos the central taco that is what we 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.300
 will give stability in each of the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.300
 stripped and braking we do 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.570
 As you can see all the elements of 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.010
 the mallow therefore the casing as the 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.020
 chassis and especially the sole are 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.240
 designed to maximize a 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.710
 aspect that players value a lot 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.480
 in football today and is the 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.860
 speed will not bring you more 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.300
 speed but it will get that 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.680
 all that your legs are capable of 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.970
 generate you can transmit 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.970
 directly on your team's game
