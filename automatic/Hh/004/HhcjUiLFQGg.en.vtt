time and time again it's an iconic scene
of<00:00:36.030> course<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.480> yeah<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:36.930> very<00:00:37.110> iconic<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
of course it's yeah it's very iconic to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160 
of course it's yeah it's very iconic to
the<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.219> Batman<00:00:38.700> origin<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.930> didn't

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the to the Batman origin I just didn't

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.119 
the to the Batman origin I just didn't
think<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.530> were<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:40.920> so

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
think that they were going to go so

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.729 
think that they were going to go so
origin<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:41.940> Batman<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.320> movie<00:00:43.620> this

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
origin with Batman in this movie this

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.830 
origin with Batman in this movie this
kind<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.100> shows<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:45.719> I

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
kind of shows you that this is really I

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.119 
kind of shows you that this is really I
think<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.770> more<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
think this is going to be more of a

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.760 
think this is going to be more of a
Batman<00:00:47.640> afflicting<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> super

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
Batman afflicting it then a super

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.319 
Batman afflicting it then a super
manfully<00:00:50.100> i<00:00:50.160> don't<00:00:50.309> know<00:00:50.370> maybe<00:00:50.700> I'm<00:00:50.879> wrong<00:00:51.059> I

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
manfully i don't know maybe I'm wrong I

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.060 
manfully i don't know maybe I'm wrong I
mean<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.870> already<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.379> know<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.890> they're

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
mean we already we know that they're

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.770 
mean we already we know that they're
gonna<00:00:53.190> both<00:00:53.460> get<00:00:53.670> their<00:00:53.789> standalone<00:00:54.449> movies

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
gonna both get their standalone movies

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.319 
gonna both get their standalone movies
so<00:00:54.930> maybe<00:00:55.140> they<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.350> equal<00:00:55.820> screen<00:00:56.820> time<00:00:57.090> but

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
so maybe they have equal screen time but

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.270 
so maybe they have equal screen time but
I<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:58.289> did<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.559> think<00:00:58.770> they're<00:00:58.949> gonna<00:00:59.129> shoot

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
