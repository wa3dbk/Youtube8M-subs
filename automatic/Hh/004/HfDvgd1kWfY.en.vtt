00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.349
 sooner or later you have to handle 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.570
 familiar things for they have a beginning 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.059
 and end either they 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.670
 disappears forever or change to 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.730
 unrecognizable virtual war 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.769
 over we long and hard fought for 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.129
 control over key points 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:44.649
 but now there is peace and silence here 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.530
 no longer see the plane in the sky and not 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.500
 hear volleys of tanks all weapons 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.189
 forever white flags coming back to the warehouse 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:58.659
 patiently waiting for the conquerors but Russia and 

00:00:54.189 --> 00:01:00.100
 the USA have gone away from here since the end of the war 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:04.059
 ends and 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.580
 This is the story of the days of battlefield play free 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.210
 my deep regret 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.390
 the same fate befell nedforspid world 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.670
 fifa world and battlefield heroes 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.430
 that is, all those games that once 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.860
 were considered a breakthrough and a new layer of the genre 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.200
 fritupley go into oblivion 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.560
 however, other projects like star war 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.409
 z from republic commander nkgb take 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.259
 the alliance continues its work they say 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.380
 still popular and close them until 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.899
 we will be well and god with them however fact 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.759
 remains a fact 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.639
 zhidomasony ea games not stand on ceremony with 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.369
 those who stop making a profit or 

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:47.469
 does not perform tasks so 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.880
 many studios were closed due to 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.490
 unprofitability 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.039
 in general, the giants of the gaming industry 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.859
 especially emotional in this 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.740
 The plan therefore closes immediately 4 online 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:01.389
 games fits into its classic model 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.969
 market behavior 

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:07.149
 although a dilemma is that they 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.340
 themselves to blame for the game were raw and 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.380
 actually not supported therefore 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.970
 players were in no hurry to invest their 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.670
 blood up out of an investment of money but 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.010
 gene was in a hurry amazing but replaced 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.070
 this four never came 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.410
 new if you look at everything 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.500
 I can not say that I am disappointed or 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.080
 glad about it anyway after closing 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.450
 play-off cream and of course we will find others 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.120
 projects but still painful to part 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.760
 with those players with whom you often 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.070
 I met in the game I don't know about you, but 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.140
 looking back me the game will be 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.510
 cause nostalgia and pleasant 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.680
 memories there I learned what 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.950
 clan-war 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.640
 and events my channel was closely connected with 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.040
 this game and it all started in 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.830
 VKontakte group gathered a wonderful 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.590
 the team we played together got 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.840
 pleasure communicated shared their 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.880
 achievements someone will say that 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.360
 battlefield live free 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.730
 it is slag but not for us we loved this 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.640
 humble series not because of the graphics 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.040
 because of the simplicity of the gameplay of old friends 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.550
 cards of the second part of the whole range 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.470
 weapons from different parts of the game was 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.620
 raw but we waited patiently 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.670
 fix bugs and updates wrote and 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.340
 requested and 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.739
 and did not cease to hope moreover we 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.230
 continued to play no matter what 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.680
 finished off the last level of their 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.440
 characters to adequately leave clear 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.500
 asking the game not to close is useless 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.250
 business remains business and nothing 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.230
 personal 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.860
 you probably ask me what I will be 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.570
 play after free play 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.850
 Needless to say, go ahead 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.910
 concentrate on other projects 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.690
 for example, I looked at heroes 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.970
 and generals insi johns and maybe on 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.610
 Squad game , finally I want to say 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.070
 thanks to those who are with me 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.700
 played this great game that 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.450
 such came out 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.360
 this and that we held before its closure was 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.989
 it's fun to play with and wish to find you 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.519
 worthy replacement for this shooter 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.610

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.680

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.030
