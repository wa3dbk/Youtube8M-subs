 4 Today's products are Lego 7007 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:14.799
 The original season 12 is the original worry, is sold out in the neighborhood that the sale of pale green 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:19.689
 I bought it because I sold it in three dimensions .

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.899
 Do you write the code example in a game that could be something for the kids to study 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.980
 I think you should use Scada on the first-come, first-served basis . 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.980
 Please, I know something else. 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:59.430

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.719

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.630
 There are only three of us. 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.820
 I liked the jump a little . 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.440
 It's like this. 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.710

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:43.420
 It is made by making and making. 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:49.900

 That's right, but it 's confusing. 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.750
 I do not think it should be underneath . 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:26.650
 I think you should give it back. 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.650
 Oh, I think I must have a beard . 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:34.950
