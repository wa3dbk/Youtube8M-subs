00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
lots and lots of expansion he's actually

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.279 
lots and lots of expansion he's actually

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
kind of pushing out of his base he

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.860 
kind of pushing out of his base he
realizes<00:00:47.000> light<00:00:48.000> realized<00:00:48.390> his<00:00:48.539> right<00:00:48.719> now

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
realizes light realized his right now

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.930 
realizes light realized his right now
that<00:00:49.050> he's<00:00:49.200> economically<00:00:49.829> ahead<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.340> his

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that he's economically ahead is his

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.459 
that he's economically ahead is his
armies<00:00:51.329> bigger<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.809> expect<00:00:52.199> him<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> be

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
armies bigger so I expect him to be

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.860 
armies bigger so I expect him to be
pushing<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:53.039> sometimes<00:00:54.030> soon<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.750> do

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
pushing in sometimes soon here to do

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.709 
pushing in sometimes soon here to do
something<00:00:55.379> Silas<00:00:55.770> facility<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.600> so

something Silas facility is going up so

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.479 
something Silas facility is going up so
does<00:00:57.809> look<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.230> will<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.680> seeing<00:00:59.010> science

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
does look like we will be seeing science

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.599 
does look like we will be seeing science
vessels<00:00:59.910> shortly<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.420> he<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.320> needs<00:01:01.800> nope

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609

no sign of storms yet from light or from

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.070 
no sign of storms yet from light or from
violet<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.210> feel<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> big<00:01:06.930> mistake

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
violet and I feel this is a big mistake

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.810 
violet and I feel this is a big mistake
he<00:01:07.380> needs<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:07.860> some<00:01:07.890> late-game<00:01:08.400> tech

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
he needs to get some late-game tech

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.730 
he needs to get some late-game tech
shuttles<00:01:09.540> going<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.380> missile

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
shuttles going in this one missile

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
shuttles going in this one missile
turret<00:01:10.890> might<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.130> able<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.310> pick<00:01:11.400> off<00:01:11.549> one

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
turret might be able to pick off one

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.219 
turret might be able to pick off one
shot<00:01:11.909> oh<00:01:11.970> I'm<00:01:12.090> not<00:01:12.240> sure<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.990> does<00:01:13.110> look

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
shot oh I'm not sure and it does look

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.080 
shot oh I'm not sure and it does look
like<00:01:13.320> Oh<00:01:13.500> bear<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.220> shell<00:01:14.400> barely<00:01:14.760> doesn't

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
like Oh bear one shell barely doesn't

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.670 
like Oh bear one shell barely doesn't
fall<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.570> looks<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.900> drop<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
fall it looks like a drop so this is the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.140 
fall it looks like a drop so this is the
right<00:01:16.710> thought<00:01:17.159> by<00:01:17.340> violet<00:01:17.670> violet<00:01:17.939> actually

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
right thought by violet violet actually

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.249 
right thought by violet violet actually
going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.360> do<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> drop<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:18.780> i<00:01:18.869> don't<00:01:19.049> think<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
going to do a drop but i don't think the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.899 
going to do a drop but i don't think the
army<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.530> big<00:01:19.680> enough<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.009> think<00:01:20.369> light<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.820> be

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
army is big enough I think light will be

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.570 
army is big enough I think light will be
able<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> stop<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.600> fairly<00:01:22.560> quickly<00:01:22.740> maybe

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
able to stop this fairly quickly maybe

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
able to stop this fairly quickly maybe
he<00:01:23.759> could<00:01:23.880> lay<00:01:24.090> out<00:01:24.240> an<00:01:24.450> upgrading<00:01:24.930> armory<00:01:25.259> or

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
he could lay out an upgrading armory or

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.620 
he could lay out an upgrading armory or
something<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.250> slow<00:01:26.549> light<00:01:27.000> down<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
something to slow light down just a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.999 
something to slow light down just a
little<00:01:27.810> bit<00:01:27.930> he<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.320> needs<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.560> buy<00:01:28.770> himself

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
little bit he just needs to buy himself

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.530 
little bit he just needs to buy himself
more<00:01:29.400> time<00:01:29.610> he's<00:01:29.759> basically<00:01:30.030> he's<00:01:30.270> trying<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
more time he's basically he's trying to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.609 
more time he's basically he's trying to
do<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:30.810> no<00:01:31.369> his<00:01:32.369> attack<00:01:32.990> pretty<00:01:33.990> much<00:01:34.229> fails

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
do but no his attack pretty much fails

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.190 
do but no his attack pretty much fails
stds<00:01:35.579> coming<00:01:35.850> off<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> line<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.270> our<00:01:36.540> huge

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
stds coming off the line and our huge

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.060 
stds coming off the line and our huge
army<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.950> vultures<00:01:38.490> vultures<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.990> very<00:01:40.590> fast

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
army of vultures vultures a very fast

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.600 
army of vultures vultures a very fast
unit<00:01:41.640> he<00:01:42.180> must<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.509> been<00:01:42.630> thinking<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.200> um

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
unit he must have been thinking that um

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.830 
unit he must have been thinking that um
yeah<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.970> wasn't<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> vultures<00:01:45.540> if

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
yeah so if it wasn't for the vultures if

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.969 
yeah so if it wasn't for the vultures if
it<00:01:45.930> would<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.079> been<00:01:46.170> tanks<00:01:46.500> required<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
it would have been tanks required to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.310 
it would have been tanks required to
come<00:01:47.159> back<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.670> deal<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.659> violence<00:01:49.140> drop

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
come back up and deal with violence drop

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.359 
come back up and deal with violence drop
then<00:01:49.500> maybe<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.799> would<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.009> been<00:01:50.100> more

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
then maybe that would have been more

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.069 
then maybe that would have been more
damage<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.119> there<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.780> does<00:01:51.899> look<00:01:52.049> like

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
damage but not there it does look like

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.719 
damage but not there it does look like
violet<00:01:52.500> will<00:01:52.649> be<00:01:52.740> attacking<00:01:53.159> he<00:01:53.250> realizes<00:01:53.549> he

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
violet will be attacking he realizes he

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.130 
violet will be attacking he realizes he
needs<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.060> do<00:01:54.149> something<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.689> last-ditch

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
needs to do something a last-ditch

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
needs to do something a last-ditch
effort<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> try<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.979> himself<00:01:56.159> back<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
effort to try to get himself back in the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.030 
effort to try to get himself back in the
game<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:57.990> very<00:01:58.140> many<00:01:58.380> goons<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
game but that's not very many goons I

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.380 
game but that's not very many goons I
just<00:01:59.189> feel<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.579> not<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.119> enough

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
just feel that's not going to be enough

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.420 
just feel that's not going to be enough

depots but i don't think the supply
depot<00:02:07.020> count<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.680> huge<00:02:07.950> deal<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.429> late<00:02:08.759> in

depot count is a huge deal this late in

depot count is a huge deal this late in
the<00:02:08.940> game<00:02:09.000> i<00:02:09.509> feel<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:09.989> light<00:02:10.500> has<00:02:10.530> that

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
expansion

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.600 
expansion
while<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.710> looks<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:13.950> he'll<00:02:14.070> finally<00:02:14.310> be

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
while it looks like he'll finally be

while it looks like he'll finally be
tied<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.120> expansions<00:02:15.660> but<00:02:15.900> that's<00:02:16.440> not<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
tied in expansions but that's not the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.300 
tied in expansions but that's not the
way<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:16.980> want<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.370> be<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.880> pvt<00:02:18.390> matchup

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.640 
way you want to be in a pvt matchup
especially<00:02:20.310> about<00:02:20.940> 20<00:02:21.720> minutes<00:02:22.260> into<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
especially about 20 minutes into the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.500 
especially about 20 minutes into the
game<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.430> maybe<00:02:23.580> it's<00:02:23.790> not<00:02:23.880> quite<00:02:24.120> 20<00:02:24.390> maybe

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
game and maybe it's not quite 20 maybe

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.440 
game and maybe it's not quite 20 maybe
18<00:02:25.290> 17<00:02:25.800> 18<00:02:26.070> minutes<00:02:26.340> I'm<00:02:26.790> not<00:02:27.030> exactly<00:02:27.240> sure

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
18 17 18 minutes I'm not exactly sure

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.030 
18 17 18 minutes I'm not exactly sure
but<00:02:28.100> um<00:02:29.100> yeah<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.170> using<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> upper<00:02:31.590> level<00:02:31.890> to

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
but um yeah so using the upper level to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.110 
but um yeah so using the upper level to
his<00:02:32.160> advantage<00:02:32.370> but<00:02:32.640> there's<00:02:32.820> not<00:02:32.940> going<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
his advantage but there's not going to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.460 
his advantage but there's not going to
be<00:02:33.210> enough<00:02:33.450> goons<00:02:33.690> he's<00:02:33.810> actually<00:02:33.990> my<00:02:34.200> vote<00:02:34.350> to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
be enough goons he's actually my vote to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.500 
be enough goons he's actually my vote to
get<00:02:34.560> some<00:02:34.680> easy<00:02:34.860> SCV<00:02:35.400> kills<00:02:35.700> but<00:02:36.150> he<00:02:36.330> needs

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
get some easy SCV kills but he needs

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.240 
get some easy SCV kills but he needs
more<00:02:36.750> than<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:37.170> couple<00:02:37.440> SCB<00:02:37.950> kills<00:02:38.130> he

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
more than just a couple SCB kills he

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.160 
more than just a couple SCB kills he
need<00:02:38.370> something<00:02:38.760> big<00:02:39.030> maybe<00:02:39.600> an<00:02:39.750> arbiter

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
need something big maybe an arbiter

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.750 
need something big maybe an arbiter
recall<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.590> feel<00:02:40.830> could<00:02:40.980> actually<00:02:41.160> change<00:02:41.520> this

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
recall I feel could actually change this

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.120 
recall I feel could actually change this
game<00:02:42.000> around<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:42.540> no<00:02:43.080> sign<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.410> storms<00:02:43.860> yet

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
game around but no sign of storms yet

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.890 
game around but no sign of storms yet
and<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.310> feel<00:02:44.520> that's<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.820> huge<00:02:45.210> mistake<00:02:45.420> as<00:02:45.780> I

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
and I feel that's a huge mistake as I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.810 
and I feel that's a huge mistake as I
said<00:02:46.080> before<00:02:46.130> vultures<00:02:47.130> moving<00:02:47.430> out<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.670> is

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
said before vultures moving out this is

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.040 
said before vultures moving out this is
going<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.030> be<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> lot<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.390> probe<00:02:48.660> kills<00:02:48.930> only

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
going to be a lot of probe kills only

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.800 
going to be a lot of probe kills only
one<00:02:49.410> cannon<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.400> about<00:02:50.640> 30<00:02:50.970> vultures<00:02:51.570> but<00:02:51.720> now

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
one cannon to about 30 vultures but now

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.570 
one cannon to about 30 vultures but now
goons<00:02:52.110> are<00:02:52.350> moving<00:02:52.650> out<00:02:52.740> but<00:02:52.860> still<00:02:53.070> lots<00:02:53.370> and

goons are moving out but still lots and

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.040 
goons are moving out but still lots and
lots<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.790> vultures<00:02:54.120> I'm<00:02:54.330> sure<00:02:54.690> he<00:02:54.780> got<00:02:54.870> some

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
lots of vultures I'm sure he got some

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.870 
lots of vultures I'm sure he got some
easy<00:02:55.260> probe<00:02:55.620> kills<00:02:55.890> they're<00:02:56.100> not<00:02:56.550> enough

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
easy probe kills they're not enough

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.550 
easy probe kills they're not enough
goons<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.390> actually<00:02:57.660> handle<00:02:57.810> with<00:02:58.080> these<00:02:58.260> now

you generated then he might get some get

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.400 
you generated then he might get some get
some<00:03:56.550> energy<00:03:56.910> for<00:03:57.120> these<00:03:57.450> storms<00:03:57.930> than<00:03:58.290> he

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
some energy for these storms than he

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.840
