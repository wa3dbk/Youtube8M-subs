house this is the tour right here and I

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.640 
house this is the tour right here and I
made<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> little<00:00:21.060> target<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.960> not<00:00:22.140> very<00:00:22.380> good

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
made a little target it's not very good

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.259 
made a little target it's not very good
but<00:00:23.000> it'll<00:00:24.000> get<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> job<00:00:24.420> done<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:26.090> first<00:00:27.090> I'm

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
but it'll get the job done so first I'm

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.109 
but it'll get the job done so first I'm
just<00:00:27.330> going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.630> show<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.990> quick<00:00:28.230> test<00:00:28.650> of

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
just going to show you a quick test of

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.730 
just going to show you a quick test of
what<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.210> does

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
what it does

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.170 
what it does
and<00:00:31.740> basically<00:00:32.420> zeros<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.750> fast<00:00:35.180> it's

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and basically zeros really fast it's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
and basically zeros really fast it's
useful<00:00:36.630> for<00:00:36.660> putting<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> two<00:00:37.710> by<00:00:37.890> one

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
useful for putting in like a two by one

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.619 
useful for putting in like a two by one
you<00:00:40.200> know<00:00:40.350> hallway<00:00:41.340> or<00:00:41.520> whatever<00:00:44.420> just<00:00:45.420> to

you know hallway or whatever just to

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.130 
you know hallway or whatever just to
make<00:00:45.989> sure<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:47.149> secure<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> guess<00:00:48.570> I'll<00:00:49.110> show

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
make sure it's secure I guess I'll show

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.740 
make sure it's secure I guess I'll show
you<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.710> second<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.480> now<00:00:51.480> we're<00:00:51.660> going

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
you that in a second but now we're going

you that in a second but now we're going
to<00:00:51.809> test<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.320> against<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> creeper<00:00:53.570> see<00:00:54.570> how

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to test it against the creeper see how

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.099 
to test it against the creeper see how
well<00:00:55.730> how<00:00:56.730> well<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.059> works<00:00:57.270> how<00:00:57.480> fast<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.020> can

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
well how well that works how fast it can

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.860 
well how well that works how fast it can
take<00:00:58.320> down<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> creeper<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.629> show<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.690> how

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
take down the creeper and show you how

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.230 
take down the creeper and show you how
that<00:01:00.930> works<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:04.280> take<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.640> string<00:01:06.060> with

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
that works and take that string with

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.560 
that works and take that string with
that<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.780> pretty<00:01:07.590> good<00:01:07.830> speed<00:01:08.299> keep<00:01:09.299> some

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that but pretty good speed keep some

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.500 
that but pretty good speed keep some
blocked<00:01:10.260> off<00:01:10.500> art<00:01:11.460> not<00:01:11.760> really<00:01:12.030> blocked<00:01:12.299> off

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
blocked off art not really blocked off

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.260 
blocked off art not really blocked off
but<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.740> know<00:01:13.890> pushed<00:01:14.159> back<00:01:14.460> um<00:01:16.130> which<00:01:17.130> is

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
but you know pushed back um which is

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.120 
but you know pushed back um which is
really<00:01:18.270> important<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.320> important<00:01:19.710> part<00:01:19.920> cuz

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
really important the important part cuz

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.460 
really important the important part cuz
I<00:01:20.369> can't<00:01:21.030> blow<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:23.900> this<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.049> probably<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
I can't blow up and this is probably the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.950 
I can't blow up and this is probably the
coolest<00:01:25.619> part<00:01:25.890> except<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:27.000> kind<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.689> left<00:01:27.840> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
coolest part except I kind of left it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.450 
coolest part except I kind of left it
unexposed<00:01:28.500> because<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.920> don't<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.220> how<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
unexposed because I don't know how to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.710 
unexposed because I don't know how to
cover<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.180> not<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.990> best<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.409> redstone<00:01:31.799> but

build a house like this it's just to
show<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.930> then<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.890> got<00:01:50.040> my<00:01:50.189> little

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
show you and then I got my little

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.830 
show you and then I got my little
control<00:01:51.570> system<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:53.040> could<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.840> you

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
control system here you could see you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.780 
control system here you could see you
put<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.259> lever<00:01:55.439> up<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.040> armed

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
put the lever up it's armed

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.959 
put the lever up it's armed
down<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.360> disarmed<00:01:58.430> so<00:02:00.049> if<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.969> I

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
down it's disarmed so if I do that and I

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.460 
down it's disarmed so if I do that and I
walk<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.360> these<00:02:03.450> pressure<00:02:03.750> plates<00:02:04.049> now

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.850 

there's<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.709> no<00:02:10.860> way<00:02:11.360> um<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.770> think

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
there's just no way um and I think

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.009 
there's just no way um and I think
that's<00:02:14.160> really<00:02:14.370> cool<00:02:14.550> really<00:02:15.360> helpful<00:02:15.840> and

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
that's really cool really helpful and
