were<00:05:18.519> very<00:05:18.759> very<00:05:19.329> disappointing<00:05:20.139> a<00:05:20.229> game<00:05:20.439> oh

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:20.769 
were very very disappointing a game oh

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:23.699 
were very very disappointing a game oh
we<00:05:21.039> had<00:05:21.129> some<00:05:21.459> pressure<00:05:22.209> goes<00:05:22.539> through<00:05:23.439> wanted

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:23.709 
we had some pressure goes through wanted

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:25.109 
we had some pressure goes through wanted
patrol<00:05:24.039> evolved<00:05:24.309> earlier<00:05:24.699> whether<00:05:24.969> it

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:25.119 
patrol evolved earlier whether it

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:27.569 
patrol evolved earlier whether it
because<00:05:25.449> due<00:05:25.719> to<00:05:25.959> the<00:05:26.169> Western<00:05:27.099> Asset<00:05:27.309> big

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:27.579 
because due to the Western Asset big

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:31.079 
because due to the Western Asset big
plays<00:05:28.439> things<00:05:29.439> you've<00:05:29.739> just<00:05:29.979> they<00:05:30.639> could<00:05:30.879> have

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:31.089 
plays things you've just they could have

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.189 
plays things you've just they could have
minus<00:05:31.299> yardage<00:05:31.569> plays<00:05:31.959> and<00:05:32.319> it's

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
minus yardage plays and it's

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.290 
minus yardage plays and it's
so<00:05:34.199> I<00:05:34.649> think<00:05:34.830> they<00:05:35.129> settled<00:05:35.490> down<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.969> much

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
so I think they settled down a much

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.989 
so I think they settled down a much
better<00:05:36.539> played<00:05:36.869> much<00:05:37.050> better<00:05:37.229> second<00:05:37.800> half

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:37.999 
better played much better second half

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.749 
better played much better second half
and<00:05:38.999> we<00:05:39.240> just<00:05:39.479> a<00:05:40.199> couple<00:05:40.770> guys<00:05:40.979> never<00:05:41.249> reply<00:05:41.699> to
