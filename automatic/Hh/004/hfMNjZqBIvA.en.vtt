this is why going down into the central
dungeon<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.520> profitable<00:00:41.850> right<00:00:42.390> now<00:00:42.539> so<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
dungeon is so profitable right now so it

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.630 
dungeon is so profitable right now so it
has<00:00:43.710> six<00:00:44.310> keys<00:00:44.610> primers<00:00:45.540> Sextus<00:00:46.200> cuates<00:00:46.710> tear

has six keys primers Sextus cuates tear

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.470 
has six keys primers Sextus cuates tear
tear<00:00:48.450> tests<00:00:48.810> secundus<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.100> Quintus<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.329> now

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
tear tests secundus and Quintus so now

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.280 
tear tests secundus and Quintus so now

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
10 minutes you can get even luckier I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.109 
10 minutes you can get even luckier I
once<00:01:10.320> got<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.710> four<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.490> about<00:01:11.729> seven

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
once got like four in about seven

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.209 
once got like four in about seven
minutes<00:01:12.329> so<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.079> know<00:01:13.259> it's<00:01:13.409> all<00:01:13.649> about<00:01:13.890> look

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
range from 1 mil and you only get one of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.629 
range from 1 mil and you only get one of
them<00:01:19.380> an<00:01:19.530> hour<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.039> still<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.399> film

you can
yeah<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:21.150> basically<00:02:21.510> use<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.720> best

abilities you can and finally armor this

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.850 
abilities you can and finally armor this
is<00:02:24.660> probably<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.020> worst<00:02:25.110> time<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.709> want<00:02:25.830> to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
is probably the worst time you want to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.410 
is probably the worst time you want to
be<00:02:25.950> taking<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> don't<00:02:26.580> we<00:02:26.700> take<00:02:26.850> in<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.120> lower

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
than royal dragon hide so if you have

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.960

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
like Armadale def Louis or anything like

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.810 
like Armadale def Louis or anything like
that<00:02:33.090> basically<00:02:34.020> I'm<00:02:34.170> taking<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.820> wall

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
that basically I'm taking the wall

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.270 
that basically I'm taking the wall
priest<00:02:36.150> helmet<00:02:36.600> just<00:02:36.840> because<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.440> hybrid

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
priest helmet just because it's a hybrid

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.000 
priest helmet just because it's a hybrid
and<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:38.820> gives<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.180> mark<00:02:39.800> bonuses<00:02:40.800> and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.820 
and it just gives you a mark bonuses and
I'm<00:02:41.880> using<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> Royal<00:02:42.330> crossbow<00:02:42.840> with<00:02:43.410> fury

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
I'm using the Royal crossbow with fury

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.920 
I'm using the Royal crossbow with fury
and<00:02:43.980> all<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.880> this<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:45.270> what<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.480> take

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
and all that this is just what I take

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.590 
and all that this is just what I take
you<00:02:46.530> should<00:02:46.770> take<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.220> best<00:02:47.430> range<00:02:47.880> gear<00:02:48.270> you

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
you should take the best range gear you

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.050 
you should take the best range gear you
possibly<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.470> because<00:02:50.069> that<00:02:50.220> increases

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
possibly have because that increases

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.260 
possibly have because that increases
profit<00:02:51.390> per<00:02:51.510> hour<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.760> yes<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.030> basically

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
profit per hour and yes so basically

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.940 
profit per hour and yes so basically
we're<00:02:55.110> going<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.320> be<00:02:55.380> going<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.739> next

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
we're going to be going on to the next

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.479 
we're going to be going on to the next
line<00:02:56.100> out<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.880> let's<00:02:57.570> go<00:02:57.830> okay<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.340> the

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
line out so let's go okay so this is the

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.270 
line out so let's go okay so this is the
requirements<00:03:00.060> requirements<00:03:00.870> are<00:03:01.350> 81<00:03:01.890> Slayer

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
requirements requirements are 81 Slayer

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.280 
requirements requirements are 81 Slayer
you<00:03:02.519> need<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.209> get<00:03:03.360> into<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.810> dungeon

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
you need that to get into the dungeon

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.030 
you need that to get into the dungeon
just<00:03:04.709> just<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.610> start<00:03:05.880> with<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.870> don't<00:03:07.680> try<00:03:07.980> and

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
just just to start with so don't try and

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.979 
just just to start with so don't try and
get<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.370> without<00:03:08.580> h1<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.150> think<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.570> can<00:03:09.780> boost

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
get in without h1 I think you can boost

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.570 
get in without h1 I think you can boost
up<00:03:10.290> with<00:03:10.620> something<00:03:11.040> I'm<00:03:11.220> not<00:03:11.310> really<00:03:11.489> sure

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
up with something I'm not really sure

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.449 
up with something I'm not really sure
but<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.000> need<00:03:12.150> 81<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.930> get<00:03:13.080> down<00:03:13.459> recommended

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
but you need 81 to get down recommended

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.940 
but you need 81 to get down recommended
stats<00:03:14.700> are<00:03:14.910> at<00:03:15.090> least<00:03:15.360> 70<00:03:15.870> range<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.830> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
stats are at least 70 range so the

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.380 
stats are at least 70 range so the
reason<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.340> these<00:03:17.580> are<00:03:17.760> weak<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.060> range<00:03:18.269> you

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
reason that these are weak to range you

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.670 
reason that these are weak to range you
probably<00:03:18.660> only<00:03:18.810> want<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.110> be<00:03:19.170> used<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.470> range

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
probably only want to be used and range

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.699 
probably only want to be used and range
here<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.160> that's<00:03:20.430> really<00:03:20.780> 67<00:03:21.780> 268<00:03:22.290> something

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
here and that's really 67 268 something

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.420 
here and that's really 67 268 something
for<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.250> reason<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:24.530> 67<00:03:25.530> something<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:26.190> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
for the reason that 67 something is the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.930 
for the reason that 67 something is the
war<00:03:27.420> tortoise<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.200> 60<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.250> bunny<00:03:29.549> which<00:03:29.820> I

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
war tortoise and 60 is the bunny which I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.970 
war tortoise and 60 is the bunny which I
use<00:03:30.120> reason<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:30.959> use<00:03:30.989> bunny<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.680> because

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
use reason I use bunny it is because

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.660 
use reason I use bunny it is because
it's<00:03:32.100> cheaper<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.700> still<00:03:32.880> feels<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.959> prayer

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
it's cheaper and it still feels a prayer

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.340 
it's cheaper and it still feels a prayer

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
tutorial all I recommend using is a

tutorial all I recommend using is a
temporal<00:05:55.969> magic<00:05:56.300> and<00:05:56.539> if<00:05:56.630> your<00:05:56.750> soul<00:05:57.020> spit

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
temporal magic and if your soul spit

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.499 
temporal magic and if your soul spit
then<00:05:57.349> soulsplit<00:05:57.880> and<00:05:58.880> basically<00:05:59.330> that's

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
then soulsplit and basically that's

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.540
