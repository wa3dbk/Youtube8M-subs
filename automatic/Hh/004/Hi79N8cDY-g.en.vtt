economic<00:01:52.829> koonta<00:01:53.399> could<00:01:53.970> consolidate<00:01:54.420> power

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
economic koonta could consolidate power

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.830 
economic koonta could consolidate power
and<00:01:55.560> unite<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.100> world<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.790> peace<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.689> in

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
and unite the world not in peace but in

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.319 
and unite the world not in peace but in
fear<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.189> something<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.969> fully

fear and that is something that is fully

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.830 
fear and that is something that is fully
operational<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.320> was<00:02:01.409> fully<00:02:01.710> operational<00:02:01.890> by

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
operational it was fully operational by

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.889 
operational it was fully operational by
1974<00:02:04.159> 33<00:02:05.159> years<00:02:05.399> ago<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> things
