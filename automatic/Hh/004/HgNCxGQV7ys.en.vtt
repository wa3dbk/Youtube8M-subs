00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.189
 german b youth champion 2013 the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.960
 foxes berlin in an exciting 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.730
 defeated final of the final four out 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.699
 the berliners hsg dutenhofen 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.460
 m端nchholzhausen in the seven-meter throw yes 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.720
 that's hard outstanding horny I 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.980
 Nobody has seen at the beginning 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.150
 so we are heavy the 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.030
 season started and that is so now 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.159
 goes out so indescribable so something 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.379
 number but never experienced I have last 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.899
 Year lost twice in the final now 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.440
 It just has to win 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.299
 phenomenal 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.030
 both teams were nervous 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.890
 to note from the beginning where the guests 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.549
 from hessen found something better in the game 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.659
 two too many by jonas m端ller 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.939
 especially the two semi-players m端ller 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.739
 and Matthias Schwalbe got the foxes 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:05.570
 defend against the grip and 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.790
 so the offspring of the sat 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.210
 bundesliga team hsg wetzlar always 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.040
 continue from there the andreas team 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.829
 Westram also has a double majority 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.420
 could not use basi decisively 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.610
 although able to shorten but 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.640
 she was able to turn the game first 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.670
 not yet it went with 17 to 18 in 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.689
 the half-time break 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.060
 after the interim compensation 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.829
 the beginning of the second half saw the 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.909
 spectators in the sportforum berlin one 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.159
 balanced game 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.619
 both defenses revealed some 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.200
 gaps so the result screwed up 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.450
 up to 26 26 upwards 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.270
 now the Middle Hessians laid one 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.729
 gap between 27 and 30 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.889
 the hsg seemed to be on track 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.420
 but the fox's offspring fought 

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:52.399
 back to the game and went forward shortly 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.709
 finish for the first time since 2 2 1 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.539
 back in the lead 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.340
 and then you had nile googles on 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.079
 most accurate actor of the foxes the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.960
 chance to make the lid on it 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.080
 but he forgave 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.299
 the first fucking feeling if you like that 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.429
 decisive rejects it like china 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.560
 met and met you all 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.760
 must however decide 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.189
 then brought jonas m端ller 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.200
 his hit the 33 33 the 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.299
 extension and that is fast 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.670
 described the foxes started 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.650
 wide awake kevin struck brought his team 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.209
 virtually alone with three goals in 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.549
 guidance in the second half 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.720
 dominated the guests and the Berliners 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.829
 barely succeeded 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.239
 stood after 37 minutes 37 to 37 the 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.319
 decision had to come from the dreaded 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.090
 fall point 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.250
 and after already a wetzlarer 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
 discarded and all foxes players up 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.390
 matthias had to hit there 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.400
 swallow now turns foxes 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.799
 goalie alexander heider nailed 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.319
 his box and so was the victory and 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:56.159
 So the title is fixed 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.889
 but not really at all 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.590
 believe after the game after what so 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.879
 where we were almost gone and then 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.470
 to catch up again 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.389
 we would have found myself again 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.340
 and defenses stand as well as in the semi-final 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.019
 and there you can so herbs I can 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.370
 straight dragonfly ran and by that we have 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.370
 Too many simple gates 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.030
 that's the heart in 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.640
 the pants if their 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.390
 But who is one of us? 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.130
 absolute trust in our people 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.990
 then showed to the conclusion again 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.990
 why you are in the gate with us
