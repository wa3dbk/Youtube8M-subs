00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
actually a little less expensive and in

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.160 
actually a little less expensive and in
my<00:04:14.260> opinion<00:04:14.410> better<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:16.299> in<00:04:16.630> a<00:04:16.720> case<00:04:16.870> like<00:04:17.049> that

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
my opinion better so in a case like that

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.780 
my opinion better so in a case like that
you<00:04:17.590> would<00:04:17.739> act<00:04:17.950> we<00:04:18.130> would<00:04:18.250> actually<00:04:18.370> pick<00:04:18.760> a

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
you would act we would actually pick a

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.090 
you would act we would actually pick a
color<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.390> then<00:04:19.840> highlight<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:20.829> make<00:04:21.070> it

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
color and then highlight it and make it

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.920 
color and then highlight it and make it
like<00:04:21.370> this<00:04:21.519> solid<00:04:21.970> thing<00:04:22.180> but<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.810> can

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
like this solid thing but you can

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.600 
like this solid thing but you can
introduce<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.410> color<00:04:23.650> there<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.250> think<00:04:24.460> it's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
introduce a color there and I think it's

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.310 
introduce a color there and I think it's
I<00:04:24.700> think<00:04:25.090> it's<00:04:25.210> very<00:04:25.360> striking<00:04:25.750> for<00:04:26.200> that
