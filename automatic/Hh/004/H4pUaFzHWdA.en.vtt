00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.370 
help you with resistance training to
stretch<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.420> foot<00:02:11.630> against<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.080> rubber

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
stretch the foot against the rubber

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.000 
stretch the foot against the rubber
we'll<00:02:12.800> show<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.010> how<00:02:13.160> we<00:02:13.370> do<00:02:13.610> that

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.680 

so<00:02:20.010> once<00:02:20.280> again<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.880> foot<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.240> pressing

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
so once again the foot is pressing

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.200 
so once again the foot is pressing
through<00:02:22.380> but<00:02:22.890> there's<00:02:23.070> more<00:02:23.280> resistance<00:02:23.430> now

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
through but there's more resistance now

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.180 
through but there's more resistance now
so<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.600> really<00:02:25.110> strengthens<00:02:25.440> your<00:02:25.860> feet

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
so that really strengthens your feet

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.610 
so that really strengthens your feet

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
because you're not actually benefitting

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.290 
because you're not actually benefitting
by<00:03:01.200> doing<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.740> so<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.340> should<00:03:02.520> just<00:03:02.550> be<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:03.270> a

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
by doing that so it should just be to a

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.230 
by doing that so it should just be to a
comfortable<00:03:03.810> level<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:05.250> also<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:05.910> will<00:03:06.120> have

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
seen dancers scratch at the bar at the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.130 
seen dancers scratch at the bar at the
end<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.820> their<00:03:08.970> class<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.600> this<00:03:09.690> is<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> very

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
end of their class and this is a very

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.740 
end of their class and this is a very
good<00:03:10.350> way<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.560> help<00:03:11.010> stretch<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.240> flex<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
good way to help stretch and flex the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.440 
good way to help stretch and flex the
legs<00:03:12.930> usually<00:03:13.530> done<00:03:13.740> after<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.820> bones

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
legs usually done after the the bones

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.290 
legs usually done after the the bones
and<00:03:15.630> muscles<00:03:16.020> are<00:03:16.110> warmed<00:03:16.440> up<00:03:17.300> elevation

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
and muscles are warmed up elevation

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.930 
and muscles are warmed up elevation
jumping<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.500> rather<00:03:19.710> like<00:03:19.950> an<00:03:20.160> elastic<00:03:20.430> band

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
jumping is rather like an elastic band

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.070 
jumping is rather like an elastic band
the<00:03:21.300> more<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.660> bend<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:22.440> stretch<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.640> more

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
the more you bend and stretch the more

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.950 
the more you bend and stretch the more
your<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.980> higher<00:03:26.220> your<00:03:26.520> jump<00:03:26.790> will<00:03:27.000> be<00:03:27.030> so

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
your the higher your jump will be so

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.020 
your the higher your jump will be so
looking<00:03:28.650> at<00:03:28.770> Sara<00:03:29.070> now<00:03:29.340> she's<00:03:29.610> going<00:03:29.850> to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
looking at Sara now she's going to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.210 
looking at Sara now she's going to
really<00:03:30.270> bend<00:03:30.750> her<00:03:31.260> knees<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.710> she's<00:03:32.010> going<00:03:32.160> to

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
really bend her knees and she's going to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.080 
really bend her knees and she's going to
jump<00:03:32.640> into<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.180> air<00:03:33.210> and<00:03:34.340> Bend<00:03:35.340> again<00:03:35.580> and

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
jump into the air and Bend again and

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.570 
jump into the air and Bend again and
it's<00:03:36.570> just<00:03:36.960> like<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.500> elastic<00:03:37.740> band<00:03:38.220> nice

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
it's just like the elastic band nice

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.930 
it's just like the elastic band nice
