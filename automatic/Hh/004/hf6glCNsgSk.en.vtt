00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
under the cabin and shoots up right

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.819 
under the cabin and shoots up right
there<00:03:19.280> we<00:03:19.880> filled<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.180> in<00:03:20.389> a<00:03:20.419> lot<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.829> thanks

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
now this is all kind of dirty and yucky

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.839 
now this is all kind of dirty and yucky
here<00:03:23.359> it<00:03:23.450> was<00:03:23.599> all<00:03:23.870> nice<00:03:24.169> clean<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:25.459> know<00:03:25.549> two

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
here it was all nice clean you know two

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.120 
here it was all nice clean you know two
inch<00:03:26.060> two<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> half<00:03:27.019> inch<00:03:27.260> thick<00:03:27.590> gravel

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
inch two and a half inch thick gravel

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.949 
inch two and a half inch thick gravel
like<00:03:28.849> everywhere<00:03:29.209> else<00:03:29.359> around<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.629> cabin

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
like everywhere else around the cabin

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.930 
like everywhere else around the cabin
but<00:03:30.049> when<00:03:30.169> we<00:03:30.290> fill<00:03:30.440> this<00:03:30.530> ditch<00:03:30.769> in<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.220> lot<00:03:31.879> of

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
but when we fill this ditch in a lot of

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.330 
but when we fill this ditch in a lot of
that<00:03:32.030> gravel<00:03:32.389> got<00:03:32.510> pushed<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:33.109> I<00:03:34.069> think

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
that gravel got pushed in so I think

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.119 
that gravel got pushed in so I think
after<00:03:34.879> these<00:03:35.120> big<00:03:35.329> rains<00:03:35.569> maybe<00:03:35.959> it's<00:03:36.889> just

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
after these big rains maybe it's just

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.470 
after these big rains maybe it's just
that<00:03:37.310> there's<00:03:37.579> so<00:03:37.639> much<00:03:37.730> gravel<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.329> got

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
that there's so much gravel that got

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.500 
that there's so much gravel that got
stuck<00:03:38.720> in<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.930> pit<00:03:39.819> that<00:03:40.819> there's<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.090> lot<00:03:41.299> it's

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
stuck in the pit that there's a lot it's

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.180 
stuck in the pit that there's a lot it's
porous<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:41.930> know<00:03:42.199> maybe<00:03:42.500> it's<00:03:42.680> holding<00:03:42.980> water

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
porous you know maybe it's holding water

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.059 
porous you know maybe it's holding water
a<00:03:43.669> little<00:03:43.910> longer<00:03:44.150> than<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.440> rest<00:03:45.889> of<00:03:46.010> the

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
a little longer than the rest of the

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.199 
a little longer than the rest of the
ground<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.549> maybe<00:03:46.669> that's<00:03:46.849> why<00:03:46.970> it's<00:03:47.120> getting

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
ground and maybe that's why it's getting

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.879 
ground and maybe that's why it's getting
damp<00:03:47.540> right<00:03:47.690> there<00:03:47.900> maybe<00:03:48.349> it's<00:03:48.470> not<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.650> leak

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
damp right there maybe it's not a leak

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.629 
damp right there maybe it's not a leak
maybe<00:03:49.519> it's<00:03:49.730> just<00:03:49.879> you<00:03:50.599> know<00:03:50.750> spongy<00:03:51.560> ground

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
maybe it's just you know spongy ground

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.800 
maybe it's just you know spongy ground
they're<00:03:52.639> not<00:03:52.790> spongy<00:03:53.090> but<00:03:53.209> porous<00:03:53.480> ground<00:03:53.690> I

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
they're not spongy but porous ground I

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.180 
they're not spongy but porous ground I
hope<00:03:53.989> that's<00:03:54.199> that's<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.650> case<00:03:54.829> we'll<00:03:55.010> find

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
hope that's that's the case we'll find

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.670 
hope that's that's the case we'll find
out<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:56.780> think<00:03:56.989> that's<00:03:57.139> possible

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
out you think that's possible

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.140

question I bought 230 foot strips of

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.240 
question I bought 230 foot strips of
heat<00:04:02.720> tape<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.680> I'm<00:04:03.769> going<00:04:03.919> to<00:04:03.980> install

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
heat tape that I'm going to install

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.729 
heat tape that I'm going to install
under<00:04:04.549> here<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:04.849> run<00:04:05.000> around<00:04:05.120> but<00:04:05.739> the

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
under here and run around but the

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.839 
under here and run around but the
instructions<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.430> got<00:04:07.549> me<00:04:07.669> a<00:04:07.699> little

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
instructions that got me a little

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.330 
instructions that got me a little
concerned<00:04:07.940> they<00:04:08.449> say<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:10.040> heat

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
concerned they say that this the heat

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.860 
concerned they say that this the heat
tape<00:04:10.519> can<00:04:10.699> overheat<00:04:11.120> real<00:04:11.329> easily<00:04:11.510> if<00:04:11.810> you

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
tape can overheat real easily if you

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.220 
tape can overheat real easily if you
don't<00:04:11.930> install<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.470> just<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:14.079> one<00:04:15.079> of<00:04:15.139> the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
don't install it just so and one of the

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.289 
don't install it just so and one of the
things<00:04:15.410> they<00:04:15.590> took<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.639> destructions<00:04:17.180> talked

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
things they took the destructions talked

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.020 
things they took the destructions talked
about<00:04:17.479> is<00:04:17.570> not<00:04:17.599> running<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.560> lines<00:04:18.829> too<00:04:19.729> close

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
about is not running the lines too close

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.459 
about is not running the lines too close
together<00:04:20.269> you<00:04:20.630> know<00:04:20.750> not<00:04:20.900> not<00:04:21.139> getting<00:04:21.380> too

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:21.469 
together you know not not getting too

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.250 
together you know not not getting too
much<00:04:21.590> but<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:22.039> know<00:04:22.130> on<00:04:22.250> half<00:04:22.669> inch<00:04:22.909> stuff

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
much but you know on half inch stuff

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.110 
much but you know on half inch stuff
where<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:24.530> come<00:04:24.919> across

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
where you come across

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.200 
where you come across
and<00:04:26.510> then<00:04:26.750> you<00:04:26.870> either<00:04:27.050> either<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:28.160> don't<00:04:28.910> get

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
and then you either either I don't get

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.030 
and then you either either I don't get
this<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:29.480> tape<00:04:29.630> come<00:04:30.230> across<00:04:30.530> here<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:30.800> either

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
this on tape come across here and either

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.430 
this on tape come across here and either
shoot<00:04:31.340> over<00:04:31.669> here<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.990> here<00:04:33.199> and<00:04:33.290> come<00:04:33.410> back

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
shoot over here to here and come back

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.250 
shoot over here to here and come back
down<00:04:33.590> again<00:04:33.770> or<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.669> come<00:04:34.880> back<00:04:35.090> down<00:04:35.419> and<00:04:35.780> go

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
down again or you come back down and go

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.080 
down again or you come back down and go
over<00:04:36.290> again<00:04:36.770> so<00:04:37.370> you'd<00:04:37.490> have<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.699> come<00:04:37.790> up<00:04:37.820> one

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
over again so you'd have to come up one

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.650 
over again so you'd have to come up one
side<00:04:39.010> then<00:04:40.010> down<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.550> other<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:41.030> go<00:04:41.419> across

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
side then down the other and go across

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.140 
side then down the other and go across
now<00:04:42.580> they<00:04:43.580> don't<00:04:43.760> really<00:04:43.850> give<00:04:44.030> you<00:04:44.060> a

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
now they don't really give you a

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.060 
now they don't really give you a
measurement<00:04:44.540> what's<00:04:45.290> too<00:04:45.500> close<00:04:45.830> I'm

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
measurement what's too close I'm

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.969 
measurement what's too close I'm
wondering<00:04:46.490> if<00:04:46.900> being<00:04:47.900> on<00:04:48.139> either<00:04:48.560> side<00:04:48.949> of

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
wondering if being on either side of

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.460 
wondering if being on either side of
this<00:04:49.250> is<00:04:49.610> too<00:04:49.880> close<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.990> can<00:04:51.139> share<00:04:51.320> your

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
this is too close you can share your

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.080 
this is too close you can share your
input<00:04:51.770> on<00:04:52.010> that<00:04:52.160> that'd<00:04:52.370> be<00:04:52.490> awesome

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
input on that that'd be awesome

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.409 
input on that that'd be awesome
and<00:04:53.180> then<00:04:53.690> if<00:04:53.840> I<00:04:54.020> wanted<00:04:54.380> to<00:04:54.590> could<00:04:55.520> I<00:04:55.669> do<00:04:56.360> you

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
and then if I wanted to could I do you

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.350 
and then if I wanted to could I do you
think<00:04:56.630> I<00:04:56.750> could<00:04:57.430> come<00:04:58.430> up<00:04:58.520> here<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.940> then<00:04:59.090> just

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
think I could come up here and then just

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.890 
think I could come up here and then just
kind<00:04:59.570> of<00:05:00.430> Daisy<00:05:01.430> over<00:05:01.729> here<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.389> then<00:05:02.630> start

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
kind of Daisy over here and then start

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.409 
kind of Daisy over here and then start
again<00:05:03.020> maybe<00:05:04.010> putting<00:05:04.250> something<00:05:04.550> between<00:05:05.060> it

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
again maybe putting something between it

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.150 
again maybe putting something between it
in<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:05.600> wood<00:05:06.070> maybe<00:05:07.070> some<00:05:08.320> foil<00:05:09.320> covered<00:05:09.950> or

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
in the wood maybe some foil covered or

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.310 
in the wood maybe some foil covered or
foil<00:05:10.610> faced<00:05:10.880> insulation<00:05:11.570> just<00:05:11.720> stapled<00:05:12.110> here

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
foil faced insulation just stapled here

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.129 
foil faced insulation just stapled here
and<00:05:12.470> then<00:05:12.979> so<00:05:13.160> that<00:05:13.600> you<00:05:14.600> know<00:05:14.690> runs<00:05:14.870> across

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
and then so that you know runs across

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.980 
and then so that you know runs across
that<00:05:15.290> something<00:05:15.560> like<00:05:15.620> that<00:05:15.680> but<00:05:16.900> yeah<00:05:17.900> I'm

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
that something like that but yeah I'm

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.570 
that something like that but yeah I'm
just<00:05:18.020> wondering<00:05:18.289> how<00:05:18.680> close<00:05:19.039> I<00:05:19.220> could<00:05:19.280> run<00:05:19.550> it

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
just wondering how close I could run it

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.760 
just wondering how close I could run it
it<00:05:20.030> doesn't<00:05:20.180> really<00:05:20.360> tell<00:05:20.570> me<00:05:22.210> so<00:05:23.560> that's<00:05:24.560> that

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
it doesn't really tell me so that's that

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.360 
it doesn't really tell me so that's that
