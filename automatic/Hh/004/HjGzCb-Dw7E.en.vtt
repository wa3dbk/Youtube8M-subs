now let the wind's coming I know go
figure<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.450> guess<00:00:10.049> we<00:00:10.200> could<00:00:10.350> spin<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.740> around<00:00:10.860> i

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
figure I guess we could spin it around i

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.950 
figure I guess we could spin it around i
mean<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.670> Sun's<00:00:11.910> up<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.270> off<00:00:14.660> or<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:15.929> just

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
mean the Sun's up and off or I can just

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.519 
mean the Sun's up and off or I can just
wait<00:00:16.230> whatever<00:00:16.980> what's<00:00:17.730> up<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.529> this

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
wait whatever what's up to you this

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.810 
wait whatever what's up to you this
might<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:19.830> well<00:00:19.950> try<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.160> take<00:00:20.369> off<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> little

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
might as well try to take off a little

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.569 
might as well try to take off a little
bit<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.180> wind<00:00:21.419> I<00:00:22.189> don't<00:00:23.189> think<00:00:23.340> it'll<00:00:23.460> take

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:23.579 
bit in the wind I don't think it'll take

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:32.870 
bit in the wind I don't think it'll take
much<00:00:23.939> room<00:00:27.349> yeah<00:00:29.809> and<00:00:31.730> double-check<00:00:32.730> my

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
much room yeah and double-check my

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.150 
much room yeah and double-check my
rudder<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.720> this<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.989> right<00:00:34.200> that's<00:00:34.860> right

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
rudder so this is right that's right

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.800 
rudder so this is right that's right

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
just need a little bit of Expo in there

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.620 
just need a little bit of Expo in there
something<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:03.140> are<00:03:04.000> changing<00:03:05.000> your<00:03:05.360> par

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
something and that are changing your par

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.830 
something and that are changing your par
with<00:03:06.110> electric<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.830> notice<00:03:07.220> has<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:07.970> tendency<00:03:08.540> to

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
with electric I notice has a tendency to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.100 
with electric I notice has a tendency to
make<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:09.890> servo<00:03:10.190> switch<00:03:10.250> or<00:03:10.700> something<00:03:10.850> l<00:03:11.150> the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
make the servo switch or something l the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.430 
make the servo switch or something l the
torque<00:03:12.440> oh<00:03:12.710> yeah<00:03:13.550> makes<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.180> turn<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:18.200> might

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
torque oh yeah makes it turn that might

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:32.520 
torque oh yeah makes it turn that might
have<00:03:18.560> been<00:03:18.590> into<00:03:24.640> looks<00:03:25.640> good

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.790 

I<00:03:32.650> think<00:03:33.340> as<00:03:33.459> long<00:03:33.610> as<00:03:33.790> it's<00:03:33.940> dry<00:03:34.300> and<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:35.470> cut

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
I think as long as it's dry and it's cut

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.670 
I think as long as it's dry and it's cut
short<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:36.490> hmm<00:03:37.150> white<00:03:37.510> with<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.900> somebody<00:03:38.590> to

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
short here hmm white with a somebody to

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.320 
short here hmm white with a somebody to
