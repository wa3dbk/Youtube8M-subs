00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.919
 Today we will review the mod which 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.650
 called divine rpg but you background 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.040
 see cyclops but not completely harmless 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.929
 with them not to touch but they have a 400 x's 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.680
 small information one of these 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.859
 beans 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.289
 which adds mod devine rpg 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.680
 let's actually start killing 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.710
 as far as I remember this is the coolest 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.560
 sword that adds on the underwood face 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.930
 but we'll review and so first 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.180
 this workshop filter let's sleep 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.079
 This is such a little man, but as far as I 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.129
 I remember he is pretty weak or me 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.309
 dreamed up but let's kill him 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.309
 kill him 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.960
 kill yourself 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.120
 and with him in a certain file experience but 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.170
 it is in my only valid mode 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.710
 survival it we threw out 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.460

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.290
 frost 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.630
 but he may try from you therefore 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.689
 survival 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:19.380
 quite difficult but survival flies 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:22.350
 myself to you and especially such 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.409
 danger more precisely to me danger from 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.399
 problems with and kill him they have something well 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:37.210

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.659
 Of course slower than me, but still 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.010

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.330

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.780
 just confused something 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.290

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:46.390
 reptile because I already just got 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.390
 this one that just got me already 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:58.240
 damn what is he a long time to kill 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.240
 lace him hp 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:06.490
 okay shorter how you see kill him 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:12.430
 very long we move on to the next 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:17.300
 the last is still our review can 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:23.270
 this is such a thing that happens 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:26.470
 frozen shards let's we volume its volume 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.470
 volume volume 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.780
 sorry i show items 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.450
 killing mobs 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:42.680
 no survival creative just 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:47.350
 I do not know everyone mobs and hp so they 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:50.030
 they can kill me and I am asleep from far away 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:55.850
 here 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:58.370
 and let's all get this one 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:03.230
 shorter thing i'll take the most ordinary 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:06.709
 the simplest weapon is diamond 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:11.930
 sword and just plain diamond sword 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:17.989
 Iâ€™ll just finish this stinker up 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:20.660
 stinky so that I have not to go with should not 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.620
 get frozen shards well as far as i am 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.890
 I remember when I killed her, but not from me 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.500
 nothing got and I'm sorry but 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.680
 Of course, the chance of falling out is pretty 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:39.850
 big but in my even diamond 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:43.790
 the sword is impossible as was killed because 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:47.950
 how do you explain it as the same 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:52.400
 what to chop iron wood pick year 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:55.790
 because what about divine rpg diamonds 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.919
 roles almost do not play unless 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:03.850
 armor and all but this sword is there at all he 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:09.550
 nothing compared to this because 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.550
 maximum 50 plus maybe 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:20.130
 the weapons himself the damage and fashionable sofa 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:23.950
 my god died where I went there 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:27.310
 In short, I did a review today. 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.200
 This is only the first part of a fashion review. 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.350
 divine rpg 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:36.640
 wait for 2 parts it will most likely be 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:39.550
 tomorrow, well, as was yours, as always 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:43.920
