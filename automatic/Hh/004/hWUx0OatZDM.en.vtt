00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.139
 hello and welcome to bake 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.960
 and cooking with stefan this time i want to 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.910
 make a buttercream with you the 100th 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.910
 from then is suitable 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:32.129
 to do this as the name already needs 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:37.350
 of course says butter sugar icing sugar 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.350
 protein and a pinch of salt 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.260
 First, we enter the protein into one 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.260
 mixing bowl over the water bath 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.920
 then we add the sugar 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:07.030
 heat the thing over the water bath 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:09.430
 at 80 degrees constantly strive through it 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.130
 that the sugar dissolves in the protein 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.690
 the sugar crystals must be in the protein 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.240
 dissolved water is very important 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.810
 pot should also be relatively low 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.470
 not that the water is that 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.170
 touched bottom of the mixing bowl 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.280
 but only through the steam should that 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.280
 be heated egg white 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.310
 so you see I have one now 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.000
 thermometer in the protein mass is at 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.350
 just under 80 degrees and the sugar has 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.770
 completely dissolved so we 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.770
 Now you can whip up the protein 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.960
 besides you should have problems with the 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.080
 Having egg whites helps you 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.100
 Maybe if you have the bowl beforehand 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.780
 wiping with lemon juice again 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.030
 always guarantees that the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.910
 bowls are 100 percent free and 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.530
 therefore, the egg whites open up well 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:28.410
 so I can give a pinch now 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:31.790
 salt and then the egg white on 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.790
 turn up at the highest level 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.530
 if the egg white is well pitched 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.040
 a kind pc mass has emerged 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.120
 we gradually add the butter to it and 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.090
 the powdered sugar 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.060
 I have the mother in small pieces 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.850
 to them was cut to faster 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.360
 room temperature brought 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:01.640
 In my case, I give something else 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.640
 quince jelly added for the taste 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.160
 if everything is well mixed is the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.720
 Buttercream suitable for 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.000
 processed 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.670
 Of course you can do it well too 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.800
 Covered in the refrigerator store this 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.750
 buttercream you can even over a 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.830
 Week in the refrigerator store is not 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.490
 problem with egg whites and butter and 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.560
 a lot of sugar is made without cream so 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.970
 No problem for you over a week 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.970
 to pick up a fridge 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.060
 the buttercream is easy to handle 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.290
 I flavor with all sorts of things 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.020
 have now just in the quince jelly 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.190
 taken their course can also magath 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.530
 take cream or something similar 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.310
 and as I said 100 percent of then 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.290
 suitable because there is no cream in it 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.160
 that knock does not promise a problem 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.480
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.510

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.270

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.479
