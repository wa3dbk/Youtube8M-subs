00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.740
 Hi everybody 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.740
 here I am doing a little video 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.999
 I discovered through a goal 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.999
 which is called brand new 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.079
 and for oneself 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.079
 md brand super cheap 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.899
 branca and mcclain 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.640
 so it's clear that 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.640
 many records do not sign of malaise 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.560
 initially this season has accepted a postponed said 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.450
 if you want to win the trophy cloth kit this field 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.990
 not really a lot of choice 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.990
 super cheap 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
 his compatriot mike catt 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.850
 result 40 steps 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.790
 China and India 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.400
 here I did not want to do 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.760
 this woman of maxime cessieux 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.990
 you can find distilled with hit and run 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.710
 for me it was mostly in the morning what interested me 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.710
 I think I will place orders 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.710
 trahan which is still sometimes also tomorrow colors 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.110
 like that so sas 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.860
 here 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.860
 eye shadow 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 do not look at everything 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.450
 and he is a beautiful language 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.450
 this plateau parity seems so 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.060
 it is sure that 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.550
 I was not necessarily but this upturn 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.530
 frankly an essay 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.240
 in may 2004 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.320
 and unique on this site too 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.380
 so what is shocking is already a good tv showcase not how 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.729
 of Abkhazian 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.009
 and almost all classes in cleveland 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.009
 lately what I did 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.779
 according to henri brichart as in this disc of chants course 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.659
 I am not in good shape 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.629
 deangelo williams 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.769
 you have to go see the most beautiful flowers of strength with a lot 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.489
 she's not bad we talked but four 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.169
 I will not be sad 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.169
 tutto mercato very slow 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.739
 but that's the truth 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:54.889
 or to the ass 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.389
 you want to share this 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:58.099
