boo<00:00:48.870> fixes<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:50.390> mean<00:00:51.390> either<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.629> still<00:00:51.870> get

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
boo fixes it I mean either you still get

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.270 
boo fixes it I mean either you still get
a<00:00:52.020> little<00:00:52.260> bits<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.469> lag<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.250> but

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
a little bits of lag here and there but

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.810 
a little bits of lag here and there but
that's<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.730> expected<00:00:54.800> but<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.860> think<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
that's to be expected but I think it

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.740 
that's to be expected but I think it
just<00:00:57.180> drastically<00:00:57.920> changes<00:00:59.180> you're<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.420> one

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
I would be ecstatic I think that would

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.070 
I would be ecstatic I think that would
really<00:04:05.340> make<00:04:05.760> this<00:04:05.880> game<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.269> lot<00:04:06.720> better

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
really make this game a lot better

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.250

because<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.500> actually<00:04:08.180> introduced<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.480> semi

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
because it actually introduced a semi

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.320 
because it actually introduced a semi
tactical<00:04:11.010> element<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.580> because<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.209> way

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
tactical element to it because the way

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.390 
tactical element to it because the way
the<00:04:12.450> game<00:04:12.480> sits<00:04:12.870> right<00:04:13.019> now<00:04:13.200> I'm<00:04:13.440> almost<00:04:13.769> too

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
the game sits right now I'm almost too

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.099 
the game sits right now I'm almost too
