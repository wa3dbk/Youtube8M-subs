00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
costs when it comes to hosting server

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.149 
costs when it comes to hosting server
that's<00:01:07.229> right<00:01:07.409> most<00:01:07.740> certainly

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that's right most certainly

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.649 
that's right most certainly
but<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.520> course<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:08.880> said<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.270> don't<00:01:09.510> want

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
but of course they said they don't want

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.660 
but of course they said they don't want
the<00:01:09.960> players<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.590> exploited<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the players to be exploited or have a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.670 
the players to be exploited or have a
frustrating<00:01:12.299> time<00:01:12.450> unless<00:01:13.020> they<00:01:13.140> pay

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
frustrating time unless they pay

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.800 
frustrating time unless they pay
that's<00:01:13.890> right<00:01:14.310> indeed<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> course<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that's right indeed so of course this is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.749 
that's right indeed so of course this is
aimed<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.170> protecting<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.860> player<00:01:17.189> very<00:01:17.490> much

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
aimed at protecting the player very much

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.609 
aimed at protecting the player very much
I<00:01:17.939> say<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.420> these<00:01:18.540> rules<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.990> else<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.500> been

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
I say so these rules in else have been

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.560 
I say so these rules in else have been
crazy<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.040> those<00:01:20.189> points<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.729> mind<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.420> it's

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
crazy but those points in mind and it's

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.660 
crazy but those points in mind and it's
a<00:01:21.630> list<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.930> do's<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.229> dont's<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> seems<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
a list of do's and dont's it seems you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.480 
a list of do's and dont's it seems you
know<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.439> well<00:01:25.740> apparently<00:01:25.979> you

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
know what you can do well apparently you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700 
know what you can do well apparently you
can<00:01:26.670> charge<00:01:26.970> players<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.630> access<00:01:28.080> your<00:01:28.259> server

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
can charge players to access your server

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.130 
can charge players to access your server
but<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.670> fees<00:01:30.060> must<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.450> equal<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:30.960> all

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
