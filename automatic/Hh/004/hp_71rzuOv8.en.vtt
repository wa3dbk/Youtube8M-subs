if we look here we got some brown kind

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.420 
if we look here we got some brown kind
of<00:00:48.570> good<00:00:49.530> what<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> called<00:00:51.559> blocks<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.070> this

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
of good what is called blocks so this

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.150 
of good what is called blocks so this
might<00:00:53.760> look<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.930> new<00:00:55.170> kind<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.530> dirt<00:00:55.890> or

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
might look like a new kind of dirt or

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.459 
might look like a new kind of dirt or
something<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> grass

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
something as you can see here the grass

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.670 
something as you can see here the grass
is<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.629> the<00:01:00.629> dirt<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:01.020> earth<00:01:01.289> doesn't

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
is here and the dirt on earth doesn't

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.609 
is here and the dirt on earth doesn't
look<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.539> but<00:01:03.539> maybe<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.110> will<00:01:04.350> change

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
look like this but maybe it will change

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.789 
look like this but maybe it will change
after<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.339> break<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:06.000> something<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.799> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
after we break it or something and I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.609 
after we break it or something and I
suppose<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.520> looks<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.000> maybe<00:01:09.659> what<00:01:10.229> or

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
suppose this looks like maybe what or

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.240 
suppose this looks like maybe what or
will<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.360> will<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:13.590> something<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.100> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
will you can will that's something it is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.730 
will you can will that's something it is
appears<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> me<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.659> doesn't<00:01:15.990> give<00:01:16.530> so

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
appears to me but it doesn't give so

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.990 
appears to me but it doesn't give so
much<00:01:16.920> details<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.170> look<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:20.000> it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
much details and if you look here as it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.960 
much details and if you look here as it
looks<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> tree<00:01:21.840> which<00:01:22.229> will<00:01:22.490> randomly<00:01:23.490> be

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
looks like a tree which will randomly be

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.740 
looks like a tree which will randomly be
generated<00:01:24.659> around<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.799> world<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.750> mop

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
generated around the world as mop

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.260 
generated around the world as mop
villages<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.369> look<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
villages and if we look here this a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.890 
villages and if we look here this a
house<00:01:30.600> made<00:01:31.439> out<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:32.040> cobblestone<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.180> new<00:01:33.420> new

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
house made out of cobblestone a new new

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.130 
house made out of cobblestone a new new
texture<00:01:34.460> planks<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.610> mossy<00:01:36.540> cobble<00:01:36.930> stone

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
texture planks and mossy cobble stone

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.580 
texture planks and mossy cobble stone
and<00:01:37.369> glass<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.150> glass<00:01:39.450> inside<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and glass we have glass inside and I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.950 
and glass we have glass inside and I
think<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:41.009> front<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:42.329> will<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> door

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
think up front here that will be a door

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.810 
think up front here that will be a door
so<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.590> answer<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.040> house<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.549> maybe

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so we can answer the house and maybe

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.289 
so we can answer the house and maybe
load<00:01:45.240> some<00:01:45.509> things<00:01:45.689> or<00:01:46.409> whatever<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.299> it

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
load some things or whatever and it

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.469 
load some things or whatever and it
looks<00:01:48.780> really<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.560> little<00:01:50.220> bit<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.520> weird<00:01:51.180> this

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
looks really a little bit of weird this

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.780 
looks really a little bit of weird this
tree<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.380> has<00:01:52.530> lightly<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.490> mushroom

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
tree it has lightly like a mushroom

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.440 
tree it has lightly like a mushroom
texture<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.710> read<00:01:55.890> those<00:01:56.250> red<00:01:56.759> most<00:01:57.210> earnest

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.469 
texture and read those red most earnest
you<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.840> find<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:59.219> we<00:01:59.399> get<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.180> tree

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
you can find and then we get the tree

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.520 
you can find and then we get the tree
again<00:02:00.780> or<00:02:01.200> wood<00:02:01.880> will<00:02:03.020> but<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.049> don't<00:02:04.380> think

little<00:02:20.489> close<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.939> know<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.269> quality<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.719> best

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
little close I know the quality is best

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.699 
little close I know the quality is best
but<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.859> can<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:23.969> door<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:25.260> that's<00:02:25.469> very

but you can see the door so that's very
interesting<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.670> means<00:02:26.909> that<00:02:27.030> we<00:02:27.329> can

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
interesting and that means that we can

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.690 
interesting and that means that we can
enter<00:02:27.719> the<00:02:27.840> houses<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.349> we<00:02:29.010> probably<00:02:29.340> find

and<00:04:47.300> you<00:04:48.300> can<00:04:48.509> just<00:04:48.719> look<00:04:48.960> around<00:04:49.139> here<00:04:49.529> a

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
and you can just look around here a

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.519 
and you can just look around here a
little<00:04:49.740> bit<00:04:50.029> there's<00:04:51.029> these<00:04:51.539> new<00:04:51.900> blocks<00:04:52.229> are

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:52.529 
little bit there's these new blocks are

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:55.219 
little bit there's these new blocks are
very<00:04:52.830> interesting<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.490> look<00:04:53.639> at<00:04:53.819> and<00:04:54.120> we<00:04:54.419> if<00:04:54.689> if

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
very interesting to look at and we if if

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.740 
very interesting to look at and we if if
they<00:04:55.560> replace<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.099> cobblestone<00:04:56.669> and<00:04:56.849> the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
they replace the cobblestone and the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.929 
they replace the cobblestone and the
stone<00:04:58.020> with<00:04:58.680> these<00:04:58.889> conjectures<00:04:59.189> that<00:04:59.729> will

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
stone with these conjectures that will

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.050 
stone with these conjectures that will
be<00:05:00.060> beautiful<00:05:00.379> but<00:05:01.379> i<00:05:01.620> also<00:05:01.919> think<00:05:02.039> for<00:05:02.909> us

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
be beautiful but i also think for us

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.170 
be beautiful but i also think for us
think<00:05:03.870> there<00:05:04.050> should<00:05:04.229> just<00:05:04.500> keep<00:05:04.800> these<00:05:05.180> keep

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
think there should just keep these keep

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.300 
think there should just keep these keep
the<00:05:06.330> old<00:05:06.479> Texas<00:05:07.020> of<00:05:07.169> stone<00:05:07.439> and<00:05:07.680> comes<00:05:08.129> down

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
the old Texas of stone and comes down

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.740 
the old Texas of stone and comes down
and<00:05:08.580> just<00:05:08.779> also<00:05:10.099> make<00:05:11.099> this<00:05:11.310> in<00:05:11.580> like<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.539> put

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
and just also make this in like you put

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.869 
and just also make this in like you put
them<00:05:12.900> also<00:05:13.080> in<00:05:13.259> this<00:05:13.590> so<00:05:14.129> you<00:05:14.219> can<00:05:14.279> ask<00:05:14.460> you

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
them also in this so you can ask you

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.390 
them also in this so you can ask you
have<00:05:15.120> for<00:05:15.509> kind<00:05:16.080> of<00:05:16.199> textures<00:05:16.529> of<00:05:16.710> cobblestone

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
have for kind of textures of cobblestone

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.239 
have for kind of textures of cobblestone
stone<00:05:17.879> and<00:05:18.800> what<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:20.009> mossy<00:05:20.580> cobblestone<00:05:22.249> but

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:23.249 
stone and what and mossy cobblestone but

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:28.129 
stone and what and mossy cobblestone but
also<00:05:23.400> we<00:05:23.699> got<00:05:23.849> cut<00:05:24.180> mossy<00:05:24.810> stone<00:05:26.779> so<00:05:27.779> if<00:05:27.990> we

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
also we got cut mossy stone so if we

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.079 
also we got cut mossy stone so if we
look<00:05:28.169> at<00:05:28.409> the<00:05:28.529> picture<00:05:28.889> 1<00:05:29.099> this<00:05:29.699> is<00:05:29.909> very

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.089 
look at the picture 1 this is very

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:32.089 
look at the picture 1 this is very
interesting<00:05:30.449> very<00:05:31.319> interesting<00:05:31.469> knowledge

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
interesting very interesting knowledge

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.879 
interesting very interesting knowledge
that<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.430> will<00:05:32.580> make<00:05:32.759> this<00:05:32.969> for<00:05:33.270> us<00:05:33.419> and<00:05:33.889> I

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
that you will make this for us and I

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.709 
that you will make this for us and I
really<00:05:35.219> helped<00:05:35.520> some<00:05:37.639> mops<00:05:38.639> in<00:05:39.029> the<00:05:39.360> next

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
really helped some mops in the next

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:43.730 
really helped some mops in the next
update<00:05:39.839> of<00:05:40.560> in-game<00:05:41.490> screenshots<00:05:42.020> I<00:05:43.020> presume

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
update of in-game screenshots I presume

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.459 
update of in-game screenshots I presume
I<00:05:44.039> think<00:05:44.699> he<00:05:45.029> will<00:05:45.180> add<00:05:45.330> some<00:05:45.360> pigment<00:05:46.050> to<00:05:46.259> run

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:46.469 
I think he will add some pigment to run

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:47.959 
I think he will add some pigment to run
around<00:05:46.620> here<00:05:46.979> and<00:05:47.189> live<00:05:47.490> in<00:05:47.610> these<00:05:47.729> houses

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
around here and live in these houses

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:51.260 
around here and live in these houses
that<00:05:48.629> will<00:05:48.779> be<00:05:48.930> very<00:05:49.349> interesting<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:50.270> random

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
that will be very interesting and random

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.829 
that will be very interesting and random
generated<00:05:52.460> what<00:05:53.460> is<00:05:53.610> called<00:05:53.819> chests<00:05:54.479> with

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:54.839 
generated what is called chests with

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:58.639 
generated what is called chests with
random<00:05:55.259> generated<00:05:55.680> tools<00:05:56.129> and<00:05:57.060> that's<00:05:58.050> very

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:58.649 
random generated tools and that's very

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:01.399 
random generated tools and that's very
cool<00:05:58.919> and<00:05:59.129> I'm<00:05:59.909> also<00:06:00.149> looking<00:06:00.449> forward<00:06:00.839> to<00:06:01.199> if

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
cool and I'm also looking forward to if

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:06.260 
cool and I'm also looking forward to if
we<00:06:01.740> see<00:06:02.039> any<00:06:02.250> dragon<00:06:02.849> layers<00:06:04.069> so<00:06:05.069> but<00:06:06.029> I<00:06:06.089> don't

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
we see any dragon layers so but I don't

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.439 
we see any dragon layers so but I don't
think<00:06:06.449> I<00:06:06.750> don't<00:06:07.199> if<00:06:07.319> they<00:06:07.710> I<00:06:07.949> hope<00:06:08.430> if<00:06:08.639> they<00:06:09.270> add

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
think I don't if they I hope if they add

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.040 
think I don't if they I hope if they add
some<00:06:09.750> mobs<00:06:10.080> here<00:06:10.379> they<00:06:10.620> will<00:06:10.710> be<00:06:10.860> passive<00:06:11.460> or

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
some mobs here they will be passive or

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.439 
some mobs here they will be passive or
whatever<00:06:13.050> on<00:06:13.259> neutral<00:06:13.979> and<00:06:14.189> attack<00:06:15.029> if<00:06:15.210> you

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
whatever on neutral and attack if you

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.540 
whatever on neutral and attack if you
attack<00:06:15.689> them<00:06:15.870> like<00:06:16.229> zombie<00:06:16.770> pigmen<00:06:17.069> in<00:06:17.279> the

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
attack them like zombie pigmen in the

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.629 
attack them like zombie pigmen in the
net<00:06:17.699> so<00:06:18.629> all<00:06:18.870> right<00:06:19.080> this<00:06:19.500> is<00:06:19.649> very<00:06:19.860> this<00:06:20.399> will

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
net so all right this is very this will

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.700 
net so all right this is very this will
be<00:06:20.819> very<00:06:21.240> interesting<00:06:21.389> and<00:06:21.990> they<00:06:22.529> could

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
be very interesting and they could

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.899 
be very interesting and they could
probably<00:06:23.419> be<00:06:24.419> more<00:06:25.289> down<00:06:25.560> here<00:06:25.589> more<00:06:26.370> new<00:06:26.610> maps

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
probably be more down here more new maps

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.980 
probably be more down here more new maps
or<00:06:27.240> something<00:06:27.649> but<00:06:28.649> we'll<00:06:29.099> look<00:06:29.279> to<00:06:29.580> that

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
or something but we'll look to that

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.059 
or something but we'll look to that
