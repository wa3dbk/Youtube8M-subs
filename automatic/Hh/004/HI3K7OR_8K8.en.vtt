00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
we'll talk about that further in just a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.910 
we'll talk about that further in just a
few<00:01:17.670> moments<00:01:17.840> applied<00:01:18.840> are<00:01:19.200> predicted<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.650> get

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
few moments applied are predicted to get

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.820 
few moments applied are predicted to get
11<00:01:20.700> seats<00:01:21.000> not<00:01:21.659> such<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> great<00:01:22.140> night<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.650> them

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
11 seats not such a great night for them

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.789 
11 seats not such a great night for them
and<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.460> Lib<00:01:23.640> Dems<00:01:23.670> expected<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.750> get<00:01:24.900> 5<00:01:25.640> AMS

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
and the Lib Dems expected to get 5 AMS

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.550 
and the Lib Dems expected to get 5 AMS
so<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.689> state<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.140> parties

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
so as we see it the state of the parties

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.880 
so as we see it the state of the parties
had<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.280> gone<00:01:32.400> 130<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.869> picture<00:01:34.470> tells<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
had just gone 130 the picture tells the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.999 
had just gone 130 the picture tells the
story<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.369> doesn't<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.820> labor<00:01:36.500> for<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.680> we

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
story really doesn't it labor for up we

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.910 
story really doesn't it labor for up we
conservatives<00:01:38.640> up<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.060> Clyde<00:01:39.810> Camry<00:01:40.290> down<00:01:40.470> for

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
conservatives up to Clyde Camry down for

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.030 
conservatives up to Clyde Camry down for
the<00:01:41.490> Lib<00:01:41.670> Dems<00:01:42.320> having<00:01:43.320> lost<00:01:43.560> one

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the Lib Dems having lost one

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.670 
the Lib Dems having lost one
so<00:01:44.520> we're<00:01:44.970> predicting<00:01:45.299> labour<00:01:45.869> short<00:01:46.259> by<00:01:46.439> one

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
so we're predicting labour short by one

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.010 
so we're predicting labour short by one
of<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.189> majority

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
of a majority

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.319 
of a majority
we'll<00:01:49.530> talk<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.310> Secretary<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.790> State<00:01:51.090> in

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
we'll talk to the Secretary of State in

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.789 
we'll talk to the Secretary of State in
just<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> few<00:01:51.840> moments<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.290> think<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.649> have

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
just a few moments but I think we have

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.539 
just a few moments but I think we have
another<00:01:53.070> declaration<00:01:53.369> coming<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:55.130> think<00:01:56.130> we

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
another declaration coming in I think we

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.700 
another declaration coming in I think we
can<00:01:56.729> take<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.180> now<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.420> word<00:01:57.930> Delon<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.530> why

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
can take you now to word Delon so why

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.620 
can take you now to word Delon so why
don't<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:58.950> go<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.189> Delon<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.240> hear<00:02:00.450> what's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
don't we go to Delon and and hear what's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.170 
don't we go to Delon and and hear what's
going<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.990> there
