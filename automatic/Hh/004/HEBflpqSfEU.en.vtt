00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
matter of t-mobile saying yeah go ahead

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.369 
matter of t-mobile saying yeah go ahead
and<00:00:38.329> push<00:00:38.480> it<00:00:38.600> out<00:00:38.750> one<00:00:39.110> way<00:00:39.260> or<00:00:39.290> another

well so I do recommend taking a look at
that<00:03:12.120> forum<00:03:12.480> thread<00:03:12.750> as<00:03:12.900> well<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> bit<00:03:13.709> of

that forum thread as well it is a bit of

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.430 
that forum thread as well it is a bit of
a<00:03:14.010> manual<00:03:14.430> process<00:03:14.459> but<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.780> doesn't<00:03:16.260> appear

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
a manual process but it doesn't appear

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.229 
a manual process but it doesn't appear
to<00:03:16.500> be<00:03:16.590> terribly<00:03:16.950> complicated<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.760> involved

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239
