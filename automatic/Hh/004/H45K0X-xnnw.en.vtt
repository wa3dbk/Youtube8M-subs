 [Music] 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.180
 to fry fry means to emerge a 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.670
 food in a fatty substance lard oil 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:22.680
 or other things partially or totally 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.259
 this in this case we are now going to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.419
 fry even making one 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.570
 batter the fry can take place 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.030
 only with floured food and 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.370
 fried in this cable or with one 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.760
 batter the batter you can do with 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.970
 eggs with only water with eggs and beer in 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.750
 In this case I'm going to prepare you one 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:54.000
 batter made with flour and beer eggs 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:57.480
 salt let's go beat it beat 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.300
 welcome a place let's make the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.810
 salt approx 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.509
 in the meantime we lit the flame 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.540
 in the oil and we're bringing it to 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:16.170
 gradually we add the boiling 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:22.460
 just flour to have a batter 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.460
 but not too dense this way 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:28.649
 now the batter starts to harden then 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.659
 let's stop with the flour but add 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:37.590
 a bit of beer that will help this 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.389
 batter to rise slightly therefore 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.200
 if you have prepared it and maybe even 

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:46.770
 half an hour before starting to fry 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.009
 the food will inflate more and in this way 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.869
 will absorb even less oil to see if 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.630
 the hot oil we take pinch of 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.909
 flour and let's see if it fries fry 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.729
 very well the oil means that it is hot 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.830
 then we take the cod in this 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:08.149
 case we make cubes 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:16.180
 we put it in the batter 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:19.670
 in this way we turn it so that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.300
 absorb well from all sides the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.320
 batter 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.950
 well then we continue to put the 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.130
 our pieces of cod passed into 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.630
 oil batter here is in this case 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.110
 pretending a little too much 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.480
 therefore we lower the flame well sta 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.590
 afflicting normally as you can 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:48.020
 see all the well divided 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:52.190
 now let's make sure that i torino well 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.590
 frying cooking times are not 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.400
 of from watch but are visual therefore 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.650
 when he starts worshiping it means that 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.080
 almost cooked as in this case it is cooked 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.310
 therefore we do nothing other than 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.480
 removes the outside because it remains 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.660
 crunchy and soft inside this is 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.269
 the right frying cooking in 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.630
 this case I'm smelling it either 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.350
 extra virgin olive oil from the bank 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.350
 take a little salt 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:36.620
 we skip the whole thing 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:39.250
 so together and we are ready for 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.250
 taste it 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.169
