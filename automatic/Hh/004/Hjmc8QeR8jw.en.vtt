 a single tweet and it's a tweet that is 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.460
 extremely important so let's go with 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.460

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.040

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.390
 extremely important tweet guys yo 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.550
 I wanted to make this video for this to 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.730
 Although I had many discussions with 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.470
 the extraterrestrials because they wanted to see 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.300
 a new tweet I know that many of 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.850
 you want to see that but despite 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.040
 those guys, I need to show you this 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.140
 tweet because many of you already told me 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.230
 they have been asking and I wanted to inculcate 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.320
 this like getting this tweet 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.150
 within this list of the Tuesdays before 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.680
 I would begin to show 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.199
 you see that I have my jailbreak 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.760
 I have my subject and all the subject is 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.650
 I'm putting here on screen here and 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.580
 if so, it's called a very 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.409
 nice take into account many many 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.909
 icons although not all are understood but 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.190
 look at the stock exchange as it looks 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.370
 look activer look at the compass a tweet 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.080
 that takes a lot much into account and look 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.229
 up here also the status bar 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.930
 how good it looks like, let's talk now 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.150
 of what is the real fact I already made a 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.159
 video of this and here also our 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.350
 Julian writer has made an article of 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.490
 what to do so as not to lose the boil that 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.710
 in case you have 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.320
 an error and that's what this 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.909
 tweet I wanted to do it a long time ago 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.619
 since he left ios 7 to say that 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.830
 is working but as we had 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.380
 jailbreak available for it from 7.0 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.039
 points 6 and Japan continued to affirm 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.420
 ios 7.0 points 6 it did not matter if you 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.399
 have an error you only had to 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.830
 make a restoration if it is an error 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.399
 serious ok if you have an error with a 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.619
 Tweet 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.179
 you can upload in safe mode 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.340
 sure is that you turn off the device 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.009
 and turn it on by pressing the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.690
 ok button all that is in a 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.019
 article below for you to read it 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.759
 as apolo was still signing but I did not 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.750
 I saw it so necessary but now that it came out 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.540
 ios 7.1 and we do not have jr baking 7.1 you 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.670
 you can not just go to itunes and do 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.920
 the restoration because he's going to lose his 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.340
 jailbreak that's exactly what it does 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.440
 this allows us to make a restoration 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.000
 everything like new but with the jailbreak ok 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.640
 even though we're going to be in May of 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.989
 7.0 points 6 what is that in the version 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.390
 that I am currently you are going to 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.490
 stay in your version but with everything 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.410
 clean that is this option 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.700
 I will not do it here if you 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.960
 They want to see the video in which I 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.760
 I made it, I'm going to leave it here under me 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.040
 I'm just going to make the first option 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.510
 that erases all the tweets and you 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.180
 simply want to restore you 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.180

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.250
 it gives you here it says yes and it goes on and it goes 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.770
 see everything that will come out and ready 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.380
 you already do your restoration was I of 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.780
 7 it is returned and installed but with the 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.120
 jailbreak but in this icon here in 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.790
 this button here you are going to erase 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.350
 all the tweets you do not erase anything from the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.600
 device you will have all your 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.160
