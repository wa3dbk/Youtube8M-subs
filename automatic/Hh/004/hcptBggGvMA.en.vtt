00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.460
 hi girls new video on how to seal 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.320
 I had already made it however decided to 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.480
 redo it again 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.490
 the important thing in sealing is heaven 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.230
 very important sealing because they 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.210
 the nooks break off and the is lifted 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.279
 tip at 90 percent is always blame 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.930
 of the seal as it should be sealed 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 the nail must or cover the whole well 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.610
 surface especially the tip and the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.860
 corners as you see in this anyway 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.329
 Video of the segment between the other trick 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.280
 obviously don't touch but the cuticles 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.469
 because if you touch the cuticles you create 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.540
 I wanted to tell you a few things 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.879
 regarding the sealing I use the top 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.579
 silla which is a crystal sealant 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.140
 century dispersive state allowed lamp 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.300
 like all three or four sealants 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 minutes after which I broke it with 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.800
 crystals hills cleanser why 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.660
 this because unfortunately the sealants a 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.359
 low cost and low price customers 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.370
 when it was born degrease at 90 percent 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.110
 makes your nails dull so if you do 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.979
 it happens a case like this you have several 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.439
 options 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.810
 option number one is useful to try 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.460
 use cuticle oil ie 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.040
 degrease with cuticle oil to see 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.100
 if option 2 e is more glossy 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.420
 buy a high quality three of a kind 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 I use that of crystals in themselves 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 use only for 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.479
 degrease the seal or the other 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.490
 simpler and easier solution 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.470
 then use a classic top coat 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.829
 transparent and then transparent enamel 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.329
 to make them more shiny after the last one 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.200
 option that you know I once did 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.400
 used is to pass after a 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.259
 dispersion-free sealant 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.060
 makes the problem of 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.939
 sealant without dispersion is put on 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.590
 alone that the 3 seems therefore we say that 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.540
 it is a bit difficult to find the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.119
 combination I now found it like 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.369
 high quality and high sealants 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.799
 course also with used other place is 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.869
 perfect in the past also found 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.790
 these problems so it 's up to you to understand 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.320
 One moment what to do while I 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.450
 chat I showed you how 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.490
 seal as a tip cover me 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.600
 I recommend it is a very long passage 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.860
 important 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.470
 and here is making you see how 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.790
 degrease I hope so much video can 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.110
 be useful if you have other questions 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.060
