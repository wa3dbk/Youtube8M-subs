00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
start off with the land base one

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.060 
start off with the land base one
teetering<00:01:17.939> peaks<00:01:18.380> you<00:01:19.380> might<00:01:19.619> want<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.979> have

and putting in much of a call it Hellion

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.590 
and putting in much of a call it Hellion
something<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.740> really<00:01:32.040> Hellion<00:01:32.670> crucible

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
something it's really Hellion crucible

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.249 
something it's really Hellion crucible
it's<00:01:33.810> pretty<00:01:34.650> good<00:01:35.150> you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.240> pay<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.420> or

it's pretty good you can pay to or

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.289 
it's pretty good you can pay to or
charge<00:01:37.740> counter<00:01:38.100> pressure<00:01:38.310> counters<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.150> you

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
charge counter pressure counters and you

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.510 
charge counter pressure counters and you
get<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> five<00:01:39.720> by<00:01:39.869> felling<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.320> somehow<00:01:40.619> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
get a five by felling in somehow you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.010 
get a five by felling in somehow you
might<00:01:41.670> want<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> price<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.720> but

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
might want to price that with this but

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.219 
might want to price that with this but
this<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.380> pretty<00:01:43.590> good<00:01:44.479> next<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.869> think
