00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.849
 the young human consumer of products 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.349
 the young consumer toucan give fruit all 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.330
 consumption generates impacts 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.400
 some can be positive contributing 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.140
 to maintain the cycle of life but 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.839
 consumption of products can generate both 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.949
 positive and negative impacts and a 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.929
 cell phone 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.630
 this product had a past has the 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.339
 present and will have a future in the past 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.309
 are the materials needed for your 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.140
 manufacturing as various types of metals 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.690
 the situation was not careful with the environment 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.850
 environment, there may be negative 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.530
 it is as if all these natural resources 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.609
 journey together with the product on the first 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.910
 consumption phase 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.960
 the purchase following the use of the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.620
 product 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.989
 your future will one day be discarding the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.030
 consumption is a need for all just 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.590
 to be alive to consume but what to 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.420
 People forget that consuming involves 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.969
 many choices and depending on these 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.040
 choices of the impacts generated for 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.710
 start because you buy because you really 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.520
 we need not only to buy what we 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.870
 purchase 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.360
 I chose the project because it has what 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.900
 You need to because you are the youngest. 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.890
 Modern who purchase a store near 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.570
 home or a distant, as 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.520
 buy saving and paying cash 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.700
 or buying on credit paying with interest 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.500
 several times and after buying 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.270
 depending on how we use the product 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.850
 we can extend its useful life and 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.150
 avoid waste and our choices 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.050
 impact on disposal 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.280
 especially the materials can be 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.630
 recycled 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.250
 some manufacturers have been collecting 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.500
 your own discarded products 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.810
 recycling materials and reduce 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.640
 pollution and use of natural resources 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.540
 when we see that it is really important 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.040
 in our 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.290
 still the reasons that lead us to 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.450
 consuming we can make more 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.360
 helping everyone to have a 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.560
 future with more quality of life 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.560
