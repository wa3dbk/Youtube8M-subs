00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
century what made it pretty special was

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
century what made it pretty special was
the<00:01:45.810> fact<00:01:46.140> he<00:01:46.229> had<00:01:46.500> these<00:01:46.680> big<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.220> old

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
this led to a pretty unstable climate we

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.289 
this led to a pretty unstable climate we
wanted<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.530> capture<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.399> we've<00:01:56.909> added<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
wanted to capture this and we've added a

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.609
