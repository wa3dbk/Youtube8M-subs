reading that second one is when is the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.200

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.790 
update going to be submitted or what
when<00:00:27.869> do<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.140> think<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> be

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
when do you think it's going to be

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.220 
when do you think it's going to be
submitted<00:00:29.070> says<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> our<00:00:30.330> hands<00:00:30.660> so

submitted says it's out of our hands so

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.620 
submitted says it's out of our hands so
I<00:00:31.260> think<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.590> means<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.040> done<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:33.360> he's

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
I think that means it's done but he's

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.560 
I think that means it's done but he's
waiting<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.170> apple<00:00:34.710> or<00:00:35.180> mojang<00:00:36.180> I'm<00:00:36.390> not

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
waiting for like apple or mojang I'm not

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.440 
waiting for like apple or mojang I'm not
sure<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.950> next<00:00:38.219> one<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.730> there<00:00:39.149> won't<00:00:39.270> be

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
sure and the next one is there won't be

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.830 
sure and the next one is there won't be
T&amp;T<00:00:39.870> until<00:00:40.829> creepers<00:00:41.219> are<00:00:41.399> added<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.969> he

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
T&amp;T until creepers are added and he

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.940 
T&amp;T until creepers are added and he
doesn't<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.110> how<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.350> works<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.620> creative

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.860 
doesn't know how it works in creative
mode<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.789> maybe<00:00:45.059> he<00:00:45.270> won't<00:00:45.390> add<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
mode so maybe he won't add it to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.529 
mode so maybe he won't add it to
creative<00:00:46.379> which<00:00:46.530> would<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.800> very<00:00:47.039> annoying<00:00:47.539> um
