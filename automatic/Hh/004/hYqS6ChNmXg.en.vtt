whole body thing just a little look at
the<00:00:10.010> heads<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> Megazord<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.059> there<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.360> a

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
the heads of the Megazord so there is a

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.110 
the heads of the Megazord so there is a
big<00:00:12.630> difference<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:14.009> my<00:00:14.070> opinion<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.910> one

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
big difference in my opinion this one

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.250 
big difference in my opinion this one
utilizes<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> whole<00:00:16.260> gold<00:00:17.720> painted<00:00:18.720> area<00:00:19.050> right

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
here where this one is more TV accurate

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

where<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.789> plain<00:00:51.149> yellow<00:00:52.910> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
where this one is just plain yellow the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.540 
where this one is just plain yellow the
mouthpiece<00:00:54.780> looks<00:00:55.079> exactly<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.649> same<00:00:55.770> pretty

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
mouthpiece looks exactly the same pretty

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.090 
mouthpiece looks exactly the same pretty
much<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.180> that's<00:00:57.480> pretty<00:00:57.690> much<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
much and that's pretty much it for the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
much and that's pretty much it for the
head<00:00:59.430> itself<00:01:03.860> alright<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.880> legacy<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
head itself alright so the legacy and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.190 
head itself alright so the legacy and
2010<00:01:08.280> Micah's<00:01:08.549> words<00:01:08.729> both<00:01:09.420> use<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.020> same

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
2010 Micah's words both use the same

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.280 
2010 Micah's words both use the same
sword<00:01:11.040> essentially<00:01:11.610> same<00:01:12.240> mold<00:01:12.510> but

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
sword essentially same mold but

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.370 
sword essentially same mold but
different<00:01:13.710> finishes<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.570> 2010

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
different finishes this is the 2010

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.410 
different finishes this is the 2010
obviously<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:16.979> didn't<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.970> metallic

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
obviously I didn't go with a metallic

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.350 
obviously I didn't go with a metallic
look<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.280> chromed<00:01:21.060> out

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
look to it and this one is chromed out

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.910 
look to it and this one is chromed out
blinged<00:01:21.960> out<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> core<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.740> bit

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
blinged out to the core so a little bit

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.990 
blinged out to the core so a little bit
different<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:27.509> thickness<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
different is the thickness of the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.810 
different is the thickness of the
handles<00:01:30.619> which<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.070> weird<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.490> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
handles which is really weird and that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.170 
handles which is really weird and that
actually<00:01:33.420> causes<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.810> problem<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:35.610> legacy

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
actually causes a problem for the legacy

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.510 
actually causes a problem for the legacy
Megazord<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.040> thin<00:01:38.280> enough<00:01:38.310> so

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
Megazord this one is thin enough so

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.899 
Megazord this one is thin enough so
where<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.600> slide<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:42.079> and

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
where you can just slide it like so and

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.130 
where you can just slide it like so and
the<00:01:44.909> legacy<00:01:45.750> actually<00:01:46.530> can't<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:48.149> go<00:01:48.540> all

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the legacy actually can't really go all

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
the legacy actually can't really go all
the<00:01:49.320> way<00:01:49.350> through<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.549> you're<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.119> gonna

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the way through so you're just gonna

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.810 
the way through so you're just gonna
have<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.509> leave<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.549> let's<00:01:53.700> move

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
have to leave it like so so let's move

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.959 
have to leave it like so so let's move
on<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> 360<00:01:54.869> look<00:01:55.500> at<00:01:55.680> both<00:01:56.009> makers<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.759> again

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
on to a 360 look at both makers so again

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.240 
on to a 360 look at both makers so again
this<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.240> what<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.659> look<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.250> side-by-side

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
this is what they look like side-by-side

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.450 
this is what they look like side-by-side
comparison

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.910 

they're<00:02:05.240> more<00:02:05.540> TV<00:02:05.900> accurate<00:02:06.320> again<00:02:06.620> for<00:02:06.860> the

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
they're more TV accurate again for the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.940 
they're more TV accurate again for the
legacy<00:02:07.250> megazord<00:02:08.090> credit<00:02:08.960> to<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.170> 2010

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
and see that the sword positioning is

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.420 
and see that the sword positioning is
off<00:02:27.990> again<00:02:30.380> yeah<00:02:31.380> does<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.070> go<00:02:32.160> all<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.400> way

through Macedon heads a little bit gets

definitely reconsider some things I mean
they're<00:04:27.750> pretty<00:04:27.900> much<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.080> same<00:04:28.290> things<00:04:28.620> as

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
they're pretty much the same things as

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.770 
they're pretty much the same things as
I'm<00:04:28.980> pointing<00:04:29.130> out<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.760> there's<00:04:30.419> a<00:04:30.510> lot<00:04:30.540> of

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
I'm pointing out that there's a lot of

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.380 
I'm pointing out that there's a lot of
diecast<00:04:31.410> stuff<00:04:32.040> but<00:04:32.400> again<00:04:32.610> they're<00:04:33.090> really

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
diecast stuff but again they're really

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.270 
diecast stuff but again they're really
not<00:04:33.540> needed<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.200> I<00:04:34.470> really<00:04:34.710> think<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.010> the

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
not needed and I really think that the

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.830 
not needed and I really think that the
diecast<00:04:35.669> interior<00:04:36.270> should<00:04:36.419> have<00:04:36.540> been<00:04:36.630> on<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
diecast interior should have been on the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.780 
diecast interior should have been on the
teeth<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.500> triceratop<00:04:38.070> horns

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
teeth the triceratop horns

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.320 
teeth the triceratop horns
as<00:04:38.880> well<00:04:39.090> as<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.300> tusks<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.050> trunks<00:04:40.500> and

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
as well as the tusks and the trunks and

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.730 
as well as the tusks and the trunks and
stuff<00:04:42.330> like<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.780> another<00:04:43.380> thing<00:04:43.590> that

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
stuff like that another thing that

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.190 
stuff like that another thing that
really<00:04:43.770> bothers<00:04:44.640> me<00:04:44.670> is<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.360> sword<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:46.170> sword

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
really bothers me is the sword the sword

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.410 
really bothers me is the sword the sword
is<00:04:46.530> made<00:04:46.650> of<00:04:46.800> plastic<00:04:47.190> but<00:04:47.220> it's<00:04:47.580> chrome<00:04:47.940> and

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
is made of plastic but it's chrome and

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.840 
is made of plastic but it's chrome and
since<00:04:49.230> it's<00:04:49.380> an<00:04:49.500> extra<00:04:50.010> layer<00:04:50.250> of<00:04:50.280> chrome

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
since it's an extra layer of chrome

since it's an extra layer of chrome
paint<00:04:51.570> on<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.650> hand<00:04:53.010> doesn't<00:04:53.820> grip<00:04:54.420> the

paint on it the hand doesn't grip the

paint on it the hand doesn't grip the
sword<00:04:56.030> correctly<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.210> I'm<00:04:57.480> a<00:04:57.510> little<00:04:57.840> upset

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
sword correctly and I'm a little upset

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.780 
sword correctly and I'm a little upset
about<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.950> as<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.310> can<00:04:59.430> see<00:04:59.610> right

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
about that and as you can see right

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.520 
about that and as you can see right
there<00:04:59.850> it<00:05:00.240> doesn't<00:05:00.630> look<00:05:00.810> right<00:05:01.230> it<00:05:01.380> looks

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
there it doesn't look right it looks

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.550 
there it doesn't look right it looks
like<00:05:01.590> honestly<00:05:02.580> it's<00:05:02.760> an<00:05:02.910> inch<00:05:03.180> over<00:05:03.540> it<00:05:03.780> and

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
like honestly it's an inch over it and

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.960 
like honestly it's an inch over it and
that's<00:05:04.860> something<00:05:05.070> they<00:05:05.280> should<00:05:05.520> have<00:05:05.610> worked

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
that's something they should have worked

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.580 
that's something they should have worked
on<00:05:06.180> I<00:05:06.420> mean<00:05:06.600> even<00:05:07.200> if<00:05:07.290> they<00:05:07.410> have<00:05:07.500> the

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
on I mean even if they have the

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.400 
on I mean even if they have the
prototype<00:05:08.100> I<00:05:08.370> mean<00:05:08.930> they<00:05:09.930> should<00:05:09.960> have<00:05:10.260> worked

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
prototype I mean they should have worked

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.440 
prototype I mean they should have worked
on<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.620> um<00:05:11.130> in<00:05:11.640> terms<00:05:11.700> of<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.090> stickers<00:05:12.360> I

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
on that um in terms of the stickers I

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.360 
on that um in terms of the stickers I
was<00:05:12.600> very<00:05:12.780> impressed<00:05:13.200> by<00:05:13.350> it<00:05:13.380> I<00:05:13.770> did<00:05:14.190> give<00:05:14.340> a

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
was very impressed by it I did give a

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.910 
was very impressed by it I did give a
new-school<00:05:14.790> feel<00:05:15.180> to<00:05:15.360> it<00:05:15.480> and<00:05:16.170> made<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.650> more

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
new-school feel to it and made it more

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.010 
new-school feel to it and made it more
look<00:05:17.250> mekka<00:05:17.670> wise<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:18.540> think<00:05:18.720> that's<00:05:18.870> what

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
look mekka wise and I think that's what

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.780 
look mekka wise and I think that's what
they<00:05:19.080> were<00:05:19.140> trying<00:05:19.320> to<00:05:19.530> go<00:05:19.620> for<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:20.130> 2010

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
they were trying to go for the 2010

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.490 
they were trying to go for the 2010
version<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:21.360> think<00:05:21.420> they<00:05:21.900> were<00:05:21.960> just<00:05:22.200> trying<00:05:22.410> to

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
version I think they were just trying to

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.470 
version I think they were just trying to
get<00:05:22.590> it<00:05:22.740> out<00:05:22.920> there<00:05:23.190> be<00:05:23.580> show<00:05:23.850> accurate<00:05:24.330> as

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
get it out there be show accurate as

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.860 
get it out there be show accurate as
possible<00:05:25.050> but<00:05:25.470> definitely<00:05:25.980> with<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.880> legacy

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
possible but definitely with the legacy

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.830 
possible but definitely with the legacy
Megazord<00:05:28.470> it<00:05:28.860> gives<00:05:29.100> off<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.580> really<00:05:30.390> good<00:05:30.630> vibe

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
Megazord it gives off a really good vibe

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.320 
Megazord it gives off a really good vibe
to<00:05:31.140> it<00:05:31.170> and<00:05:31.470> if<00:05:32.310> it<00:05:32.520> wasn't<00:05:32.670> for<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:33.030> sword

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
to it and if it wasn't for that sword

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.740 
to it and if it wasn't for that sword
and<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:34.470> price<00:05:34.680> tag<00:05:34.890> was<00:05:35.550> still<00:05:35.820> iffy<00:05:36.090> but<00:05:36.630> the

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
and the price tag was still iffy but the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.420 
and the price tag was still iffy but the
price<00:05:36.930> tag<00:05:36.960> itself<00:05:37.440> when<00:05:37.740> it<00:05:37.890> first<00:05:38.100> came<00:05:38.280> out

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
price tag itself when it first came out

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.430 
price tag itself when it first came out
was<00:05:38.610> $60<00:05:39.360> I<00:05:39.540> wasn't<00:05:39.900> too<00:05:39.990> hesitant<00:05:40.260> in<00:05:40.380> a

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
was $60 I wasn't too hesitant in a

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.950 
was $60 I wasn't too hesitant in a
buying<00:05:40.650> it<00:05:40.800> I<00:05:40.920> thought<00:05:41.100> it<00:05:41.160> was<00:05:41.250> a<00:05:41.310> great<00:05:41.520> piece

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
buying it I thought it was a great piece

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.400 
buying it I thought it was a great piece
as<00:05:43.310> for<00:05:44.310> being<00:05:44.640> it<00:05:44.790> when<00:05:45.120> they<00:05:45.240> shot<00:05:45.660> up<00:05:45.780> to<00:05:45.900> $80

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
as for being it when they shot up to $80

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.260 
as for being it when they shot up to $80
I<00:05:46.530> was<00:05:46.650> really<00:05:46.890> surprised<00:05:47.220> very<00:05:47.700> hesitant

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
I was really surprised very hesitant

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.270 
I was really surprised very hesitant
about<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:48.810> I<00:05:49.020> think<00:05:49.080> $60<00:05:49.800> is<00:05:49.980> what<00:05:50.160> you

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
about it and I think $60 is what you

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.940 
about it and I think $60 is what you
should<00:05:50.430> pay<00:05:50.610> for<00:05:50.880> this<00:05:50.970> item<00:05:51.420> the<00:05:52.350> box<00:05:52.590> itself

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
should pay for this item the box itself

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.280 
should pay for this item the box itself
