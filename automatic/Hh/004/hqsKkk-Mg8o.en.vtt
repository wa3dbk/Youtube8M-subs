00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
screw driver we swap sides Dom that

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.440 
screw driver we swap sides Dom that
might<00:01:06.800> be<00:01:06.920> it

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
you might be better off with a stumpy

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.480 
you might be better off with a stumpy
screwdriver<00:01:20.270> or<00:01:20.540> ratchet<00:01:21.110> screwdriver<00:01:21.770> there

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
okay so this one's a little bit

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.980 
okay so this one's a little bit
different<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.670> others<00:01:28.940> it's<00:01:29.480> a<00:01:29.600> sort<00:01:29.900> of

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
different to the others it's a sort of

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.120 
different to the others it's a sort of
hybrid<00:01:30.230> talks<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.480> flathead<00:01:32.480> bit<00:01:32.990> there<00:01:33.230> okay

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
hybrid talks and flathead bit there okay

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.760 
hybrid talks and flathead bit there okay
so<00:01:34.790> that's<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.330> right<00:01:36.080> now<00:01:36.320> we<00:01:36.380> need<00:01:36.620> to

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
so that's that right now we need to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.640 
so that's that right now we need to
remove<00:01:37.150> those<00:01:38.150> two<00:01:38.540> of<00:01:38.900> our<00:01:39.110> pointer<00:01:39.500> them

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
remove those two of our pointer them

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.950 
remove those two of our pointer them
both<00:01:39.890> behind<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:41.570> is<00:01:41.630> sort<00:01:41.870> of

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
both behind that so this is sort of

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.660 
both behind that so this is sort of
almost<00:01:42.320> next<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.920> chassis<00:01:43.160> leg<00:01:43.520> you've

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
almost next to the chassis leg you've

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.840 
almost next to the chassis leg you've
got<00:01:43.820> two<00:01:44.060> plastic<00:01:44.990> nuts<00:01:45.260> here<00:01:45.620> okay<00:01:46.460> which<00:01:46.700> we

panel
we<00:02:03.630> don't<00:02:03.750> need<00:02:03.900> to<00:02:04.050> take<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> wheel<00:02:04.530> arches

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
we don't need to take the wheel arches

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.320 
we don't need to take the wheel arches
completely<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.550> we're<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.850> taking<00:02:06.000> these

completely out we're just taking these

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.420 
completely out we're just taking these
bits<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.590> give<00:02:07.770> us<00:02:07.860> enough<00:02:08.160> room<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
bits out just to give us enough room to

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.740 
bits out just to give us enough room to
move<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:10.229> access<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> couple<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.130> bolts

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
now we've got to disconnect the

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.840 
now we've got to disconnect the
electrics<00:06:24.550> so<00:06:25.450> there's<00:06:25.660> a<00:06:25.780> connector<00:06:26.850> there

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
electrics so there's a connector there

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.150 
electrics so there's a connector there
that's<00:06:28.120> hooked<00:06:28.360> up<00:06:28.570> on<00:06:28.750> the<00:06:28.900> side<00:06:29.350> and<00:06:29.710> you've

showing<00:06:32.950> pull<00:06:33.760> that<00:06:33.880> back<00:06:34.150> and<00:06:34.780> you've<00:06:34.870> got<00:06:34.960> a

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
showing pull that back and you've got a

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.870 
showing pull that back and you've got a
pressing<00:06:35.470> beneath<00:06:35.860> where<00:06:36.130> the<00:06:36.280> red<00:06:36.430> clip<00:06:36.669> was

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
pressing beneath where the red clip was

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.630 
pressing beneath where the red clip was
and<00:06:37.600> remove<00:06:37.960> the<00:06:38.140> connector<00:06:38.290> and<00:06:38.860> that<00:06:39.400> does

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:39.640 
and remove the connector and that does

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.840 
and remove the connector and that does
the<00:06:39.790> fog<00:06:40.030> light<00:06:40.270> down<00:06:40.540> the<00:06:40.720> parking<00:06:41.169> sensors

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
the fog light down the parking sensors

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.220 
the fog light down the parking sensors
so<00:06:42.850> the<00:06:43.060> only<00:06:43.210> other<00:06:43.480> thing<00:06:43.750> we<00:06:43.780> need<00:06:44.080> to

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
so the only other thing we need to

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.720 
so the only other thing we need to
disconnect<00:06:44.440> from<00:06:44.830> the<00:06:44.980> bumper<00:06:45.430> from<00:06:45.580> the

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
disconnect from the bumper from the

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.690 
disconnect from the bumper from the
vehicle<00:06:46.180> is<00:06:46.450> the<00:06:46.810> washer<00:06:47.020> jet<00:06:47.380> pipes<00:06:47.650> so<00:06:48.490> this

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
vehicle is the washer jet pipes so this

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.750 
vehicle is the washer jet pipes so this
there's<00:06:49.570> two<00:06:49.630> of<00:06:49.960> them<00:06:50.169> you<00:06:51.130> disconnect<00:06:51.550> one

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
there's two of them you disconnect one

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.490 
there's two of them you disconnect one
off<00:06:51.910> the<00:06:52.210> trick<00:06:52.720> there<00:06:52.900> is<00:06:53.020> that<00:06:53.140> disconnect

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
off the trick there is that disconnect

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.159 
off the trick there is that disconnect
one<00:06:54.340> off<00:06:54.490> the<00:06:54.640> tank<00:06:54.940> and<00:06:55.270> one<00:06:55.450> off<00:06:55.570> the<00:06:55.720> bumper

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:56.169 
one off the tank and one off the bumper

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:58.260 
one off the tank and one off the bumper
and<00:06:56.410> then<00:06:56.980> loop<00:06:57.250> it<00:06:57.370> back<00:06:57.430> round<00:06:57.910> so<00:06:58.180> it

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
and then loop it back round so it

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.590 
and then loop it back round so it
doesn't<00:06:58.570> lose<00:06:58.780> any<00:06:59.230> fluid<00:07:00.220> right<00:07:00.970> and<00:07:01.240> so<00:07:01.419> if<00:07:01.510> I

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.600 
doesn't lose any fluid right and so if I

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.420 
doesn't lose any fluid right and so if I
just<00:07:01.930> show<00:07:02.290> you<00:07:02.320> a<00:07:02.500> couple<00:07:02.770> of<00:07:02.919> other<00:07:03.040> things

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
just show you a couple of other things

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.710 
just show you a couple of other things
then<00:07:03.669> if<00:07:04.060> you<00:07:04.300> support<00:07:04.690> that<00:07:04.810> bumper<00:07:05.230> tom
