 make she guides the door herself by 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.990
 yourself to hang and the course acts usually teaches 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.659
 when an odd number of tunnels can 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.659
 make foil and when we put together 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.340
 transform space rooms 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.890
 we actually have branches 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:30.670
 This is the passage we get rails 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:34.200
 downstairs no yes all almost all products 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.200
 brand salt 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.280
 sharpened by the movement of the canvases on his 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.369
 dynamics 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.159
 without the bottom rail want to eat 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.799
 elemental system guides undoubtedly 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.340
 Here's the hole that does not exist 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.800
 holes it for fixers here 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.170
 fixing down give back 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.270
 in order for us all these panels 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.130
 fix helped because of course and 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.920
 guides go on the guide and 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.869
 all the panels we have fixed 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.560
 how would the air be 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.380
 so these are special clamps they 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.330
 set fixed and the door is nowhere 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:19.180
 will go here it will stand firmly here 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:22.660
 here so quit and much lower so each 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.390
 panel for such objects apply 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.650
 poke systems whatever it is china 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.650
 bright exterior 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:37.290
 pirate grandees gazebos 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.290
 stained glass interior partitions 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.269
 all external that is outside 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.360
 home and are the limits of the yard absolutely 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:53.690
 everyone needs to close these meccan 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.030
 any room in which 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.700
 located but which is not intended 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.630
 for heating after all this is cold 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.730
 glass although although if 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.360
 dear to this glazing you cold 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.540
 tens 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.200
 a hot fence well, let's say some 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.680
 Kirov 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.420
 and this operation is simple 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.640
 heat but depending on the area 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.760
 end up being they appreciate then she 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.880
 temperature minus 15 outside will be 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.190
 keep enough of these clones inside 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.770
 clip you can put the infrared on 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.860
 the ceiling will also be very comfortable cozy 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:38.240
 In any case, we have such objects 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.030
 did a lot and exactly so customers 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.490
 ours did 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.440
 and close to taste the system near this 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.940
 system 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.890
 2 here so it works the first door well 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.840
 how do we recommend doing on 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.730
 closers 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.959
 nice nice relatively stupid 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.700
 the gunner where it nicely closes smoothly 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.680
 you can make it too of course it will 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.220
 go all the door back come back 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.580
 abundantly necessary depends on the brand of the door closer 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.730
 and adjustment filed boobs quality 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.560
 suppress parking is punished 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.640
 which is always there where 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.340
 is tweede 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.830
 Well, by the way, parking can be done any 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.230
 configuration further on other systems 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:31.550
 who are in our showroom 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:36.980
 I'll show it here when disconnect 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.240
 quilted she can so know is created 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.220
 very nice effect 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.970
 what 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.970
 we can move the glasses apart 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.120
 will be swaying nicely and at the same 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.820
 time can walk a draft 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:05:11.530
 very nice going in general easy and 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:05:14.700
 just like that next but in 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:18.460
 If we value our example 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:28.990
 space length there 5 10 15 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:31.890
 meters and until the customer does not walk alone 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.890
 block 1 2 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:46.510
 there exists let's go this way 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:49.960
 we put on the guides and it turns out 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.060
 door additionally that is if we are 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.810
 space on the product 4 meters before jumping 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.180
 9 meters here we hit the door which 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.940
 if you fix 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:04.840
 mechanical lock exposure after 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:12.910
 boy here is the usual lever 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:14.190
 but which closes itself like not this 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.900
 2 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:23.190
 turn into a moving parking mom 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.190
 the system is simple and clear
