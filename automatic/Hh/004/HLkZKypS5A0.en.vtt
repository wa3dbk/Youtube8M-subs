again<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.540> need<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> differences

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
again we need to see the differences

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130 
again we need to see the differences
between<00:01:10.979> those<00:01:11.490> two<00:01:11.729> pipes<00:01:12.030> will<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.840> running
