00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.500 
guns a little small figure what we'll do
is<00:02:36.980> go<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.280> bottom<00:02:38.459> here<00:02:38.930> grab<00:02:39.930> this

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
is go to the bottom here grab this

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.440 
is go to the bottom here grab this
rolled<00:02:42.510> forward<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.700> then<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:45.000> take<00:02:45.209> these

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
rolled forward so then we take these

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:55.250 
rolled forward so then we take these
piece<00:02:45.750> here<00:02:50.030> move<00:02:51.030> them<00:02:51.209> out<00:02:51.410> then<00:02:54.109> press<00:02:55.109> them

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
piece here move them out then press them

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:06.559 
piece here move them out then press them
on<00:02:55.349> there<00:03:01.129> like<00:03:02.129> so<00:03:02.629> push<00:03:03.629> here<00:03:05.150> like<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.329> feet

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
on there like so push here like the feet

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.530 
on there like so push here like the feet
come<00:03:06.750> out<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:09.920> grab<00:03:10.920> under<00:03:11.220> here<00:03:11.489> for<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
come out so grab under here for the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:22.539 
come out so grab under here for the
hands<00:03:17.840> same<00:03:18.840> on<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.109> side<00:03:20.239> take<00:03:21.239> at<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.510> end

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
hands same on this side take at the end

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.610 
hands same on this side take at the end
gun<00:03:25.579> moves<00:03:26.579> back<00:03:26.819> take<00:03:27.569> this<00:03:27.720> portion<00:03:28.230> move

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
gun moves back take this portion move

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.270 
gun moves back take this portion move
back<00:03:28.829> as<00:03:29.010> well

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.309 

that's<00:03:35.030> basically<00:03:35.240> it's<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.900> main<00:03:36.140> body<00:03:36.620> done

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
that's basically it's a main body done

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.990 
that's basically it's a main body done
take<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.350> small<00:03:39.650> figure<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:40.340> can<00:03:40.459> see<00:03:40.610> it's<00:03:40.760> a

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
take a small figure you can see it's a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.300 
take a small figure you can see it's a
nicely<00:03:41.750> detailed<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.350> arms<00:03:42.650> can<00:03:42.890> move<00:03:42.950> but

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
nicely detailed the arms can move but

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.640 
nicely detailed the arms can move but
I'm<00:03:43.430> not<00:03:43.640> gonna<00:03:44.420> risk<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:44.990> because<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.380> lot<00:03:45.620> of

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
I'm not gonna risk it because a lot of

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.500 
I'm not gonna risk it because a lot of
these<00:03:45.830> figures<00:03:46.069> just<00:03:46.250> tend<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.760> break<00:03:46.970> so<00:03:47.240> yeah

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
these figures just tend to break so yeah

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.840 
these figures just tend to break so yeah
I'm<00:03:47.569> not<00:03:47.750> going<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.020> mess<00:03:48.140> with<00:03:48.319> it<00:03:48.520> go<00:03:49.520> so

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
I'm not going to mess with it go so

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.740 
I'm not going to mess with it go so
movement<00:03:50.270> here<00:03:50.770> so<00:03:51.770> you<00:03:51.860> can<00:03:52.040> sit<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.819> things

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
movement here so you can sit and things

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.229 
movement here so you can sit and things
like<00:03:53.870> that<00:03:54.010> pretty<00:03:55.010> cool<00:03:57.760> there's<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:59.120> head

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
like that pretty cool there's the head

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:09.070 
like that pretty cool there's the head
for<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.540> big<00:04:00.260> figure<00:04:03.310> move<00:04:04.310> this<00:04:04.430> down<00:04:08.080> just

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
for the big figure move this down just

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.880 
for the big figure move this down just
line<00:04:09.320> it<00:04:09.350> up<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:10.150> there<00:04:11.150> we<00:04:11.239> go<00:04:11.739> you'll<00:04:12.739> see

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
line it up and there we go you'll see

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.130 
line it up and there we go you'll see
the<00:04:13.100> specs<00:04:14.000> there<00:04:14.269> is<00:04:16.359> speed<00:04:17.359> is<00:04:17.510> about<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.780> four

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
the specs there is speed is about a four

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.830 
the specs there is speed is about a four
its<00:04:18.980> intelligence<00:04:19.669> is<00:04:19.820> a<00:04:19.940> five<00:04:20.209> in<00:04:20.450> a<00:04:20.510> strength

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
its intelligence is a five in a strength

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.110 
its intelligence is a five in a strength
of<00:04:21.140> ten<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:21.739> yeah<00:04:22.100> be<00:04:22.370> slow<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:23.240> not<00:04:23.860> too<00:04:24.860> right

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
of ten so yeah be slow is not too right

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.050 
of ten so yeah be slow is not too right
and<00:04:26.650> yeah<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.770> packs<00:04:27.979> a<00:04:28.070> hell<00:04:28.130> of<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.310> punch<00:04:28.520> but

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
and yeah it packs a hell of a punch but

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.909 
and yeah it packs a hell of a punch but
yeah<00:04:29.540> but<00:04:29.960> what<00:04:30.080> you're<00:04:30.200> expecting<00:04:30.500> you<00:04:30.770> to

give him some more firepower of course
in<00:04:40.550> this<00:04:40.640> mode<00:04:40.850> you<00:04:41.060> can<00:04:42.340> move<00:04:43.340> this<00:04:43.550> way<00:04:44.330> once

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
in this mode you can move this way once

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.400 
in this mode you can move this way once
like<00:04:45.110> this<00:04:45.320> so<00:04:45.650> whatever<00:04:45.890> I<00:04:46.840> like<00:04:47.840> given<00:04:48.380> like

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
this yeah I really like this figure

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.710 
this yeah I really like this figure
there's<00:04:52.550> not<00:04:52.729> a<00:04:52.760> lot<00:04:52.940> of<00:04:52.970> articulation<00:04:53.660> of

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
there's not a lot of articulation of

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.210 
there's not a lot of articulation of
course<00:04:53.990> he<00:04:54.140> still<00:04:54.410> on<00:04:54.530> his<00:04:54.650> head<00:04:54.890> doesn't<00:04:55.070> move

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
course he still on his head doesn't move

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.969 
course he still on his head doesn't move
the<00:04:55.640> only<00:04:56.210> most<00:04:56.450> Leslie<00:04:57.289> here<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.620> shoulder

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
the only most Leslie here the shoulder

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.570 
the only most Leslie here the shoulder
and<00:04:58.280> he<00:04:58.400> can<00:04:58.640> you<00:04:59.260> move<00:05:00.260> this<00:05:00.470> but<00:05:00.770> that's

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
and he can you move this but that's

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.850 
and he can you move this but that's
basically<00:05:01.760> it<00:05:02.150> no<00:05:02.570> movement<00:05:02.990> at<00:05:03.080> Lex<00:05:03.560> it's

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
basically it no movement at Lex it's

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.040 
basically it no movement at Lex it's
basically<00:05:04.789> a<00:05:04.910> brick<00:05:05.210> but<00:05:05.479> a<00:05:05.510> very<00:05:05.810> cool<00:05:05.990> and

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
basically a brick but a very cool and

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.040 
basically a brick but a very cool and
nice<00:05:06.410> looking<00:05:06.710> breaky<00:05:07.100> this<00:05:07.510> is<00:05:08.510> of<00:05:08.720> course<00:05:08.780> if

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
nice looking breaky this is of course if

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.600 
nice looking breaky this is of course if
you<00:05:09.140> want<00:05:09.320> figure<00:05:09.620> so<00:05:09.830> we<00:05:09.950> I'm<00:05:10.070> not<00:05:10.280> getting

you want figure so we I'm not getting

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.510 
you want figure so we I'm not getting
him<00:05:10.760> for<00:05:11.090> the<00:05:11.479> amazing<00:05:11.780> articulation<00:05:12.740> it<00:05:13.310> does

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520
