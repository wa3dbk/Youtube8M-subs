could<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.079> their<00:01:49.229> hands<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.680> dark<00:01:50.040> ball<00:01:50.250> in

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
could get their hands on a dark ball in

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.160 
could get their hands on a dark ball in
the<00:01:50.610> games<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.119> would<00:01:51.240> pretty<00:01:51.450> much<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.689> game

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the games it would pretty much be game

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.810 
the games it would pretty much be game
breaking<00:01:52.680> because<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.100> would<00:01:53.189> likely<00:01:53.399> raise

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
breaking because it would likely raise

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.940 
breaking because it would likely raise
your<00:01:54.030> Pokemon<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> level<00:01:54.869> 100<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.500> max<00:01:55.710> out

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
your Pokemon to level 100 and max out

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.550 
your Pokemon to level 100 and max out
its<00:01:55.979> Ivy's<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> probably<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.600> optimization

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
its Ivy's and probably more optimization

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.620 
its Ivy's and probably more optimization
on<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> competitive<00:01:59.399> level<00:01:59.579> now<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.509> could

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
on the competitive level now what could

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.780 
on the competitive level now what could
be<00:02:00.719> better<00:02:00.899> than<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.399> honestly<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.579> doesn't

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
be better than that honestly it doesn't

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.580 
be better than that honestly it doesn't
seem<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.180> anything<00:02:03.689> could<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.229> there<00:02:04.380> is

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
seem like anything could but there is

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.530 
seem like anything could but there is
one<00:02:04.860> pokeball<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.670> don't<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.090> anything

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
one pokeball that we don't know anything

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.260 
one pokeball that we don't know anything
about<00:02:06.829> that's<00:02:07.829> right<00:02:08.220> I'm<00:02:08.459> talking<00:02:08.489> about<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
about that's right I'm talking about the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.170 
about that's right I'm talking about the
GS<00:02:09.539> ball<00:02:09.989> since<00:02:10.950> we<00:02:11.099> know<00:02:11.250> literally<00:02:11.879> nothing

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
GS ball since we know literally nothing

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.890 
GS ball since we know literally nothing
about<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
about the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.899 
about the
yes<00:02:13.049> balls<00:02:13.349> mechanics<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.220> can't<00:02:14.519> know<00:02:14.700> how

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
yes balls mechanics we can't know how

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.910 
yes balls mechanics we can't know how
powerful<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.780> pokeball<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.409> really<00:02:16.709> is

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
powerful of a pokeball it really is

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.580 
powerful of a pokeball it really is
however<00:02:17.730> since<00:02:18.299> we<00:02:18.450> don't<00:02:18.629> know<00:02:18.780> anything<00:02:19.170> we

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
however since we don't know anything we

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.100 
however since we don't know anything we
can't<00:02:19.920> assume<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> conclude<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.750> theory

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
can't assume so to conclude this theory

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.990 
can't assume so to conclude this theory
we<00:02:22.260> know<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.769> master<00:02:23.010> ball<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.489> not<00:02:23.790> in

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
we know that the master ball is not in

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.789 
we know that the master ball is not in
fact<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.420> most<00:02:24.659> powerful<00:02:25.110> pokeball<00:02:25.590> and

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
fact the most powerful pokeball and

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.830 
fact the most powerful pokeball and
there<00:02:25.950> are<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.129> few<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.670> outclassed<00:02:27.239> them<00:02:27.569> not

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
there are a few that outclassed them not

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.440 
there are a few that outclassed them not
so<00:02:28.200> master<00:02:28.470> ball<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.190> think<00:02:29.879> that<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> dark

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
so master ball I think that the dark

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.270 
so master ball I think that the dark
ball<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.049> best<00:02:31.079> pokeball<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:32.099> that's

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
ball is the best pokeball but that's

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.520 
ball is the best pokeball but that's
just<00:02:32.519> my<00:02:32.760> opinion<00:02:32.909> if<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.079> anything<00:02:34.319> to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
just my opinion if you have anything to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.140 
just my opinion if you have anything to
add<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:34.890> theory<00:02:35.280> or<00:02:35.459> want<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.730> share<00:02:36.000> your

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
add to this theory or want to share your

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.850 
add to this theory or want to share your
