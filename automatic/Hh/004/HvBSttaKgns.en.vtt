00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.750 
to do fabric crochet so the first step
is<00:00:19.130> we're<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.340> put<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:22.490> two<00:00:23.490> strips

right on top of the other and then we're

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.880 
right on top of the other and then we're
going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> bend<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.460> over<00:00:33.440> just<00:00:34.440> bend<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.770> over

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
projects or to join fabric together so

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.660 
projects or to join fabric together so
that's<00:02:38.620> how<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.069> do<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:41.280> actually<00:02:42.280> I'm

it<00:04:28.070> says<00:04:28.250> before<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.790> roll<00:04:29.000> it

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.490 

now<00:04:40.150> that<00:04:40.360> time<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.720> didn't<00:04:41.110> put<00:04:41.259> them<00:04:41.349> together

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
now that time I didn't put them together

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.890 
now that time I didn't put them together
like<00:04:41.949> I<00:04:42.129> normally<00:04:42.280> do<00:04:42.699> so<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:43.060> slots<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:43.690> same

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
like I normally do so the slots the same

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.219 
like I normally do so the slots the same
size<00:04:44.940> in<00:04:45.940> this<00:04:46.090> case<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.599> put<00:04:46.780> this<00:04:46.900> one<00:04:47.110> on

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
size in this case you put this one on

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.420 
size in this case you put this one on
top<00:04:47.440> because<00:04:47.770> it's<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.069> one<00:04:48.190> on<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.550> end

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
top because it's the one on the end

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.029 
top because it's the one on the end
bring<00:04:51.430> it<00:04:51.520> through<00:04:51.669> and<00:04:52.449> there<00:04:52.690> you<00:04:52.870> go<00:04:53.050> then

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
bring it through and there you go then

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.409 
bring it through and there you go then
now<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.340> wrap<00:04:54.699> it<00:04:54.729> together<00:04:54.940> pink<00:04:55.629> blue<00:04:57.419> pink

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
now you wrap it together pink blue pink

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.779 
now you wrap it together pink blue pink
and<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:59.440> can<00:04:59.590> start<00:04:59.830> your<00:05:00.009> project<00:05:00.250> and
