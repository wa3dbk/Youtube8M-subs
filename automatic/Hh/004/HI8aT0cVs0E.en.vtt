00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello with you and nekrashevich himself and 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
 today we talk about why 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.549
 users leave 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.629
 our sites your sites my sites let's 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:19.019
 let's take an example why 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:22.340
 happens and how to deal with it and 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.960
 need to fight and so the first reason is 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.289
 outdated website design 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.769
 take a pencil take a piece of paper 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.470
 sit down and take exactly an hour of analysis 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.660
 competitors analysis sites analysis 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.320
 competitor homepage designs 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.340
 look at how their site is different from 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.640
 your site 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.359
 look what they implemented chips 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.050
 what decisions they implemented and take 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:54.930
 decision yourself make your design more 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.609
 modern more adaptive look 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.500
 their site is not only displayed on 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.350
 your computer but also on the computer 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.620
 neighbor watch it displayed on 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.700
 a laptop on a tablet on a smartphone and on 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.270
 regular phone 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.450
 the second point is difficult to read 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.750
 information open the usual article about 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.409
 your site look at the font on 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.390
 the size of it to color understand what is convenient 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.180
 You are far from reading what will happen 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.340
 read our favorite customer he's just not 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.009
 will bother he gets together 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.350
 and go to a competitor is it convenient for you 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.750
 do not hurt to read eyes and do not 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.670
 strain to read this or that 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.860
 information 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.689
 consult the experts today very 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.140
 many niches get more than half 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.170
 customers from mobile internet site 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.530
 long loading is another reason 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.740
 by which users leave our 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.450
 site due to the long download of our site 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.579
 positions can go down and at the same time 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.799
 increase the percentage of failures is when 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.130
 people came to our site did not wait 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.710
 its full downloads and gone it's not 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.399
 like not users not search 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.030
 system and natural 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.970
 I like to see how it loads 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.670
 change your site even better 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.799
 on faster need to improve 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.200
 download speed trust 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:27.340
 there is no limit to perfection the fifth paragraph 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.409
 in our charts it's natural when 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.409
 without our knowledge without our consent 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.510
 video or audio presentation included 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:41.230
 This all happens the most inappropriate moment 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.970
 everyone went to bed we sat down at our 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.639
 computer started working 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.739
 visited the site and here for the whole apartment 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:51.420
 there was loud music 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.859
 I propose to immediately turn off any 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.680
 let autoplay play for 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:00.400
 decide when to turn on the audio range 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.049
 when to include video 6 it is not 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.139
 clear site navigation 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.540
 we also call it menu or structure 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:10.269
 different types of sites decide different sites 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.879
 tasks and therefore they cannot have 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.230
 equally menu every menu individually 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.359
 structure is matched 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.639
 and it is done under the task that 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.620
 it is necessary to solve the selling site that 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.109
 do a look at the statistics 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.299
 watch analytics test 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.540
 constantly test again test 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.370
 see those menu items, those items 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.730
 navigating your site which is not at all 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.199
 used remove them do 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.840
 more accessible are the items that are the most 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:41.440
 sought after visited visited by themselves 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.780
 decide what they need help them menu 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.109
 it should help visited and not 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.590
 mislead it 7 fun it is very 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:53.079
 a lot of advertising 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.959
 a popup window that offers you 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:59.319
 add your email address to receive 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:03.040
 chic mailing list offer either 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:05.409
 like facebook or offer 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.049
 some shares are all annoying 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.120
 remove all the opportunity and more windows 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.930
 reduce the number of all kinds 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.780
 advertising on your site 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.180
 understand the visitor must be comfortable and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.280
 quickly convey information to inform 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.500
 the main service of which is our website 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.350
 and the less factors will be it 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.530
 distract the faster it converts 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.880
 in the buyer the eighth point is not 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.970
 call to action 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.500
 unfortunately 90 percent of sites have no 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.470
 call to action 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.789
 Well, I mean we do not sell sites. 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.479
 can find buy order call 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.860
 submit your application 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.050
 Moreover, many sites are very similar 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.509
 something like pass quest find out where our 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.090
 contacts find out whether you can order 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:56.030
 learns by doing we deliver prompt 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.770
 the client actions take his main 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.750
 services 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.000
 Ask him to order a call or 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.039
 leave phone or email 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.770
 dear subscribers of my channel we 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.470
 8 dismantled with you 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.139
 in my opinion the reasons for which 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.800
 users leave our sites there and 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.000
 others are there hacking site before either there 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.520
 it is not clear where I got 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.770
 what is the main servant that we sell very 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.419
 Often users leave the site because 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.340
 that there is no price there is no number on the product and at that 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.740
 time when there are many other sites 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.870
 who immediately offer this product with 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.300
 at the price they naturally go into 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.060
 Looking for the best let's make a website and 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.800
 even better with you was alexander sergeevich
