00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 today I will speak this not insulting or 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.319
 the new old school since I gave myself 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.320
 mind that it is a rather absurd subject 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.780
 I see it's an endless fight like 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.610
 talk about musical culture since there are 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.100
 different genres today I'm going to talk more 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.680
 of a common enemy that we have high 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.769
 Vienna as a new school I belong to 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.619
 the average school that heard this 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.960
 already 12 years of being well school I have 26 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.029
 years but not in fact they meet 14 of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 durero which is well stopped 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.559
 transcendent you are totally invited to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.510
 wait for the invitation by video and side 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.610
 health strong since they generate good 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.670
 I'm going to talk about an enemy 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.070
 both schools and in this aspect 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.469
 must support only a little bit the enemy 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.649
 here is the time today I think the one of 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.570
 djs today I will talk a little more about 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.420
 marks because I mean time 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.399
 unfortunately and it is very regrettable and not 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.190
 I do it as a cultured form of those who are 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.440
 my school very soon when I have 12 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.690
 years as parents stop being 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.240
 these gentlemen colleagues 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.640
 but already have this to do about your 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.060
 Own equipment own productions and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.009
 live from that which is not bad at 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.009
 opposite helicopter 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.899
 I think it's perfect to stop being 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.329
 old school to just live on your 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.579
 Work your work life and 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.799
 the new school will become the 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:32.189
 half school because our enemy is 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.250
 the time you think the river king 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.310
 mart opens terni jay all brands we 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.530
 While the new school interests 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.140
 for the growth of if they do not 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.060
 Interested if you are 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.170
 to them and they are interested in your community 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.030
 that yes they have given us great advantages 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.960
 that are fucking mother with the helicopter 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.290
 others have given great advantages 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.409
 technologies that made it much easier 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.479
 the simple work done and so 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.479
 follow up for the board 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.750
 they do not care if you know or not 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.000
 you know mix I'm interested in selling your 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.040
 product like any company they will 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.630
 they give the facility that anyone can 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.459
 to serve 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.770
 unfortunately being old with new 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.800
 school we have this against because 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.470
 I said school because everyone is the djs 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.900
 everyone who tells you is gay 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.310
 obviously not professionals is very 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.080
 different the word professional guillén 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.540
 new school I would recommend that you 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.519
 worry because once which is 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.680
 growing is that it is always in the 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.510
 next installation if you believe 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.180
 who have a future in this world of 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.489
 djs is like the universities right now 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.220
 you remember the parents or their 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.920
 grandparents before they took out the university if 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.080
 maybe five or six right now all 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.060
 world is doctor everybody is a lawyer 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.660
 that no mames i think we're stuck 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.700
 lawyers, which is not competition 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.319
 if in truth proven work always 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.100
 give you like work you will know 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.120
 do and do it like that 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.290
 and very good but this is facilitating 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.800
 because it's worrying for the new 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.900
 school 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.290
 apart from the jam, although they are going to be 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.440
 what is for example in this era not 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.440
 school you can learn law is not that 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.900
 no no because we do not know how to tie is not 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.630
 they make us gay but because we do not know 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.700
 this and it's not a very absurd fight or not 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.830
 because we do not have the culture of the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.590
 eighties and ninetys I do not know if it is that 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.110
 the one that djs class the music that retouch 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.150
 good you as a new school I'm going 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.120
 to ask a question you do not school 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.100
 within 20 25 years are going to be the old 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.560
 school that they will do when the new 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.480
 school of the future the attacks with that 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.940
 they will stop if they know it and mix 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.950
 English and producers that will 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.420
 be very difficult and that 's why I 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.400
 I always talk a little about the production 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.540
 but not because this is a very 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.909
 variable who take it take it 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.159
 because it can be solved more comfortable and 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.680
 we simply have an enemy 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.900
 in which we must fight and this is 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.250
 time as combat would be time 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.070
 of the combats with much knowledge 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.259
 such knowledge is going to take you to the 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.329
 glory to war but you do not believe the 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:23.130
 mix floor or be versatile too 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.639
 stay in learning a little about 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.880
 musical culture about jason that either 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.130
 I do not know techniques with scratch now that is 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.860
 I have school unemployment apply to 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.930
 the whole cell of making edits and of 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.460
 production do not have many options 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.320
 it's simple fact is that you have to 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.870
 learn it because time is passing 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.289
 and our friend is our common enemy 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.440
 realize an electro thing from before 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.570
 It was very varied from 2010 but it was very 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.430
 varied the old 2 to the circuit 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.620
 I have to accept it was very good 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.620
 right now everyone is doing what 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.900
 same with the same low and visitors 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.120
 in different notes which already has me 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.820
 a little bit up to the mother there are producers 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.529
 Mexicans I have to say through as 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.989
 again not for making lyrics 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.749
 what could he have that can have 

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:15.899
 excellent singers in Spanish but what 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:17.699
 prefer the room series or whatever in 

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:19.889
 English which if being in Mexico 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.839
 you make me something absurd what hits 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.819
 here gentlemen would be a letter of a 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.499
 nice letter in spanish and it would be something 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.439
 as a new revolutionary thing 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:30.449
 simply stadium ellis or its letter in 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:32.609
 Spanish and I do not know how many to vote their 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.529
 professions has its title page track 

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:37.499
 my Mexican doing this kind of 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:40.079
 electro pharmacy fish in spanish nothing 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.949
 the conclusion is but the support of old 

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:43.619
 and new school 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.479
 not not for me among you since 

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:47.639
 our only enemy of how afterwards is 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.279
 Unfortunately time since I lived 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.769
 It will be a bit blurry since the brother 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:55.919
 who knows how to handle this camera because it is 

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:58.559
 busy is not and so be the videos 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:02.099
 while external approach and well then for 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:04.259
 finish I have some little gifts that they 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.839
 they will serve all the producers and 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.789
