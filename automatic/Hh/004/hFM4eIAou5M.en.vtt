ones<00:02:53.490> that<00:02:53.670> get<00:02:53.760> us<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.970> reconsider<00:02:54.330> how<00:02:54.540> we

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
ones that get us to reconsider how we

ones that get us to reconsider how we
play<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.350> ones<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.680> get<00:02:55.770> us<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.890> think

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
play the ones that get us to think

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.500 
play the ones that get us to think
through<00:02:56.430> what<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.640> ramifications<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:57.420> the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.560 
mechanics really are and understand just
how<00:02:59.340> much<00:02:59.670> we<00:02:59.820> can<00:02:59.940> get<00:03:00.000> out<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.270> rules<00:03:00.450> of

these are what make me say with
