00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.610 
so he's going to be able to push music
all<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.040> way<00:03:43.190> back<00:03:43.370> to<00:03:43.520> his<00:03:43.580> base<00:03:43.790> i<00:03:44.440> think<00:03:45.440> it

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
all the way back to his base i think it

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.920 
all the way back to his base i think it
will<00:03:45.770> be<00:03:45.890> tough<00:03:46.070> for<00:03:46.280> muzu<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.880> defend<00:03:47.210> this

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
will be tough for muzu to defend this

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.690 
will be tough for muzu to defend this
but<00:03:48.500> he<00:03:48.650> does<00:03:48.770> have<00:03:48.980> high<00:03:49.130> templar<00:03:49.520> there

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
but he does have high templar there

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.040 
but he does have high templar there
those<00:03:49.880> high<00:03:50.030> templar<00:03:50.420> probably<00:03:50.810> have<00:03:50.930> at

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
those high templar probably have at

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.170 
those high templar probably have at
least<00:03:51.140> one<00:03:51.440> or<00:03:51.560> two<00:03:51.590> storms<00:03:51.920> on<00:03:52.250> them<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:53.000> looks

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
least one or two storms on them it looks

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.110 
least one or two storms on them it looks
like<00:03:53.300> he<00:03:53.420> is<00:03:53.450> pushing<00:03:53.890> doing<00:03:54.890> up<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.340> kind<00:03:56.090> of
