your<00:01:36.930> team<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:40.340> know<00:01:41.340> Floyd<00:01:41.670> has<00:01:41.970> been<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
your team I know Floyd has been the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.030 
your team I know Floyd has been the
favorite<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.759> think<00:01:44.759> Pacquiao<00:01:46.880> by<00:01:48.560> at<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
favorite but I think Pacquiao by at the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.870 
favorite but I think Pacquiao by at the
least<00:01:50.250> temper<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.850> knock<00:01:51.149> out<00:01:51.619> if<00:01:52.619> not<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:53.729> i

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
least temper and knock out if not like i

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.850 
least temper and knock out if not like i
said<00:01:54.119> before<00:01:54.299> Floyd<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.320> take<00:01:55.560> your<00:01:55.740> own

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
said before Floyd can take your own

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.560 
said before Floyd can take your own
points<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.649> hope<00:01:58.649> Pacquiao<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.610> he<00:02:00.420> always

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
points but I hope Pacquiao as he always

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.830 
points but I hope Pacquiao as he always
does<00:02:00.990> he<00:02:01.469> out<00:02:01.740> works<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.700> out<00:02:02.850> punches<00:02:03.450> Floyd

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
does he out works and out punches Floyd

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.679 
does he out works and out punches Floyd
and<00:02:04.170> takes<00:02:04.590> all<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> rounds<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.610> nick's<00:02:06.600> the
