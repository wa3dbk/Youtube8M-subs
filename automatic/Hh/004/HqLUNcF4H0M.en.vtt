00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
which is a little bit unusual

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.240 
which is a little bit unusual

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
completely pointless extreme this is a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.650 
completely pointless extreme this is a
blu-ray<00:00:55.230> player<00:00:55.260> says<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:55.770> an<00:00:55.890> HD<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:57.480> get<00:00:57.629> a

obviously<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.300> remote<00:01:06.020> this<00:01:07.020> pointless

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
obviously the remote this pointless

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.789 
obviously the remote this pointless
sticker<00:01:09.409> tip<00:01:10.409> cardboard<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.380> comes<00:01:13.619> in

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
sticker tip cardboard and it comes in

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:22.130 
sticker tip cardboard and it comes in
this<00:01:15.619> packaging<00:01:20.270> I<00:01:21.270> mean<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.570> quite<00:01:21.840> wide

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
this packaging I mean it's quite wide

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.450 
this packaging I mean it's quite wide
but<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.220> surprisingly<00:01:24.500> narrow<00:01:25.500> even<00:01:26.369> though

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
but it's surprisingly narrow even though

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.870 
but it's surprisingly narrow even though
it's<00:01:26.610> long<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.030> way<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:28.229> short<00:01:28.880> so

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it's long that way but just short so

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.010 
it's long that way but just short so
there<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:32.030> okay<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.060> grab<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> closer<00:01:33.810> look

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
there it is okay so grab a closer look

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.230 
there it is okay so grab a closer look
at<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.259> now<00:01:34.640> that's<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> front<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.800 
at it now that's the front of it
obviously<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.460> pretty<00:01:38.640> clean<00:01:38.970> not<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> lot

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810

now is plug it all in and see what you
think<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:24.640> says<00:02:24.820> power<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:26.160> see<00:02:27.160> what

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
think it says power on I see what

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:48.380 
think it says power on I see what
happens

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.690 

so<00:02:48.960> there<00:02:49.200> goes<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.440> tented<00:02:49.950> my<00:02:50.340> hard<00:02:50.520> drives

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
so there goes the tented my hard drives

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:59.030 
so there goes the tented my hard drives
plugged<00:02:50.940> into<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.240> as<00:02:51.330> well<00:02:51.450> at<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.660> moment<00:02:58.040> so

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
plugged into it as well at the moment so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.320 
plugged into it as well at the moment so
it's<00:02:59.160> probably<00:02:59.430> written<00:02:59.640> off<00:02:59.730> both<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.150> might

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
it's probably written off both it might

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.760 
it's probably written off both it might
even<00:03:00.450> start<00:03:00.810> playing<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.230> probably<00:03:01.440> rate

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
even start playing I probably rate

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.650 
even start playing I probably rate
plugged<00:03:02.010> into<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.400> as<00:03:02.490> well<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:02.910> yeah<00:03:03.630> I

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
plugged into it as well so yeah I

does take a few minutes for it sir it's
quite<00:04:05.310> quick<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:05.580> time<00:04:05.760> sometimes<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.299> does

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
quite quick this time sometimes it does

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.530 
quite quick this time sometimes it does
take<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.739> about<00:04:07.739> 10<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.400> 20<00:04:08.670> seconds<00:04:09.180> for<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.450> to

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
take a about 10 to 20 seconds for it to

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.690 
take a about 10 to 20 seconds for it to
start<00:04:10.049> playing<00:04:10.320> depends<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.370> movie<00:04:11.670> I

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
start playing depends on the movie I

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.810 
start playing depends on the movie I
guess<00:04:12.799> but<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:13.890> fast-forward<00:04:14.340> works<00:04:14.640> really

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
guess but the fast-forward works really

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.780 
guess but the fast-forward works really
well<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.109> can<00:04:16.400> skip<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.580> whichever

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
well and I can skip it to whichever

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.930 
well and I can skip it to whichever
scene<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.180> like<00:04:19.280> one<00:04:20.280> thing<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.580> is<00:04:20.700> annoying

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
scene I like one thing that is annoying

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.010 
scene I like one thing that is annoying
though<00:04:21.330> is<00:04:21.630> on<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.800> remote<00:04:23.790> control<00:04:24.240> so

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
though is on the remote control so

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.380 
though is on the remote control so
focusing<00:04:25.710> them<00:04:25.830> on<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:29.000> they<00:04:30.000> guess<00:04:30.180> on<00:04:30.330> the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
focusing them on that they guess on the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.900 
focusing them on that they guess on the
remote<00:04:30.600> control<00:04:30.990> if<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.860> do<00:04:31.919> press<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.580> skip

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
remote control if I do press the skip

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.430 
remote control if I do press the skip
button<00:04:34.790> it<00:04:35.790> doesn't<00:04:36.479> skip<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:36.900> scene<00:04:37.229> or

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
button it doesn't skip a scene or

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.440 
button it doesn't skip a scene or
anything<00:04:37.470> like<00:04:37.919> that<00:04:37.979> because<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.090> one

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
anything like that because it is one

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.080 
anything like that because it is one
file<00:04:39.810> some<00:04:40.770> blu-ray<00:04:41.040> players<00:04:41.280> just<00:04:41.490> skips<00:04:41.850> a

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
file some blu-ray players just skips a

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.880 
file some blu-ray players just skips a
certain<00:04:42.690> amount<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:42.930> time<00:04:43.169> depends<00:04:43.530> at<00:04:43.830> the

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
certain amount of time depends at the

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.610 
certain amount of time depends at the
size<00:04:44.130> of<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.340> actual<00:04:44.940> movie<00:04:45.300> clip<00:04:45.510> so<00:04:46.380> but

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
size of the actual movie clip so but

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.530 
size of the actual movie clip so but
this<00:04:46.770> one<00:04:46.919> just<00:04:47.070> skips<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.460> next<00:04:48.300> video

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
this one just skips to the next video

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.240 
this one just skips to the next video
clip<00:04:48.810> so<00:04:48.990> in<00:04:49.080> this<00:04:49.140> case<00:04:49.320> it<00:04:49.470> skips<00:04:50.100> in<00:04:50.190> the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
clip so in this case it skips in the

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.670 
clip so in this case it skips in the

if<00:06:41.440> you<00:06:41.530> look<00:06:41.680> to<00:06:41.770> the<00:06:41.890> setup<00:06:43.530> you<00:06:44.530> can<00:06:44.830> change

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
if you look to the setup you can change

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.670 
if you look to the setup you can change
the<00:06:45.160> display<00:06:45.400> settings<00:06:45.790> with<00:06:46.660> 1080p<00:06:47.230> and

the display settings with 1080p and

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.410 
the display settings with 1080p and
change<00:06:48.340> the<00:06:48.430> resolution<00:06:48.580> depending<00:06:49.240> on<00:06:49.330> your

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
change the resolution depending on your

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.940 
change the resolution depending on your
telly<00:06:51.870> then<00:06:52.870> you<00:06:52.960> get<00:06:53.110> your<00:06:53.200> Hertz<00:06:53.440> as<00:06:53.710> well

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
telly then you get your Hertz as well

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.630 
telly then you get your Hertz as well
this<00:06:54.820> telly<00:06:55.150> is<00:06:55.360> 50<00:06:55.720> Hertz<00:06:55.870> telly<00:06:56.290> so<00:06:56.650> that's

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:57.640 
this telly is 50 Hertz telly so that's

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.250 
this telly is 50 Hertz telly so that's
what<00:06:57.820> we<00:06:57.940> get<00:06:58.120> was<00:06:58.330> that<00:06:58.480> one<00:06:58.690> but<00:06:58.930> you<00:06:59.020> can't
