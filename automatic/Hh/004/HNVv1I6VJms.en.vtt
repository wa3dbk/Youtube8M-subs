play backups right here a sense of one
in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:19.410> corner<00:00:20.300> sensor<00:00:21.320> to<00:00:22.320> which<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.340> this

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
in the corner sensor to which is this

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.630 
in the corner sensor to which is this
little<00:00:23.699> white<00:00:23.970> bit<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.189> sense<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.310> three

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
little white bit here and sense of three

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.470 
little white bit here and sense of three
is<00:00:26.849> right<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.539> car<00:00:27.779> down<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:29.330> it<00:00:30.330> took

is right in the car down there it took
me<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> few<00:00:30.750> attempts<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.130> but

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
me a few attempts to get that one in but

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.610 
me a few attempts to get that one in but
fingers<00:00:33.300> crossed<00:00:33.450> for<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.290> right<00:00:34.469> this

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
fingers crossed for do it right this

time
so<00:00:35.899> start<00:00:36.899> by<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:38.239> sense<00:00:39.239> or<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:40.100> since<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> one

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
so start by a sense or one since the one

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.299 
so start by a sense or one since the one
what<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.059> need<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.770> well<00:00:43.770> for<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> whole

you can get down right so first apply

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.550 
you can get down right so first apply
that<00:01:17.159> one

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.450 

place<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:25.399> and<00:01:26.399> stick<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.909> down<00:01:28.189> folks<00:01:29.189> I

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
place it in and stick it down folks I

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.260 
place it in and stick it down folks I
just<00:01:29.670> turned<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.090> accidentally<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.970> then

just turned it on accidentally and then

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.889 
just turned it on accidentally and then
second<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:34.189> put<00:01:35.189> camera<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:36.829> Betsy<00:01:37.829> there

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
second one put camera down Betsy there

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.999 
second one put camera down Betsy there
just<00:01:39.899> slide<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.920> back<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:42.920> insert<00:01:43.920> another

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
just slide it back and insert another

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.520 
just slide it back and insert another
tap<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.580> is<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:44.909> an<00:01:45.090> iced<00:01:45.530> isosceles

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
tap this is like an iced isosceles

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.870 
tap this is like an iced isosceles
triangle<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.130> need<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> slide<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.670> in

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
triangle so you just need to slide it in

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.289 
triangle so you just need to slide it in
but<00:01:51.539> make<00:01:51.750> sure<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.289> none<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:53.119> gets<00:01:54.119> in

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
but make sure that none of it gets in

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.820 
but make sure that none of it gets in
the<00:01:54.390> way<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.539> you<00:01:54.750> sensor<00:01:55.229> because<00:01:55.679> that

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
the way of you sensor because that

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.430 
the way of you sensor because that
slides<00:01:56.069> up<00:01:56.220> and<00:01:56.369> down<00:01:56.810> right<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
slides up and down right now for the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.490 
slides up and down right now for the
last<00:01:58.679> bit<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.009> need<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> piece<00:01:59.750> which<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.049> about

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
last bit you need a piece which is about

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.499 
last bit you need a piece which is about
so<00:02:01.830> long<00:02:03.350> I<00:02:04.549> don't<00:02:05.549> know<00:02:05.780> judge<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.959> size<00:02:07.259> it's

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
so long I don't know judge in size it's

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.250 
so long I don't know judge in size it's
small<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.840> compare<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.289> with<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:12.810> no

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
small I can compare it with it's no

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.140 
small I can compare it with it's no
longer<00:02:13.560> than<00:02:14.190> well<00:02:14.940> I'm<00:02:15.540> going<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:15.959> compare<00:02:16.319> it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
longer than well I'm going to compare it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.670 
longer than well I'm going to compare it
yeah<00:02:20.269> if<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.569> just<00:02:21.750> see<00:02:22.049> it<00:02:22.370> above<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.580> razor

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
yeah if you just see it above the razor

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.190 
yeah if you just see it above the razor
there<00:02:25.680> there<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.310> like<00:02:26.609> a<00:02:27.030> line<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.989> runs

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
there there is like a line that runs

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.500 
there there is like a line that runs
across<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.709> back<00:02:28.890> here<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:29.970> about<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.209> same

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
across the back here it's about the same

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.360 
across the back here it's about the same
infers<00:02:31.109> that<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.620> width<00:02:31.859> of<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.359> needs<00:02:33.359> to<00:02:33.600> be

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
infers that the width of it needs to be

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.940 
infers that the width of it needs to be
nice<00:02:35.370> decent<00:02:35.700> width<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:38.390> slide<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.569> down<00:02:39.950> now

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
nice decent width so slide it down now

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.349 
nice decent width so slide it down now
this<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.250> where<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:41.519> turn<00:02:41.760> on<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.060> console

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.870 

turn<00:02:48.359> that<00:02:48.540> down<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:50.040> then<00:02:50.370> if<00:02:50.489> we're<00:02:50.700> going

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
turn that down and then if we're going

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.870 
turn that down and then if we're going
to<00:02:50.940> put<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:52.430> in

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:19.900 

until<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.960> sit<00:02:58.440> see<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.890> slide<00:02:59.070> back<00:02:59.490> here

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:27.960 

and<00:03:20.120> then<00:03:21.050> here<00:03:22.010> oh<00:03:22.540> you've<00:03:23.540> just<00:03:23.570> knocked<00:03:23.900> it

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.810 

then<00:03:28.970> just<00:03:29.570> here<00:03:29.990> it's<00:03:30.950> like<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.220> little<00:03:31.580> lip

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
then just here it's like a little lip

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.610 
then just here it's like a little lip
wake<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.360> just<00:03:32.540> tuck<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.840> under<00:03:33.140> safe<00:03:33.350> holes

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
wake and just tuck it under safe holes

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.130 
wake and just tuck it under safe holes
so<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.400> don't<00:03:34.580> need<00:03:34.700> any<00:03:34.850> stars<00:03:35.330> around<00:03:35.690> like

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
so you don't need any stars around like

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.270 
so you don't need any stars around like
you've<00:03:36.350> might<00:03:36.560> have<00:03:36.680> seen<00:03:36.860> in<00:03:37.010> other<00:03:37.130> videos

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
you've might have seen in other videos

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.600 
you've might have seen in other videos
but<00:03:38.350> this<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:39.470> general<00:03:39.860> idea<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:40.370> then<00:03:40.460> the

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
but this is general idea and then the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.750 
but this is general idea and then the
game<00:03:40.850> that<00:03:41.120> we're<00:03:41.240> going<00:03:41.360> to<00:03:41.420> use<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:45.760> they

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
game that we're going to use is they

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.430 
game that we're going to use is they
observe<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.210> same<00:03:47.420> not<00:03:47.990> odd<00:03:48.230> world<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:51.260> is

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
observe the same not odd world and it is

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.350 
observe the same not odd world and it is
a<00:03:51.500> copy

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
a copy

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.100 
a copy
it's<00:03:53.360> an<00:03:53.480> old<00:03:53.660> copy<00:03:55.210> if<00:03:56.210> you<00:03:56.270> can<00:03:56.570> just<00:03:56.780> see<00:03:57.080> I

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
it's an old copy if you can just see I

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.240 
it's an old copy if you can just see I
don't<00:03:57.500> know<00:03:57.710> you<00:03:58.580> can<00:03:58.760> only<00:03:59.030> see<00:03:59.210> a<00:03:59.240> remedy<00:03:59.750> but

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
don't know you can only see a remedy but

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.550 
don't know you can only see a remedy but
anyway<00:04:01.250> so<00:04:01.910> what<00:04:02.210> we<00:04:02.330> do<00:04:02.480> is<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:03.050> start<00:04:03.320> with

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
anyway so what we do is to start with

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.190 
anyway so what we do is to start with
this<00:04:04.430> first<00:04:04.730> tab<00:04:05.120> we<00:04:05.450> just<00:04:06.440> raise<00:04:06.710> it<00:04:06.890> up<00:04:08.200> I'll

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
this first tab we just raise it up I'll

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.390 
this first tab we just raise it up I'll
take<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.650> off<00:04:09.740> even<00:04:11.740> so<00:04:12.740> now<00:04:12.920> I've<00:04:13.010> just<00:04:13.040> took

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
take it off even so now I've just took

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.430 
take it off even so now I've just took
that<00:04:13.700> off<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.870> get<00:04:15.020> a<00:04:15.080> normal<00:04:16.239> ps1<00:04:17.239> or<00:04:18.310> ps2

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
that off you get a normal ps1 or ps2

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.620 
that off you get a normal ps1 or ps2
bind<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.620> disc<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:22.280> don't<00:04:22.760> have<00:04:22.880> any<00:04:23.090> ps2

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
bind the disc I don't have any ps2

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.260 
bind the disc I don't have any ps2
backups<00:04:24.200> so<00:04:25.190> I'm<00:04:25.340> just<00:04:25.490> using<00:04:25.700> circuit

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
backups so I'm just using circuit

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.080 
backups so I'm just using circuit
breakers<00:04:26.630> needs<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:27.050> start<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.500> off<00:04:27.650> just<00:04:28.580> put

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
breakers needs to start it off just put

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.260 
breakers needs to start it off just put
that<00:04:29.120> in<00:04:29.920> and<00:04:30.920> then<00:04:31.220> on<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:33.400> s2<00:04:34.400> screen<00:04:34.790> if<00:04:35.090> it

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
that in and then on the s2 screen if it

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.360 
that in and then on the s2 screen if it
is<00:04:35.390> fine<00:04:35.630> control<00:04:35.930> just<00:04:36.890> going<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.280> your

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
is fine control just going to your

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.200 
is fine control just going to your
browser

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:51.170 

and<00:04:42.509> then<00:04:45.440> we<00:04:46.440> just<00:04:46.770> put<00:04:46.860> on<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:48.139> tab<00:04:49.699> so<00:04:50.699> just<00:04:51.000> an

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
and then we just put on a tab so just an

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.409 
and then we just put on a tab so just an
asset<00:04:51.600> else<00:04:52.500> that<00:04:52.800> spinning<00:04:55.940> what<00:04:56.940> we<00:04:57.150> should

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
asset else that spinning what we should

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.840 
asset else that spinning what we should
do<00:05:00.590> well<00:05:01.590> where<00:05:01.770> I<00:05:01.800> pushed<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.460> in<00:05:02.550> far<00:05:02.820> enough

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
do well where I pushed it in far enough

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.390 
do well where I pushed it in far enough
that's<00:05:03.300> fine

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
that's fine

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.900 
that's fine

from<00:05:50.610> spinning<00:05:51.319> and<00:05:52.319> set<00:05:52.499> this<00:05:52.740> scanner<00:05:54.050> now

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
from spinning and set this scanner now

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.010 
from spinning and set this scanner now
we<00:05:55.110> get<00:05:55.379> back<00:05:55.409> up<00:05:56.419> you<00:05:57.419> want<00:05:57.599> to<00:05:57.689> be<00:05:57.779> careful

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
not to damage it so if you put your

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.929 
not to damage it so if you put your
finger<00:05:59.789> in<00:05:59.909> the<00:05:59.999> middle<00:06:00.330> and<00:06:01.259> push<00:06:01.800> down<00:06:02.159> on<00:06:02.490> to

finger in the middle and push down on to

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:07.040 
finger in the middle and push down on to
a<00:06:02.969> bit<00:06:03.300> up<00:06:03.449> spinning<00:06:04.580> what<00:06:05.599> stops<00:06:06.599> it<00:06:06.870> right

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
a bit up spinning what stops it right

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.059 
a bit up spinning what stops it right
keep<00:06:07.499> spinning

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:08.069 
keep spinning

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.050 
keep spinning
now<00:06:08.870> and<00:06:09.870> then<00:06:10.229> Anya<00:06:10.710> just<00:06:11.189> simply<00:06:11.580> press<00:06:11.819> X

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
now and then Anya just simply press X

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:19.850 
now and then Anya just simply press X
oops<00:06:14.629> okay<00:06:16.249> and<00:06:17.419> just<00:06:18.419> play<00:06:18.689> as<00:06:19.259> if<00:06:19.560> it<00:06:19.710> were<00:06:19.830> a

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
oops okay and just play as if it were a

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:28.950 
oops okay and just play as if it were a
normal<00:06:20.249> disk

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.129 

and<00:06:29.500> there<00:06:29.710> we<00:06:29.830> go<00:06:30.120> you<00:06:31.120> back<00:06:31.300> up<00:06:31.330> young

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
and there we go you back up young

and there we go you back up young
so<00:06:32.919> hopefully<00:06:33.250> the<00:06:33.550> sense<00:06:33.790> of<00:06:33.940> three<00:06:34.180> should

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
so hopefully the sense of three should
