world cyber like series here there the
games<00:01:27.159> itself<00:01:28.229> were<00:01:29.229> some<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.799> best

starcraft<00:01:30.670> games<00:01:30.909> that<00:01:31.119> i<00:01:31.180> think<00:01:31.450> i've<00:01:31.630> ever

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
starcraft games that i think i've ever

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.710 
starcraft games that i think i've ever
seen<00:01:32.560> they<00:01:33.549> were<00:01:33.610> just<00:01:33.940> unbelievably

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
seen they were just unbelievably

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.690 
seen they were just unbelievably
exceptional<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.619> right<00:01:36.040> now<00:01:36.159> we<00:01:36.220> got<00:01:36.430> cheese

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
exceptional and right now we got cheese

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.280 
exceptional and right now we got cheese
on<00:01:36.940> cheese<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:37.509> though<00:01:37.570> flash<00:01:37.810> got<00:01:38.080> in<00:01:38.170> here

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
on cheese and though flash got in here

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.170 
on cheese and though flash got in here
really<00:01:38.560> early<00:01:38.590> he's<00:01:39.280> actually<00:01:39.520> behind<00:01:39.940> in<00:01:40.119> his

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
really early he's actually behind in his

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.120 
really early he's actually behind in his
barracks<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.750> there's<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.229> second<00:01:41.770> barracks

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
barracks and there's a second barracks

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.609 
barracks and there's a second barracks
going<00:01:42.520> down<00:01:42.670> for<00:01:42.850> innovation<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.409> I'm<00:01:44.470> going

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
going down for innovation so I'm going

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.859 
going down for innovation so I'm going
to<00:01:44.649> see<00:01:44.890> in<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.040> moment<00:01:45.240> who<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.390> cheese<00:01:46.690> is

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
to see in a moment who is cheese is

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.240 
to see in a moment who is cheese is
better<00:01:47.080> set<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.560> would<00:01:47.680> have<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:48.009> say<00:01:48.040> that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
better set and I would have to say that

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.310 
better set and I would have to say that
all<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.549> innovations<00:01:49.119> position<00:01:49.540> better<00:01:49.750> if

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
all the innovations position better if

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.960 
all the innovations position better if
only<00:01:50.740> because<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.280> barracks<00:01:51.640> was<00:01:51.789> down

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
only because this barracks was down

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.910 
only because this barracks was down
first<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.840> looks<00:01:53.140> like<00:01:53.200> you'll<00:01:53.380> probably<00:01:53.679> be

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
first it looks like you'll probably be

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.290 
first it looks like you'll probably be
going<00:01:54.130> for<00:01:54.250> just<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.460> marine<00:01:54.700> push<00:01:54.940> whereas

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
going for just a marine push whereas

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.899 
going for just a marine push whereas
will<00:01:55.450> likely<00:01:55.630> have<00:01:55.899> Reapers<00:01:56.909> Prudential

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
will likely have Reapers Prudential

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.669 
will likely have Reapers Prudential

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
much I like mojitos and bunker down for

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.059 
much I like mojitos and bunker down for
a<00:02:15.790> whole<00:02:16.000> bunch<00:02:16.239> of<00:02:16.360> casting<00:02:19.769> now<00:02:20.769> we<00:02:20.830> do<00:02:21.040> have

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
a whole bunch of casting now we do have

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.150 
a whole bunch of casting now we do have
the<00:02:21.760> first<00:02:22.000> marine<00:02:22.239> already<00:02:22.570> on<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.750> way

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
the first marine already on the way

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.750 
the first marine already on the way
flash<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.400> still<00:02:24.430> making<00:02:24.730> his<00:02:24.910> tech<00:02:25.120> lab<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.610> I

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
flash is still making his tech lab and I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.009 
flash is still making his tech lab and I
think<00:02:27.970> he's<00:02:28.060> going<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.269> know<00:02:28.420> pretty<00:02:28.810> darn

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
think he's going to know pretty darn

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.690 
think he's going to know pretty darn
quick<00:02:29.350> with<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.590> heck's<00:02:29.799> happening<00:02:30.010> here<00:02:30.519> and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
quick with the heck's happening here and

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.479 
quick with the heck's happening here and
how<00:02:31.360> much<00:02:31.540> trouble<00:02:31.810> he's<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.170> we<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
how much trouble he's in we have the

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.699 
how much trouble he's in we have the
worker<00:02:33.700> pole<00:02:34.060> though<00:02:34.989> I<00:02:35.019> don't<00:02:35.200> really<00:02:35.500> know

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
worker pole though I don't really know

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.840 
worker pole though I don't really know
what<00:02:35.829> this<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.100> going<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.250> hope<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.579> accomplish

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
what this is going to hope to accomplish

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.210 
what this is going to hope to accomplish
he'd<00:02:37.840> be<00:02:37.930> better<00:02:38.049> off<00:02:38.200> like<00:02:38.650> just<00:02:38.680> maybe

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
he'd be better off like just maybe

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.650 
he'd be better off like just maybe
pulling<00:02:39.549> all<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.760> his<00:02:39.910> workers<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.299> come<00:02:40.510> down

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
pulling all of his workers to come down

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.960 
pulling all of his workers to come down
here<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.870> support<00:02:41.260> his<00:02:41.410> Marauders<00:02:41.950> at<00:02:42.730> this

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
here and support his Marauders at this

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.320 
here and support his Marauders at this
stage<00:02:43.269> Oh<00:02:43.829> lots<00:02:44.829> of<00:02:44.920> workers

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.680 

at<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:48.600> stage<00:02:48.840> flash<00:02:49.350> pretty

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
at this stage flash pretty

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.910 
at this stage flash pretty
uh<00:02:52.300> yeah<00:02:53.740> yeah<00:02:55.030> one<00:02:56.030> more<00:02:56.210> water<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.660> worker

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
uh yeah yeah one more water and a worker

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.510 
uh yeah yeah one more water and a worker
against<00:02:57.920> just<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.880> small<00:02:59.510> pile<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.810> workers

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
against just a small pile of workers

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.870 
against just a small pile of workers
that's<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:01.910> funny

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.450 

the<00:03:05.780> problem<00:03:06.290> is<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:07.450> flash<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.750> blind

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
the problem is that flash is blind

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.330 
the problem is that flash is blind
substantially<00:03:10.460> in<00:03:10.930> units<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:12.290> supplied<00:03:12.800> lock

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
substantially in units is supplied lock

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.470 
substantially in units is supplied lock
you<00:03:14.550> see<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.970> there's<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.209> supply<00:03:15.360> depot

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
you see that there's a supply depot

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.089 
you see that there's a supply depot
going<00:03:15.900> down<00:03:16.019> innovation<00:03:16.500> over<00:03:16.680> here<00:03:16.890> where

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
going down innovation over here where

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.360 
going down innovation over here where
are<00:03:17.640> available<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.150> spend

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.830 

I<00:03:21.459> don't<00:03:22.180> know<00:03:22.299> if<00:03:22.390> he's<00:03:22.510> going<00:03:22.629> to<00:03:22.690> get<00:03:22.780> away

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
I don't know if he's going to get away

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.789 
I don't know if he's going to get away
with<00:03:22.989> this<00:03:23.140> command<00:03:23.500> center<00:03:25.290> pray<00:03:26.290> smart<00:03:26.650> move

by from flash to kill any of the supply
depots<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.140> now<00:03:32.140> he<00:03:32.200> can't<00:03:32.530> actually<00:03:32.769> even

shoot necessarily add to this let's take
the<00:03:38.650> command<00:03:38.920> center<00:03:39.069> will<00:03:39.370> just<00:03:39.879> barely<00:03:40.180> get

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
the command center will just barely get

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.289 
the command center will just barely get
away<00:03:41.099> this<00:03:42.099> is<00:03:42.280> really<00:03:42.519> funny<00:03:42.730> actually<00:03:42.940> I'm

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299

find this extremely hilarious both those

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.819 
find this extremely hilarious both those
barracks<00:03:45.099> gonna<00:03:45.250> float<00:03:45.489> over<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:46.560> don't<00:03:47.560> think

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
barracks gonna float over I don't think

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.530 
barracks gonna float over I don't think
he's<00:03:48.069> got<00:03:48.370> enough<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.940> two<00:03:49.150> Marauders

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
he's got enough the two Marauders

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.089 
he's got enough the two Marauders
themselves<00:03:50.019> wouldn't<00:03:50.319> be<00:03:50.409> enough<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.739> take<00:03:50.920> on

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
themselves wouldn't be enough to take on

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.420 
themselves wouldn't be enough to take on
this<00:03:55.379> if<00:03:56.379> you<00:03:56.560> manage<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:56.920> shoot<00:03:57.010> down<00:03:57.310> the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
this if you manage to shoot down the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.699 
this if you manage to shoot down the
command<00:03:57.700> center<00:03:57.910> with<00:03:58.120> an<00:03:58.269> Marine<00:03:58.840> yeah<00:03:59.500> maybe

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
command center with an Marine yeah maybe

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.280 
command center with an Marine yeah maybe
things<00:03:59.950> would<00:04:00.040> be<00:04:00.129> different<00:04:01.049> command<00:04:02.049> center

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
things would be different command center

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.390 
things would be different command center
will<00:04:02.470> get<00:04:02.620> down<00:04:02.769> here<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.040> actually<00:04:03.160> start

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
will get down here and actually start

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.000 
will get down here and actually start
making<00:04:03.700> money<00:04:03.989> but<00:04:04.989> I'll<00:04:05.379> shoot<00:04:05.799> these

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
making money but I'll shoot these

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.770 
making money but I'll shoot these
Marauders<00:04:06.340> are<00:04:06.519> just<00:04:06.700> hope<00:04:06.849> you're<00:04:07.599> going<00:04:07.690> to

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
get surrounded way too easy and flash is

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.899 
get surrounded way too easy and flash is
just<00:04:11.739> going<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:11.920> lose<00:04:12.099> essentially<00:04:12.730> right

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
just going to lose essentially right

here try to block with his own SUVs but
once<00:04:19.030> these<00:04:19.120> Marauders<00:04:19.449> are<00:04:19.630> surrounded

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
once these Marauders are surrounded

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.440 
once these Marauders are surrounded
they're<00:04:21.130> done<00:04:21.310> gets<00:04:21.910> one<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.270> them

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.790 

yeah<00:04:24.600> that's<00:04:25.110> a--that's<00:04:25.620> pretty<00:04:25.830> much<00:04:26.010> TV

maybe<00:04:27.629> positioning<00:04:28.629> was<00:04:28.750> better<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.259> have<00:04:29.349> a

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
maybe positioning was better to have a

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.490 
maybe positioning was better to have a
chance<00:04:29.710> but<00:04:30.210> anywho<00:04:31.210> really<00:04:31.629> fast<00:04:31.870> quick
