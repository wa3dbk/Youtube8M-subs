 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.750
 video of winning I am patricia and I bring you 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.150
 a new top 10 today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.219
 I bring a top 10 of the books that most 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.660
 they made me cry I really wanted to 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.190
 make this video because I am very 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.710
 sensitive and normally the books I 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.930
 they make me cry a lot so I wanted to 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.939
 do it for the same reason but with 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.670
 a majority of the books that he reads to me 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.090
 some lagrimilla falls but today I come to you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.039
 to talk about those who made me cry 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.810
 very much base of the first top 10 that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.030
 dance in order of position number 10 to 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.829
 placed number 1 so I hope that you 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.350
 like it a lot and we're going to start at 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.559
 placed number 10 we have a legal 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.020
 veronica rice and if this book made me 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.690
 I was but I think because of the spoiler 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.059
 what they did to me, I did not feel it as much as 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.500
 it felt other people cried I was 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.879
 impossible, I was not from that moment, 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.190
 feel bad and feel frustrated but 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.960
 I did not feel the same as other people 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.420
 because they made me the spoiler and I 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.270
 they annoyed quite the end of the book 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.309
 he was very sorry for the end that he has 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.040
 that I put him in the position number 10 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.500
 put number nine we have the ramp 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.240
 from rimbaud rowing this book and the truth 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.310
 that it was a roller coaster of emotions I 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.799
 It made me feel a lot and it broke 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.100
 quite the heart with the end could not 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.039
 avoid releasing more than one tear was 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.759
 quite painful and quite cruel and 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:29.729
 real and raw at the same time it was all a 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.320
 explosion of feelings and the truth 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.390
 that it is impossible not to cry with 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.490
 outside so that's why the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.600
 position number 9 in position number 8 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.060
 we meet 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.830
 in the door next to hand late 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.810
 fitzpatrick is a book that I just 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.299
 finish reading very recently and from 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.009
 I assure you that a moment is 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.080
 lack of intention that was suffered 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.849
 so much that I could not help but cry 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.390
 seas but dark I cried enough 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:56.310
 when I did not feel super bad reading 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.740
 I see them for god why is it happening 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.899
 this can not be so painful a 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.689
 part of the book the truth that I felt 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.459
 impotence rage and that's what she cried and so 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.549
 that undoubtedly that's why the 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.130
 position number 8 in position number 7 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.470
 we are where 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.820
 trees sing 'de laura gallego creo 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.450
 that is one of the books with the 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.560
 most impressive final beautiful and 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.080
 wonderful that I have read in my life 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.780
 so much that he could not help but cry with that 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.400
 end each time so precious and at the same time 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.560
 so bitter a book totally 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.200
 recommended if you have not read it in the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.990
 put number 6 we are at a 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.760
 son of alejandro pigeons with this book 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.770
 I could not help but cry with the end 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.780
 also I was already seeing it coming 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.940
 but it is impossible when you realize 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.220
 of all of how Alexander tells it is 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.430
 impossible not to shed tears or is it 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.980
 impossible not to get excited is impossible 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.080
 feel nothing with this book because it is 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.440
 wonderful above I was lucky to 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.910
 meet Alejandro doves and that we 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.590
 take a step beyond the book and that we 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.330
 they explain a lot more things than what 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.220
 there is behind this book it made me feel 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.600
 very much and I would like very much that 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.460
 all read them if you have the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.560
 opportunity because it's wonderful vale 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.630
 we are already entering swampy terrain 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.390
 we enter the top 5 and with all these 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.130
 books and cried a lot be very much 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.690
 I will say it many times but with 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.480
 these 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.150
 and there have even been some who give me 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.300
 as almost an attack but well let's 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.670
 it in the position number 5 we have to me 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.410
 before yoyo moyes is a book 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.440
 perfect is a wonderful book is a 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.580
 precious book has everything I think it is 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.210
 of the best that there has been in all my 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.160
 life and it made me cry too much 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.610
 I swear when I tell you I was at 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.310
 final was horrible but at the same time it was 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.170
 wonderful and I recommend it very much 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.300
 If you want to know what it is about 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.520
 exactly I leave it in the iv I made a 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.830
 review a long time ago for the channel itself 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.740
 you are interested to see it in the position number 4 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.420
 we are prohibited from talita its zoom to 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.030
 Esteban just broke my heart 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.130
 He broke whole and I wanted to die after 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.620
 to read this book among a kind of 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.650
 trance between a kind of depression 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.290
 they want to pose is mine because this 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.480
 author has done what she has done to me 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.950
 my poor heart but this book is 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.020
 made for everyone but me without 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.510
 I doubt you always and without hesitation 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.680
 sure they are exposed number four 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.310
 of 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.350
 in position number 3 we have to under the 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.699
 same star of john green is a book 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.370
 that you can not miss in this kind of 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:31.419
 videos because it 's reading it and it's impossible 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.280
 do not cry it 's impossible not to get inside 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.259
 of this and feel empathy with the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.360
 characters and feel how they feel 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.550
 them and for that reason I made myself suffer 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.050
 so much but at the same time I enjoyed 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.229
 very much and I laughed a lot with this book 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.630
 but cry that I could not miss and 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.340
 is in the ranking of the three books 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.370
 What else have made me cry how beautiful 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.650
 is at number two we have a 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.620
 harry potter and the relics of the 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.190
 death by jk rowling this book as ya 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.800
 you know a lot is a deathless 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.259
 after death after death after death and 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.229
 bad things I already read it I knew that at 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.460
 final I knew that what was happening was not 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.080
 I was going to have a solution 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.330
 and the truth that this book is 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.669
 suffer a lot I cried a lot so much 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.800
 for the deaths like because in the end like that 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.690
 which has a well-deserved number 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.030
 two because this one I not only cried with a 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.080
 done in particular I have a lot of 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.229
 events that take place 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.479
 during the 636 pages that you have like this 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.970
 that you can imagine my grief 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:34.419
 with this book and every time I read it 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:38.439
 I cry so it's inevitable and in the 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.560
 put number one the book that has most 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:43.750
 made me cry all my life and that 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.009
 I prefer not to think about it because of thinking 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:51.699
 in what happens in the weeping I assure you 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:53.800
 is in sage by susan collins this book 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.469
 it broke my heart susan collins 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:01.569
 he caught my heart he ripped it from my chest 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:03.940
 he crushed it he threw it to the ground he trampled it and 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.190
 then swept the little steps that were left 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.169
 and I threw it in the trash so I stayed 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.000
 heartless because it me 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:13.120
 love these to use in him but at the same time 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.240
 I do not like it especially for certain things 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.120
 that happen in the end without a doubt with this book 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.580
 is that I think about it and I cry that I do not 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.039
 I do not even want to think about it because I get 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.229
 sick and that's why he takes the job 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.790
 number one because still in us 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.950
 I remember them 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.260
 I do not want to cry but in this 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.580
 remembering certain things they give me 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.040
 I want to cry 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.620
 so sense jose takes the position 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.080
 number 1 because until now the 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.790
 today's ranking I would like very much to me

 I say I 'm pretty whiny and could 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.090
 put many more that have made me 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.700
 cry but well these are the ones that 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:56.830
