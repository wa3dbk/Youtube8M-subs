00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.460
 Ganchito HernÃ¡ndez the main objective 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.860
 of this tournament that was to save the 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.370
 descent is already goal accomplished 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.080
 you can dream now with the rise 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.450
 good look personally still not 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.920
 the equipment is practically saved 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.550
 I think Friday is a match 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.520
 difficult where we can say if it is 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.949
 fulfills the objective of saving us and of 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.410
 tie the line not from there winning the 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.230
 Friday I think it's worth dreaming I do not know 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.970
 It is worth to hope, it is worth and hope 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.040
 because I think we have a team the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.440
 tournament is for any team 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.269
 there is no team that marks the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.640
 Unlike as in other tournaments that 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.430
 did a lion a roadrunner then 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.559
 it seems that thinking about salvation or 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.579
 taking out salvation gives us for 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.969
 to delude ourselves and to heal 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.699
 in defense we are solid that only 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.379
 I give it to the whole team all the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.479
 team has the credit to defend us 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.860
 well and forward have had not had 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.979
 and they've gotten him that's very 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.840
 important but I think the team is 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.759
 characterized by its order by the claw 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.549
 for the delivery you have for the 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.049
 concentration that we have maintained all 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.729
 the parties and I think we have to 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.950
 continue working and improving those 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.920
 aspects how they are prepared cited 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.080
 mentally for each game if as I 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.840
 you say it's a team or a 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.270
 very large institution that represents it 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.030
 in Mexican football then this is that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.950
 It gives you greater commitment despite of 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.679
 that is footballistically knows the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 history of the university that is this 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.729
 a big boom in the city and in everything 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.090
 the country not then I think you have to 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.670
 assimilate that commitment you have to know 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.000
 defend the colors and good that you 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.009
 you prepare working at the mentalized one hundred 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.479
 and every game you never see what 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.810
 what's going to happen is what's going to 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.350
 happen you see yourself with shortcuts you see 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.689
 keeping the bow 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.000
 and that motivates you is not motivated by 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.560
 visualization to be able in the match 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.420
 in carrying it with the greatest seriousness 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.160
 respecting the ritual and doing his best 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.959
 effort and everyone contributing their 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.730
 little grain of sand that you would say to the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.730
 I think it's about time that the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.470
 jalisco good as they say cynics 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.930
 bad results is not what caused 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.450
 that people move away from the stadium 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.239
 will go away every Friday but I do not think 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.190
 that now we have not won it 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.510
 We have shown match game at home 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.280
 we would not have wanted to lose 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.170
 against veracruz is the party that 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.630
 It cost and it hurt a lot because it was in 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.519
 house as I tell you but I think that as you 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.560
 I ask you to tell them to be delighted 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.019
 world with us that we are very close 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.580
 of salvation and of qualification and 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.230
 dream they dream that this is a 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.290
 big team we want to make it big 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.910
 that we players are 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.190
 emphasized and mentalized for 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.080
 try to qualify first will go to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.450
 champion and then ascend we go step 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.209
 step by step then I ask for your support 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.950
 Friday at half past eight they are 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.510
 against wolves supporting us to the fullest 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.959
 that we are going to commit to 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.959
 leave with 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.680
 in favor
