the<00:03:18.460> open<00:03:19.270> circle<00:03:19.720> or<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.230> X<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:23.290> can<00:03:23.470> invert

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
the open circle or the X you can invert

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.500 
the open circle or the X you can invert
this<00:03:26.520> there's<00:03:27.520> an<00:03:27.700> outline<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.090> goes<00:03:28.390> around

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
this there's an outline that goes around

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.940 
this there's an outline that goes around
here<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:28.960> don't<00:03:28.990> see<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.410> right<00:03:29.590> now<00:03:29.770> because

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
here you don't see it right now because

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.830 
here you don't see it right now because
there's<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.310> black<00:03:30.490> background<00:03:30.760> but<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:34.120> you

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
there's a black background but and you

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.610 
there's a black background but and you
can<00:03:34.990> adjust<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.560> size<00:03:35.770> with<00:03:36.460> this<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.470> like<00:03:38.470> I

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
can adjust the size with this and like I

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.860 
can adjust the size with this and like I
said<00:03:38.680> you<00:03:39.010> can<00:03:39.190> position<00:03:39.580> this<00:03:39.910> on<00:03:40.240> the<00:03:40.660> screen

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
said you can position this on the screen

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.790 
said you can position this on the screen
now<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.230> recommendation<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.490> create<00:03:43.330> one

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
now the recommendation is you create one

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.560 
now the recommendation is you create one
position<00:03:44.800> it<00:03:45.130> size<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.380> then<00:03:47.380> option<00:03:48.570> drag

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
position it size it and then option drag

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:57.240 
position it size it and then option drag
a<00:03:49.600> copy<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:51.220> create<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.760> next<00:03:52.000> one<00:03:53.460> then<00:03:56.250> use

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
a copy to create the next one then use

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.150 
a copy to create the next one then use
the<00:03:57.460> chord<00:03:57.760> progression<00:03:58.300> if<00:03:58.510> you<00:03:58.660> have<00:03:58.870> it<00:03:59.160> to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
the chord progression if you have it to

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.730 
the chord progression if you have it to
do<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.460> next<00:04:00.670> chord<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.750> draw<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.350> out<00:04:02.470> and

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
do the next chord and draw it out and

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.020 
do the next chord and draw it out and
then<00:04:03.040> after<00:04:03.910> you<00:04:04.000> get<00:04:04.590> your<00:04:05.590> initial<00:04:06.490> chords

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
then after you get your initial chords

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.880 
then after you get your initial chords
done<00:04:07.240> you<00:04:07.420> can<00:04:07.570> option<00:04:07.870> drag<00:04:07.990> copies<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.740> them

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
done you can option drag copies of them

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.760 
done you can option drag copies of them
into<00:04:09.130> place<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.900> that's<00:04:10.900> about<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.320> fastest

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
into place and that's about the fastest

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.310 
into place and that's about the fastest
workflow<00:04:12.280> that<00:04:13.090> I've<00:04:13.240> been<00:04:13.600> able<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:13.930> come<00:04:14.110> up

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
workflow that I've been able to come up

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.820 
workflow that I've been able to come up
with<00:04:15.180> now<00:04:16.180> for<00:04:16.209> version<00:04:16.840> 2<00:04:17.109> slightly

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
with now for version 2 slightly

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.380 
with now for version 2 slightly
different<00:04:18.780> version<00:04:19.780> 2<00:04:19.959> has<00:04:21.390> on-screen

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
different version 2 has on-screen

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.770 
different version 2 has on-screen
controls<00:04:22.720> for<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:24.600> positions<00:04:25.600> here<00:04:27.600> it<00:04:28.600> has

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
controls for the positions here it has

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:37.830 
controls for the positions here it has
this<00:04:28.990> kind<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.500> bar<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:30.960> notation<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:36.840> the

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
this kind of bar a notation and the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.670 
this kind of bar a notation and the
number<00:04:38.170> of<00:04:38.320> strings<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:39.190> adjusted<00:04:39.760> here<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:41.470> if

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
number of strings is adjusted here so if

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.500 
number of strings is adjusted here so if
you've<00:04:41.860> got<00:04:42.010> light

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:56.840 

and<00:04:48.500> we'll<00:04:49.250> do<00:04:49.430> say<00:04:50.020> three

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.760 

and<00:04:57.330> you<00:04:57.600> can<00:04:57.750> just<00:04:57.900> drag<00:04:58.140> us<00:04:58.380> into<00:04:58.650> position

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
and you can just drag us into position

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.640 
and you can just drag us into position
like<00:04:59.160> this

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.040 

the<00:05:03.979> problem<00:05:04.310> with<00:05:04.490> this<00:05:04.639> one<00:05:04.879> is<00:05:04.909> these<00:05:05.780> don't

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
the problem with this one is these don't

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.129 
the problem with this one is these don't
automatically<00:05:06.740> align<00:05:07.069> perfectly<00:05:07.629> so<00:05:08.629> just<00:05:08.990> a

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
automatically align perfectly so just a

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.760 
automatically align perfectly so just a
few<00:05:09.919> little<00:05:10.069> hints<00:05:10.960> how<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.020> get<00:05:12.199> this<00:05:12.319> working

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
few little hints how to get this working

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.249 
few little hints how to get this working
this<00:05:13.009> is<00:05:13.190> pretty<00:05:13.460> fast<00:05:13.729> if<00:05:14.090> you<00:05:14.300> set<00:05:14.990> up<00:05:15.139> all

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
this is pretty fast if you set up all

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.159 
this is pretty fast if you set up all
your<00:05:15.409> cords<00:05:15.680> first<00:05:16.039> you<00:05:16.220> can<00:05:16.370> do<00:05:16.490> about<00:05:17.139> 24<00:05:18.139> or

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
your cords first you can do about 24 or

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.050 
your cords first you can do about 24 or
25<00:05:18.949> cords<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:20.470> then<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:22.460> easiest<00:05:22.819> thing<00:05:23.030> to

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
25 cords and then the easiest thing to

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.890 
25 cords and then the easiest thing to
do<00:05:23.270> is<00:05:23.419> just<00:05:23.860> option<00:05:24.860> drag<00:05:25.159> out<00:05:25.430> copies<00:05:26.180> that

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
do is just option drag out copies that

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.960 
do is just option drag out copies that
are<00:05:27.080> in<00:05:27.349> the<00:05:27.530> same<00:05:27.740> place<00:05:28.039> and<00:05:28.400> create<00:05:28.819> the

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
are in the same place and create the

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.059 
are in the same place and create the
next<00:05:29.150> cord

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
next cord

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.529 
next cord
once<00:05:31.069> you<00:05:31.190> get<00:05:31.310> your<00:05:31.490> progression<00:05:31.849> made<00:05:32.210> then

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
once you get your progression made then

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.510 
once you get your progression made then
you<00:05:32.659> can<00:05:32.840> do<00:05:33.199> multiple<00:05:33.710> copies<00:05:33.919> of<00:05:34.930> the

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
you can do multiple copies of the

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.300 
you can do multiple copies of the
generator<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:37.849> then<00:05:38.090> drag<00:05:38.389> them<00:05:38.629> out<00:05:39.099> for<00:05:40.099> the

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
generator and then drag them out for the

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.490 
generator and then drag them out for the
entire<00:05:40.849> progression<00:05:41.120> and<00:05:41.659> then<00:05:41.840> just<00:05:42.080> you

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
entire progression and then just you

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.709 
entire progression and then just you
know<00:05:42.639> move<00:05:43.639> them<00:05:43.789> around<00:05:43.909> and<00:05:44.330> match<00:05:44.509> them

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:44.719 
know move them around and match them

00:05:44.719 --> 00:06:09.130 
know move them around and match them
with<00:05:44.750> the<00:05:45.020> time<00:05:45.860> of<00:05:46.009> the<00:05:46.099> music
