00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
ninis shared NS used a form so let's go

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.520 
ninis shared NS used a form so let's go
to<00:02:17.070> our<00:02:17.130> iOS<00:02:17.580> app<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:17.940> build<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.780> really<00:02:19.170> simple

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
to our iOS app and build a really simple

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.850 
to our iOS app and build a really simple
little<00:02:20.000> interface<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.320> text<00:02:22.320> field<00:02:22.530> we're

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
little interface so text field we're

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.760 
little interface so text field we're
going<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.070> just<00:02:23.310> store<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.850> text<00:02:24.630> piece<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.470> text

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
going to just store a text piece of text

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.650 
going to just store a text piece of text
so<00:02:25.830> let's<00:02:26.220> put<00:02:26.400> our<00:02:26.490> text<00:02:26.760> field<00:02:26.940> in<00:02:27.030> there<00:02:27.180> and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
so let's put our text field in there and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
so let's put our text field in there and
let's<00:02:28.380> put<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> button<00:02:32.180> open<00:02:33.180> up<00:02:33.680> assistant

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
let's put a button open up assistant

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.480 
let's put a button open up assistant
editor<00:02:35.060> close<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.620> bring<00:02:37.980> our<00:02:38.130> text

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
editor close that so bring our text

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:47.270 
editor close that so bring our text
field<00:02:38.810> available<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.870> make<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.590> function<00:02:46.890> for

thing<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:12.990> let's<00:03:13.320> first<00:03:13.620> create<00:03:14.130> our<00:03:14.640> shared

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
thing so let's first create our shared

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:28.009 
thing so let's first create our shared
use<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.570> big<00:03:15.810> file<00:03:16.020> so<00:03:16.650> let<00:03:17.090> shared<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:26.810> if<00:03:27.810> you

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
use a big file so let shared and if you

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.920 
use a big file so let shared and if you
use<00:03:28.200> nsuserdefaults<00:03:28.709> for<00:03:29.400> now<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:30.390> can't

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
use nsuserdefaults for now I can't

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.990 
use nsuserdefaults for now I can't
remember<00:03:31.019> it's<00:03:31.350> cold<00:03:31.560> but<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:32.850> to

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
remember it's cold but you have to

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.210 
remember it's cold but you have to
declare<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.810> first<00:03:34.110> which<00:03:34.890> is<00:03:35.010> what<00:03:35.130> I'm

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
declare this first which is what I'm

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.130 
declare this first which is what I'm
doing<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.610> when<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.330> open<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.690> bracket

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
doing and when you open that bracket

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.920 
doing and when you open that bracket
comes<00:03:37.560> up<00:03:37.769> with<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.010> options<00:03:38.540> sweet<00:03:39.540> named

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
comes up with the options sweet named

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.530 
comes up with the options sweet named
sweet<00:03:40.590> yes<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.459> know<00:03:41.580> it's<00:03:41.730> not<00:03:41.850> sweet<00:03:42.239> sweet

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
sweet yes I know it's not sweet sweet

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.440 
sweet yes I know it's not sweet sweet
it's<00:03:42.720> new<00:03:43.320> aspect<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:44.340> here<00:03:44.640> we<00:03:45.090> want<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.239> put

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
it's new aspect in here we want to put

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.250 
it's new aspect in here we want to put
the<00:03:45.750> name<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.260> your<00:03:46.680> app<00:03:47.640> group<00:03:48.510> which<00:03:48.959> is<00:03:49.080> the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
the name of your app group which is the

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.960 
the name of your app group which is the
container<00:03:49.590> where<00:03:50.280> your<00:03:50.400> information<00:03:50.880> is

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
container where your information is

00:03:50.970 --> 00:04:07.640 
container where your information is
stored<00:03:51.269> that's<00:03:51.900> shared<00:03:52.280> so<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:06.660> this<00:04:07.080> is<00:04:07.290> our

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
stored that's shared so so this is our

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.949 
stored that's shared so so this is our
access<00:04:08.100> point<00:04:08.400> for<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:09.090> shared<00:04:09.450> container

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
access point for that shared container

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.710 
access point for that shared container
so<00:04:10.799> that's<00:04:11.040> when<00:04:11.940> this<00:04:12.030> function<00:04:12.209> runs<00:04:12.540> we're

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
so that's when this function runs we're

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.350 
so that's when this function runs we're
going<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.900> want<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.230> put<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:14.060> text<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.299> she

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
going to want to put a text so she

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.580 
going to want to put a text so she
shared<00:04:17.120> dot<00:04:18.200> set<00:04:19.430> object<00:04:20.430> for<00:04:20.850> K<00:04:21.500> we're<00:04:22.500> gonna

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
shared dot set object for K we're gonna

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.390 
shared dot set object for K we're gonna
set<00:04:23.010> our<00:04:23.160> object<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.880> text<00:04:24.180> field<00:04:24.979> text

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
set our object is the text field text

you<00:04:36.060> just<00:04:36.300> want<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.600> synchronize<00:04:39.020> so<00:04:40.020> that's

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
you just want to synchronize so that's

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.710 
you just want to synchronize so that's

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
soon as it use defaults before you'd

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.279 
soon as it use defaults before you'd
know<00:05:46.710> you<00:05:46.770> yeah<00:05:47.960> you'd<00:05:48.960> use<00:05:49.229> object<00:05:49.979> for<00:05:50.310> K<00:05:50.580> so

we're going to go I'm gonna set people's
this<00:05:59.940> is<00:06:00.060> probably<00:06:00.419> more<00:06:01.349> than<00:06:01.500> necessary

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
this is probably more than necessary

test<00:06:25.320> run<00:06:25.530> our<00:06:25.650> app<00:06:25.800> so<00:06:26.460> iOS<00:06:26.880> app<00:06:27.180> comes<00:06:27.449> up

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.910 

that's<00:06:31.110> right<00:06:31.470> something

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
that's right something

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.860 
that's right something
and<00:06:33.920> button<00:06:34.250> so<00:06:34.610> that<00:06:34.760> button<00:06:35.120> saves<00:06:35.480> it<00:06:35.690> in

button there it loads our text something

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.550 
button there it loads our text something
which<00:06:46.100> is<00:06:46.370> from<00:06:47.000> that<00:06:47.120> shared<00:06:47.420> container<00:06:47.810> so

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
which is from that shared container so

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.200 
which is from that shared container so
hopefully<00:06:48.920> that<00:06:49.100> shows<00:06:49.340> you<00:06:49.550> an<00:06:49.730> example<00:06:50.030> of

hopefully that shows you an example of
