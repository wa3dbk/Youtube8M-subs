00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.249 

you<00:01:21.610> just<00:01:21.820> do<00:01:21.939> if<00:01:22.119> they<00:01:22.270> search<00:01:22.509> you<00:01:22.960> know<00:01:23.079> the

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
you just do if they search you know the

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.560 
you just do if they search you know the
shape<00:01:23.469> continues<00:01:24.189> over<00:01:24.490> here<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:25.360> looks

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
shape continues over here it looks

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.749 
shape continues over here it looks
better<00:01:25.719> market<00:01:27.180> that's<00:01:28.180> your<00:01:28.329> choice<00:01:31.049> and

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
better market that's your choice and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.819 
better market that's your choice and
this<00:01:33.759> is<00:01:33.909> gonna<00:01:34.030> be<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.270> door<00:01:34.570> so<00:01:35.289> I<00:01:35.590> don't
