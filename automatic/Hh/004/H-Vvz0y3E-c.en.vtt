00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.539 
apart and then together keeping your
hips<00:03:26.019> up<00:03:26.170> now<00:03:26.320> look<00:03:26.530> at<00:03:26.680> that's<00:03:26.769> perfect<00:03:27.370> keep

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
hips up now look at that's perfect keep

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.030 
hips up now look at that's perfect keep
going<00:03:27.940> she's<00:03:28.150> keeping<00:03:28.870> her<00:03:28.959> hips<00:03:29.200> up<00:03:29.500> so<00:03:29.739> she

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
going she's keeping her hips up so she

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.440 
going she's keeping her hips up so she
doesn't<00:03:30.370> let<00:03:30.430> her<00:03:30.549> butt<00:03:30.730> sink<00:03:31.000> down<00:03:31.209> that

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
doesn't let her butt sink down that

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.930 
doesn't let her butt sink down that
requires<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.930> lot<00:03:32.260> of<00:03:32.290> core<00:03:32.650> strength<00:03:32.940> good

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
requires a lot of core strength good

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.080 
requires a lot of core strength good
breathe<00:03:34.829> that's<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:36.070> so<00:03:36.280> again<00:03:36.430> we'll<00:03:36.940> go

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
breathe that's it so again we'll go

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.090 
breathe that's it so again we'll go
about<00:03:37.329> 30<00:03:37.660> seconds<00:03:38.200> with<00:03:38.350> these<00:03:38.500> intervals

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
about 30 seconds with these intervals

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.009 
about 30 seconds with these intervals
these<00:03:39.760> circuits<00:03:40.209> get<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.480> whole<00:03:40.750> body

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
these circuits get the whole body

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.810 
these circuits get the whole body
working<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.829> really<00:03:42.220> gets<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.549> inner

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
working that really gets the inner

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:52.320 
working that really gets the inner
thighs<00:03:43.320> nicely<00:03:50.459> okay<00:03:51.459> our<00:03:51.579> last<00:03:51.609> move<00:03:52.120> in<00:03:52.239> this

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
thighs nicely okay our last move in this

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.119 
thighs nicely okay our last move in this
circuit<00:03:52.690> is<00:03:52.810> gonna<00:03:52.959> be<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.140> Burpee<00:03:53.620> with<00:03:53.980> the

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
circuit is gonna be a Burpee with the

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.160 
circuit is gonna be a Burpee with the
gliders<00:03:54.580> okay<00:03:55.030> okay<00:03:55.239> so<00:03:55.300> this<00:03:55.510> is<00:03:55.690> awesome

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
gliders okay okay so this is awesome

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.119 
gliders okay okay so this is awesome
because<00:03:56.290> now<00:03:56.530> we're<00:03:56.650> using<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.920> piece<00:03:57.099> of

work with the whole group we go through
that<00:04:36.039> whole<00:04:36.280> circuit<00:04:36.700> again<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.210> then<00:04:37.479> we

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
that whole circuit again and then we

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:38.730 
that whole circuit again and then we
jump<00:04:37.780> on<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.020> treadmill<00:04:38.200> for<00:04:38.560> a<00:04:38.590> nice
