guys about that paracord put see how the
current<00:03:02.800> is<00:03:03.100> pulling<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.610> my<00:03:03.730> machine

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.160 

paracord<00:03:09.490> stops<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.180> from<00:03:10.210> going<00:03:10.540> downstream

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
paracord stops it from going downstream

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
and it also stops it from pulling on

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.740 
and it also stops it from pulling on
this

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750
