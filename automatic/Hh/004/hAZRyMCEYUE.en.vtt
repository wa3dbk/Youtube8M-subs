00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.800 
watch my videos in 720p just need a
basic<00:00:19.980> reaction<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:21.240> go<00:00:21.359> back<00:00:21.510> at<00:00:21.689> any

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
basic reaction I can go back at any

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.050 
basic reaction I can go back at any
point<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.230> very<00:00:22.410> difficult<00:00:22.640> anyway<00:00:23.640> without

a<00:00:28.640> giant<00:00:29.640> slime<00:00:29.880> farm<00:00:30.119> uses<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> pair<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.679> slime

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
a giant slime farm uses a pair of slime

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.950 
a giant slime farm uses a pair of slime
chunks<00:00:32.250> juice<00:00:32.550> lime<00:00:32.730> chunks<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.180> if<00:00:33.750> you

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
chunks juice lime chunks and if you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.319 
chunks juice lime chunks and if you
don't<00:00:34.140> know<00:00:34.430> slimes<00:00:35.430> will<00:00:35.700> only<00:00:35.820> spawn<00:00:36.120> in

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
don't know slimes will only spawn in

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.170 
don't know slimes will only spawn in
certain<00:00:36.630> chunks<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.320> yes<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.370> know<00:00:38.640> own<00:00:38.790> spawn

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
certain chunks so yes I know own spawn

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.810 
certain chunks so yes I know own spawn
below<00:00:39.540> layer<00:00:39.750> 40<00:00:40.140> used<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> be<00:00:41.100> 16<00:00:41.489> s<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.670> used

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
below layer 40 used to be 16 s we used

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.970 
below layer 40 used to be 16 s we used
to<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:41.940> much<00:00:42.090> harder<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.600> anyway<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.800> going

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
to be much harder but anyway just going

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.709 
to be much harder but anyway just going
to<00:00:44.040> hop<00:00:44.129> down<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.520> now<00:00:44.670> I'd<00:00:44.879> jump<00:00:45.539> down<00:00:45.660> my

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
to hop down there now I'd jump down my

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.680 
to hop down there now I'd jump down my
junk<00:00:45.989> too<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:47.489> well<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.030> i'm<00:00:48.270> already<00:00:48.420> down

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
junk too we as well and i'm already down

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.510 
junk too we as well and i'm already down
here<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:49.590> course<00:00:49.770> there's<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.980> long<00:00:50.129> climb<00:00:50.280> back

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
here of course there's a long climb back

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.900 
here of course there's a long climb back
up<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:50.910> oh<00:00:50.940> well<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.160> are<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> few<00:00:53.730> layers

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
up but oh well so we are a few layers

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.600 
up but oh well so we are a few layers
worth<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.390> lot<00:00:54.660> right<00:00:54.870> now<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.649> yes<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.370> level

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
worth a lot right now so yes what level

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.869 
worth a lot right now so yes what level
10<00:00:57.469> anyway<00:00:58.469> there<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.649> two<00:00:58.890> gigantic<00:00:59.370> towers

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
10 anyway there are two gigantic towers

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.380 
10 anyway there are two gigantic towers
which<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> cannot<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:00.719> hear<00:01:00.750> they<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.680> 6

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
which you cannot see hear they have 6

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.530 
which you cannot see hear they have 6
250<00:01:03.390> 66<00:01:04.140> x<00:01:04.320> 256<00:01:05.189> squares<00:01:05.460> swanville<00:01:05.790> space<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
250 66 x 256 squares swanville space so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.310 
250 66 x 256 squares swanville space so
comes<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.500> about<00:01:08.210> 3072<00:01:09.210> supportable<00:01:09.900> spaces

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
comes for about 3072 supportable spaces

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.100 
comes for about 3072 supportable spaces
so<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.560> quite<00:01:10.799> big<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:12.090> terms<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.600> any<00:01:12.810> kind

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
so it's quite big in terms of any kind

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.160 
so it's quite big in terms of any kind
of<00:01:13.290> spawning<00:01:13.860> trap<00:01:14.570> it's<00:01:15.570> got<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> storage<00:01:16.140> tank

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
of spawning trap it's got a storage tank

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.020 
of spawning trap it's got a storage tank
here<00:01:16.650> which<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> controlled<00:01:17.340> by<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
here which is controlled by this the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.460 
here which is controlled by this the
other<00:01:18.210> two<00:01:18.420> levers<00:01:18.750> control<00:01:19.200> little

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
other two levers control little

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.530 
other two levers control little
vaporizers<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> sides<00:01:20.640> she<00:01:21.270> can't<00:01:21.479> hear

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
vaporizers on the sides she can't hear

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.630 
vaporizers on the sides she can't hear
little<00:01:21.810> piston<00:01:22.200> bear<00:01:22.350> prizes<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.280> forced<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
little piston bear prizes it forced the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.789 
little piston bear prizes it forced the
slimes<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.060> fall<00:01:24.210> into<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> lava<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.650> i

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
slimes to fall into the lava so that i

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.770 
slimes to fall into the lava so that i
can<00:01:25.920> switch<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.670> effectively<00:01:27.330> switch<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
can switch this effectively switch this

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.590 
can switch this effectively switch this
off<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.320> my<00:01:28.860> mob<00:01:29.700> trap<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> surface<00:01:30.450> will

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
off and my mob trap on the surface will

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.969 
off and my mob trap on the surface will
still<00:01:30.750> function<00:01:30.930> normally<00:01:31.170> which<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.920> good

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
still function normally which is a good

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.340 
still function normally which is a good
thing<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.549> guess<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.880> what<00:01:35.880> our<00:01:36.060> all<00:01:37.020> words

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
thing I guess so I what our all words

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.370 
thing I guess so I what our all words
yes<00:01:38.340> I'm<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> turn<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.780> am<00:01:40.140> going

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
yes I'm going to turn it on I am going

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.530 
yes I'm going to turn it on I am going
to<00:01:40.740> wait<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> fill<00:01:41.790> up<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.030> I'll<00:01:42.390> be

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
to wait for this to fill up and I'll be

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.260 
to wait for this to fill up and I'll be
back<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.110> moment<00:01:43.490> okay<00:01:44.490> right<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.090> it's

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
back in just a moment okay right so it's

keeps<00:03:40.210> my<00:03:40.360> computer<00:03:40.720> quiet<00:03:40.990> and<00:03:41.170> cool<00:03:41.350> and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
keeps my computer quiet and cool and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.540 
keeps my computer quiet and cool and
it's<00:03:42.370> just<00:03:42.790> too<00:03:42.910> smooth<00:03:43.180> as<00:03:43.390> Max<00:03:43.720> FPS<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:45.190> right

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
it's just too smooth as Max FPS so right

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.820 
it's just too smooth as Max FPS so right
let's<00:03:45.820> head<00:03:46.180> over<00:03:46.210> here<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.900> i<00:03:47.170> will<00:03:47.290> show<00:03:47.770> you

let's head over here and i will show you

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
let's head over here and i will show you
my<00:03:48.960> other<00:03:49.960> small<00:03:50.380> flaws<00:03:50.590> inside<00:03:50.920> that<00:03:51.040> has<00:03:51.160> my

my other small flaws inside that has my

my other small flaws inside that has my
preparation<00:03:52.630> skills<00:03:52.810> here<00:03:53.230> already<00:03:53.620> dug<00:03:53.890> a

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
preparation skills here already dug a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.890 
preparation skills here already dug a
hole<00:03:54.100> in<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.400> wall<00:03:54.520> so<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.600> is<00:03:55.630> what<00:03:55.780> the

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
hole in the wall so this is what the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.650 
hole in the wall so this is what the
spawn<00:03:56.110> floor<00:03:56.380> looks<00:03:56.560> like<00:03:57.210> looks<00:03:58.210> a<00:03:58.360> lot<00:03:58.480> like

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
spawn floor looks like looks a lot like

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.900

the towers used to be used on chunkier I

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.720 
the towers used to be used on chunkier I
definitely<00:04:01.390> remember<00:04:01.690> that<00:04:02.020> but<00:04:02.260> oh<00:04:02.440> well

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
definitely remember that but oh well

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
spawns facing a random direction and

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.740 
spawns facing a random direction and
you'll<00:04:08.560> just<00:04:08.740> hop<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.190> that<00:04:09.400> direction<00:04:10.200> until

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
you'll just hop in that direction until

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.500 
you'll just hop in that direction until

okay I'm not sure methinks and n

you<00:04:19.639> know<00:04:19.729> they<00:04:19.819> can<00:04:19.849> take<00:04:20.120> up<00:04:20.269> stone<00:04:20.479> anyway

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
you know they can take up stone anyway

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.710 
you know they can take up stone anyway

moving on they spawn they help in a

let's say they spawn on the top floor

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:30.219 
let's say they spawn on the top floor
they're<00:04:29.090> going<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.300> fall<00:04:29.449> down<00:04:29.479> you'd<00:04:29.900> expect

they're going to fall down you'd expect

i<00:04:47.900> will<00:04:48.229> put<00:04:48.469> a<00:04:48.530> link<00:04:48.650> in<00:04:49.189> the<00:04:49.759> description<00:04:50.300> for

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
i will put a link in the description for

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.619 
i will put a link in the description for
this<00:04:51.129> so<00:04:52.129> yes<00:04:52.400> if<00:04:52.699> you<00:04:53.060> want<00:04:53.270> to<00:04:53.360> know<00:04:53.419> how<00:04:53.599> to

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:53.629 
this so yes if you want to know how to

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:55.360 
this so yes if you want to know how to
build<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:54.050> slime<00:04:54.259> reducer<00:04:54.620> what<00:04:54.830> it<00:04:54.949> does<00:04:55.099> is<00:04:55.340> it

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
build a slime reducer what it does is it

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.180 
build a slime reducer what it does is it
reduces<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.449> big<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:56.960> medium<00:04:57.319> slimes<00:04:57.620> into

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
reduces the big and medium slimes into

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.480 
reduces the big and medium slimes into
small<00:04:58.610> ones<00:04:59.169> so<00:05:00.169> that<00:05:00.199> they<00:05:00.560> can<00:05:00.830> be<00:05:00.860> punched

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
small ones so that they can be punched

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.969 
small ones so that they can be punched
easily<00:05:01.879> basically<00:05:02.479> you<00:05:03.319> get<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.560> slimeballs

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
easily basically you get the slimeballs

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.580 
easily basically you get the slimeballs
more<00:05:04.219> easily<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:05.180> yeah<00:05:05.330> that's<00:05:06.050> about<00:05:06.289> that

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
more easily so yeah that's about that

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.279 
more easily so yeah that's about that
for<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:06.860> I<00:05:07.099> will<00:05:07.930> actually<00:05:08.930> I<00:05:08.960> think<00:05:09.020> I'll

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
for that I will actually I think I'll

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.019 
for that I will actually I think I'll
cut<00:05:09.500> to<00:05:09.620> another<00:05:09.740> world<00:05:10.190> my<00:05:10.370> creative<00:05:10.819> world

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:11.029 
cut to another world my creative world

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.670 
cut to another world my creative world
and<00:05:11.300> I'll<00:05:11.360> show<00:05:11.539> you<00:05:11.569> this<00:05:11.810> working<00:05:12.199> so<00:05:12.379> yeah

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
and I'll show you this working so yeah

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.499 
and I'll show you this working so yeah
we<00:05:12.919> go<00:05:13.039> back<00:05:13.250> again<00:05:13.430> in<00:05:13.819> just<00:05:14.120> a<00:05:14.240> moment

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
we go back again in just a moment

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.890 
we go back again in just a moment
alright<00:05:15.289> so<00:05:15.529> here<00:05:15.740> is<00:05:15.889> a<00:05:16.060> little<00:05:17.060> prototype<00:05:17.659> of

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
alright so here is a little prototype of

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.379 
alright so here is a little prototype of
the<00:05:18.169> slime<00:05:18.469> reducer<00:05:18.919> built<00:05:19.159> in<00:05:19.370> my<00:05:19.550> creative

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
the slime reducer built in my creative

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:21.999 
the slime reducer built in my creative
testing<00:05:20.750> well<00:05:20.900> so<00:05:21.229> what<00:05:21.349> we<00:05:21.439> have<00:05:21.620> so<00:05:21.800> we<00:05:21.830> have

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
testing well so what we have so we have

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.249 
testing well so what we have so we have
the<00:05:22.190> reducing<00:05:22.819> unit<00:05:23.090> itself<00:05:23.389> test<00:05:24.169> your

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
the reducing unit itself test your

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.890 
the reducing unit itself test your
little<00:05:24.529> water<00:05:24.710> canal<00:05:25.099> attached<00:05:26.090> to<00:05:26.419> a<00:05:26.449> slime

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
little water canal attached to a slime

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.709 
little water canal attached to a slime
spawning<00:05:27.229> dispenser<00:05:27.909> it's<00:05:28.909> just<00:05:29.150> a<00:05:29.240> dispenser

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
spawning dispenser it's just a dispenser

they will die they were split into
normal<00:05:56.449> sized<00:05:56.690> lines<00:05:57.050> should<00:05:57.800> go<00:05:57.979> they'll<00:05:58.219> be

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
normal sized lines should go they'll be

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.070 
normal sized lines should go they'll be
hurt<00:05:58.520> by<00:05:58.669> this<00:05:58.729> but<00:05:59.330> they<00:05:59.389> won't<00:05:59.539> die<00:05:59.719> they'll

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:02.839 
pull down on 2d soul sand so it did have

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:04.149

to go to the nether to fill this in my

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.339 
to go to the nether to fill this in my
world<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:04.599> we're<00:06:05.599> customer<00:06:05.900> on<00:06:05.960> salts<00:06:06.229> and

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
world and we're customer on salts and

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:07.869 
world and we're customer on salts and
the<00:06:06.469> jump<00:06:06.680> up<00:06:06.860> I<00:06:07.039> don't<00:06:07.580> know<00:06:07.639> why<00:06:07.849> that

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:07.879 
the jump up I don't know why that

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.360 
the jump up I don't know why that
happens<00:06:08.419> but<00:06:08.569> it<00:06:08.690> does<00:06:08.900> they<00:06:09.289> jump<00:06:09.500> up<00:06:09.650> just

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
happens but it does they jump up just

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.070 
happens but it does they jump up just
touch<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:10.699> lava<00:06:10.879> they<00:06:11.089> die<00:06:11.300> and<00:06:11.599> it's<00:06:11.900> written

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
touch the lava they die and it's written

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.890 
touch the lava they die and it's written
two<00:06:12.259> small<00:06:12.469> ones<00:06:12.909> which<00:06:13.909> go<00:06:14.120> into<00:06:14.300> is<00:06:14.719> your

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
two small ones which go into is your

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.719 
two small ones which go into is your
water<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.409> you<00:06:16.129> can<00:06:16.250> do<00:06:16.310> whatever<00:06:16.460> you<00:06:16.699> like

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
water and you can do whatever you like

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.510 
water and you can do whatever you like
with<00:06:16.849> them<00:06:17.060> basically<00:06:17.529> I'm<00:06:18.529> going<00:06:18.979> to<00:06:19.129> block

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
with them basically I'm going to block

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.149 
with them basically I'm going to block
that<00:06:19.699> off<00:06:19.759> so<00:06:20.120> we<00:06:20.240> can<00:06:20.360> have<00:06:20.599> a<00:06:20.629> slime<00:06:21.620> mosh<00:06:21.889> pit

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159 
that off so we can have a slime mosh pit

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.059 
that off so we can have a slime mosh pit
there<00:06:22.449> anyway<00:06:23.449> i<00:06:23.629> am<00:06:24.229> now<00:06:24.319> going<00:06:24.529> to<00:06:24.650> stick

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069 
there anyway i am now going to stick

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:26.559 
there anyway i am now going to stick
piece<00:06:25.250> of<00:06:25.339> redstone<00:06:25.460> here<00:06:25.789> and<00:06:26.000> we<00:06:26.270> will<00:06:26.389> see

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:26.569 
piece of redstone here and we will see

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.100 
piece of redstone here and we will see
exactly<00:06:26.899> how<00:06:27.139> it<00:06:27.229> works

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.610 

so<00:06:31.110> there<00:06:31.860> we<00:06:31.919> go<00:06:31.949> as<00:06:32.190> a<00:06:32.639> small<00:06:33.090> slime<00:06:33.389> and

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
so there we go as a small slime and

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.430 
so there we go as a small slime and
you'll<00:06:34.620> see<00:06:34.800> that<00:06:34.830> one<00:06:35.100> go<00:06:35.250> through<00:06:36.139> and<00:06:37.139> he'll

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
you'll see that one go through and he'll

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.379 
you'll see that one go through and he'll
just<00:06:37.650> go<00:06:37.800> straight<00:06:38.070> through<00:06:38.220> here's<00:06:39.120> our

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
just go straight through here's our

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:41.240 
just go straight through here's our
median<00:06:39.720> you<00:06:40.290> can<00:06:40.530> see<00:06:40.620> take<00:06:40.919> some<00:06:41.100> damage

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
median you can see take some damage

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.830 
median you can see take some damage
jumps<00:06:41.790> guys<00:06:42.270> it's<00:06:42.930> more<00:06:43.110> add<00:06:43.320> a<00:06:43.380> giant<00:06:43.949> one

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
jumps guys it's more add a giant one

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.840 
jumps guys it's more add a giant one
guys<00:06:45.840> splits<00:06:46.470> into<00:06:46.620> normal<00:06:46.979> ones<00:06:47.130> the<00:06:47.580> normal

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
guys splits into normal ones the normal

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.780 
guys splits into normal ones the normal
ones<00:06:47.970> go<00:06:48.180> to<00:06:48.449> there<00:06:49.260> they<00:06:49.770> jump<00:06:50.010> up<00:06:50.130> to<00:06:50.310> die<00:06:50.520> and

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
ones go to there they jump up to die and

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.340 
ones go to there they jump up to die and
so<00:06:50.940> forth<00:06:51.150> and<00:06:51.300> you<00:06:51.449> end<00:06:51.600> up<00:06:51.660> with<00:06:51.780> a<00:06:51.840> lot<00:06:52.020> of<00:06:52.050> a
