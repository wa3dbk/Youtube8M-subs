00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.370

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.250

 preparing for this I feel more 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.099
 sure already after this long week 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.019
 two weeks of promotion and I can more 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.959
 well focus on that and completely 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.780
 already has more than one million visits in 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.819
 youtube have really created a lot 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.580
 traffic on social networks but 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.440
 there are also criticisms and tutear more than one 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.090
 cure up how you face it because 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.530
 obviously they will always be critical 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.510
 they say you 're a novice who does not 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.819
 I would have thrown the sung and 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.310
 I respect the opinions of all 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.500
 for the truth I have reached a point in 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.010
 my life that I can not focus on those 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.069
 people on the contrary 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.739
 It helps me like that to move forward to 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.239
 motivate me but I do not care about the truth 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.370
 I feel like I do not care what 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.319
 have to say they I focus more on 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.239
 the people who support me and that if I 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.459
 wants and positive comments on 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.890
 my social networks and I learned a lot 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.390

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.020
