00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
time around I did a quick jump up to see

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.500 
time around I did a quick jump up to see
if<00:03:42.599> you<00:03:42.690> catch<00:03:42.870> mark<00:03:43.140> Gardner<00:03:43.500> was<00:03:43.620> able<00:03:43.860> to

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
if you catch mark Gardner was able to

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.850 
if you catch mark Gardner was able to
and<00:03:45.510> because<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.810> Doom's<00:03:46.110> hit<00:03:46.260> confirms<00:03:46.680> it's

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
and because of Doom's hit confirms it's

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.199 
and because of Doom's hit confirms it's
really<00:03:47.069> easy<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.340> actually<00:03:47.760> do<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.000> super

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
really easy to actually do the super

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.199 
really easy to actually do the super
into<00:03:48.569> it<00:03:48.629> if<00:03:48.750> needed<00:03:48.959> i<00:03:49.830> miss<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.790> launch<00:03:50.940> in

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
into it if needed i miss the launch in

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.240 
into it if needed i miss the launch in
there<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:51.720> i<00:03:51.870> realized<00:03:52.349> this<00:03:52.530> match<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:53.069> was

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
there but i realized this match it was

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.220 
there but i realized this match it was
there<00:03:53.519> was<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.670> little<00:03:53.940> bit<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.180> like<00:03:54.599> input<00:03:55.019> lag

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
there was a little bit of like input lag

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.800 
there was a little bit of like input lag
because<00:03:56.000> you'll<00:03:57.000> notice<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.390> couple<00:03:57.420> of<00:03:57.720> other

late<00:04:32.669> in<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.789> game<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:33.090> extremely<00:04:33.180> important

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
late in the game is extremely important

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.590 
late in the game is extremely important
and<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:35.010> don't<00:04:35.520> know<00:04:35.610> why<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:35.789> did<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.120> laser<00:04:36.330> gun

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
and I don't know why I did the laser gun

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.990 
and I don't know why I did the laser gun
at<00:04:36.630> that<00:04:36.900> point<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.440> I<00:04:38.340> could<00:04:38.669> have<00:04:38.760> killed

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
at that point and I could have killed

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.770 
at that point and I could have killed
him<00:04:39.150> fast<00:04:39.360> but<00:04:39.570> now<00:04:39.660> he's<00:04:39.810> got<00:04:39.930> X<00:04:40.110> Factor<00:04:40.560> and

him fast but now he's got X Factor and

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.029 
him fast but now he's got X Factor and
at<00:04:42.780> this<00:04:42.960> point<00:04:43.169> I<00:04:43.289> just<00:04:43.320> want<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.620> burn<00:04:43.830> him<00:04:43.950> up

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
because they'd pull again little 30 x

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
because they'd pull again little 30 x
