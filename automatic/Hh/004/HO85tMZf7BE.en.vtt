you<00:04:26.950> only<00:04:27.100> have<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:27.550> much<00:04:27.700> room<00:04:28.120> on<00:04:28.450> a<00:04:28.540> DVD<00:04:28.780> i

believe<00:04:29.560> it's<00:04:29.710> eight<00:04:29.890> hundred<00:04:30.160> megabytes<00:04:30.520> so

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
believe it's eight hundred megabytes so

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.720 
believe it's eight hundred megabytes so
they<00:04:31.660> have<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:32.110> compress<00:04:32.950> them<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.490> lose

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
they have to compress them and you lose

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.320 
they have to compress them and you lose
a<00:04:33.790> bit<00:04:34.150> of<00:04:34.210> quality<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.620> even<00:04:36.100> though<00:04:36.330> the

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
a bit of quality so even though the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.150 
a bit of quality so even though the
quality<00:04:37.780> is<00:04:37.840> better<00:04:38.050> than<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.500> handycam

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
quality is better than the handycam

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.860 
quality is better than the handycam
because<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:39.730> was<00:04:39.880> ripped<00:04:40.120> from<00:04:40.360> an<00:04:40.630> original

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
because it was ripped from an original

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.940 
because it was ripped from an original
DVD<00:04:41.730> the<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:43.360> compression<00:04:43.930> rate<00:04:44.170> gives<00:04:44.710> you<00:04:44.920> a

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
DVD the the compression rate gives you a

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.320 
DVD the the compression rate gives you a
lower<00:04:45.460> quality<00:04:46.050> image<00:04:47.050> it's<00:04:47.290> still<00:04:47.650> okay<00:04:48.640> it's

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
lower quality image it's still okay it's

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.450 
lower quality image it's still okay it's
definitely<00:04:49.930> not<00:04:50.080> DVD<00:04:50.680> quality<00:04:50.920> and<00:04:51.340> it's

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
definitely not DVD quality and it's

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.060 
definitely not DVD quality and it's
definitely<00:04:51.850> not<00:04:53.100> blu-ray<00:04:54.100> so<00:04:55.710> there's<00:04:56.710> that

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
definitely not blu-ray so there's that

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.210 
definitely not blu-ray so there's that

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
quality before you buy it they're pretty

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.370 
quality before you buy it they're pretty
good<00:05:14.740> about<00:05:14.860> that<00:05:16.050> but<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.170> thing<00:05:17.350> is

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
good about that but the thing is

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.520 
good about that but the thing is
sometimes<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:19.210> aspect<00:05:19.780> ratio<00:05:19.870> is

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
sometimes the the aspect ratio is

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.040 
sometimes the the aspect ratio is
stretched<00:05:21.010> out<00:05:21.280> so<00:05:22.000> everybody<00:05:22.330> looks<00:05:22.720> just

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
stretched out so everybody looks just

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.590 
stretched out so everybody looks just
slightly<00:05:23.680> fatter<00:05:24.070> you<00:05:24.760> know<00:05:24.880> their<00:05:25.240> head<00:05:25.450> is

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
slightly fatter you know their head is

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.720 
slightly fatter you know their head is
just<00:05:25.780> a<00:05:25.960> little<00:05:26.260> bit<00:05:26.350> wider<00:05:26.620> you<00:05:27.460> know<00:05:27.550> that

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
just a little bit wider you know that

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.090
