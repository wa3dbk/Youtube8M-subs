00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
going to look like in its finished state

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.780 
going to look like in its finished state
and<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.310> see<00:01:11.340> pretty<00:01:11.700> much

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and then to this you can see pretty much

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.760 
and then to this you can see pretty much
everything<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.570> I'm<00:01:12.659> going<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.960> use<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.590> make

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
everything that I'm going to use to make

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.460 
everything that I'm going to use to make
the<00:01:13.830> rest<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:14.610> chicken<00:01:15.030> broth<00:01:15.210> ok<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
reason why everything is gonna be pretty

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.880 
reason why everything is gonna be pretty
easy<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.840> memorize<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.439> everything's<00:01:19.799> gonna

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
easy to memorize is everything's gonna

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.859 
easy to memorize is everything's gonna
be<00:01:20.070> based<00:01:20.280> off<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.520> onions<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.689> see

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
be based off of onions here you can see

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.810 
be based off of onions here you can see
that<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.409> two<00:01:22.920> onions<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.670> just

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that I have two onions and I'm just

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.520 
that I have two onions and I'm just
gonna<00:01:23.939> chop<00:01:24.210> them<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:25.049> doesn't<00:01:25.409> really

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
gonna chop them up it doesn't really

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.080 
gonna chop them up it doesn't really
even<00:01:25.680> matter<00:01:25.920> how<00:01:26.189> much<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.549> chop<00:01:26.759> them<00:01:26.970> up

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
even matter how much you chop them up

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.010 
even matter how much you chop them up
and<00:01:27.360> then<00:01:27.840> my<00:01:28.080> goal<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.070> half<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.820> many

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
and then my goal is to have half as many

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.530 
and then my goal is to have half as many

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
celery's as I have onions and half as

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.260 
celery's as I have onions and half as
much<00:01:33.869> carrots<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.220> onions<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.970> then

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
much carrots as I have onions and then

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.990 
much carrots as I have onions and then
once<00:01:36.659> again<00:01:36.810> half<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:37.650> much<00:01:37.860> mushrooms<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000

I prefer garlic powder over regular

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.640 
I prefer garlic powder over regular

scoop<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.920> pesto<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.730> then<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.540> no<00:03:15.870> time

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
scoop of pesto and then there is no time

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.500 
scoop of pesto and then there is no time
delay<00:03:16.530> here<00:03:16.890> I'm<00:03:17.070> going<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.430> immediately<00:03:18.239> add

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
delay here I'm going to immediately add

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.680 
delay here I'm going to immediately add
in<00:03:18.900> eight<00:03:19.380> cups<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.459> water<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.450> I'm<00:03:21.570> gonna

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
in eight cups of water and I'm gonna

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.390 
in eight cups of water and I'm gonna
stir<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.350> combine<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.890> make<00:03:22.920> sure<00:03:23.190> that

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
stir to combine to make sure that

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.490 
stir to combine to make sure that
something<00:03:23.670> doesn't<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.239> invert<00:03:24.600> in<00:03:25.410> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
something doesn't it invert in the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.949 
something doesn't it invert in the
bottom<00:03:25.860> now<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.400> think<00:03:26.580> eight<00:03:27.030> cups<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.750> just

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
bottom now I think eight cups is just

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.420 
bottom now I think eight cups is just
about<00:03:28.140> perfect<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.709> course<00:03:28.950> if<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.250> add<00:03:29.400> a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
about perfect of course if you add a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.860 
about perfect of course if you add a
little<00:03:29.760> bit<00:03:29.970> less<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:30.390> gonna<00:03:30.480> have<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> little

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
little bit less it's gonna have a little

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.300 
little bit less it's gonna have a little
bit<00:03:31.049> more<00:03:31.230> flavor<00:03:31.500> if<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:31.799> add<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:31.950> little<00:03:32.100> bit

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
bit more flavor if you add a little bit

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.009 
bit more flavor if you add a little bit
more<00:03:32.340> it's<00:03:32.760> gonna<00:03:32.850> have<00:03:33.090> less<00:03:33.360> flavor<00:03:33.720> and

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
more it's gonna have less flavor and

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.449 
more it's gonna have less flavor and
then<00:03:34.290> whenever<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.769> starts<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.130> boil<00:03:35.310> I'm

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
then whenever it starts to boil I'm

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.820 
then whenever it starts to boil I'm
gonna<00:03:35.580> turn<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.940> from<00:03:36.090> high<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.780> 20%<00:03:37.590> now<00:03:37.739> I'm

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
gonna turn it from high to 20% now I'm

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.210 
gonna turn it from high to 20% now I'm
going<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.310> let<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.730> sit<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.420> simmer<00:03:39.959> at<00:03:40.290> 20%

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
going to let that sit and simmer at 20%

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.370 
going to let that sit and simmer at 20%
for<00:03:41.459> approximately<00:03:42.180> two<00:03:42.510> hours<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.230> only

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380

have<00:03:43.530> an<00:03:43.620> hour<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.890> half<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.100> is<00:03:44.519> more

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
have an hour and a half that is more

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.190 
have an hour and a half that is more
than<00:03:44.880> perfectly<00:03:45.269> fine<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.900> then<00:03:45.989> I'm<00:03:46.080> gonna

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
than perfectly fine and then I'm gonna

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.009 
than perfectly fine and then I'm gonna
pour<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.650> into<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:47.070> colander<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.730> then<00:03:48.420> after

pour this into a colander and then after

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.810 
pour this into a colander and then after
it<00:03:49.170> goes<00:03:49.410> in<00:03:49.650> there<00:03:49.830> I'm<00:03:50.010> going<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.430> mash<00:03:50.640> it

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820
