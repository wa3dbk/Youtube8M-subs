packaging in fact I usually feel a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.310 
packaging in fact I usually feel a
little<00:00:41.430> bit<00:00:41.579> bad<00:00:41.820> when<00:00:42.149> I'm<00:00:42.239> removing<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
little bit bad when I'm removing a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.930 
little bit bad when I'm removing a
figure<00:00:43.649> from<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:44.399> everything

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
figure from it just because everything

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.720 
figure from it just because everything
looks<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.360> free<00:00:45.629> God<00:00:46.370> especially<00:00:47.370> because<00:00:47.489> we

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
looks so free God especially because we

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.400 
looks so free God especially because we
even<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.090> little<00:00:48.390> comic<00:00:48.809> panels<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
even have little comic panels in the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.250 
even have little comic panels in the
background<00:00:49.980> here<00:00:50.690> which<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.809> don't<00:00:51.870> see<00:00:52.020> with

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
background here which you don't see with

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.959 
background here which you don't see with
a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> other<00:00:53.100> toy<00:00:54.090> companies<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.820> one

a lot of other toy companies the one

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
a lot of other toy companies the one
difference<00:00:57.149> though<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.320> don't

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
difference though is that they don't

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.080 
difference though is that they don't
provide<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:58.980> much<00:00:59.160> back<00:00:59.520> storing<00:01:00.000> these

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
provide as much back storing these

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.910 
provide as much back storing these
characters<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.260> they<00:01:01.379> assume<00:01:01.739> that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
characters just because they assume that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.219 
characters just because they assume that
you<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.070> who<00:01:02.460> they<00:01:02.609> are<00:01:02.760> already<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:04.080> you

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you know who they are already but if you

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.320 
you know who they are already but if you
don't<00:01:04.350> know<00:01:04.439> who<00:01:04.619> he<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.799> he<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.519> actually

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
don't know who he is he is actually

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
the role kizi really large figure and

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.699 
the role kizi really large figure and
somewhat<00:03:53.760> heavy<00:03:54.000> he<00:03:54.720> does<00:03:54.959> feel<00:03:55.260> kind<00:03:55.290> of

somewhat heavy he does feel kind of
light<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.280> suspect<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.390> upper<00:03:57.660> torso

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
light so I suspect that the upper torso

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.000 
light so I suspect that the upper torso
here<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:58.620> in<00:03:58.739> fact<00:03:58.950> Hollow<00:04:00.440> which<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.709> sort

here is in fact Hollow which that sort

of confirms it also the joints really

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.770 
of confirms it also the joints really
really<00:04:05.310> incredibly<00:04:05.790> stiff<00:04:06.209> this<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.570> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
really incredibly stiff this is the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.080 
really incredibly stiff this is the
second<00:04:07.260> Marvel<00:04:07.739> Select<00:04:07.860> of<00:04:08.220> unbox<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:08.790> far

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
second Marvel Select of unbox so far

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.140 
second Marvel Select of unbox so far
before<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.380> reviewed<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.100> doctor<00:04:11.940> doom

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
before that I reviewed the doctor doom

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.120 
before that I reviewed the doctor doom
which<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.750> was<00:04:12.900> really<00:04:13.080> impressed<00:04:13.290> with<00:04:13.680> but

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
which I was really impressed with but

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.940 
which I was really impressed with but
this<00:04:14.820> one<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.209> joints<00:04:15.630> are<00:04:15.750> just<00:04:15.959> aren't

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
this one the joints are just aren't

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.860 
this one the joints are just aren't
really<00:04:17.160> doing<00:04:17.459> much<00:04:17.609> it's<00:04:18.060> just<00:04:18.270> like<00:04:18.359> knowing

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
really doing much it's just like knowing

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.219 
really doing much it's just like knowing
me<00:04:19.400> takes<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.609> lot<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.000> pressure<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:21.600> get<00:04:21.960> it<00:04:22.109> to

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
me takes a lot of pressure to get it to

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.020 
me takes a lot of pressure to get it to
do<00:04:22.350> anything<00:04:22.650> I<00:04:23.160> guess<00:04:23.340> they<00:04:23.490> probably<00:04:23.789> will

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
do anything I guess they probably will

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.950 
do anything I guess they probably will
loosen<00:04:24.270> up<00:04:24.539> over<00:04:24.780> time

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
loosen up over time

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.800 
loosen up over time
now<00:04:26.530> it's<00:04:26.710> just<00:04:26.889> a<00:04:27.130> huge<00:04:27.910> aggravation<00:04:30.569> as<00:04:31.569> you

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
now it's just a huge aggravation as you

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.930 
now it's just a huge aggravation as you
can<00:04:31.930> see<00:04:32.259> we<00:04:32.470> have<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.919> incredible<00:04:33.550> amount<00:04:33.850> of

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
can see we have a incredible amount of

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.499 
can see we have a incredible amount of
detail<00:04:34.360> here<00:04:34.949> tons<00:04:35.949> of<00:04:36.190> veins<00:04:36.669> bulging<00:04:37.330> all

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
detail here tons of veins bulging all

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.370 
detail here tons of veins bulging all
over<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.930> place<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:39.580> then<00:04:40.389> on<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.780> back<00:04:40.990> the

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
over the place and then on the back the

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.439 
over the place and then on the back the
shoulder<00:04:42.069> blades<00:04:42.340> here<00:04:42.610> just<00:04:42.880> positively

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
shoulder blades here just positively

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.320 
shoulder blades here just positively
massive<00:04:44.220> you<00:04:45.220> know<00:04:45.280> there's<00:04:45.490> a<00:04:45.550> huge<00:04:46.060> amount

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
massive you know there's a huge amount

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.070 
massive you know there's a huge amount
of<00:04:46.509> difference<00:04:47.380> between<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:48.069> and<00:04:49.080> sell

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
of difference between that and sell

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.950 
of difference between that and sell
lower<00:04:50.319> back<00:04:52.919> the<00:04:53.919> pants<00:04:54.759> and<00:04:54.910> stuff<00:04:55.120> or<00:04:55.539> are

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
lower back the pants and stuff or are

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.260 
lower back the pants and stuff or are
made<00:04:56.349> of<00:04:56.470> a<00:04:56.590> soft<00:04:56.919> rubbery<00:04:57.430> plastic<00:04:57.639> at<00:04:58.150> the

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
made of a soft rubbery plastic at the

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.439 
made of a soft rubbery plastic at the
edges<00:04:58.419> here<00:04:59.220> that<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.400> entire<00:05:00.610> lower<00:05:00.940> portion

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
edges here that the entire lower portion

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.800 
edges here that the entire lower portion
here<00:05:01.750> is<00:05:01.930> this<00:05:02.349> so<00:05:02.590> i<00:05:02.620> guess<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:03.009> really

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
here is this so i guess it really

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.040 
here is this so i guess it really
simulates<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:04.990> fabric<00:05:05.710> lot<00:05:05.949> better<00:05:06.190> although

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
simulates the fabric lot better although

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.170 
simulates the fabric lot better although
you<00:05:08.050> know<00:05:08.199> I<00:05:08.440> wouldn't<00:05:09.130> expect<00:05:09.190> jeans<00:05:09.729> be<00:05:10.000> that

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
you know I wouldn't expect jeans be that

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.760 
you know I wouldn't expect jeans be that
mountable<00:05:10.870> oh<00:05:12.599> um<00:05:13.599> actually<00:05:14.020> this<00:05:14.410> is<00:05:14.590> the

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
mountable oh um actually this is the

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.399 
mountable oh um actually this is the
third<00:05:15.310> barbel<00:05:15.849> selectively<00:05:16.690> unboxed<00:05:17.199> I<00:05:17.289> also

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
third barbel selectively unboxed I also

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.550 
third barbel selectively unboxed I also
unbox<00:05:17.889> the<00:05:18.220> Thor<00:05:18.729> which<00:05:19.659> again<00:05:19.960> was<00:05:20.139> a<00:05:20.199> pretty

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
unbox the Thor which again was a pretty

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.930 
unbox the Thor which again was a pretty
cool<00:05:20.770> figure<00:05:21.159> if<00:05:21.280> I<00:05:21.370> guess<00:05:21.520> it's<00:05:21.669> just<00:05:21.729> the

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
cool figure if I guess it's just the

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.820 
cool figure if I guess it's just the
joints<00:05:22.449> on<00:05:22.539> these<00:05:22.690> larger<00:05:23.229> figures<00:05:23.590> that

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
joints on these larger figures that

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.010 
joints on these larger figures that
might<00:05:24.039> be<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.220> little<00:05:24.340> bit<00:05:24.520> tougher<00:05:24.940> I'll<00:05:25.930> let

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
might be a little bit tougher I'll let

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.860 
might be a little bit tougher I'll let
me<00:05:26.110> just<00:05:26.289> give<00:05:26.440> you<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:26.590> quick<00:05:26.860> run-through<00:05:27.870> we

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
me just give you a quick run-through we

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.570 
me just give you a quick run-through we
have<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.080> ball<00:05:29.409> jointed<00:05:29.800> head<00:05:30.039> which<00:05:30.310> feels

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
have a ball jointed head which feels

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.629 
have a ball jointed head which feels
pretty<00:05:30.820> loose<00:05:31.090> really<00:05:31.509> good<00:05:31.750> range<00:05:31.990> of<00:05:32.080> motion

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
pretty loose really good range of motion

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.649 
pretty loose really good range of motion
you<00:05:33.639> know<00:05:33.729> really<00:05:33.759> responsive<00:05:34.690> we<00:05:35.110> have<00:05:35.199> a

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
you know really responsive we have a

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:41.100 
you know really responsive we have a
rotating<00:05:37.659> wrist<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.880> know<00:05:40.000> again<00:05:40.360> works

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
rotating wrist you know again works

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.149 
rotating wrist you know again works
pretty<00:05:41.560> well<00:05:41.880> ball<00:05:42.880> jointed<00:05:43.270> elbow<00:05:44.009> which<00:05:45.009> is

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
pretty well ball jointed elbow which is

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.279 
pretty well ball jointed elbow which is
a<00:05:45.190> pretty<00:05:45.520> good<00:05:45.759> choice<00:05:46.090> for<00:05:46.120> larger<00:05:46.930> figures

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
a pretty good choice for larger figures

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.909 
a pretty good choice for larger figures
just<00:05:47.320> because<00:05:47.949> the<00:05:49.020> double<00:05:50.020> pins<00:05:50.289> don't<00:05:50.620> work

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
just because the double pins don't work

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.620 
just because the double pins don't work
too<00:05:51.280> well<00:05:52.620> no<00:05:53.620> bicep<00:05:54.250> articulation<00:05:55.030> obviously

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
too well no bicep articulation obviously

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.080 
too well no bicep articulation obviously
then<00:05:55.810> we<00:05:55.960> go<00:05:56.080> straight<00:05:56.139> to<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:57.090> shoulder

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
then we go straight to the shoulder

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.110 
then we go straight to the shoulder
joint<00:05:58.120> here<00:05:58.690> which<00:05:58.900> frankly<00:05:59.800> is<00:06:00.120> as

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
joint here which frankly is as

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.620 
joint here which frankly is as
responsive<00:06:01.990> as<00:06:02.080> I<00:06:02.259> would<00:06:02.440> like<00:06:02.620> I<00:06:03.509> mean<00:06:04.509> it

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
responsive as I would like I mean it

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.839 
responsive as I would like I mean it
does<00:06:05.169> the<00:06:05.409> rotation<00:06:06.009> pretty<00:06:06.219> well<00:06:06.460> but<00:06:06.699> it

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
does the rotation pretty well but it

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.640 
does the rotation pretty well but it
takes<00:06:07.000> a<00:06:07.180> lot<00:06:07.389> of<00:06:07.419> pressure<00:06:07.810> to<00:06:07.960> get<00:06:08.259> it<00:06:08.409> going

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
takes a lot of pressure to get it going

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.399 
takes a lot of pressure to get it going
up<00:06:09.490> or<00:06:09.699> down<00:06:09.729> par<00:06:10.449> that<00:06:10.659> might<00:06:10.810> just<00:06:10.960> be<00:06:11.080> to<00:06:11.320> the

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
up or down par that might just be to the

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.520 
up or down par that might just be to the
sculpt<00:06:11.889> or<00:06:12.099> it<00:06:12.789> looks<00:06:12.940> like<00:06:13.229> it's<00:06:14.229> kind<00:06:14.469> of

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
sculpt or it looks like it's kind of

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.939 
sculpt or it looks like it's kind of
fraying<00:06:14.919> I<00:06:15.190> don't<00:06:15.729> know<00:06:15.789> it's<00:06:16.000> kind<00:06:16.180> of<00:06:16.210> weird

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
fraying I don't know it's kind of weird

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:22.080 
fraying I don't know it's kind of weird
no<00:06:17.949> waste<00:06:18.159> articulation<00:06:19.229> kind<00:06:20.229> of<00:06:20.320> downer<00:06:21.090> we

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
no waste articulation kind of downer we

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.430 
no waste articulation kind of downer we
have<00:06:22.330> a<00:06:22.979> sort<00:06:23.979> of<00:06:24.039> ball<00:06:24.280> jointed<00:06:24.669> hip<00:06:24.849> here<00:06:25.440> but

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
have a sort of ball jointed hip here but

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.700 
have a sort of ball jointed hip here but
mostly<00:06:26.979> just<00:06:27.099> goes<00:06:27.580> out<00:06:27.759> to<00:06:27.940> the<00:06:28.060> side<00:06:28.330> as<00:06:28.710> you

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
mostly just goes out to the side as you

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.649 
mostly just goes out to the side as you
can<00:06:29.860> see<00:06:30.130> it<00:06:30.250> doesn't<00:06:30.580> have<00:06:30.849> like<00:06:31.150> any<00:06:31.180> point

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:31.659 
can see it doesn't have like any point

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.490 
can see it doesn't have like any point
of<00:06:31.750> rotation<00:06:31.990> up<00:06:32.500> here<00:06:32.680> at<00:06:32.740> the<00:06:32.800> thigh<00:06:34.289> so<00:06:35.289> till

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
of rotation up here at the thigh so till

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.320 
of rotation up here at the thigh so till
I<00:06:35.529> really<00:06:35.800> go<00:06:35.949> one<00:06:36.159> direction<00:06:36.310> kind<00:06:36.969> of<00:06:37.089> like

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
I really go one direction kind of like

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.360 
I really go one direction kind of like
the

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
the

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.620 
the
shoot<00:06:39.180> the<00:06:39.389> marvel<00:06:39.870> universe<00:06:39.900> ones<00:06:41.630> ball

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
shoot the marvel universe ones ball

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.950 
shoot the marvel universe ones ball
jointed<00:06:43.020> knee<00:06:43.229> which<00:06:43.830> will<00:06:44.100> rotate<00:06:44.580> and<00:06:44.790> then

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
jointed knee which will rotate and then

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.070 
jointed knee which will rotate and then
go<00:06:45.960> in<00:06:46.110> now<00:06:46.380> and<00:06:46.680> then<00:06:46.889> we<00:06:47.040> have<00:06:47.280> a<00:06:47.600> pin<00:06:48.600> jointed

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
go in now and then we have a pin jointed

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.540 
go in now and then we have a pin jointed
ankle<00:06:49.560> here<00:06:49.910> um<00:06:50.930> so<00:06:51.930> you<00:06:52.620> know<00:06:52.650> serviceable

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
ankle here um so you know serviceable

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.290 
ankle here um so you know serviceable
articulation<00:06:54.360> it<00:06:54.479> will<00:06:55.070> do<00:06:56.070> the<00:06:56.100> job<00:06:56.250> but<00:06:56.970> I

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
articulation it will do the job but I

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.480 
articulation it will do the job but I
mean<00:06:57.690> not<00:06:57.720> tremendously<00:06:58.410> well<00:06:58.740> just<00:06:59.100> because

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
mean not tremendously well just because

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.120 
mean not tremendously well just because
the<00:06:59.760> joints<00:07:00.210> are<00:07:00.410> incredibly<00:07:01.410> stiff<00:07:01.770> I<00:07:01.979> can

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
the joints are incredibly stiff I can

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.680 
the joints are incredibly stiff I can
kind<00:07:02.370> of<00:07:02.460> understand<00:07:02.970> that<00:07:03.150> if<00:07:03.360> it<00:07:03.479> was<00:07:03.660> just

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
kind of understand that if it was just

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.920 
kind of understand that if it was just
for<00:07:04.050> like<00:07:04.290> the<00:07:04.530> Lord<00:07:04.860> body<00:07:05.190> because<00:07:05.900> given<00:07:06.900> the

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
for like the Lord body because given the

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.990 
for like the Lord body because given the
weight<00:07:07.139> of<00:07:07.260> this<00:07:07.320> character<00:07:07.830> he<00:07:08.010> does<00:07:08.400> need<00:07:08.760> a

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
weight of this character he does need a

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.879 
weight of this character he does need a
certain<00:07:09.360> amount<00:07:09.479> of<00:07:09.720> stiffness<00:07:10.050> to<00:07:10.470> keep<00:07:10.710> it

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
certain amount of stiffness to keep it

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.029 
certain amount of stiffness to keep it
from<00:07:11.729> toppling<00:07:12.180> over<00:07:12.419> but<00:07:12.870> the<00:07:13.110> arms<00:07:13.530> is<00:07:13.710> kind

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 
from toppling over but the arms is kind

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.540 
from toppling over but the arms is kind
of<00:07:14.190> weird<00:07:14.520> and<00:07:15.500> i<00:07:16.500> guess<00:07:16.680> some<00:07:16.710> you<00:07:17.220> might<00:07:17.400> have

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
of weird and i guess some you might have

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.360 
of weird and i guess some you might have
the<00:07:17.699> same<00:07:17.729> problem<00:07:18.120> as<00:07:18.330> well<00:07:18.510> where<00:07:18.810> I<00:07:19.370> mean

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
the same problem as well where I mean

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.600 
the same problem as well where I mean
some<00:07:20.550> parts<00:07:20.880> are<00:07:20.970> just<00:07:21.030> heavier<00:07:21.479> than<00:07:21.630> others

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.610 
some parts are just heavier than others

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.300 
some parts are just heavier than others
all<00:07:23.610> in<00:07:23.970> all<00:07:24.120> this<00:07:24.600> is<00:07:24.660> a<00:07:24.840> very<00:07:25.229> cool<00:07:25.590> figure<00:07:26.070> on

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
all in all this is a very cool figure on

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.480 
all in all this is a very cool figure on
the<00:07:26.340> emeritus<00:07:26.820> of<00:07:27.060> sculpt<00:07:27.660> and<00:07:27.810> paint<00:07:27.870> um<00:07:28.770> in

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490 
the emeritus of sculpt and paint um in

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.760 
the emeritus of sculpt and paint um in
terms<00:07:29.550> of<00:07:29.910> articulation<00:07:30.690> though<00:07:30.870> he<00:07:31.139> is<00:07:31.350> kind

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:31.770 
terms of articulation though he is kind

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.390 
terms of articulation though he is kind
of<00:07:31.919> shaky<00:07:32.400> you<00:07:32.820> know<00:07:33.470> it<00:07:34.470> kind<00:07:34.770> of<00:07:34.889> does<00:07:35.130> this

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 
of shaky you know it kind of does this

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.760 
of shaky you know it kind of does this
what<00:07:35.880> it's<00:07:36.030> supposed<00:07:36.449> to<00:07:36.630> but<00:07:37.139> even<00:07:37.590> then

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770 
what it's supposed to but even then

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.230 
what it's supposed to but even then
there's<00:07:38.010> a<00:07:38.070> significant<00:07:38.880> amount<00:07:39.120> of

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 
there's a significant amount of

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.450 
there's a significant amount of
resistance<00:07:39.539> and<00:07:40.080> you<00:07:40.860> probably<00:07:41.130> won't<00:07:41.310> be

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 
resistance and you probably won't be

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.190 
resistance and you probably won't be
able<00:07:41.550> to<00:07:41.669> pose<00:07:41.910> them<00:07:42.150> in<00:07:42.270> as<00:07:42.479> much<00:07:42.750> as<00:07:43.020> you

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.200 
able to pose them in as much as you

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.100 
able to pose them in as much as you
might<00:07:43.590> like<00:07:43.970> also<00:07:44.970> the<00:07:45.150> other<00:07:45.270> type<00:07:45.539> downside

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.110 
might like also the other type downside

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.990 
might like also the other type downside
is<00:07:46.289> it<00:07:46.740> would<00:07:46.950> have<00:07:47.039> been<00:07:47.160> cool<00:07:47.370> they<00:07:47.610> gave<00:07:47.820> him

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 
is it would have been cool they gave him

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.820 
is it would have been cool they gave him
like<00:07:48.180> an<00:07:48.300> alternate<00:07:48.690> hand<00:07:48.990> for<00:07:49.260> like<00:07:49.349> a<00:07:49.470> gun<00:07:49.680> or

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:49.830 
like an alternate hand for like a gun or

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.159 
like an alternate hand for like a gun or
something<00:07:49.860> just<00:07:50.400> be<00:07:50.610> as<00:07:50.700> a<00:07:50.760> character<00:07:51.169> has

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:52.169 
something just be as a character has

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:54.710 
something just be as a character has
used<00:07:52.560> weapons<00:07:53.070> so<00:07:53.520> or<00:07:54.090> at<00:07:54.180> least<00:07:54.300> the<00:07:54.419> open

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 
used weapons so or at least the open

used weapons so or at least the open
hand<00:07:54.900> that<00:07:55.110> he<00:07:55.229> could<00:07:55.440> have<00:07:55.530> held<00:07:55.740> something

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.010 
hand that he could have held something

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.690 
hand that he could have held something
in<00:07:56.250> but<00:07:56.550> I<00:07:56.910> don't<00:07:57.810> know<00:07:57.979> for<00:07:58.979> what<00:07:59.039> it<00:07:59.250> is<00:07:59.400> is

00:07:59.690 --> 00:07:59.700 
in but I don't know for what it is is

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.850 
in but I don't know for what it is is
the<00:07:59.880> very<00:08:00.240> cool<00:08:00.539> alternate<00:08:01.229> to<00:08:01.349> the<00:08:01.500> green

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860 
the very cool alternate to the green

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.400 
the very cool alternate to the green
Hulk<00:08:02.160> which<00:08:02.550> you<00:08:03.389> know<00:08:03.510> a<00:08:03.539> lot<00:08:03.750> of<00:08:03.810> people<00:08:03.930> did

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:04.410 
Hulk which you know a lot of people did

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.350 
Hulk which you know a lot of people did
like<00:08:04.650> and<00:08:05.010> I<00:08:05.250> didn't<00:08:05.700> pick<00:08:05.820> it<00:08:05.849> up<00:08:06.060> just

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 
like and I didn't pick it up just

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.469 
like and I didn't pick it up just
because<00:08:06.570> i<00:08:06.750> thought<00:08:07.289> the<00:08:08.060> shading<00:08:09.060> wasn't<00:08:09.389> as

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 
because i thought the shading wasn't as

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:12.290 
because i thought the shading wasn't as
cool<00:08:09.720> but<00:08:10.110> you<00:08:10.320> know<00:08:10.470> this<00:08:10.919> definitely<00:08:11.729> has<00:08:12.240> a

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.300 
cool but you know this definitely has a

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.610 
cool but you know this definitely has a
much<00:08:12.780> quarter<00:08:13.169> look<00:08:13.349> to<00:08:13.530> it<00:08:13.680> so<00:08:14.330> um<00:08:15.470> until<00:08:16.470> next

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620 
much quarter look to it so um until next

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.039 
much quarter look to it so um until next
time<00:08:16.830> folks
