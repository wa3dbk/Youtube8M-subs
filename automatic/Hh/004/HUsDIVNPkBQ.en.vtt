on top of this floor and then we'll be

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.789 
on top of this floor and then we'll be
wrapping<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.659> chicken<00:01:09.960> wire<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.530> with

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
wrapping that with chicken wire and with

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.550 
wrapping that with chicken wire and with
galvanized<00:01:11.400> wire<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.970> plastering<00:01:12.930> outside

galvanized wire and plastering outside
the<00:01:13.710> walls<00:01:13.950> okay<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:14.909> these<00:01:15.060> two<00:01:15.509> steel

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the walls okay it's these two steel

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.990 
the walls okay it's these two steel
rings<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.409> assemble<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.040> two<00:01:17.340> circles<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
rings that assemble in two circles and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.719 
rings that assemble in two circles and
then<00:01:18.840> we're<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.560> using<00:01:19.860> galvanized<00:01:20.430> steel

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
then we're just using galvanized steel

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.179 
then we're just using galvanized steel
roofing<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:22.110> has<00:01:22.350> some<00:01:22.380> holes<00:01:22.830> drilled

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
roofing here that has some holes drilled

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.740 
roofing here that has some holes drilled
at<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> edge<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> edge<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.299> each<00:01:24.420> sheet

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
at the edge of the edge of each sheet

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.899 
at the edge of the edge of each sheet
and<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.860> wired<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.460> baling<00:01:26.880> wire

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
and it's just wired on with baling wire

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.380 
and it's just wired on with baling wire
and<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:28.140> make<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.500> big<00:01:28.799> circular<00:01:29.360> like<00:01:30.360> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
and we make this big circular like a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.830 
and we make this big circular like a
giant<00:01:30.990> TIG<00:01:31.229> n<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:32.189> becomes<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.729> forms<00:01:33.210> for

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
giant TIG n it becomes the forms for

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.290 
giant TIG n it becomes the forms for
forming<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> walls<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> tank

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.910 

we<00:01:41.300> are<00:01:41.479> firmly<00:01:41.900> convinced<00:01:42.500> that<00:01:42.590> these

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
we are firmly convinced that these

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.910 
we are firmly convinced that these
household<00:01:43.750> rainwater<00:01:44.750> harvesting<00:01:44.990> tanks<00:01:45.560> are

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
household rainwater harvesting tanks are

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.719 
household rainwater harvesting tanks are
a<00:01:46.340> very<00:01:46.940> cost<00:01:47.270> effective<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.050> sustainable

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
a very cost effective and sustainable

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.290 
a very cost effective and sustainable
solution<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:50.950> internation<00:01:51.979> once<00:01:52.760> we<00:01:53.000> build

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
solution to internation once we build

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.760 
solution to internation once we build
these<00:01:53.420> rain<00:01:53.690> tanks<00:01:54.110> for<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.290> families

these rain tanks for the families

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.249 
these rain tanks for the families
they'll<00:01:55.580> last<00:01:55.790> for<00:01:56.119> decades<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:56.960> the
