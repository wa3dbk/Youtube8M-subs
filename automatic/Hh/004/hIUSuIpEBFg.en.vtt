me<00:00:41.670> wrong<00:00:41.700> Sarkis<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.420> scoring<00:00:42.870> wells<00:00:43.110> but

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
me wrong Sarkis and scoring wells but

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.119 
me wrong Sarkis and scoring wells but
Tunisian<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:44.910> vinícius<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.870> seems<00:00:46.129> more

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
Tunisian just vinícius just seems more

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.779 
Tunisian just vinícius just seems more
relaxed<00:00:47.730> stronger<00:00:49.100> unloading<00:00:50.100> more<00:00:50.280> putting

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
relaxed stronger unloading more putting

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.950 
relaxed stronger unloading more putting
him<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> back<00:00:51.270> foot

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
him on the back foot

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
him on the back foot
I<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.920> cyclesounds<00:00:53.340> trying<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.000> pick

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
I think cyclesounds trying to just pick

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.939 
I think cyclesounds trying to just pick
his<00:00:54.300> shots<00:00:54.539> now<00:00:54.750> maybe<00:00:55.050> not<00:00:55.289> shut<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> points

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
his shots now maybe not shut the points

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.709 
his shots now maybe not shut the points
hope<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.730> steal<00:00:56.940> points<00:00:57.329> victory

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
hope you can steal points victory

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.750 
hope you can steal points victory

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
best weld and it seems like Sarkis had

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.230 
best weld and it seems like Sarkis had
was<00:03:26.710> more<00:03:26.890> of<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.070> counter<00:03:27.430> fighter<00:03:27.640> but<00:03:28.180> he

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
was more of a counter fighter but he

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.490 
was more of a counter fighter but he
just<00:03:28.420> couldn't<00:03:28.570> handle<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.960> early<00:03:29.290> pressure

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
just couldn't handle the early pressure

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.260 
just couldn't handle the early pressure
in<00:03:29.710> rounds<00:03:29.950> one<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.130> two<00:03:30.280> that's<00:03:30.760> why<00:03:30.970> we<00:03:31.120> did

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
in rounds one and two that's why we did

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.850 
in rounds one and two that's why we did
he<00:03:31.330> leave<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:31.690> too<00:03:31.840> late<00:03:32.020> he<00:03:32.170> was<00:03:32.290> moving<00:03:32.560> and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
he leave it too late he was moving and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.700 
he leave it too late he was moving and
he<00:03:32.950> needed<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.400> win<00:03:33.520> that<00:03:33.700> round<00:03:33.850> big<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.710> think

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
he needed to win that round big I think

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.140 
he needed to win that round big I think
he<00:03:35.770> did<00:03:35.920> lose<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.220> first<00:03:36.460> two<00:03:36.610> rounds<00:03:36.970> so

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
he did lose the first two rounds so

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.180 
he did lose the first two rounds so
he'll<00:03:38.050> be<00:03:38.170> interested<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.680> see<00:03:38.800> if<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:38.980> judges
