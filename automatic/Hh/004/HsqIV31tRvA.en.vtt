xbox one and the possibility of it

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.509 
xbox one and the possibility of it
having<00:00:20.570> backwards<00:00:21.140> compatibility<00:00:21.949> now<00:00:22.430> this

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
having backwards compatibility now this

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.100 
having backwards compatibility now this
isn't<00:00:22.700> something<00:00:23.030> I<00:00:23.270> made<00:00:23.539> up<00:00:23.570> this<00:00:23.870> is<00:00:23.990> not

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
isn't something I made up this is not

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.510 
isn't something I made up this is not

and you know who would be cool if this

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.750 
and you know who would be cool if this
would<00:00:27.110> happen<00:00:27.380> this<00:00:27.500> is<00:00:27.650> an<00:00:27.770> actual<00:00:28.220> interview

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
would happen this is an actual interview

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.550 
would happen this is an actual interview
that<00:00:28.910> happened<00:00:29.330> I<00:00:29.510> was<00:00:29.869> an<00:00:29.990> interview<00:00:30.410> with

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
that happened I was an interview with

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.290 
that happened I was an interview with
gamestop<00:00:30.770> and<00:00:31.400> the<00:00:31.490> company's<00:00:31.910> senior

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
gamestop and the company's senior

gamestop and the company's senior
director<00:00:32.780> Albert<00:00:33.530> pinay<00:00:34.340> oh<00:00:34.370> they're

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
basically asking him questions if it was

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.770 
basically asking him questions if it was
possible<00:00:36.739> for<00:00:37.100> there<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.520> be<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:38.059> backwards

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
possible for there to be a backwards

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.389 
possible for there to be a backwards
compatibility<00:00:39.500> with<00:00:39.530> using<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.160> cloud

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
compatibility with using the cloud

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.430 
compatibility with using the cloud
service<00:00:40.970> that<00:00:41.120> xbox<00:00:41.570> one<00:00:41.840> is<00:00:41.989> going<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.200> have

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
service that xbox one is going to have

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.069 
service that xbox one is going to have
now<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.730> way<00:00:43.850> that<00:00:43.880> it<00:00:44.120> were<00:00:44.239> work<00:00:44.510> it's<00:00:44.870> not

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
now the way that it were work it's not

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.780 
now the way that it were work it's not
going<00:00:45.200> to<00:00:45.290> be<00:00:45.380> exactly<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:46.399> way<00:00:46.520> that<00:00:46.550> you

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
going to be exactly the way that you

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.580 
going to be exactly the way that you
would<00:00:46.910> see<00:00:47.180> it<00:00:47.300> with<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:48.020> know<00:00:48.140> previous

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
would see it with you know previous

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.170 
would see it with you know previous
versions<00:00:48.980> of<00:00:49.100> backwards<00:00:49.520> compatibility

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
versions of backwards compatibility

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.600 
versions of backwards compatibility
which<00:00:50.329> would<00:00:50.510> be<00:00:50.630> kind<00:00:51.230> of<00:00:51.290> like<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:52.130> guess

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
which would be kind of like the I guess

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.950 
which would be kind of like the I guess
you<00:00:52.700> could<00:00:52.730> say<00:00:52.940> like<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:53.120> ps2<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:53.780> were<00:00:53.870> able

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
you could say like the ps2 you were able

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.630 
you could say like the ps2 you were able
to<00:00:54.140> play<00:00:54.290> playstation<00:00:54.559> one<00:00:55.040> games<00:00:55.280> we<00:00:55.460> just

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
to play playstation one games we just

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.209 
to play playstation one games we just
put<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:55.880> game<00:00:56.059> in<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:56.840> most<00:00:57.649> ways<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:58.100> it

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
put the game in so most ways that it

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.700 
put the game in so most ways that it
happens<00:00:58.670> is<00:00:58.969> that<00:00:59.000> it's<00:00:59.480> usually<00:00:59.989> an<00:01:00.170> emulated

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
happens is that it's usually an emulated

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.340 
happens is that it's usually an emulated
version<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.430> console<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.180> ps3<00:01:02.750> had

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
version of the console so the ps3 had

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.529 
version of the console so the ps3 had
the<00:01:03.590> 40<00:01:03.950> gig<00:01:04.159> and<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.430> 60<00:01:04.850> gig<00:01:05.030> version<00:01:05.239> of

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
the 40 gig and the 60 gig version of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.450 
the 40 gig and the 60 gig version of
itself<00:01:05.899> and<00:01:06.170> those<00:01:06.649> two<00:01:06.680> versions<00:01:07.250> who<00:01:07.369> were

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
itself and those two versions who were

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.240 
itself and those two versions who were
actually<00:01:07.939> able<00:01:08.090> to<00:01:08.539> go<00:01:09.259> back<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:09.560> put<00:01:10.039> your

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
actually able to go back and put your

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.920 
actually able to go back and put your
ps2<00:01:10.579> games<00:01:11.000> in<00:01:11.180> there<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.479> would<00:01:11.570> play<00:01:11.780> in

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
ps2 games in there and it would play in

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.359 
ps2 games in there and it would play in
but<00:01:12.110> you<00:01:12.350> know<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.560> games<00:01:12.740> would<00:01:12.950> be<00:01:12.979> glitchy

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
but you know the games would be glitchy

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.649 
but you know the games would be glitchy
sometimes<00:01:13.940> some<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.270> games<00:01:14.450> weren't

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
sometimes some of the games weren't

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.180 
sometimes some of the games weren't
running<00:01:14.840> perfect<00:01:15.409> and<00:01:15.619> it<00:01:15.710> was<00:01:15.830> only<00:01:15.920> because

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
running perfect and it was only because

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.580 
running perfect and it was only because
the<00:01:16.670> console<00:01:17.030> was<00:01:17.150> emulating<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.930> ps2<00:01:18.229> it

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
the console was emulating the ps2 it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.190 
the console was emulating the ps2 it
wasn't<00:01:18.890> actually<00:01:19.280> playing<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.790> game<00:01:20.080> so<00:01:21.080> the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
wasn't actually playing the game so the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.750 
wasn't actually playing the game so the
way<00:01:21.320> that<00:01:21.350> backwards<00:01:21.920> compatibility<00:01:22.610> would

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
way that backwards compatibility would

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.210 
way that backwards compatibility would
actually<00:01:23.299> work<00:01:23.479> on<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.780> Xbox<00:01:24.229> one<00:01:24.560> is<00:01:24.740> that

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
actually work on the Xbox one is that

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.100 
actually work on the Xbox one is that
you<00:01:25.340> would<00:01:25.460> be<00:01:25.580> able<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.880> stream<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.420> game<00:01:26.750> to

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
you would be able to stream the game to

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.800 
you would be able to stream the game to
your<00:01:27.290> console<00:01:27.830> itself<00:01:28.010> and<00:01:28.549> with<00:01:29.330> this<00:01:29.540> kind

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
your console itself and with this kind

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.750 
your console itself and with this kind
of<00:01:29.900> service<00:01:30.260> would<00:01:30.470> depend<00:01:30.890> completely<00:01:31.220> and

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
of service would depend completely and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.910 
of service would depend completely and
how<00:01:31.970> good<00:01:32.210> your<00:01:32.780> internet<00:01:33.140> provider<00:01:33.290> is<00:01:33.710> how

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
how good your internet provider is how

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.590 
how good your internet provider is how
could<00:01:34.100> your<00:01:34.159> upload<00:01:34.549> speed<00:01:34.580> is<00:01:34.970> your<00:01:35.180> download

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
could your upload speed is your download

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.289 
could your upload speed is your download
speed<00:01:35.630> all<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.290> that<00:01:36.409> kind<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.740> stuff<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.670> one

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
speed all of that kind of stuff so one

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.969 
speed all of that kind of stuff so one
of<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.479> problems<00:01:38.810> with<00:01:38.900> streaming<00:01:39.380> games<00:01:39.650> is

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
of the problems with streaming games is

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.170 
of the problems with streaming games is
that<00:01:40.159> if<00:01:40.280> someone<00:01:40.520> doesn't<00:01:40.670> have<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:40.909> good

that if someone doesn't have a good

that if someone doesn't have a good
enough<00:01:41.299> internet<00:01:41.840> connection<00:01:42.290> they<00:01:42.470> might<00:01:42.619> be

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
enough internet connection they might be

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.350 
enough internet connection they might be
lagging<00:01:43.250> their<00:01:43.430> controls<00:01:43.850> might<00:01:44.060> not<00:01:44.240> be

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
lagging their controls might not be

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.120 
lagging their controls might not be
one-to-one<00:01:44.990> because<00:01:45.710> they're<00:01:45.830> trying<00:01:46.040> to

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
one-to-one because they're trying to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.740 
one-to-one because they're trying to
stream<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.490> game<00:01:46.759> into<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.180> console<00:01:47.600> itself

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
stream the game into the console itself

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.840 
stream the game into the console itself
now<00:01:48.680> with<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:49.009> being<00:01:49.070> said<00:01:49.310> during<00:01:49.700> the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
now with that being said during the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.130 
now with that being said during the
interview<00:01:50.210> they<00:01:50.240> were<00:01:50.479> talking<00:01:50.810> about<00:01:50.900> how

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
interview they were talking about how

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.780 
interview they were talking about how
it's<00:01:51.350> so<00:01:51.530> hard<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.829> describe<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.460> actual

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
it's so hard to describe the actual

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.490 
it's so hard to describe the actual
cloud<00:01:53.180> service<00:01:53.659> because<00:01:53.990> there<00:01:54.110> are<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:54.259> many

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
cloud service because there are so many

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.469 
cloud service because there are so many
things<00:01:54.799> you<00:01:54.860> can<00:01:55.009> do<00:01:55.159> with<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:56.450> course

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
things you can do with it and of course

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.789 
things you can do with it and of course
we're<00:01:56.930> also<00:01:57.049> saying<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:57.470> they<00:01:57.560> were<00:01:57.619> trying

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
we're also saying that they were trying

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.670 
we're also saying that they were trying
to<00:01:57.920> figure<00:01:58.100> out<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:59.000> know<00:01:59.030> over<00:01:59.450> time<00:01:59.720> if<00:02:00.140> it

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
to figure out you know over time if it

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.440 
to figure out you know over time if it
was<00:02:00.799> something<00:02:01.189> that<00:02:01.220> would<00:02:01.640> be<00:02:01.820> effective

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
was something that would be effective

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
was something that would be effective
that<00:02:02.630> would<00:02:02.720> be<00:02:02.780> something<00:02:02.960> that's<00:02:03.140> good<00:02:03.380> to

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
that would be something that's good to

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.319 
that would be something that's good to
experience<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.369> course<00:02:04.579> how<00:02:05.030> much<00:02:05.210> it

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
experience and of course how much it

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:06.940 
experience and of course how much it
would<00:02:05.420> cost<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.810> deliver<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.380> service<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:06.860> if

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
would cost to deliver the service so if

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.929 
would cost to deliver the service so if
it<00:02:07.070> was<00:02:07.189> something<00:02:07.369> I<00:02:07.490> was<00:02:07.610> going<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.790> take<00:02:07.880> a

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
it was something I was going to take a

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.580 
it was something I was going to take a
lot<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.209> money<00:02:08.329> then<00:02:08.989> they<00:02:09.079> weren't<00:02:09.289> gonna<00:02:09.349> do

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
lot of money then they weren't gonna do

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.050 
lot of money then they weren't gonna do
it<00:02:09.619> because<00:02:09.979> obviously<00:02:10.189> it<00:02:10.640> feels<00:02:10.789> going<00:02:10.970> to

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
it because obviously it feels going to

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.520 
it because obviously it feels going to
cost<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.689> lot<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.840> money<00:02:11.959> they<00:02:12.230> might<00:02:12.349> even

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
cost a lot of money they might even

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.140 
cost a lot of money they might even
charge<00:02:12.920> for<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.340> service<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.909> a<00:02:13.939> lot<00:02:14.060> of

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
charge for the service and a lot of

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.459 
charge for the service and a lot of
people<00:02:14.239> might<00:02:14.450> not<00:02:14.599> be<00:02:14.689> interested<00:02:14.989> in<00:02:15.290> that

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:15.469 
people might not be interested in that

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.619 
people might not be interested in that
but<00:02:16.189> nonetheless<00:02:16.519> I<00:02:16.879> think<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.180> pretty<00:02:17.329> cool

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
but nonetheless I think it's pretty cool

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:18.580 
but nonetheless I think it's pretty cool
is<00:02:17.779> a<00:02:17.840> pretty<00:02:17.989> good<00:02:18.169> idea

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
is a pretty good idea

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.650 
is a pretty good idea
a<00:02:19.010> pretty<00:02:19.519> cool<00:02:19.730> idea<00:02:19.849> that<00:02:20.180> they<00:02:20.269> might<00:02:20.480> be

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
a pretty cool idea that they might be

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.720 
a pretty cool idea that they might be
able<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.019> actually<00:02:21.200> it'll<00:02:21.590> stream<00:02:21.860> maybe<00:02:22.430> not

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
able to actually it'll stream maybe not

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.089 
able to actually it'll stream maybe not
the<00:02:22.910> entire<00:02:23.239> xbox<00:02:23.780> 360<00:02:24.379> collection<00:02:24.860> or<00:02:24.950> maybe

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
the entire xbox 360 collection or maybe

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.600 
the entire xbox 360 collection or maybe
not<00:02:25.280> every<00:02:25.910> single<00:02:26.209> one<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.480> xbox<00:02:26.930> games

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
not every single one of the xbox games

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.680 
not every single one of the xbox games
but<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.700> would<00:02:28.819> be<00:02:28.849> kind<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.209> cool<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.420> be<00:02:29.629> able

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
but it would be kind of cool to be able

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.089 
but it would be kind of cool to be able
to<00:02:29.840> go<00:02:29.989> back<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.230> play<00:02:30.560> some<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.890> big

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
one I could be completely wrong it would

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.789 
one I could be completely wrong it would
be<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> pretty<00:03:05.299> cool<00:03:05.540> service<00:03:05.870> but<00:03:06.530> once<00:03:06.650> again

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799
