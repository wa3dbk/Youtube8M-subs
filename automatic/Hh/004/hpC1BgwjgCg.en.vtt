side I'm sure you guys can actually see
this<00:00:32.250> from<00:00:32.640> riot<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.270> angle<00:00:34.520> perfect

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
this from riot at this angle perfect

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.900 
this from riot at this angle perfect
there<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.880> go

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
there we go

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.369 
there we go
those<00:00:38.910> little<00:00:39.360> lug<00:00:39.600> nuts<00:00:39.809> for<00:00:39.960> those<00:00:40.110> tires

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
those little lug nuts for those tires

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.139 
those little lug nuts for those tires
were<00:00:40.469> pretty<00:00:40.860> pretty<00:00:41.309> hard<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.640> put<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.910> there

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
were pretty pretty hard to put on there

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.389 
were pretty pretty hard to put on there
but<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.649> managed<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.680> work<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.219> little

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
but I managed to work it out a little

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.639 
but I managed to work it out a little
bit<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> back<00:00:46.620> looks

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
bit I think this is what the back looks

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.119 
bit I think this is what the back looks
like<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> take<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:49.129> take

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
like and I'm just going to take my take

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.860 
like and I'm just going to take my take
from<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> different<00:00:50.520> angle<00:00:50.789> possibly<00:00:53.719> there<00:00:54.719> we

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
from a different angle possibly there we

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.160 
from a different angle possibly there we
go<00:00:55.050> that's<00:00:55.320> exactly<00:00:55.860> what<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.039> looks<00:00:56.219> like

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.240 

it's<00:01:01.170> sort<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.440> dirty<00:01:01.620> from<00:01:01.829> inside<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
it's sort of dirty from inside and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.030 
it's sort of dirty from inside and
really<00:01:02.460> take<00:01:02.699> take<00:01:03.180> my<00:01:03.300> time<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> clean<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.960> up

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
really take take my time to clean it up

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.179 
really take take my time to clean it up
as<00:01:06.030> far<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.600> inside<00:01:07.140> goes<00:01:07.439> I'm<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:07.950> gonna

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
as far as the inside goes I'm just gonna

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.330 
as far as the inside goes I'm just gonna
open<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.390> real<00:01:09.659> quick<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.170> don't<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:11.189> some

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
reason I don't like the actual bodies
