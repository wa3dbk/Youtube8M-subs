00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.290
 this cold front 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.200
 She will pass over the south of Brazil. 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.620
 very quickly what does this mean 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.800
 means that polar air will advance 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.500
 by argentine, right and wrong in uruguay 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.520
 paraguay is very fast during the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.320
 Saturday 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.390
 this polar air will enter very 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.420
 quickly on the southern region of Brazil 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.840
 so who is here in the north of 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.230
 stop making sense there know of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.660
 late at night a fresh wind so already 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.570
 will start to change now big fall 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.829
 temperature in south brazil happens 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.930
 even there then on the 22nd on the 23rd 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.420
 this projection that you are seeing here 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.789
 indicates the projection of the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.510
 minimum temperatures for the southern region 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.530
 of Brazil with entry of this polar mass 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.510
 expectation that we will have to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.699
 example there is already in the day on the 22 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.309
 some temperatures below or near 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.590
 of 10 degrees on the border with Uruguay 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.340
 in other places here also from region 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.189
 serrana 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.340
 the first Sunday of autumn will be 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.130
 really blanket in the south of Brazil and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.930
 Everybody there screw well and because 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.270
 It's going to be cool, right? 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.470
 when it comes to this polar air 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.409
 the southeast region 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.630
 who else will feel this fall from 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.970
 temperature is paulo ne 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.159
 the cold wind of this polar mass must 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.140
 invade são paulo already and during a Saturday 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.310
 but it is mainly on Sunday and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.320
 Monday 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.869
 with the combination of lots of rain 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.030
 cloudiness and polar air that we are going 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.340
 really having two days with 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 pleasant temperatures in são paulo with 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.920
 It feels really cold the same thing 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.930
 to areas of Rio de Janeiro on the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.979
 city of rio de janeiro the fall of 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.869
 temperature 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.790
 particularly on Saturday Sunday 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.829
 for Sunday that during Sunday what 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.200
 It should be the most pronounced all this 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.600
 region here the southern mine triangle 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.420
 You 'll also feel a little, huh? 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.660
 gives a temperature drop but this 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:17.230
 polar air will not have the strength to arrive 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.540
 the holy spirit or north of mines 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.750
 arrive a very very softened way 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.100
 in the projection being made 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.320
 currently in areas such as southern 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.420
 mato grosso do sul in this area that 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.010
 on the border with Paraguay will have 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.330
 temperatures much lower than 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.200
 Sao Paulo happens 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.630
 It is possible that we will have a 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.820
 the weekend is not temperatures until 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.810
 near maybe 10 degrees here in the south 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.810
 from mato grosso do sul
