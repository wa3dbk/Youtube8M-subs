00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
package they will most likely be

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.120 
package they will most likely be
upgraded<00:01:41.090> together<00:01:41.659> in<00:01:41.870> in<00:01:42.080> a<00:01:42.290> laboratory<00:01:42.470> so

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
upgraded together in in a laboratory so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.920 
upgraded together in in a laboratory so
you<00:01:43.190> know<00:01:43.490> how<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.730> which<00:01:44.180> spawns<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
you know how the which spawns the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.170 
you know how the which spawns the
skeletons<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.770> when<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.400> are<00:01:46.520> Gator<00:01:46.760> the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
skeletons and when you are Gator the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.300 
skeletons and when you are Gator the
question<00:01:47.540> is<00:01:47.720> will<00:01:48.260> a<00:01:48.290> skeleton<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:49.100> the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
question is will a skeleton and the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.910 
question is will a skeleton and the
witch<00:01:49.460> be<00:01:49.640> operated<00:01:50.090> separately<00:01:50.510> or<00:01:51.500> will

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
witch be operated separately or will

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.100 
witch be operated separately or will
they<00:01:52.100> be<00:01:52.159> operated<00:01:52.670> together<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:53.870> will

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
they be operated together so you will

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.530 
they be operated together so you will
most<00:01:54.290> likely<00:01:54.440> need<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.950> level<00:01:55.159> 7<00:01:55.520> laboratory<00:01:56.090> so

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
most likely need a level 7 laboratory so

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.390 
most likely need a level 7 laboratory so
that<00:01:56.570> sunset<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.409> also<00:01:57.800> unlocked<00:01:58.070> at<00:01:58.220> townhall

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
that sunset is also unlocked at townhall

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.140 
that sunset is also unlocked at townhall
9<00:01:59.080> again<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:00.409> don't<00:02:01.070> know<00:02:01.370> if<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:01.940> is<00:02:02.090> a

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
9 again I don't know if this is a

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.240 
9 again I don't know if this is a
package<00:02:02.420> they<00:02:02.840> are<00:02:02.930> put<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.200> together<00:02:03.320> so

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
package they are put it together so

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.370 
package they are put it together so
skeletons<00:02:04.790> go<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.030> low<00:02:05.240> of<00:02:05.360> skeletor's<00:02:06.110> go<00:02:06.320> too

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
skeletons go to low of skeletor's go too

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.949 
skeletons go to low of skeletor's go too
low<00:02:06.620> for<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:08.090> witch<00:02:08.239> goes<00:02:08.450> too<00:02:08.569> low<00:02:08.690> for

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
low for and the witch goes too low for

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.960 
low for and the witch goes too low for
or<00:02:09.289> there<00:02:09.649> have<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.009> be<00:02:10.069> separate<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:10.819> can

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
or there have to be separate so you can

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.570 
or there have to be separate so you can
have<00:02:11.120> like<00:02:11.299> a<00:02:11.330> level<00:02:11.659> 5<00:02:11.840> which<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:13.129> level<00:02:13.430> 1

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
have like a level 5 which and a level 1

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.100 
have like a level 5 which and a level 1
skelter<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.269> don't<00:02:14.569> know<00:02:14.659> how<00:02:14.780> many<00:02:14.840> levels

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
skelter I don't know how many levels

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.220 
skelter I don't know how many levels
they<00:02:15.409> have<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.769> everything<00:02:15.920> like

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
they have and everything like

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.910 
they have and everything like
that<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.690> stuff<00:02:18.690> like<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:18.989> also<00:02:19.349> want<00:02:19.890> to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
that and stuff like that also want to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.240 
that and stuff like that also want to
point<00:02:20.099> out<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:21.590> will<00:02:22.590> she<00:02:22.769> spawn<00:02:23.010> more

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
point out that will she spawn more

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.180 
point out that will she spawn more
skeletor's<00:02:23.879> when<00:02:24.269> her<00:02:24.450> level<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.140> higher<00:02:25.470> so

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
skeletor's when her level is higher so

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.190 
skeletor's when her level is higher so
there<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> cap<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.299> it<00:02:27.450> says<00:02:27.629> so<00:02:27.870> she<00:02:27.930> can

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
there is a cap like it says so she can

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.020 
there is a cap like it says so she can
maybe<00:02:28.409> only<00:02:28.739> spawn<00:02:29.069> like<00:02:29.190> 10<00:02:29.430> or<00:02:29.670> 20

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
maybe only spawn like 10 or 20

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.059 
maybe only spawn like 10 or 20
skeletor's<00:02:30.510> if<00:02:30.810> she's<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.379> over<00:02:31.560> one<00:02:31.830> let's

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
skeletor's if she's all over one let's

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.369 
skeletor's if she's all over one let's
say<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.090> when<00:02:33.269> she's<00:02:33.450> upgraded<00:02:33.959> well<00:02:34.080> she<00:02:34.200> spot

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
say so when she's upgraded well she spot

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.589 
say so when she's upgraded well she spot
memorials<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:34.980> 25<00:02:35.310> or<00:02:35.489> 30<00:02:36.120> years<00:02:36.209> of

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
memorials so like 25 or 30 years of

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.729 
memorials so like 25 or 30 years of
stuff<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.500> could<00:02:37.620> be<00:02:37.650> a

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
stuff like that so that could be a

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.979 
stuff like that so that could be a
possibility<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.640> hope<00:02:39.269> that's<00:02:39.510> true<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.870> but

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
possibility I hope that's true and but

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.860 
possibility I hope that's true and but
we<00:02:40.110> shall<00:02:40.260> see<00:02:40.610> lastly<00:02:41.690> how<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.840> world

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
we shall see lastly how in the world

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.479 
we shall see lastly how in the world
does<00:02:43.170> she<00:02:43.200> die<00:02:43.470> if<00:02:43.799> she<00:02:44.129> follows<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
does she die if she follows the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.339 
does she die if she follows the
skeletor's<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:45.390> she<00:02:45.569> will<00:02:45.659> probably<00:02:45.840> die<00:02:46.140> by

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
skeletor's then she will probably die by

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.680 
skeletor's then she will probably die by
stepping<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.799> range<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.190> some<00:02:47.430> defense<00:02:47.909> but<00:02:48.599> if

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
stepping in range of some defense but if

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.210 
stepping in range of some defense but if
she<00:02:48.780> doesn't<00:02:49.019> follow<00:02:49.319> us<00:02:49.530> say<00:02:49.650> deploy<00:02:50.010> her<00:02:50.099> at

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
she doesn't follow us say deploy her at

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.500 
she doesn't follow us say deploy her at
the<00:02:50.310> corner<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.790> base<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.269> she<00:02:51.360> does

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the corner of the base and she does

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.910 
the corner of the base and she does
respond<00:02:51.870> skeletor's<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.560> they<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:52.769> run

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
respond skeletor's and they just run

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.650 
respond skeletor's and they just run
through<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.220> buildings<00:02:53.940> then<00:02:54.209> there<00:02:54.510> might

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
through the buildings then there might

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.740 
through the buildings then there might
be<00:02:54.690> unlimited<00:02:55.730> skeletor's<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.150> then<00:02:57.599> we're

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
be unlimited skeletor's and then we're

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.420 
be unlimited skeletor's and then we're
gonna<00:02:57.870> have<00:02:58.079> a<00:02:58.109> time<00:02:58.440> limit<00:02:58.709> on<00:02:58.799> her<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.400> that

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
gonna have a time limit on her so that

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.849 
gonna have a time limit on her so that
she<00:02:59.730> actually<00:03:00.000> dies<00:03:00.359> out<00:03:00.629> so<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.680> really

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
she actually dies out so it really

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.680 
she actually dies out so it really
depends<00:03:02.190> whether<00:03:02.310> she<00:03:02.519> moves<00:03:02.730> or<00:03:02.879> not<00:03:03.000> she

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
depends whether she moves or not she

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.300 
depends whether she moves or not she
probably<00:03:04.049> doesn't<00:03:04.319> fly<00:03:04.680> because<00:03:04.920> she<00:03:05.190> has<00:03:05.280> a

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
probably doesn't fly because she has a

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.130 
probably doesn't fly because she has a
walking<00:03:05.760> staff<00:03:06.000> although<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.569> could<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.109> a

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
walking staff although you could have a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.020 
walking staff although you could have a
flying<00:03:07.470> unit<00:03:07.799> with<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.010> staff<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.430> guess<00:03:08.609> so

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
flying unit with the staff I guess so

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.670 
flying unit with the staff I guess so
but<00:03:09.480> we're<00:03:09.720> also<00:03:09.900> gonna<00:03:10.079> see<00:03:10.319> how<00:03:10.470> that

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
but we're also gonna see how that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.170 
but we're also gonna see how that
happens<00:03:11.040> one<00:03:11.849> last<00:03:12.090> thing<00:03:12.299> is<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:14.000> sneaky<00:03:15.000> a
