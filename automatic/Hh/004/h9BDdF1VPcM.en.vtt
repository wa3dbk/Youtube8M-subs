00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.000
 the cough and personal'm here today on map 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.219
 It's crazy interview because I need the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.830

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.540
 video now, yes it's been lately 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.320
 inviting some of my friends and I think 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.150
 What did I invite? 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.369
 I already invited you to read it. 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.050
 others too and I'm recording interviews 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.939
 only not so important that everything from 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.000
 one time only I have one 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.529
 The problem is the crew's question. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.650
 as well as the question folks question 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.930
 people is a picture where you who went 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.579
 written on our profile asks you why 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.010
 that the guy I 'm interviewing for 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.989
 I asked him did he understand I left 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.850
 What works then, I'll ask you. 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.070
 you now that it is difficult to you 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.730
 like the picture you want your other 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.879
 favorite type appear here do so 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.399
 now you can send one can send two 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.140
 You can send three but you must 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.020
 thus puts a man 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.300
 I'll give an example put pec 2 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.800
 dots and ask the question can make 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.049
 asks why youtube is favorite 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.119
 that I'll try to go after him or you 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.810
 and I will select those questions 20 pool 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.369
 your mother's friend from your 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.610
 pick up and ask a question for my 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.920
 mother asked that the state 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.200
 If the question is cool, I'll ask. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.820
 for the person interviewing but not 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.310
 Another October practice can be 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.890
 no one can be an egg can be is 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.140
 mike can very can everyone can be 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.380
 anybody tell me you write 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.049
 the comment is the youtube name 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.549
 What do you want me to see? 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.350
 In front of the question, did you understand? 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.540
 Something else I want to talk about, you have 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.310
 some dirt suggestion for I got 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.350
 change in series a-1 some frame 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.540
 something different I can 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.460
 doing that will make it more interesting is 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.110
 the board can also say that I am 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.020
 accepting opinions I want to make is 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.000
 to make a series more fun is more 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.549
 more interactive, not just 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.110
 sitting here in the same seat as the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.909
 last time I went to make a 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.290
 chat with him I want to do other 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.020
 things with others in October 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.820
 the new ones that will appear but that's it 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.090
 Right there, I wanted to know what kind of people this is. 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.470
 It's not just learned today it's 6:00 a.m. 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.879
 half past six will have a video of 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.650
 minecraft series 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.209
 so if you 're watching this video 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.099
 now you can use six and a half that will have 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.989
 a cool video for you to watch 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.629
 Beauty, if you see then that's it 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.860
 people do not need to evaluate the video only 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.989
 so he just needs to leave his 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.060
