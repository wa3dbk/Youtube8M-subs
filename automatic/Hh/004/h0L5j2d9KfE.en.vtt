hi<00:00:00.750> guys<00:00:00.960> Jason<00:00:01.469> here<00:00:01.500> from<00:00:01.949> cream<00:00:02.250> store

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hi guys Jason here from cream store

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.480 
hi guys Jason here from cream store
online.com<00:00:03.319> and<00:00:04.319> today's<00:00:04.799> review<00:00:04.980> I'm<00:00:05.400> going

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
online.com and today's review I'm going

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.690 
online.com and today's review I'm going
to<00:00:05.609> be<00:00:05.730> talking<00:00:06.359> about<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.839> new<00:00:07.700> gray

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
to be talking about the new gray

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.509 
to be talking about the new gray
wrinkles<00:00:09.150> quantum<00:00:09.690> max<00:00:10.040> so<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
wrinkles quantum max so this is the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.289 
wrinkles quantum max so this is the
quantum<00:00:11.969> force<00:00:13.190> and<00:00:14.190> you're<00:00:15.030> looking<00:00:15.240> at

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
quantum force and you're looking at

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.540 
quantum force and you're looking at
about<00:00:15.389> four<00:00:15.750> or<00:00:15.900> five<00:00:16.049> grains<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
about four or five grains here on the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.060 
about four or five grains here on the
quantum<00:00:17.940> force<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.840> see<00:00:19.080> there<00:00:19.320> one<00:00:19.680> two

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
quantum force you can see there one two

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.700 
quantum force you can see there one two
three<00:00:20.670> four<00:00:21.570> five<00:00:22.050> maybe<00:00:22.289> five<00:00:22.590> grains<00:00:22.800> very

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
three four five maybe five grains very

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.170 
three four five maybe five grains very
very<00:00:25.710> dull<00:00:26.010> grains<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.519> can't<00:00:26.730> really<00:00:26.910> see

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
very dull grains you can't really see

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.779 
very dull grains you can't really see
the<00:00:27.300> grains<00:00:27.510> really<00:00:27.810> closely<00:00:28.460> but<00:00:29.460> that's<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the grains really closely but that's the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:42.319 
the grains really closely but that's the
quantum<00:00:30.150> force<00:00:40.850> because<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.000> means<00:00:42.210> you

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
quantum force because that means you

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.880 
quantum force because that means you
can't<00:00:42.570> oil<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> face<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.350> back<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
can't oil the face of the back and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.250 
can't oil the face of the back and
that's<00:00:44.190> certainly<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.610> problem<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.239> year<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.050> two

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that's certainly a problem a year or two

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.869 
that's certainly a problem a year or two
down<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.469> line<00:00:46.739> when<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.129> back<00:00:47.280> starts<00:00:47.520> dry

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
down the line when your back starts dry

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.220 
down the line when your back starts dry
now<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:49.200> that's<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> force<00:00:49.829> pretty<00:00:50.399> nice<00:00:50.610> back

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
now so that's the force pretty nice back

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.040 
now so that's the force pretty nice back
over<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.469> I've<00:00:52.649> got<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.809> quantum<00:00:54.809> players

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
over here I've got the quantum players

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.720 
over here I've got the quantum players
now<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.219> other<00:00:56.399> end

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
now this on the other end

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.619 
now this on the other end
super<00:00:57.090> bat<00:00:57.440> really<00:00:58.440> nice-looking<00:00:58.739> grains<00:00:59.629> one

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
super bat really nice-looking grains one

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
ten maybe eleven grains slight little

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.969

blemish<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:06.900> over<00:01:07.140> there<00:01:07.320> but<00:01:07.560> nothing<00:01:07.830> too

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
blemish right over there but nothing too

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.149 

here<00:01:26.070> we've<00:01:26.220> got<00:01:29.090> very<00:01:30.090> good<00:01:30.180> looking<00:01:30.630> back

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
here we've got very good looking back

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.100 
here we've got very good looking back
one<00:01:32.159> two<00:01:32.400> three<00:01:32.700> four<00:01:33.030> five<00:01:33.299> six<00:01:33.600> seven<00:01:33.869> eight

nine<00:01:34.350> grains<00:01:36.049> no<00:01:37.049> poly<00:01:37.380> code<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.220> as

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
nine grains no poly code on this and as

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:48.850 
nine grains no poly code on this and as
you<00:01:38.430> guys<00:01:38.579> know<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.880> prefer<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.630> obviously

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.420 

nice<00:01:49.860> pink<00:01:50.310> good<00:01:51.180> balance<00:01:53.600> really<00:01:54.600> good<00:01:54.840> feel

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
nice pink good balance really good feel

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.679 
nice pink good balance really good feel
so<00:01:56.430> very<00:01:56.880> good<00:01:57.149> very<00:01:57.810> nice<00:01:58.079> looking<00:01:58.380> back<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
so very good very nice looking back and

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:12.020 
so very good very nice looking back and
just<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.780> quick<00:02:00.990> look<00:02:01.170> at<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:02.869> cupboard<00:02:11.030> all

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
just a quick look at the cupboard all

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.369 
just a quick look at the cupboard all
the<00:02:12.120> beds<00:02:12.300> come<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.629> toe<00:02:12.780> guards<00:02:13.200> etc<00:02:15.170> just<00:02:16.170> a

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
the beds come with toe guards etc just a

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.809 
the beds come with toe guards etc just a
quick<00:02:16.620> little<00:02:16.770> map<00:02:17.010> something<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.459> noticed

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
quick little map something I noticed

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.190 
quick little map something I noticed
about<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.239> Quantum's<00:02:18.690> right

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
about the Quantum's right

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.410 
about the Quantum's right
and<00:02:19.590> what<00:02:20.520> I'm<00:02:20.580> going<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.760> pick<00:02:20.940> up<00:02:21.030> here<00:02:21.270> is

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
and what I'm going to pick up here is

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.780 
and what I'm going to pick up here is
I'm<00:02:21.540> going<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.690> pick<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.459> gray<00:02:23.459> Nichols

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
I'm going to pick up the gray Nichols

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.180 
I'm going to pick up the gray Nichols
kaboom<00:02:24.090> okay<00:02:25.050> check<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.709> out

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
kaboom okay check it out

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.050 
kaboom okay check it out
both<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.150> them<00:02:27.239> have<00:02:27.360> got<00:02:27.480> flat<00:02:27.720> flat<00:02:28.290> toes

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
both of them have got flat flat toes

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.750 
both of them have got flat flat toes
completely<00:02:30.060> flat<00:02:30.300> toes<00:02:30.569> okay<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.800> if<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.730> look

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
completely flat toes okay so if you look

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.309 
completely flat toes okay so if you look
at<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.030> profile<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:37.110> bets<00:02:37.349> look<00:02:38.959> exactly<00:02:39.959> the

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
at the profile the bets look exactly the

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.479 
at the profile the bets look exactly the
same<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:41.810> my<00:02:42.810> opinion<00:02:43.319> is<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.500> David<00:02:44.099> Warner

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
same so my opinion is that David Warner

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.949 
same so my opinion is that David Warner
is<00:02:44.610> basically<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:46.560> using<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.980> quantum<00:02:47.250> and

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
is basically just using a quantum and

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.600 
is basically just using a quantum and
putting<00:02:48.959> his<00:02:49.140> stickers<00:02:49.500> on<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.250> now<00:02:50.400> there's

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
putting his stickers on and now there's

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.430 
putting his stickers on and now there's
absolutely<00:02:50.730> nothing<00:02:51.330> wrong<00:02:51.540> with<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
absolutely nothing wrong with that the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.150 
absolutely nothing wrong with that the
quantum<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> perfectly<00:02:53.519> good<00:02:53.640> bet<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:55.160> you

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
quantum is a perfectly good bet and you

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:08.690 
quantum is a perfectly good bet and you
know<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.310> kind<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.640> like<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.819> so<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:08.340> Orangemen

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
know I kind of like it so the Orangemen

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.360 
know I kind of like it so the Orangemen
you<00:03:08.879> prefer<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.360> black<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.750> pink<00:03:10.159> get<00:03:11.159> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
you prefer the black and pink get the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.259 
you prefer the black and pink get the
quantum<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.360> now<00:03:13.319> just<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.459> anyone<00:03:14.909> know<00:03:15.090> this

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
quantum and now just to anyone know this
