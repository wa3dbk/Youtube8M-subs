00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello customers always here in a 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.000
 new video and boys girls we go back to 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.340
 gta 5 online for pc with a map 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.170
 Awesome custom with a 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.150
 lots of jumps with button of loops and 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.040
 as I am living we have a new 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.929
 environment I'm not saying in many 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.760
 comments that since we play giving 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.920
 turn around a racing button that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.350
 Personalize it a little while ago and I'll stay 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.170
 in following me I love how it went 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.660
 to win a bet and there I played before 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.099
 just before this game that was with 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.410
 who good someone was for this we go 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.420
 bet 100 for it too then 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.540
 it served time to click but guys 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.410
 seriously girls this map is 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.629
 awesome I did not play it all 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.370
 I played in the other game for good one 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.379
 previous to this one to see a little 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.390
 how it was but I did not finish it just 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.020
 I arrived on top of that building that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.780
 you will see is an absolute past we go in 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.180
 serious the outline this medium I love 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.790
 superchulo let's go let's go let's go let's go 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.120
 first jump 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.970
 first jump with goals 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.010
 voucher worth voucher perfect and more vivid 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.260
 let's go vouchers here if I'm not wrong 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.960
 Okay, here we are, and I only got here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.430
 up here I do not know no me not in followed 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.080
 boy has started well or really 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.400
 perfectly let's put the camera 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.310
 from inside as always to do the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.790
 loops because it's so much easier 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.790
 so let's see let's see and let's go 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.009
 I'm going the command from hand to hand 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.159
 when he understands boy sends off 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.350
 control off 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.120
 come on come on come on come on let's go 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.840
 can can can can can be opened 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.840
 OK 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.030
 ok ok let's go let's go let's go let's go 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.600
 come on let's go where it falls where 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.650
 fall 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.100
 Perfect for Mrs. Fueren Sra Let's go 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.050
 This is the first time that the 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.140
 last time I did not want to pass that area just 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.480
 to discover a lot of the map and see it 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.400
 during the race and young guys and you 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.350
 I say let's go forward the people we're going to 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.300
 meet people out there and see 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.890
 where and curses because it's a map 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.640
 that seems like an absolute past 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.640
 but it 's all followed like this 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.750
 incredible now because you can jump 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.750
 one and suddenly the leagues 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.510
 but they were fast I stayed a 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.770
 a lot of time has stuck and it 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.209
 He turned off the command in the middle of the jump 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.560
 but the next one and you'll see the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.630
 next for you let's play a 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.860
 heading over on this map and we will win 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.200
 because I just stayed on the side 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.940
 no battery, so I have to catch him 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.310
 good if stuff not without batteries I have to 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.050
 buy some batteries because guys girls already 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.060
 we are here back to do this 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.680
 map let's see if we can win 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.030
 we are with two different people the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.430
 first who followed the game now 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.500
 and seriously it keeps increasing if you want 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.910
 add me to the game and others I'm free 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.430
 but there is no how are you seeing like 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.500
 on YouTube and I would love it because 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.480
 many times I want to play maps and it takes 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.670
 a lot in playing for what you 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.720
 I have commented that we are going to 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.720
 wait letting do this 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.639
 but same friend friend yohan could for 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.170
 what I have commented to you that many 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.939
 Sometimes I have to wait a lot for 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:36.090
 play the game because it appeared 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:38.489
 mima westin south so he asked going up 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.799
 because it took a long time for people to join 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.389
 and let's see, let's see, let's see 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.560
 this has to be done from inside this 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.930
 it is the most complicated part of this map 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.239
 after more or less calls pretty well 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.310
 but this part is very complicated about 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.170
 a whole leap the rest no but there is one 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.230
 which is quite difficult 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.740
 my mom was already gone she left me already 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.740
 he left 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.010
 let's see if we get it fast 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.380
 soccer not always here maya we laugh it the 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.430
 we would do if you enter here badly 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.830
 no no no no no no no what is perfect 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.680
 but this does not happen nothing does not happen here 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.770
 and I 'm still here I have a lot of difficulty 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.090
 to spend this hurts because they with 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.070
 the camera inside is quite enough for me 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.280
 easier but it still costs me a 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.400
 bunch especially in this part day in 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.440
 my grandparents martÃ­n come come, now it's worth 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.950
 it is again come in 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.950
 let's enjoy spending it 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.580
 It's okay, it's not good, it's not good 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.720
 very, very good break very, 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.189
 very good 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.180
 let's see please concentrate 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.180
 concentration 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:07.410
 let's go in case that uncle site that 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.970
 damn site that damn site is not 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.590
 can be here in some way 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.590
 without having to do 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:19.540
 let's go down here because this year 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.360
 rare 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.330
 come on let's go come on let's go 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.450
 living there I'm going to spend a lot of 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.450
 times 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.460
 I'm going to give it a bunch of times because 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.690
 because it does not come out to me or it is impossible 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.060
 if I'm not able to do it yes that 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:40.550
 pass 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:43.280
 ok ok let's go let's go let's go 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:47.380
 lookers here so you can not 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.380
 mouse that mouse 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.090
 we go there then here we continue here 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.430
 we continue as you see is that I think that 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:00.700
 is a little bit wrong because there is a 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.700
 part there that like that same 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.479
 to good 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.250
 there is a part there that like stumbling 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.199
 not the other yes that it can be that 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.120
 difficulty and others do not leave me but there 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.090
 a part in the last one that you saw that 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.449
 I stumbled that it stays like I do not work 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.840
 and you do not know that here here now now 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.129
 bavaria now we are going very good kids 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.699
 at last 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:31.419
 finally we will indicate 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:33.309
 turn around turn around but well 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.499
 well well finally finally we get 

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:40.029
 pass was not done my mother had me of 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:42.879
 studied already or are we going that's seriously the 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:45.659
 color that I put to the car I think 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:48.669
 so cool said the blue this as well 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:51.759
 metallic and such with the details in 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.379
 white I like a lot how is and 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.070
 apart from that I have to put even the 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:58.080
 engine improvements that you told me 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.870
 better so as far as even to 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.550
 suspensions and everything racing and everything 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:09.090
 this and where to put a lot of 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:10.969
 cost I think 750,000 hours and had a 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:14.959
 million and something 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:16.549
 and I was almost without anything of 400 thousand and 

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:17.749
 every improvement every engine improvement and 

00:07:16.549 --> 00:07:20.509
 some engine improvements that palin that 

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:22.459
 did not make 40,000 or 50,000 or a 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:24.529
 we go away then I have to follow 

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:27.289
 when racing and earning money and 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:30.199
 doing missions to improve it to the fullest 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.610
 now we always see and guys girls 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:33.079
