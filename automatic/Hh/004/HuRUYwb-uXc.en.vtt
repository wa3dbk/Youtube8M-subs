collar we're pinning it on backwards so

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.730 
collar we're pinning it on backwards so
that<00:04:31.700> when<00:04:32.030> we<00:04:32.180> sew<00:04:32.419> it<00:04:32.570> on<00:04:32.720> it's<00:04:33.410> going<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.650> be

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
that when we sew it on it's going to be

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.159 
that when we sew it on it's going to be
a<00:04:33.770> clean<00:04:34.190> line<00:04:34.580> we're<00:04:35.210> going<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.390> make<00:04:36.110> a

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
a clean line we're going to make a

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.710 
a clean line we're going to make a
zig-zag<00:04:36.530> stitch<00:04:36.770> all<00:04:37.280> along<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:38.000> outer<00:04:38.270> edges

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
zig-zag stitch all along the outer edges

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.690 
zig-zag stitch all along the outer edges
so<00:04:39.110> that<00:04:39.140> we're<00:04:39.380> getting<00:04:39.500> both<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.310> color<00:04:40.550> of

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
so that we're getting both the color of

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:47.500 
so that we're getting both the color of
the<00:04:40.910> sweatshirt<00:04:41.419> and<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:42.230> old<00:04:42.380> hem

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.780 

what<00:04:48.050> we're<00:04:48.200> going<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.560> do<00:04:48.680> is<00:04:48.890> actually<00:04:49.310> so

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
what we're going to do is actually so

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.080 
what we're going to do is actually so
another<00:04:50.060> stitch<00:04:50.570> really<00:04:51.200> close<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.620> hem

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
another stitch really close to the hem

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.190 
another stitch really close to the hem
right<00:04:53.090> there<00:04:53.390> and<00:04:53.600> what<00:04:53.750> that's<00:04:53.900> going<00:04:54.020> to<00:04:54.080> do

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
right there and what that's going to do

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.660 
right there and what that's going to do
is<00:04:54.290> it's<00:04:54.320> going<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.620> fasten<00:04:55.070> our<00:04:55.280> stitches

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
is it's going to fasten our stitches

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.330 
is it's going to fasten our stitches
down<00:04:55.820> so<00:04:56.090> this<00:04:56.300> doesn't<00:04:56.480> just<00:04:56.630> flap<00:04:57.050> up<00:04:57.290> so<00:04:58.190> now

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
down so this doesn't just flap up so now

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.040 
down so this doesn't just flap up so now
that<00:04:58.490> we've<00:04:58.610> got<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:58.850> caller<00:04:59.120> all<00:04:59.420> nice<00:04:59.780> and

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
that we've got the caller all nice and

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.230 
that we've got the caller all nice and
clean<00:05:00.200> we're<00:05:00.590> going<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.860> cut<00:05:01.130> from<00:05:01.610> our<00:05:01.880> new

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
clean we're going to cut from our new

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.320 
clean we're going to cut from our new
collar<00:05:02.540> to<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.500> edge<00:05:03.770> of<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.730> army<00:05:05.090> and<00:05:05.180> to

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
collar to the edge of the army and to

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.990 
collar to the edge of the army and to
ensure<00:05:05.690> that<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.380> right<00:05:06.980> side<00:05:07.280> is<00:05:07.550> exactly

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
ensure that the right side is exactly

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.280 
ensure that the right side is exactly
the<00:05:08.180> same<00:05:08.330> to<00:05:08.480> the<00:05:08.540> left<00:05:08.750> side<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.110> they're

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
the same to the left side and they're

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.110 
the same to the left side and they're
both<00:05:09.410> symmetrical<00:05:10.130> we're<00:05:10.610> going<00:05:10.790> to<00:05:10.940> lay<00:05:11.090> it

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
both symmetrical we're going to lay it

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.210 
both symmetrical we're going to lay it
down<00:05:11.360> flat<00:05:11.600> so<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.080> we<00:05:12.290> can<00:05:12.440> actually<00:05:12.620> fold

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
down flat so that we can actually fold

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.690 
down flat so that we can actually fold
it<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:13.460> Mark<00:05:14.240> it<00:05:14.420> and<00:05:14.690> know<00:05:14.870> where<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.200> cut<00:05:15.380> it

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
it and Mark it and know where to cut it

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.800 
it and Mark it and know where to cut it
so<00:05:16.700> now<00:05:16.790> at<00:05:16.820> this<00:05:16.940> point<00:05:17.180> if<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:17.390> was<00:05:17.510> making

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
so now at this point if I was making

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.300 
so now at this point if I was making
this<00:05:17.870> for<00:05:18.080> myself<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.560> would<00:05:18.680> probably<00:05:18.860> try<00:05:19.220> it

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
this for myself I would probably try it

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.210 
this for myself I would probably try it
on<00:05:19.550> to<00:05:19.790> see<00:05:19.820> just<00:05:20.150> how<00:05:20.390> big<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:21.410> arm<00:05:21.650> holes<00:05:22.010> are

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
on to see just how big the arm holes are

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.580 
on to see just how big the arm holes are
