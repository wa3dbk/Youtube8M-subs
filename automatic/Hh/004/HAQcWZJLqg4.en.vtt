00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
from putting that tiny bit on how much

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.470 
from putting that tiny bit on how much
of<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.810> difference<00:03:41.139> it<00:03:41.290> makes<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:45.609> still<00:03:46.000> looks

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
of a difference it makes it still looks

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.430 
of a difference it makes it still looks
really<00:03:46.630> natural

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
really natural

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.150 
really natural
it<00:03:47.680> still<00:03:48.010> has<00:03:48.250> like<00:03:48.459> a<00:03:48.489> nice<00:03:48.790> glow<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:50.160> I'm

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
it still has like a nice glow to it I'm

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.849 
it still has like a nice glow to it I'm
normal<00:03:51.609> combination<00:03:51.880> but<00:03:52.599> I<00:03:52.930> think<00:03:53.560> this

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
normal combination but I think this

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.599 
normal combination but I think this
would<00:03:54.310> work<00:03:54.340> well<00:03:54.970> with<00:03:55.389> normal<00:03:56.200> combo<00:03:56.680> oily

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
would work well with normal combo oily

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.089 
would work well with normal combo oily
skin<00:03:57.910> it's<00:03:58.840> one<00:03:59.079> of<00:03:59.200> those<00:03:59.349> foundations<00:03:59.530> that

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
skin it's one of those foundations that

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.319 
skin it's one of those foundations that
might<00:04:00.579> stick<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.419> a<00:04:01.660> few<00:04:02.049> dry<00:04:02.260> patches<00:04:02.590> so

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
might stick to a few dry patches so

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.699 
might stick to a few dry patches so
maybe<00:04:04.329> just<00:04:04.569> be<00:04:04.690> careful<00:04:05.139> if<00:04:05.260> you<00:04:05.410> have<00:04:05.530> dry

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
maybe just be careful if you have dry

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.680 
maybe just be careful if you have dry
skin<00:04:05.799> you<00:04:06.250> might<00:04:06.430> need<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.150> use<00:04:07.209> a<00:04:07.299> primer

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
skin you might need to use a primer

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.750 
skin you might need to use a primer
underneath<00:04:08.079> it<00:04:08.530> or<00:04:08.709> make<00:04:09.069> sure<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.370> use<00:04:09.549> and

normal<00:04:14.290> combo<00:04:14.799> skin<00:04:15.069> it<00:04:15.790> blends<00:04:16.180> perfectly<00:04:16.630> if

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
normal combo skin it blends perfectly if

photography<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:23.170> think<00:05:23.890> it<00:05:24.010> looks<00:05:24.160> really<00:05:24.430> good

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700

photography I think it looks really good
it<00:05:24.970> doesn't<00:05:25.150> flash<00:05:25.480> back<00:05:25.840> oh<00:05:26.170> look

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
really nice on the skin it kind of ticks

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.680 
really nice on the skin it kind of ticks
all<00:05:37.930> the<00:05:38.140> boxes<00:05:38.170> for<00:05:39.070> me<00:05:39.100> it<00:05:39.850> lasts<00:05:40.240> all<00:05:40.330> day<00:05:40.360> it

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
all the boxes for me it lasts all day it

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.720 
all the boxes for me it lasts all day it
covers<00:05:41.140> it<00:05:41.350> feels<00:05:41.650> lightweight<00:05:41.919> you<00:05:42.550> are

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
covers it feels lightweight you are

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.090 
covers it feels lightweight you are
getting<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.720> new<00:05:43.960> technology<00:05:44.740> that<00:05:44.770> goes

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
getting the new technology that goes

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.909 
getting the new technology that goes
into<00:05:45.460> these<00:05:45.880> kind<00:05:46.690> of<00:05:46.750> liquidy<00:05:47.230> foundations

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
into these kind of liquidy foundations

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.460 
into these kind of liquidy foundations
the<00:05:48.669> YSL<00:05:49.180> one<00:05:49.450> is<00:05:49.600> similar<00:05:49.960> as<00:05:50.110> well<00:05:50.260> I<00:05:50.320> think

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
the YSL one is similar as well I think

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.600 
the YSL one is similar as well I think
in<00:05:50.950> that<00:05:51.250> it's<00:05:51.820> a<00:05:51.910> liquid<00:05:52.380> but<00:05:53.380> it<00:05:54.250> really

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
in that it's a liquid but it really

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.880 
in that it's a liquid but it really
really<00:05:55.030> covers<00:05:55.450> and<00:05:55.750> locks<00:05:55.930> baller<00:05:56.320> so<00:05:56.830> you

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
really covers and locks baller so you

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.400 
really covers and locks baller so you
get<00:05:57.160> in<00:05:57.280> that<00:05:57.430> lightweight<00:05:57.910> feel<00:05:58.320> but<00:05:59.320> you

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
get in that lightweight feel but you

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.110 
get in that lightweight feel but you
still<00:05:59.650> get<00:05:59.770> in<00:05:59.919> the<00:06:00.010> coverage<00:06:00.340> you<00:06:00.400> want<00:06:00.550> if

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
still get in the coverage you want if

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.480 
still get in the coverage you want if
you<00:06:01.360> work<00:06:01.540> long<00:06:01.810> hours<00:06:02.020> you<00:06:02.919> will<00:06:03.070> love<00:06:03.220> this

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
you work long hours you will love this

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.280 
you work long hours you will love this
because<00:06:03.730> it<00:06:04.090> literally<00:06:04.540> looks<00:06:04.750> just<00:06:05.080> as

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
because it literally looks just as

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.650 
because it literally looks just as
perfect<00:06:05.500> at<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.340> end<00:06:06.460> of<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.730> day<00:06:06.880> as<00:06:07.419> when

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
perfect at the end of the day as when

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.210 
perfect at the end of the day as when
you<00:06:07.750> applied<00:06:08.050> it<00:06:08.080> in<00:06:08.260> the<00:06:08.350> morning<00:06:08.740> so<00:06:08.980> I

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220
