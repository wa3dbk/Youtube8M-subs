00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
they said that players who use those

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.090 
they said that players who use those
characters<00:03:41.079> are<00:03:41.260> going<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.470> be<00:03:41.560> happy<00:03:41.859> pretty

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
characters are going to be happy pretty

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.449 
characters are going to be happy pretty
much<00:03:43.769> hopefully<00:03:44.769> they<00:03:44.889> do<00:03:44.950> something<00:03:45.370> about

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
much hopefully they do something about

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.099 
much hopefully they do something about
bone<00:03:45.700> shaper<00:03:46.090> shinnok<00:03:46.389> I<00:03:46.540> know<00:03:46.660> they<00:03:46.959> will

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
bone shaper shinnok I know they will

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.559 
bone shaper shinnok I know they will
there's<00:03:47.410> no<00:03:47.799> way<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.670> they're<00:03:48.910> not<00:03:49.269> going<00:03:49.510> to

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
there's no way that they're not going to

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.000 
there's no way that they're not going to
be<00:03:49.720> doing<00:03:49.840> something<00:03:50.170> about<00:03:50.410> bone<00:03:50.620> shape<00:03:50.859> or

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
be doing something about bone shape or

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.460 
be doing something about bone shape or
shinnok<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.459> think<00:03:51.790> predators<00:03:52.660> damage<00:03:53.200> scaling

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
shinnok I think predators damage scaling

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.740 
shinnok I think predators damage scaling
is<00:03:53.950> gonna<00:03:54.220> be<00:03:54.400> normalized<00:03:54.970> um<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:55.660> know

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
is gonna be normalized um you know

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.360 
is gonna be normalized um you know
predator<00:03:56.170> gets<00:03:56.319> a<00:03:56.470> ridiculous<00:03:57.069> amount<00:03:57.099> of

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
predator gets a ridiculous amount of

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.240 
predator gets a ridiculous amount of
damage<00:03:58.290> because<00:03:59.290> his<00:03:59.470> combos<00:03:59.829> don't<00:04:00.010> scale

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
damage because his combos don't scale

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.449 
damage because his combos don't scale
properly<00:04:00.609> what<00:04:01.420> else<00:04:01.569> would<00:04:01.810> I<00:04:01.870> want<00:04:02.200> um<00:04:02.620> I

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
properly what else would I want um I

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.180 
properly what else would I want um I
mean<00:04:04.329> there<00:04:04.480> isn't<00:04:04.630> really<00:04:04.930> too<00:04:05.349> much<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.889> think

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
mean there isn't really too much I think

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.089 
mean there isn't really too much I think
Kung<00:04:06.430> Lao<00:04:06.609> is<00:04:06.940> fine<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.750> way<00:04:07.780> he<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:08.099> they
