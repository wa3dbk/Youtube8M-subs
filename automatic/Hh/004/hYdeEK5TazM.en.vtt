00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.780
 little goes tomorrow night to visit another founding year old club 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.579
 tour is special for you 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:14.119
 but well I have spent five years in that sense more to but 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.060
 actually i'm not at all concerned with that, it is about one to one 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.339
 victory 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.849
 that's eric les what expected reacted before the game 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.359
 a match that you 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.060
 we have to win and it will not be easy dnb has back then 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.980
 normally they come to feel strong at home for hours 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.020
 less so this season because they have scored the most points in the tour 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.780
 but good the last few weeks I think they are better next year 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.810
 so it will make interesting and more difficult years for uncertainty 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.370
 with bad weather 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 he also worked with that very well for half a year 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.560
 that they are within a distance of the first man 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.750
 from the very good feeling into the winter break 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.530
 he can speak of a them in a good first half of the season and the strange thing is that 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.670
 Make an unexpected slip against Roda JC 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.670
 and then there is still all 8 something else if you like that 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.580
 a 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.800
 yes and of course I never know what will happen next but 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.020
 the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.640
 He hopes that decline was a one-time marriage one 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.220
 then try to continue tomorrow as usual 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.900
 yes that it is that it only happened once 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.450
 well i showed them 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.260
 I have had his own images, I actually only have the 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.160
 show the first ten minutes when tamils ​​arrive 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.320
 and that was 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.210
 that was clear 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.140
 an incident between 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.190
 yes you know that they will sing tomorrow but the leader from eindhoven what was the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.190
 conclusion why did not succeed 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.730
 that evening the race started a very weak and 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.020
 during the game tried everything to change that but the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.020
 points out that is just very difficult when you get the bad gravel 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.520
 that is especially think of 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.520
 years we have to make sure that we have now sold everything 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.049
 we a victory in almelo norway inter champion 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.060
 otherwise, unexpectedly, it always tells a second or third photo 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:13.169
 top performance 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.180
 you had estimated that in advance at the start of the season, but at least you should 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:19.829
 stand halfway 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.299
 gia gent that is a very difficult market i must honestly say i have never been there 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.229
 thought of 9 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.389
 one then at a mercy just to a small group 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.569
 where what the boys had to come and years you never know what for 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.899
 what kind of boys are those 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:36.970
 totally people themselves are meilleur 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.970
 It has turned out to be sure 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.799
 then from sudan it starts not to a place but brought 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:46.740
 well maybe not at the start of the season either 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.769
 that results in the first half of the season 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.769
 but i didn't think i would play them 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.999
 at it that will be a beautiful americans 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:01.229
 played almost everything 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.509
 the country is trying the wave of violence
