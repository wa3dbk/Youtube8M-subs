gears<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.510> talk<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.900> little<00:00:10.230> bit<00:00:10.440> about<00:00:10.469> my

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
gears and talk a little bit about my

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.620 
gears and talk a little bit about my
project<00:00:11.760> that<00:00:11.910> I've<00:00:12.030> been<00:00:12.059> working<00:00:12.540> on

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
project that I've been working on

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.700 
project that I've been working on
recently<00:00:13.880> it's<00:00:14.880> actually<00:00:15.420> homemade<00:00:15.990> PVC

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
recently it's actually homemade PVC

train<00:00:17.070> horns<00:00:18.290> I<00:00:19.290> based<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.310> design<00:00:20.520> off<00:00:21.080> dozer

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
train horns I based the design off dozer

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.950 
train horns I based the design off dozer
boy<00:00:22.380> Miller's<00:00:22.830> horns<00:00:23.600> although<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> didn't

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
boy Miller's horns although I didn't

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.370 
boy Miller's horns although I didn't
actually<00:00:25.140> buy<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.830> plans<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.380> watched

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
actually buy the plans I just watched

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.960 
actually buy the plans I just watched
the<00:00:28.590> videos<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:28.949> tried<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.430> figure<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.789> how

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the videos and tried to figure out how

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.900 
the videos and tried to figure out how
to<00:00:30.000> build<00:00:30.240> them<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.600> I<00:00:31.500> know<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.279> not

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
to build them so I know this is not

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.150 
to build them so I know this is not
anything<00:00:33.449> like<00:00:33.629> what<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.019> normally<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.620> with

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
anything like what I normally do with

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
anything like what I normally do with
guns<00:00:35.519> and<00:00:35.699> all<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.570> still<00:00:37.230> think<00:00:37.680> it's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
guns and all that but I still think it's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.069 
guns and all that but I still think it's
worth<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:38.970> channel<00:00:39.390> because<00:00:39.720> it<00:00:39.930> has

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
worth going on my channel because it has

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.620 
worth going on my channel because it has
to<00:00:40.290> do<00:00:40.440> with<00:00:41.360> DIY<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.870> homemade<00:00:43.559> stuff<00:00:43.980> so

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
to do with DIY and homemade stuff so

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.400 
to do with DIY and homemade stuff so
anyway<00:00:45.630> here<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.530> horns<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:48.260> made<00:00:49.260> them<00:00:49.379> with

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
anyway here the horns I made them with

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.780 
anyway here the horns I made them with
three<00:00:49.800> introducers<00:00:51.320> my<00:00:52.320> diaphragms<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.340> cut

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
three introducers my diaphragms are cut

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.220 
three introducers my diaphragms are cut
from<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.680> Tupperware<00:00:55.680> storage<00:00:56.160> container

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
from a Tupperware storage container

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.260 
from a Tupperware storage container
they're<00:00:58.230> about<00:00:58.469> H<00:00:58.710> an<00:00:58.950> eighth<00:00:59.219> inch<00:00:59.250> thick<00:00:59.670> I'm

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
they're about H an eighth inch thick I'm

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.060 
they're about H an eighth inch thick I'm
not<00:01:00.629> sure<00:01:00.870> exactly<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.469> plastic<00:01:01.890> they<00:01:02.039> are

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
not sure exactly what plastic they are

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.729 
not sure exactly what plastic they are
but<00:01:02.460> they're<00:01:03.180> really<00:01:03.480> sturdy<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.259> they<00:01:04.500> make

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
but they're really sturdy so they make

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.060 
but they're really sturdy so they make
pretty<00:01:05.280> nice<00:01:05.489> sound<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.500> have<00:01:07.500> an<00:01:07.649> airline

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
pretty nice sound I have an airline

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.029 
pretty nice sound I have an airline
powering<00:01:08.729> both<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.240> horns<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.959> comes<00:01:10.830> off

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
powering both the horns that comes off

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.249 
powering both the horns that comes off
my<00:01:11.250> scuba<00:01:11.670> tank<00:01:11.910> and<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.910> horns<00:01:15.300> are<00:01:15.509> tuned<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
my scuba tank and the horns are tuned to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.960 
my scuba tank and the horns are tuned to
a<00:01:16.709> third<00:01:17.160> apart<00:01:18.289> although<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:20.069> distance<00:01:20.490> or

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
a third apart although the distance or

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.639 
a third apart although the distance or
the<00:01:21.270> length<00:01:21.660> is<00:01:22.259> very<00:01:22.679> close<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.649> I'm

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
the length is very close and I'm

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.380 
the length is very close and I'm
probably<00:01:25.860> going<00:01:26.039> to<00:01:26.099> cut<00:01:26.670> them<00:01:26.849> down<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> lot

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
probably going to cut them down a lot

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.839 
probably going to cut them down a lot
more<00:01:27.450> make<00:01:27.990> them<00:01:28.200> shorter<00:01:28.709> and<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> pitch

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:29.849 
more make them shorter and as the pitch

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:32.630 
more make them shorter and as the pitch
goes<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.149> I<00:01:30.509> think<00:01:31.039> they<00:01:32.039> will<00:01:32.250> actually

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
goes up I think they will actually

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.990 
goes up I think they will actually
become<00:01:32.789> a<00:01:33.000> bit<00:01:33.240> louder<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:35.130> here's<00:01:35.369> my<00:01:35.610> air

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
become a bit louder so here's my air

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.240 
become a bit louder so here's my air
tank<00:01:36.360> setup<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.140> got<00:01:37.920> some<00:01:38.250> nylon<00:01:38.840> tubing

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
tank setup I got some nylon tubing

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.430 
tank setup I got some nylon tubing
running<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.429> this<00:01:41.550> ball<00:01:41.880> valve<00:01:42.289> quarter-inch

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
running to this ball valve quarter-inch

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.089 
running to this ball valve quarter-inch
little<00:01:44.429> extension<00:01:45.030> handle<00:01:45.530> pretty<00:01:46.530> ghetto<00:01:46.800> in

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:47.099 
little extension handle pretty ghetto in

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:49.580 
little extension handle pretty ghetto in
this<00:01:47.280> stage<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:47.940> makes<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> easier<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.289> turn

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
this stage but makes it easier to turn

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.749 
this stage but makes it easier to turn
and<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.300> this<00:01:51.539> teed<00:01:51.959> off<00:01:51.989> with<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.250> pressure

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and I have this teed off with a pressure

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.260 
and I have this teed off with a pressure
gauge<00:01:54.470> zero<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> 3000<00:01:56.220> psi<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.179> was

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
gauge zero to 3000 psi the one that was

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.109 
gauge zero to 3000 psi the one that was
originally<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:58.080> this<00:01:58.500> tank<00:01:58.800> you<00:01:59.759> can<00:01:59.910> see

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
originally on this tank you can see

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.940 
originally on this tank you can see
right<00:02:00.330> now<00:02:00.539> it's<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:00.929> about<00:02:01.229> 200<00:02:01.979> psi<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.950> I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
right now it's at about 200 psi and I

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.790 
right now it's at about 200 psi and I
achieve<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.399> using<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:06.599> fridge<00:02:07.200> compressor

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
achieve that using my fridge compressor

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.130 
achieve that using my fridge compressor
over<00:02:08.190> here

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
over here

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.040 
over here
and<00:02:10.700> pressurize<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.940> input<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:12.630> my<00:02:12.810> shop

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
and pressurize the input with my shop

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.280 
and pressurize the input with my shop
compressor<00:02:15.350> so<00:02:17.090> yeah<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.120> connect<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.050> fridge

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
compressor so yeah I connect the fridge

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.940 
compressor so yeah I connect the fridge
compressor<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.220> output<00:02:21.180> here<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.050> open

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
compressor to this output here and open

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.600 
compressor to this output here and open
the<00:02:23.069> valve<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.520> fill<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:26.160> port<00:02:26.490> is

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
the valve to fill it and this port is

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.520 
the valve to fill it and this port is
blocked<00:02:26.940> off<00:02:27.180> because<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.690> thread<00:02:28.320> size

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
blocked off because that thread size

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.610 
blocked off because that thread size
isn't<00:02:29.420> standard<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.750> can't<00:02:31.110> really<00:02:31.410> use<00:02:31.590> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
isn't standard so I can't really use it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.190 
isn't standard so I can't really use it
it's<00:02:32.459> just<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.850> tad<00:02:33.090> bigger<00:02:33.360> than<00:02:33.660> quarter-inch

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
it's just a tad bigger than quarter-inch

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.750 
it's just a tad bigger than quarter-inch
so<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.860> can't<00:02:35.550> use<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:38.130> actually<00:02:38.459> a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
so I can't use it but this is actually a

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.820 
so I can't use it but this is actually a
pinch<00:02:39.150> where<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.730> PSI<00:02:41.730> gage<00:02:42.060> came<00:02:42.480> out<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:43.500> I

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
pinch where the PSI gage came out so I

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.590 
pinch where the PSI gage came out so I
was<00:02:44.310> able<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.640> use<00:02:44.820> regular<00:02:45.450> eighth<00:02:46.080> inch<00:02:46.440> NPT

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
was able to use regular eighth inch NPT

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.229 
was able to use regular eighth inch NPT
fittings<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.310> got<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.459> up<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.610> quarter-inch

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
fittings and I got it up to quarter-inch

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.949 
fittings and I got it up to quarter-inch
and<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.470> ball<00:02:52.650> valve<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:54.209> I'll<00:02:54.420> give<00:02:54.930> a

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
and to the ball valve so I'll give a

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.990 
and to the ball valve so I'll give a
couple<00:02:55.290> blasts<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.010> show<00:02:56.220> what<00:02:56.430> they<00:02:56.610> sound

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
couple blasts to show what they sound

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.290 
couple blasts to show what they sound
like

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
like

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.410 
like
you<00:02:58.290> won't<00:02:58.470> really<00:02:58.680> be<00:02:58.830> able<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.400> hear<00:02:59.760> the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
you won't really be able to hear the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.770 
you won't really be able to hear the
loudness<00:03:00.720> but<00:03:01.489> I'll<00:03:02.489> edit<00:03:02.790> in<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.209> couple<00:03:03.600> of

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
loudness but I'll edit in a couple of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.530 
loudness but I'll edit in a couple of
Clips<00:03:04.459> showing<00:03:05.459> how<00:03:05.580> loud<00:03:05.820> they<00:03:06.030> are<00:03:06.060> from

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
Clips showing how loud they are from

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.020 
Clips showing how loud they are from
further<00:03:06.870> away<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.590> can<00:03:07.980> kind<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.820> gauge

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
further away so you can kind of gauge

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.380 
further away so you can kind of gauge
how<00:03:09.930> loud<00:03:10.170> they<00:03:10.410> are<00:03:10.440> by<00:03:10.739> how<00:03:11.130> well<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.150> sound

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
how loud they are by how well the sound

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.979 
how loud they are by how well the sound
travels<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:14.090> I'm<00:03:15.090> just<00:03:15.269> going<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.480> use<00:03:15.720> this

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
travels so I'm just going to use this

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:29.990 
travels so I'm just going to use this
handle<00:03:16.739> here<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.250> try<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:18.260> do<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.290> one-handed

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.990 

again<00:03:31.000> not<00:03:31.239> sure<00:03:31.299> how<00:03:31.719> well<00:03:31.930> you<00:03:32.170> can<00:03:32.790> hear<00:03:33.790> it

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
again not sure how well you can hear it

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.979 
again not sure how well you can hear it
as<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.319> how<00:03:35.439> loud<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.040> but<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.810> really

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
as to how loud it is but that really

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.990 
as to how loud it is but that really
does<00:03:38.260> nothing<00:03:38.469> to<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:39.040> pressure<00:03:39.280> gauge<00:03:39.640> so

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
does nothing to the pressure gauge so

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.140 
does nothing to the pressure gauge so
I'm<00:03:40.209> expecting<00:03:40.599> this<00:03:41.049> tank<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:42.430> last<00:03:42.700> pretty

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
I'm expecting this tank to last pretty

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.099 
I'm expecting this tank to last pretty
long<00:03:43.239> for<00:03:43.870> me<00:03:44.790> if<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.970> put<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.299> in<00:03:46.450> my<00:03:46.599> car<00:03:46.900> or

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
long for me if I put it in my car or

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.020 
long for me if I put it in my car or
something<00:03:47.560> like<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.700> yeah<00:03:51.700> that's<00:03:51.909> about

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
something like that so yeah that's about

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.209 
something like that so yeah that's about
it<00:03:52.319> I'll<00:03:53.319> show<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.799> couple<00:03:54.069> clips<00:03:54.519> of<00:03:56.219> long

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:57.219 
it I'll show a couple clips of long

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.660 
it I'll show a couple clips of long
distance<00:03:57.810> recording<00:03:58.889> so<00:03:59.889> you<00:03:59.920> can<00:04:00.250> see<00:04:00.489> how

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
distance recording so you can see how

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.289 
distance recording so you can see how
far<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.720> sound<00:04:01.959> travels<00:04:02.470> but<00:04:03.000> other<00:04:04.000> than

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
far the sound travels but other than

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.409 
far the sound travels but other than
that<00:04:04.359> I<00:04:04.780> hope<00:04:05.769> you<00:04:06.040> enjoyed<00:04:06.370> this<00:04:07.150> is<00:04:07.299> my

that I hope you enjoyed this is my
homemade<00:04:07.720> train<00:04:08.049> horns<00:04:08.349> thanks<00:04:08.709> for<00:04:08.859> watching
