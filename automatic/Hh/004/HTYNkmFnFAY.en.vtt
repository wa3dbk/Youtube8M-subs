00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.129
 I'm going to prepare a rich party with 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:17.060
 kings for this we're going to need medium 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.720
 kilo of meat to sow half 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.720
 of a lettuce 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:30.250
 a quarter of cheese chiles rajas in low 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.509
 three lemons a little bit of vinegar a 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.950
 trickle of oil 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.810
 olive or who prefer 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.530
 oregano salt 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.920
 4 red tomatoes 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:50.250
 and an onion we are going to cook the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.250
 meat with salt and garlic 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.850
 I've already cooked the meat here with a 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.590
 garlic clove salt and a piece of onion 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.200
 let's wait for it to cook 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.060
 and let it be soft and leave it 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.060
 cool and we crumble it 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.040
 I'm already finely chopping the lettuce 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.960
 and I'm going to continue with all this vegetable 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.590
 it happened to me to tell them that the practice 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.750
 let's go with a rich soup of 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 cream or if they want mayonnaise for 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.390
 seize on the toast 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.020
 the meat is already cooked, let's hope that 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.020
 cool to celebrate 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.200
 and tell him the meat that I'm going to add 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.230
 to the vegetable 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.970
 let's stir well 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.010
 we are going to put 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:56.130
 Pepper I forgot to tell you that 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:01.080
 We needed pepper 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.030
 we are going to put oregano 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.960
 and dry oregano 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:12.319
 here of morón is it with the fingers 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.489
 it's all oregano are you 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.489
 it's a taste 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.430
 this oreganito 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.430
 then we are going to put 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.630
 the chili traits 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.459
 the vinegar the trickle of oil 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.540
 and let's start 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:49.680
 to squeeze the lemons with 3 lemons 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.680
 I will occupy three animated 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.490
 I'm finishing 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.900
 put the other ingredients salt 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:03.130
 salpicón that is very rich you add the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.630
 cheese you can add the cheese 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.350
 when I have already served you in your 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.900
 Toast I prefer it so 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.310
 be serving and all that 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.720
 the cheese 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.720
 we stir well 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.090
 the slices of avocado 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.010
 and we keep stirring until it 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.710
 integrate the ingredients well 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.650
 good 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.070
 it's time to lose you can 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.070
 to serve 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.690
 the salpicón directly to the toast or 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.760
 you can put cream 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.190
 or a little mayonnaise 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.110
 so it's not so dry 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.110
 let's prepare an honest way 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.650
 using one hand 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.189
 I have the cameras well 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.189
 qatar 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.770
 the idea is that 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.770
 and we are going to put you 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.630
 the spatter 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:28.170
 I already tried it and it is delicious 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.170
 let's put him 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.390
 a sliced avocado 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.120
 and so is not toast salpicón 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.500
 I will accompany a agüita 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.670
 Jamaica 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.990
 I hope you liked my video 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.170
 and yes no 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.160
 will be for the next little finger up 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.160
 porfis and suscribe that it costs nothing 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.160
 bye
