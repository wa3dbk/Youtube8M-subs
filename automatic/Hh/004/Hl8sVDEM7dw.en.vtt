00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
ground Pro version which is what I have

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.780 
ground Pro version which is what I have
here<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.960> firm<00:01:16.200> ground<00:01:16.409> or<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.100> AG<00:01:17.610> or

artificial<00:01:18.390> grass<00:01:18.570> version<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.619> reason

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
artificial grass version and the reason

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.260 
artificial grass version and the reason
why<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.310> make<00:01:20.460> three<00:01:20.700> different<00:01:20.909> stud

why they make three different stud

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.240 
why they make three different stud
patterns<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:22.049> because<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.619> three<00:01:23.009> star

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
patterns is because all three star

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.800 
patterns is because all three star
patterns<00:01:23.610> are<00:01:23.790> designed<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.540> specific

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
patterns are designed for one specific

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.020 
patterns are designed for one specific
type<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.350> playing<00:01:25.710> surface<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.340> know<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:27.000> of

type of playing surface I know a lot of

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580 
type of playing surface I know a lot of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
that they can use on artificial grass

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.569 
that they can use on artificial grass
firm<00:01:30.869> ground<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.350> soft<00:01:31.619> ground<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.400> that's

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
firm ground and soft ground but that's

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.969

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
of people are saying is very gimmicky

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.250 
of people are saying is very gimmicky
and<00:03:13.970> I<00:03:14.209> would<00:03:14.330> agree<00:03:14.540> with<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.780> but<00:03:14.930> there

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
and I would agree with that but there

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.780 
and I would agree with that but there
definitely<00:03:15.410> is<00:03:15.770> a<00:03:15.800> noticeable<00:03:16.250> difference<00:03:16.459> in

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
definitely is a noticeable difference in

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.580 
definitely is a noticeable difference in
terms<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.150> how<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.300> shoe<00:03:17.540> feels<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.410> guess

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
terms of how the shoe feels and I guess

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.720 
terms of how the shoe feels and I guess
that<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:18.860> want<00:03:19.040> more<00:03:19.190> information<00:03:19.400> on

that if you want more information on
that<00:03:19.850> go<00:03:19.910> ahead<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.239> check<00:03:20.450> out<00:03:20.570> that<00:03:20.600> forward

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
that go ahead and check out that forward

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.830 
that go ahead and check out that forward
and<00:03:21.230> review<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:22.280> does<00:03:22.430> also<00:03:22.640> feature<00:03:22.790> ACC<00:03:23.630> all

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
it does is it acts as a wet control

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.330 
it does is it acts as a wet control
element<00:03:29.660> keeping<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.440> surface<00:03:30.860> of<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.190> upper

going<00:05:10.090> towards<00:05:10.540> this<00:05:10.690> kind<00:05:10.900> of<00:05:11.050> combination

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
going towards this kind of combination

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.040 
going towards this kind of combination
of<00:05:11.800> metal<00:05:12.160> and<00:05:12.340> plastic<00:05:12.400> studs<00:05:13.030> on<00:05:13.270> their<00:05:13.810> soft

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
ground stud pattern formations because

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.790 
ground stud pattern formations because
it<00:05:16.060> does<00:05:16.210> perform<00:05:16.390> a<00:05:16.690> little<00:05:16.870> bit<00:05:17.050> better<00:05:17.110> then

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
it does perform a little bit better then

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.590 
it does perform a little bit better then
like<00:05:18.070> I<00:05:18.100> said<00:05:18.220> just<00:05:18.550> your<00:05:18.640> classic<00:05:18.880> six<00:05:19.390> thud

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
like I said just your classic six thud

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.390 
like I said just your classic six thud
so<00:05:20.290> that's<00:05:20.410> pretty<00:05:20.560> much<00:05:20.650> it<00:05:20.830> as<00:05:20.980> far<00:05:21.010> as<00:05:21.280> the

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
so that's pretty much it as far as the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.400 
so that's pretty much it as far as the
unboxing<00:05:21.970> portion<00:05:22.300> of<00:05:22.390> the<00:05:22.450> video<00:05:22.660> goes<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:23.290> I

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
unboxing portion of the video goes and I

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.260 
unboxing portion of the video goes and I
move<00:05:23.560> on<00:05:23.680> to<00:05:23.800> a<00:05:23.890> quick<00:05:24.130> weigh-in<00:05:24.880> so<00:05:25.090> you<00:05:25.150> can

move on to a quick weigh-in so you can

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.460 
move on to a quick weigh-in so you can

almost no extra space on the inside of

almost no extra space on the inside of
the<00:06:42.740> shoe<00:06:42.919> whatsoever<00:06:43.610> which<00:06:44.240> is<00:06:44.419> definitely

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
the shoe whatsoever which is definitely

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.689 
the shoe whatsoever which is definitely
a<00:06:44.900> good<00:06:45.080> thing<00:06:45.110> but<00:06:45.770> because<00:06:46.100> of<00:06:46.220> this<00:06:46.310> it<00:06:46.490> does

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:46.699 
a good thing but because of this it does

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.180 
a good thing but because of this it does
have<00:06:46.940> a<00:06:47.210> more<00:06:47.539> narrow<00:06:47.900> cut<00:06:48.289> to<00:06:48.470> it<00:06:48.620> so<00:06:49.039> if<00:06:49.130> you

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
have a more narrow cut to it so if you

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.920 
have a more narrow cut to it so if you
do<00:06:49.310> have<00:06:49.490> slightly<00:06:49.699> wider<00:06:50.120> feet<00:06:50.449> you're

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
do have slightly wider feet you're

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.540 
do have slightly wider feet you're
probably<00:06:51.110> best<00:06:51.410> off<00:06:51.650> staying<00:06:51.979> away<00:06:52.280> from<00:06:52.340> the

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
probably best off staying away from the

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.909 
probably best off staying away from the
mercurial<00:06:53.090> series<00:06:53.389> altogether<00:06:54.020> so<00:06:54.710> it<00:06:54.770> does

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 
mercurial series altogether so it does

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:56.439 
mercurial series altogether so it does
have<00:06:55.070> a<00:06:55.100> tighter<00:06:55.430> cut<00:06:55.729> through<00:06:55.970> the<00:06:56.120> mid<00:06:56.270> foot

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
have a tighter cut through the mid foot

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.450 
have a tighter cut through the mid foot
especially<00:06:57.020> along<00:06:57.470> the<00:06:57.530> instep<00:06:58.070> when<00:06:58.250> you<00:06:58.340> do

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
especially along the instep when you do

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.340 
especially along the instep when you do
pull<00:06:58.639> the<00:06:58.759> laces<00:06:58.940> tight<00:06:59.300> and<00:06:59.509> the<00:06:59.960> fit<00:07:00.139> through

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
pull the laces tight and the fit through

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.570 
pull the laces tight and the fit through

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
the forefoot and toe box isn't

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.969 
the forefoot and toe box isn't
necessarily<00:07:02.180> all<00:07:02.449> that<00:07:02.479> wide<00:07:02.870> either<00:07:03.259> so<00:07:03.889> if

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:03.979 
necessarily all that wide either so if

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:05.200 
necessarily all that wide either so if
you<00:07:04.070> were<00:07:04.160> looking<00:07:04.250> for<00:07:04.550> that<00:07:04.669> tight<00:07:04.910> fit
