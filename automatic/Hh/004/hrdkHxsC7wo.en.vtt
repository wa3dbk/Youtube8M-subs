00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:06.529
 well now let's see how bush is executed as a master rice is done 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.629
 using the titanium motorola 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.909
 well it's titanium motorola with hard bread and you have to believe 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.419
 andulo 10 2 points 1 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.320
 so 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.199
 by the way says mons 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.199
 to get this icon out 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.199
 for what they basically serve us, the master says 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.819
 the master and cnn serves to 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.140
 put 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.090
 the cell phone 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.740
 practically as it left the factory 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.990
 that is to say 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.370
 as equal as 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.660
 when we receive it in the box 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 when we buy it from our site michael 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.890
 when we buy it from our store 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.590
 and if you have not visited me recently, we are opening the sr 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.710
 then this means that you will lose all applications 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.470
 that we had installed 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.170
 the contacts if we have not synchronized them will also be lost 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.840
 that's why it's necessary to notice and review the videos regarding 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.320
 update the cape applications you have to have published also here in 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.970
 Youtube 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.520
 i perform is improvisation or integration with contacts and calendar 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.610
 those videos should review it as a previous step before making this 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.650
 master s 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.880
 because after the more service, then there is no way to recover or restore 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.000
 that information 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.700
 just in case wolf the information is lost 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.150
 the information that is embroidered on the card is not lost 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270
 just in case 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.290
 let's review 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.900
 generally what is safe in lcd is what we have here in the gallery of 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.600
 media 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.950
 for example those pieces pictures 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.210
 they would not be lost they would be there 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.420
 end they will not be affected 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.750
 but if they are going to be affected for example 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.750
 the applications 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.880
 the mail accounts that this one has configured 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.079

 that we have had stored 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.320
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.759
