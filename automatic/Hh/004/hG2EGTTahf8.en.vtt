 video or a video of recipes like this 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.870

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.429

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.740
 Mistela roles another moment that 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.990
 they want to do to question milestones like 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.240
 those who sell in the diets but what 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.460
 feel sure it 's a good taste here 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.500
 because I like to make these videos 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.800
 fast so to speak let's go with the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.800
 recipe 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.330
 Y 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.079
 first we need something called 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.379
 Puff pastry is like a ready-made dough 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.280
 it's called puff pastry and well you have to 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.729
 do where you're going to knead first 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.590
 this one is puff pastry puff 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.750
 put the flour flour where you are going to 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.750
 happen 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.560
 flour so that it does not stick either in 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.439
 this place on the table 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.899
 or anywhere else I in this 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.979
 case of occupying good in my case is called 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:29.950
 barandal I do not know in your country clear as if 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.090
 I saw myself in another country ok we did not start 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.790
 put flour in the same way also to the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.320
 puff pastry 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.510
 where they get it in any 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.080
 supermarket seriously in any 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.540
 supermarket find this pasta 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.960
 puff pastry this flour is as they want 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.960
 call him 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.650
 we had a good time so that it would be like 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.320
 a savannah 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.030
 a rolling pin a kitchen roll 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.150
 obviously on a roller to paint 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.850
 true walls I'm either funny or that 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.460
 no good he has hurt a sabanita 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.790
 as we are seeing what we are seeing in 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.070
 these moments for sabanita type 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.900
 inspired try not to be so 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:18.769
 thin not among the delgaditos 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.840
 and as wide anchico not anchico I do not know if 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.090
 it's a part but good 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.740
 try not to be so thin for 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.500
 Do not break them when you throw them away 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.260
 and when we already have a sheet of this 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.220
 shape after having stretched in this way 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.100
 our puff we start obviously with 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.730
 a knife we split a piece 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.100
 no good do not throw favors what you 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.230
 over or not keep it because it will not 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.260
 serve already have to use force 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.430
 then in this case we 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.660
 It's going to be good but we're going to do 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.650
 more bread because the whole family is there and 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.440
 so to botanize then if I go to 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.600
 do many of you are going to see a few 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.000
 well for the video not but but in 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.850
 I'm really going to do a lot because 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.160
 the whole family is reunited 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:23.760
 and well we breathe well the part that we 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.920
 It's not enough to cut it, but it's already 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.750
 Once a picture is left 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.330
 this time he will show it from the 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.380
 side and side 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.750
 from side to side up down 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.460
 left right of her 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.020
 for me that easy then in those 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.570
 moments because because I have like that 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.490
 aligned there and me my little squares of 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:49.910
 artery has that line then 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:52.390
 my cuts are straight between quotes are 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.390
 firm 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.400
 but if you do not, you do not have this 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.620
 profit then do it carefully 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.940
 well in the fun part and the one that most 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.360
 I love it like it's smearing the nutella 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.980
 so is this this is my favorite part 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.970
 this is a bit of admitting that it's a 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.270
 little tedious 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.470
 to pass 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.209
 with the roller is a bit tedious but 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.840
 fun time when you get to 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.930
 this part of giving him the nutella as it is 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.270
 more fun is cooler and remember 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.790
 that this is very patience 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.680
 Clear patience but it can also be 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.650
 complicated commented stretch it then 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.750
 lots of patience friends very much 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.880
 patience because because you are 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:46.500
 July I know that cool is patience ok 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.900
 ok yes and good next process since 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.470
 we fill with nutella as they see in their 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:56.370
 moments is to roll it up like that 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:59.400
 be very careful, because they are 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.280
 can break then very much care 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.680
 we do it I want to put speed then 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.240
 put speed because it is so that 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.640
 it has taken us because the truth is that 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.289
 it even seems to me late because l 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.419
 like the fast and it seems to operate 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.759
 Sprinkle some cinnamon at the time 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.849
 that I roll part by part so that 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:23.229
 to give a touch more flavor 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:26.529
 delicious a more colorful tone more 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:29.529
 pronounced cinnamon seems to be 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:32.339
 see more tan in quotes and you 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.339
 see more colorful 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:41.520
 sprinkle cinnamon flavor presentation 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.520
 and a special touch 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.170
 it does not matter that it is imperfect not 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.030
 matter does not have to give precisely 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.160
 perfect the roll 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.370
 we are going to take online we are going to put a 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.380
 expected role 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.150
 good in my case is a talk of this 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.070
 type and I put a waxed paper for 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.860
 that so that it does not stick increase 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:07.740
 to bake 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.740
 then we cut our rolls 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.850
 slowly I repeat from patience a lot 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.370
 patience 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.620
 I repeat it does not matter if they are not cuts 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.790
 perfect follows the nutella taquito 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.370
 It gives us that Chinese does not matter 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:30.560
 what matters is the taste and the richness 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:33.150
 is this we preheat our oven to 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.930
 180 degrees 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:39.290
 and we put these nice rolls 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.290
 oven 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.680
 and we leave it there we leave it there 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.270
 during 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:51.430
 15 for 10 15 minutes 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.580
 if you see that it is not there yet 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.630
 leave it a little bit more but be very 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.620
 pending of the suns 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.660
 we put a glaze prepared by 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.680
 icing sugar and a little water to 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.680
