00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
volume of water than

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.730 
volume of water than
spreading<00:03:33.820> through<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.330> tape<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:34.960> quickly

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
spreading through that tape so quickly

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.370 
spreading through that tape so quickly
there's<00:03:36.610> our<00:03:36.730> original<00:03:37.330> stream

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
there's our original stream

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.380 
there's our original stream
and<00:03:39.680> see<00:03:39.860> what<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:40.160> does<00:03:40.190> with<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.610> tank<00:03:40.910> oh<00:03:41.120> my

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.790 
see is down below right here and that is
at<00:05:56.979> the<00:05:57.090> floor<00:05:58.090> level<00:05:58.120> of<00:05:58.780> the<00:05:59.200> fourth<00:05:59.470> floors

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
at the floor level of the fourth floors

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.280 
at the floor level of the fourth floors
here<00:06:00.160> it<00:06:00.250> says<00:06:00.460> fourth<00:06:00.760> floor<00:06:01.060> level<00:06:01.510> so<00:06:02.080> this

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
here it says fourth floor level so this

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.040 
here it says fourth floor level so this
is<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.680> fourth<00:06:03.040> floor<00:06:03.210> this<00:06:04.210> is<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.450> ceiling

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
is the fourth floor this is the ceiling

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.379 
is the fourth floor this is the ceiling
of<00:06:05.229> the<00:06:05.440> fourth<00:06:05.710> floor<00:06:05.940> so<00:06:06.940> there's<00:06:07.150> no

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
of the fourth floor so there's no

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.780 
of the fourth floor so there's no
flashing<00:06:08.080> up<00:06:08.200> at<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.650> ceiling<00:06:08.889> to<00:06:09.340> keep<00:06:09.550> any

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
flashing up at the ceiling to keep any

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.200 
flashing up at the ceiling to keep any
water<00:06:10.060> this<00:06:10.600> water<00:06:10.930> from<00:06:11.640> coming<00:06:12.640> into<00:06:12.940> the

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
water this water from coming into the

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.810 
water this water from coming into the
living<00:06:13.600> space<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:14.410> only<00:06:14.680> flashing<00:06:15.460> that<00:06:15.640> we

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
living space the only flashing that we

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.060 
living space the only flashing that we
see<00:06:16.090> is<00:06:16.240> at<00:06:16.419> the<00:06:16.570> fourth<00:06:16.840> floor<00:06:16.900> level<00:06:17.650> and

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
see is at the fourth floor level and

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.800 
see is at the fourth floor level and
that<00:06:18.160> at<00:06:18.340> the<00:06:18.490> third<00:06:18.700> night<00:06:19.060> of<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.330> second

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
that at the third night of the second

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.650 
that at the third night of the second
and<00:06:20.130> that<00:06:21.130> flashing<00:06:21.729> is<00:06:21.880> even<00:06:22.240> kind<00:06:22.510> of

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
and that flashing is even kind of

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.659 
and that flashing is even kind of
incomplete<00:06:22.960> because<00:06:23.650> you<00:06:23.919> would<00:06:24.100> expect<00:06:24.130> it

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
incomplete because you would expect it

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.750 
incomplete because you would expect it
to<00:06:24.700> turn<00:06:25.120> back<00:06:25.560> underneath<00:06:26.560> the<00:06:27.039> next<00:06:27.550> highest

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
to turn back underneath the next highest

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.060 
to turn back underneath the next highest
up<00:06:28.210> course<00:06:28.539> of<00:06:28.780> block<00:06:29.020> and<00:06:29.289> then<00:06:29.500> turn<00:06:29.860> up

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
up course of block and then turn up

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.550 
up course of block and then turn up
again<00:06:30.250> so<00:06:31.240> it<00:06:31.360> captures<00:06:31.570> any<00:06:31.990> water<00:06:32.350> that's

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
again so it captures any water that's

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.860 
again so it captures any water that's
coming<00:06:32.950> down<00:06:33.070> the<00:06:33.130> block<00:06:33.400> as<00:06:33.789> well<00:06:34.090> as<00:06:34.300> in<00:06:34.600> the

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
coming down the block as well as in the

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.590 
coming down the block as well as in the
brick<00:06:35.110> so<00:06:35.470> this<00:06:35.800> is<00:06:35.979> a<00:06:36.010> pretty<00:06:36.850> incomplete

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
brick so this is a pretty incomplete

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.379 
brick so this is a pretty incomplete
detailing<00:06:38.320> and<00:06:38.500> the<00:06:38.729> weaknesses<00:06:39.729> are<00:06:39.789> showing

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:40.389 
detailing and the weaknesses are showing

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:43.139 
detailing and the weaknesses are showing
in<00:06:40.630> real<00:06:40.900> life
