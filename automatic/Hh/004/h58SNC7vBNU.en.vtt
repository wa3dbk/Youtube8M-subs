00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 and quite often ask questions about 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.540
 load additional libraries in 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.120
 program on the mirror 2012 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.040
 yes indeed such a problem 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.759
 there are probably many with her 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.370
 faced 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.299
 today we will upload to our library 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.160
 pause rp roll 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.340
 the model will kick 2008 release so 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.019
 we start from the internet 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 I want to see me immediately 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.519
 warn you install it 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.560
 standard way, he will not be able 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.840
 just will not be displayed in the program 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.670
 so I offer one of the most 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 easy installation methods 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.890
 create a folder where we will be 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.170
 we need to install the model 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.879
 rename video important folder not 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.440
 must be in Russian 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.030
 I call my folder model 2013 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.030
 open it now we need 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.829
 create file with extension and g is the one 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.379
 starting key which allows 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.260
 shame to load models of other programs 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.589
 and their models from older versions 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.970
 create a text document 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.729
 rename it completely to the name 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.710
 parent program in our case on 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.960
 shame right 2012 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.330
 now we need to save this 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.250
 document with jed extension if we 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.150
 just try to save this 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.850
 document 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.450
 it will remain as standard text 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.869
 file 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.860
 it does not suit us so we go 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.810
 in the folder menu, select the service parameters 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.140
 folders 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.799
 open the view tab in the menu, look for the item 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.409
 hide extensions for 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.840
 registered file types by 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.329
 default there is a tick remove 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.130
 rename our text again 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.619
 document 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.560
 we enter after the word point and where 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.149
 close the document we appear 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.969
 warning window 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.649
 agree to change the file type 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:00.329
 close the document and here we are 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.329
 standard exe file 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.860
 close the folder proceed to install 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.500
 Models procedure standard 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.569
 when installing note that 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.650
 before specifying the directory was selected 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:27.030
 point to shame files further specify the path 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.549
 to our 2013 model folder 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.140
 we make installation we check that 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.500
 additional folders appeared in our folder 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.129
 files we launch the program pavel 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.590
 by the way is very important do not forget to put 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.170
 tick back to folder options 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.980
 to avoid problems with some species 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.290
 files go to the library of shame 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.500

 here it is displayed in the dropdown list 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:03.060
 open one of our established 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.060
