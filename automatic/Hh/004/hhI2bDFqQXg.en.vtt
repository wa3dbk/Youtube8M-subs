00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
the biggest number we've ever had quite

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.009 
the biggest number we've ever had quite
frankly<00:00:29.560> a<00:00:30.220> lot<00:00:30.910> of<00:00:31.060> big<00:00:31.179> numbers<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.689> you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.019 
frankly a lot of big numbers the you

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:33.650 
frankly a lot of big numbers the you
know<00:00:32.140> right<00:00:32.320> now<00:00:32.470> we're<00:00:32.619> setting<00:00:32.890> trends<00:00:33.129> but

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
know right now we're setting trends but

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.790 
know right now we're setting trends but
that's<00:00:34.660> probably<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.989> sign<00:00:35.140> of<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.350> times<00:00:35.379> to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
that's probably a sign of the times to

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.740 
that's probably a sign of the times to
we've<00:00:36.160> never<00:00:36.340> mandated<00:00:36.970> for<00:00:37.000> our<00:00:37.330> first<00:00:37.570> year

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
acclimated they're getting a little

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.450 
acclimated they're getting a little
better<00:00:43.839> feel<00:00:44.290> for<00:00:44.530> what<00:00:44.710> it's<00:00:44.739> like<00:00:44.949> the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
better feel for what it's like the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.710 
better feel for what it's like the
temple<00:00:45.790> in<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:45.940> pace<00:00:46.150> and<00:00:46.390> it's<00:00:46.510> different

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
temple in the pace and it's different

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.840 
temple in the pace and it's different
just<00:00:47.500> like<00:00:47.649> our<00:00:47.770> guy's<00:00:47.980> ago<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.370> NFL<00:00:48.700> it's<00:00:48.820> a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
just like our guy's ago the NFL it's a

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.940 
just like our guy's ago the NFL it's a
little<00:00:49.030> different<00:00:49.180> there<00:00:49.480> so<00:00:49.809> it's<00:00:50.710> a<00:00:50.739> greater

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
little different there so it's a greater

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.440 
little different there so it's a greater
you<00:00:51.250> know<00:00:51.340> time<00:00:51.550> for<00:00:51.730> them<00:00:51.820> to<00:00:51.850> get<00:00:52.000> a<00:00:52.059> climate

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.460

that<00:01:28.740> being<00:01:28.920> said<00:01:29.070> though<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> mean<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.640> really

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
that being said though I mean we really

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.930 
that being said though I mean we really
and<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.619> haven't<00:01:31.979> lost<00:01:32.310> nominal<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:32.850> our

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
and we haven't lost nominal what our

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.310 
and we haven't lost nominal what our
percentage<00:01:33.360> would<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.600> compared<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.080> others

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
percentage would be compared to others

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.070 
percentage would be compared to others
but<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:35.310> seems<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.820> people<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.720> declare

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
but it seems like people that declare

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.410 
but it seems like people that declare
here<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:37.740> pretty<00:01:38.399> good<00:01:38.640> about<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.330> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
here are pretty good about that but you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.520 
here are pretty good about that but you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
right now feel really good about the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.389 
right now feel really good about the
group<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.420> has<00:01:54.899> committed<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.160> but

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
group that has committed you know but

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.219 
group that has committed you know but
it's<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.550> long<00:01:56.670> race<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.060> run<00:01:57.179> you<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.050> many

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it's a long race to run you have so many

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.510 
it's a long race to run you have so many
right<00:01:58.470> now<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.770> changed<00:01:59.429> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
right now have you changed the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.639 
right now have you changed the
philosophy<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.119> recruiting<00:02:00.450> oh<00:02:00.750> we're<00:02:01.619> a

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
philosophy in recruiting oh we're a

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.469 
philosophy in recruiting oh we're a
little<00:02:01.800> more<00:02:01.920> aggressive<00:02:02.159> maybe<00:02:02.580> perhaps<00:02:02.909> but

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
little more aggressive maybe perhaps but

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.930 
little more aggressive maybe perhaps but
not<00:02:03.509> not<00:02:03.810> dramatically<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.310> think<00:02:05.789> it's

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
not not dramatically and I think it's

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.279 
not not dramatically and I think it's
really<00:02:06.179> more<00:02:06.360> reflection<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.960> what's<00:02:07.110> going

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
really more reflection of what's going

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.749 
really more reflection of what's going
on<00:02:07.440> nationally<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.069> haven't<00:02:08.459> seen<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
on nationally and I haven't seen the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.780 
on nationally and I haven't seen the
numbers<00:02:09.090> or<00:02:09.239> studied<00:02:09.600> them<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:10.519> my<00:02:11.519> guess<00:02:11.580> is

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
numbers or studied them but my guess is

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.610 
numbers or studied them but my guess is
it's<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.390> things<00:02:12.720> are<00:02:12.870> moving<00:02:13.019> fast<00:02:13.260> right<00:02:13.590> I

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
it's just things are moving fast right I

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.640 
it's just things are moving fast right I
know<00:02:13.769> during<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:15.120> spring<00:02:15.470> we<00:02:16.470> had<00:02:16.620> a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
know during the this spring we had a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.620 
know during the this spring we had a
record<00:02:16.920> number<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.370> players<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.360> we<00:02:18.540> had

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
record number of players that we had

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.790 
record number of players that we had
offered<00:02:18.959> come<00:02:19.140> through<00:02:19.319> during<00:02:19.470> spring

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
offered come through during spring

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.470 
offered come through during spring
practice<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:20.370> year<00:02:20.550> ago<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:21.030> more<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.420> in

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
practice a year ago that is more so in

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.809 
practice a year ago that is more so in
june<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.590> things<00:02:22.890> are<00:02:23.010> just<00:02:23.040> shifting<00:02:23.519> forward

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
june so things are just shifting forward

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.150 
june so things are just shifting forward
like<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> lot<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.450> things<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:26.040> know<00:02:26.100> i

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
like a lot of things and you know i

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.890 
like a lot of things and you know i
think<00:02:26.340> probably<00:02:26.519> at<00:02:27.180> some<00:02:27.329> point<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.690> NC

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
think probably at some point the NC

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.660 
think probably at some point the NC
double-a<00:02:28.170> rules<00:02:28.410> i<00:02:28.530> know<00:02:28.590> though<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:29.070> head<00:02:29.610> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
double-a rules i know though the head of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.009 
double-a rules i know though the head of
the<00:02:29.730> innocent<00:02:30.000> always<00:02:30.209> address<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> little

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
the innocent always address is a little

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.330 
the innocent always address is a little
bit<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.320> some<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.590> those<00:02:31.680> rules<00:02:31.950> aren't<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
bit that some of those rules aren't the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.640 
bit that some of those rules aren't the
shift<00:02:32.610> with<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.030> because<00:02:33.290> if<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.410> think<00:02:34.470> about

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
shift with it because if you think about

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.470 
shift with it because if you think about
it<00:02:34.829> right<00:02:35.010> now<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.190> mean<00:02:35.430> thrust<00:02:35.760> at<00:02:35.940> 56

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
it right now I mean thrust at 56

anti-climatic as so much has been talked

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.030 
anti-climatic as so much has been talked
about<00:03:12.310> in<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.639> last<00:03:12.730> couple<00:03:13.060> weeks<00:03:13.359> and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
about in the last couple weeks and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.330 
about in the last couple weeks and
yesterday<00:03:15.040> morning<00:03:15.310> written<00:03:15.579> article

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
yesterday morning written article

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.800 
yesterday morning written article
previewing<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.609> announcement<00:03:19.329> that<00:03:19.540> was

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
previewing the announcement that was

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.089 
previewing the announcement that was
forthcoming<00:03:20.079> but<00:03:20.469> I<00:03:20.530> think<00:03:20.739> it's<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:20.920> real

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
forthcoming but I think it's a real

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.309 
forthcoming but I think it's a real
positive<00:03:21.280> step<00:03:21.760> certainly<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.299> seems<00:03:23.170> like

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
positive step certainly and seems like

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.660 
positive step certainly and seems like
it's<00:03:23.409> already<00:03:23.560> generated<00:03:24.069> a<00:03:24.099> lot<00:03:24.219> of<00:03:24.280> exciting

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
it's already generated a lot of exciting

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.629 
it's already generated a lot of exciting
10<00:03:25.060> years<00:03:25.239> too<00:03:25.450> late<00:03:25.599> for<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:25.870> right<00:03:26.049> now<00:03:26.079> oh

10 years too late for you right now oh
yeah<00:03:27.639> I<00:03:27.670> guess<00:03:28.030> maybe<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.420> could<00:03:28.510> argue<00:03:28.599> that

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
yeah I guess maybe you could argue that

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.659 
yeah I guess maybe you could argue that
you<00:03:29.169> know<00:03:29.290> but<00:03:29.859> you<00:03:29.950> know<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:30.250> we've<00:03:30.489> had<00:03:30.639> a

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
you know but you know that we've had a

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.220 
you know but you know that we've had a
couple<00:03:30.819> chances<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.359> be<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.629> that<00:03:31.659> mix<00:03:31.959> and

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
couple chances to be in that mix and

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.110 
couple chances to be in that mix and
that's<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.189> fun<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.370> play<00:03:33.579> you<00:03:33.849> know<00:03:33.939> you<00:03:33.999> just

never know we're going to be at the end
of<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.409> year<00:03:35.439> and<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.919> lot<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.609> factors<00:03:37.060> go<00:03:37.209> into

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
of the year and a lot of factors go into

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.059 
of the year and a lot of factors go into
it<00:03:37.569> so<00:03:37.780> that's<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.349> fun<00:03:38.500> part<00:03:38.530> about<00:03:38.739> all<00:03:38.919> this

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
thinking I think far the biggest thing

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.409

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
the pac-12 that's that's certainly a

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.009 
the pac-12 that's that's certainly a
good<00:03:51.730> leader<00:03:51.969> want<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.299> be<00:03:52.389> honest<00:03:52.599> election

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019

in all serious I've never voted on

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.979 
in all serious I've never voted on
whatever<00:04:00.280> what<00:04:01.269> which<00:04:01.480> one<00:04:01.629> is<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:01.900> the

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
whatever what which one is it the

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.619 
whatever what which one is it the
coaches<00:04:02.319> vote<00:04:02.500> for<00:04:02.739> coaches<00:04:03.519> Paul<00:04:03.730> and<00:04:04.540> the

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
coaches vote for coaches Paul and the

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.860 
coaches vote for coaches Paul and the
reason<00:04:04.780> is<00:04:05.049> i<00:04:05.169> mean<00:04:05.319> in<00:04:05.409> november<00:04:05.889> i<00:04:06.780> set<00:04:07.780> them

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
reason is i mean in november i set them

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.089 
reason is i mean in november i set them
up<00:04:07.989> at<00:04:08.139> a<00:04:08.169> Florida<00:04:08.620> no<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:08.739> think<00:04:08.949> it's<00:04:09.040> a

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
up at a Florida no I think it's a

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.649 
up at a Florida no I think it's a
contradiction<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.790> be<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.030> panel<00:04:10.359> for<00:04:10.389> tea

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
contradiction to be a panel for tea

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.520 
contradiction to be a panel for tea

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
TV so to me you know we might be the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.530 
TV so to me you know we might be the
worst<00:04:31.260> group<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.770> rely<00:04:32.460> on<00:04:32.610> in<00:04:33.120> november

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
worst group to rely on in november

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.790 
worst group to rely on in november
december<00:04:33.690> because<00:04:34.050> we<00:04:34.260> just<00:04:34.440> gotta<00:04:34.590> let<00:04:34.710> me

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
december because we just gotta let me

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.590 
december because we just gotta let me
see<00:04:34.919> in<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.070> papers<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.730> pass<00:04:35.970> who's<00:04:36.419> ever

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
see in the papers and pass who's ever

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
the papers at the end of the week so i

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.090 
the papers at the end of the week so i
don't<00:04:39.510> know<00:04:39.570> what<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.930> right<00:04:40.290> group<00:04:40.530> is<00:04:40.740> but<00:04:41.010> i

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
don't know what the right group is but i

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.409 
don't know what the right group is but i
would<00:04:41.310> think<00:04:41.430> certainly<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:41.910> commissioners

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
would think certainly the commissioners

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:43.760 
would think certainly the commissioners
would<00:04:42.540> be<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.720> good<00:04:42.870> starting<00:04:43.260> point<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.650> then

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
would be a good starting point and then

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.970 
would be a good starting point and then
whoever<00:04:44.040> they<00:04:44.160> want<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.430> add<00:04:44.550> on

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.460 

I<00:04:49.390> think<00:04:50.390> the<00:04:50.480> real<00:04:50.630> key<00:04:50.780> thing<00:04:51.020> for<00:04:51.200> us<00:04:51.320> right

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
I think the real key thing for us right

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.780 
I think the real key thing for us right
now<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.920> know<00:04:52.010> we<00:04:52.070> don't<00:04:52.220> have<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.370> large

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
now you know we don't have a large

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.570 
now you know we don't have a large
number<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.150> seniors<00:04:53.540> obviously<00:04:54.140> but<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:55.460> key

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
number of seniors obviously but the key

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.610 
number of seniors obviously but the key
thing<00:04:55.610> for<00:04:55.940> us<00:04:56.060> is<00:04:56.240> guys<00:04:56.780> like<00:04:56.990> James<00:04:57.230> Morris

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620
