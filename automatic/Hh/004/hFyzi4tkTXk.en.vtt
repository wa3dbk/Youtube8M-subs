 anecdote that he wanted to do in writing 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.250
 when he gave him time because the flame did not 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.009

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.050
 career 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.389
 I already planned to write it and show it 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.189
 when they were all in the splitter and 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.080

 a whole character not only because of what 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.119

 that kind of competition on the track was 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.580
 very difficult the race was very 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.830
 complicated the rivals go every time 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.839
