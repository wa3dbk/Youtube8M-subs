00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.969
 dj skam with whom we talk a lot about 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.070
 but it is true that it is rare that we are 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.830
 Dijon many artists a little 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.570
 new trend of dialogue but there 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.390
 dj really a plan more this good you 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.860
 you like saying that over two years is in 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.349
 effect two years 12 years 1 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.509
 it was a little boy so you were 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.220
 installed we even spoke just now 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.079
 of local didier which is one of 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.430
 first wickets the meeting in addition to the 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.850
 already making sounds for the waters of 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.960
 make success of making albums from 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.550
 to make clips also because you 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.570
 participles or voices often intervene 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.030
 in the team if I do not like it too much 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.800
 yeah that's also the technique 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 of Didier today present 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.480
 because you sell a lot because 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.519
 than at the time when we saw how 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.409
 it's good you did not have too much 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.859
 crypt and then I always have me left 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.929
 in the dark 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.399
 after when I was given my find 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:03.030
 finally so much people every month 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.559
 witnesses he puts a little bit more in 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.820
 before that was brought back after the new 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.950
 trend a new generation is coming 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.390
 is frowned upon that the febea had to bet 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.320
 on a little bit adapted a little bit 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.210
 do not see what people can 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.530
 identify people is said that the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.990
 referents are the dj they have 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.400
 need to see them that's how it is 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.400
 you do your own marketing actually 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.950
 Following by company 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.050
 dj skam is a character then is this 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.060
 that it's the same of what people 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.980
 see on the covers 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.370
 of cetera albums and yourself but what 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.950
 it is 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.130
 where his characters yes we always have 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.600
 hope has never changed not take the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.380
 head of accor helps to say when your art 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.720
 which is not the least 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.720
 it's whew and create events have 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.010
 created discotheque events 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.700
 as for guillaume he is one of 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.420
 first dj at boxed party and did 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.520
 his anniversary of the revolt there has been 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.260
 there was a before and after then 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.020
 what was the first and there was 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.300
 also these famous festival and zouk 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.490
 which attracted a lot of people 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.560
 at one time even we said yes the day 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.420
 it starts to fall 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.270
 precisely it's the hand resumes all right 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.190
 these sectors hamiti believe my project and 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.290
 then it was the good time that beat and 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.780
 think of getting on the moment but 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.450
 that I had already started to leave on 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.740
 the big festivals during 1 year 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.630
 had made me big parties in 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.230
 box that rabbis of four five 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.700
 thousand people 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.630
 that's where I saw it was the good 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.650
 moment for makes the festival into twelve and 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.270
 thirteen thousand people 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.500
 in all these cases it's in there it's good 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:40.590
 the job of producers is to feel 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.880
 the moment to have already gone to discuss 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.350
 with my these three four thousand 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.480
 people or 4 5 me whose sayings 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.680
 huge it's a lot but after 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.940
 go out disco to go on 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.010
 much bigger sites with zozos 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.580
 much larger it really takes the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.230
 fake function feel to power according to 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.110
 I think it's years of work 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.610
 because we can not get everything from one 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.220
 blow like that good it makes an event 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.600
 and so hand for both of 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.080
 three years like that made me fat 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.850
 evenings in all the boxes nahio me 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.000
 filled all the boxes I think that 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.739
 better the only dj guy has filled all 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.560
 the sold-boxes like this johnny 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.239
 movie is expected at 20 and then 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.280
 debate and after these acts salah like 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.110
 he realizes have already asked me by the 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.770
 big head and two working 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.730
 working more forward actually two 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.410
 maybe the person who does not want 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.450
 go in this box will want them 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.690
 classes so we're going to work like 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.430
 his strategy and then I saw that this is what 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.600
 type of party it's true that there is a 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.120
 stuff brews a lot of people but who 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.750
 are costly and expensive route 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.050
 then that's how to say that it's the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.850
 public very sun public sun of 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.410
 Once they see me that my communities 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.360
 saw a little neglected the assets 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.700
 and big events but it's more 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.370
 for them to our target audience is so 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.680
 in fashion always this young audience and very 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.980
 sun like intel team for example 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.570
 opacity is different here's aggressive and 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.020
 accurate it's them it's much more 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.120
 same dance floor even has a lot of 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.770
 game right now but me but he 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.730
 knows in my category but the only 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.680
 because mine to a very targeted audience to 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.419
 the shop in niamey a little bit 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.080
 traitor and sun sees the Creole world 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:27.280
 100% makes it a sudden death cast 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.530
 represents Creole thoroughly 9 7 4 is a 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.800
 little if the concept of complaint today 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.169
 sat said it creates a study at its 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.030

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.700
