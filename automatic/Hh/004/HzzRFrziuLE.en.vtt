just put a little bit more on the lid

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.349 
just put a little bit more on the lid
just<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.829> kind<00:03:19.069> of<00:03:19.190> emphasize<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.120> little

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
just to kind of emphasize it a little

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.360 
just to kind of emphasize it a little
bit<00:03:20.540> more<00:03:20.780> if<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.260> green<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.950> took<00:03:22.010> away<00:03:22.280> from

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
bit more if the green I took away from

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.940 
bit more if the green I took away from
it<00:03:22.730> you've<00:03:23.120> got<00:03:23.329> it<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.630> dark<00:03:24.019> as<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.319> want<00:03:24.500> it

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
it you've got it is dark as you want it

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.740 
it you've got it is dark as you want it
I<00:03:25.099> think<00:03:25.160> this<00:03:25.849> is<00:03:26.090> where<00:03:26.209> I'm<00:03:26.299> going<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.510> stop

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
I think this is where I'm going to stop

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.199 
I think this is where I'm going to stop
just<00:03:26.959> because<00:03:27.109> it<00:03:27.349> is<00:03:27.470> pretty<00:03:27.739> dark<00:03:28.130> I'm<00:03:28.970> going

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
just because it is pretty dark I'm going

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.589 
just because it is pretty dark I'm going
to<00:03:29.299> take<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:30.430> flat<00:03:31.430> kind<00:03:31.819> of<00:03:31.910> larger<00:03:32.329> shadow

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
to take a flat kind of larger shadow

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.150 
to take a flat kind of larger shadow
