00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.929
 hello how are you, I'm vanessa hand 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.480
 orellana for cinema in Spanish and les 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.660
 I have the first look of the macbook 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.020
 11- inch air and 13-inch air 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.029
 2013 when I saw them for the first time I thought 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.840
 that I had the wrong model because 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.550
 they look almost identical to those of 2012 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.519
 first disappointment because in this model 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.140
 all the changes come from inside 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.870
 both being that I have opposite are the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.110
 2013 versions and in addition to the price 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.420
 the difference between the two is minimal 2 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.610
 inches to be exact and it's matter 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.129
 preferably in the size of the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.469
 screen I'm going to highlight three changes 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.230
 important in terms of software the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.989
 first and most important is the new cpu 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.090
 of intel its fourth generation to which 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.829
 they are also referred to as hardware what 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.320
 means this to us the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.960
 consumers that applications and 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.329
 programs are much faster in this 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.519
 computer although the old one was not very 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.270
 slow to say and the key function of 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.820
 new 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.670
 and is that it allows the battery to last a 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.130
 couple of hours according to can use the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.710
 new macbook air for 12 hours 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.530
 followed without having to connect it to a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.689
 charger this is something they have to do 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.390
 to believe we put it to the test in 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.360
 our laboratory and even went from 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.069
 the 12 hours we had been promised 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.110
 something that did not improve is the resolution 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.420
 of the image and still do not have that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.819
 touch screen that we are already seeing in 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.250
 other models but at least we follow 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.229
 having one of the best trackpad in 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.630
 the industry that allows you to press 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.149
 any place in this mattress 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.520
 touch comes with the same slots that 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.220
 the previous one and they did not add that slot 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.530
 of 10 m and that many had asked for 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.959
 change that you will like most and something 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.750
 that we do not hear very often is that 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.759
 have reduced the price a macbook of 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.069
 less than $ 1,000 sounds like a 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.369
 madness but it is true can buy 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:10.140
 this was 11 inches with 128 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.100
 gigabytes of storage ssd by 999 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.380
 Dollars 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.100
 and it's 13 inches for 100 dollars 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.050
 more for a thousand 99 dollars in conclusion 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.440
 it's still one of the best computers 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.810
 lightweight notebooks in the market but 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.880
 eye to little they have competition already 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.130
 we are seeing other ultrabooks very 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.800
 interesting that could overcome it 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.890
 soon there you have it the first look at 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.430
 the 11-inch and 13- inch macbook air 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.530
 inches 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.890
 I am vanessa hand orellana for cinema in 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.890
 Spanish
