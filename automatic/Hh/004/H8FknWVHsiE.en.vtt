00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.070
 first of all we all have to 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.799
 know that gastric juices 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.980
 of man as such are not made for 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:19.760
 digest meat are not made to 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.890
 digest meat and to do this task of 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.020
 the digestion of meat are juices 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.170
 very weak gastric 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.510
 robert borosage wheat monterrey y 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.180
 So what research has the 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.429
 people or people who have dedicated themselves to 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.140
 what happens in our body 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:42.440
 when we consume chicken meat so that 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.409
 the animal protein if this one they have 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.969
 found that people who consume 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:53.960
 the beef of whatever 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:57.979
 first of all they are very prone 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.260
 to criticize them that arthritis will be 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.410
 is also strong and I know 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.070
 consume is transformed 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:11.310
 the uric acid in carbonic gas and 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.280
 we will let sony close substances 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.670
 that when the body retains it 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.330
 when the organism retains it, they cause 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.220
 bursting loud disturbances and it 's the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.140
 simplest example when says 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.479
 add attention there precisely from the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.410
 audio from the uric city drop one of 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.690
 the most frequent alterations 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.810
 different tristones exactly to the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.500
 American Health Foundation ensures 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.920
 with carriage in which the ingestion of these 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.140
 meats also involves the injection of 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.890
 animal fat that what goes into increasing 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.890
 the number of intestinal bacteria and 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.570
 that these bacteria directly act 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:01.410
 on the breeze of the UN and will 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:04.590
 produce an acid cancer cure and in that 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.730
 yes he was heard attentively projecting an acid 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.410
 which is carcinogenic 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.540
 not in vain that's why people who 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.610
 eat meat and I think ever 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.290
 they have done some know or they have 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.300
 result suddenly with some kind of 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.220
 cancer typology will surely not 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.440
 review in your past your history of 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.420
 against food they will find the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.890
 triggering factor surely there not 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.760
 it's something that has been a predisposition 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.490
 genetics we also do those adding 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.220
 exact in the chicken then it has 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.370
 scientifically proven that 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.260
 find sea salt this we know 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.780
 us that salmonella is a 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:46.990
 pathogenic microorganism by the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.140
 health then these bacteria that are 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.920
 they incubate there after two or three days 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.370
 they are going to produce abdominal pains going to 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.510
 produce larus fever nausea 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.560
 and really that not only 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.470
 found in the chicken as such against 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.239
 the game the image has a little dot 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.299
 there doctor now forgive a parenthesis 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.549
 before talking about the egg, look at how many 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.650
 people have not ever used or 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.120
 we have consumed because we included ourselves in 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.970
 Sometime in life made the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.709
 doctor error of a chicken and surely 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.840
 the neck we did not know what time I had 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.909
 if they had a lot of time in the oven if 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.000
 I had it in the freezer or in the 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.129
 refrigerator 678 nine months and then what 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.390
 they brought us two together and we started 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.160
 to suffer such situations 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.000
 how many times we have on television and 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.879
 two different media 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.280
 that many children are many adults 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.319
 intoxicated with a chicken that surely 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.359
 is decomposed in the process of 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.040
 decomposition is a new doctor ruiz 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.200
 yes but here what we are doing is 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.879
 a warning voice or I having what 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.910
 we consume generates quality of life or 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.730
 deterioration of it as 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.810
 now people for example also like 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.480
 not only 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.910
 isolating us a little bit of the meat but 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.460
 with the head for profit colarte juan 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.750
 carlos children cheat on dads 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.030
 when they eat it youtube 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.239
 let's say the boyfriend was bringing her girlfriends 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.720
 of chocolates chocolate and truth 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.810
 that only produces alterations also 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.210
 loud in clear we talked dead of what 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.030
 what does the chicken do but we also have 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.120
 to say that you consume chocolate 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.850
 or what contains you even though there still 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.580
 that he painted that so many people 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.220
 like that is so fond of the 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.770
 eta says out sugar does for sugar 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.010
 for pain but it's not so much for the 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.110
 right flavor but how important it is 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.980
 we should know that all this 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.500
 interferes with calcium metabolism 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:58.100
 and give the liver as we talk about the 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.770
 chicken we speak in the flesh this league 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.810
 and the fat that is consulted before 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.800
 chocolate as in the chicken as in the 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.630
 meat because the fat and the work more 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.290
 important that we have to stay tied 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.810
 to all that are vast capillaries the 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.280
 veins and arteries and when the doctor 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.860
 says that it capped the capillaries 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.390
 who has not suffered a migraine all 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.030
 some headache or headache 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.130
 we have suffered a return problem 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.810
 venous frontis because it is because 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.580
 they are plugging the capillaries are 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.740
 insolvent tiny earrings there 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.000
 in the brain and when we already talk about 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.380
 the veins and arteries were 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.330
 talking about an interesting commitment 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.860
 perhaps arteriosclerosis the rise of 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.090
 shot of the cholesterol that to carry 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.850
 a pre-infarct impact on the next 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.620
 cardiovascular brain heard attentive to that 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.750
 please to the family that both 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.910
 we want direct line no bonet is the 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.950
 fat consumption of this type of 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.600
 proteins are those that are going to generate that 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.820
 our arteries as such lose the 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.340
 flexibility become rigid and 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.200
 can carry that series of alterations 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.180
 compromising one or more many organs 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.180
 doctor sometimes 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.789
 then as we talk about 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.400
 the classes we also have to talk about 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.199
 the condiments because people 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.110
 like the meat to fill it with 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.840
 seasoning itself is not only damaged 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.539
 for fat but for protein what 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.090
 does in the body so is the 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:22.789
 sugar as such now if we talk about 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.530
 condiments before they say things 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.000
 that also hurts clear but my idea 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.530
 we smell a little of the concerts 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 when they are artificial because today in 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.680
 day people say do not use 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.440
 condiments as we use them makes 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.870
 many years do not want to say have it 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.520
 Thyme laurel is official now not 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.020
 now all condiments are looking for it 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.789
 chemicals that come minus the squares 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.820
 of those things and those that come to 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.680
 little squares or what as a girl as well 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.210
 there are clear species that come with 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.979
 coloring preservatives in 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.630
 dyes and all that kind of stuff there 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:53.539
 only that we do reference 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:56.210
 if they cause everything to alter everything first 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:58.200
 what exists dawn if the 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.170
 nervous system 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.480
 It stimulates you to eat, so that the 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.190
 people eat clear of that is an accident 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.930
 and how much the need to be 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.810
 consumed I recommend every time the 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.730
 beauty that appetite that comes to 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.560
 develop by the action of those 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:18.630
 chemicals not only well in the 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:22.230
 production a digestive alteration in 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:26.940
 the fifth raise the foods that come 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:30.150
 the reflows strongly and the worst that 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:33.030
 enter to walk that the part destined 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:37.500
 whatever forms certain 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:40.350
 experiences those diets produce pain 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:44.130
 and when the fecal bolus is going to pass 

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:47.730
 produce strong pains that when you go to 

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:50.580
 pass the fecal bolus but normally that 

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.580
 crack directly alter what is the 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.699
 temperament 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.389
 and 6 per tension and other alterations in 

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:59.770
 health 

00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:59.770
 well let's stop a little bit help
