00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
highlighting palette which looks like

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750 
highlighting palette which looks like
this<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.230> concept<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.010> quite<00:00:59.219> similar<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this in concept it's quite similar to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.160 
this in concept it's quite similar to
the<00:00:59.879> Bobbi<00:01:00.059> Brown<00:01:00.210> shimmer<00:01:00.750> breaks<00:01:00.989> you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the Bobbi Brown shimmer breaks you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.260 
the Bobbi Brown shimmer breaks you
basically<00:01:01.530> got<00:01:01.829> five<00:01:02.309> strips<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.879> shimmery

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
basically got five strips of shimmery

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.899 
basically got five strips of shimmery
colors<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:05.400> can<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:05.700> them

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
colors here and you can use them

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.240 
colors here and you can use them
individually<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.990> smaller<00:01:07.290> brush<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
individually it is smaller brush and I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010 
individually it is smaller brush and I
use<00:01:08.280> all<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.729> colors<00:01:09.150> together<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.869> when

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
use all the colors together so when

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.510 
use all the colors together so when
you're<00:01:10.170> highlighting<00:01:10.590> you're<00:01:11.010> basically

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
you're highlighting you're basically

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
you're highlighting you're basically
applying<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.119> product<00:01:12.390> which<00:01:12.750> contains<00:01:12.960> a

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
applying a product which contains a

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.649 
applying a product which contains a
little<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> shimmer<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.970> high<00:01:15.180> points

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
little bit of shimmer to the high points

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.390 
little bit of shimmer to the high points
of<00:01:15.780> your<00:01:15.810> face<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> high<00:01:16.890> points<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.369> your

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
of your face so the high points of your

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.480 
of your face so the high points of your
face<00:01:17.549> are<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.509> areas<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.170> lie<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:20.130> above

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
face are the areas that lie just above

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.460 
face are the areas that lie just above
the<00:01:20.700> bone<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.450> would<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.840> your

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the bone so that would be your

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.850 
the bone so that would be your
cheekbones<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.810> your<00:01:24.810> brow<00:01:25.080> bone<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
cheekbones and your brow bone and the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.230 
cheekbones and your brow bone and the
bridge<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.070> your<00:01:26.189> nose<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.880> when<00:01:27.030> light

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
bridge of your nose so when light

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.270 
bridge of your nose so when light
strikes<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.840> face<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.290> gets<00:01:28.500> reflected<00:01:28.799> from

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
strikes your face it gets reflected from

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.850 
strikes your face it gets reflected from

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the shimmer that you've applied and that

heavily so that you can see clearly on

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.770 
heavily so that you can see clearly on
camera<00:02:56.800> where<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.370> application<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.510> hope

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
camera where the application is I hope

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.900

appears once I've applied the product
here<00:03:02.920> it<00:03:03.430> would<00:03:03.700> seem<00:03:04.300> like<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.930> really<00:03:05.170> intense

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
here it would seem like a really intense

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.530 
here it would seem like a really intense
glow<00:03:05.830> on<00:03:06.010> my<00:03:06.040> skin<00:03:06.550> so<00:03:06.730> on<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.000> right<00:03:07.150> side<00:03:07.420> you

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
glow on my skin so on the right side you

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.270 
glow on my skin so on the right side you
can<00:03:07.690> see<00:03:07.720> there's<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.110> strong<00:03:08.560> highlight<00:03:09.040> here

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
can see there's a strong highlight here

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.210 
can see there's a strong highlight here
and<00:03:09.550> it's<00:03:10.510> not<00:03:10.720> there<00:03:10.900> on<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.110> left<00:03:11.319> side<00:03:11.560> so

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
and it's not there on the left side so

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.860 
and it's not there on the left side so
there<00:03:12.340> are<00:03:12.459> two<00:03:12.550> advantages<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:13.180> using<00:03:13.569> the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
there are two advantages of using the

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
highlighter the first one is obvious you

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.030
