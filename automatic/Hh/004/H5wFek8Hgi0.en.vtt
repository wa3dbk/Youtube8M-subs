00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
uses landscape by motion sensor so you

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.779 
uses landscape by motion sensor so you
can<00:02:07.359> see<00:02:07.570> how<00:02:07.750> fast<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.860> switches<00:02:09.160> between<00:02:09.460> the

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
can see how fast it switches between the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.630 
can see how fast it switches between the
two<00:02:09.970> modes<00:02:10.350> let's<00:02:11.350> click<00:02:11.800> this<00:02:12.040> one<00:02:12.370> website

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640

two modes let's click this one website
and<00:02:13.240> have<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.390> look<00:02:13.600> at<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.750> actually<00:02:14.320> this<00:02:14.470> is

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
and have a look at it actually this is

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.790 
and have a look at it actually this is
something<00:02:14.980> we<00:02:15.070> should<00:02:15.100> have<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.460> look<00:02:15.670> at<00:02:15.820> in

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
something we should have a look at in

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.280 
something we should have a look at in
landscape<00:02:17.800> mode

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
landscape mode

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.050
