00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:23.994
 What's new in the 2.0.1 update? 

00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:26.777
 Greetings, Nephalem, 

00:00:26.877 --> 00:00:28.877
 and welcome to the 2.1.0 update. ! 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.319
 My name is Brandy Camel, aka Nevalistis, 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.719
 responsible for the community for Diablo III. 

00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:35.928
 I am pleased to present this overview. 

00:00:36.028 --> 00:00:37.288
 This video is dedicated 

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:40.537
 at the first major content update of Reaper of Souls. 

00:00:40.637 --> 00:00:41.706
 Let's go ! 

00:00:41.737 --> 00:00:43.337
 Seasons 

00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:47.701
 Our most important novelty is 

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.493
 the competitive system of the seasons. 

00:00:49.693 --> 00:00:52.543
 Similar to the Diablo II ladder system, 

00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:54.231
 the seasons allow to play 

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:55.982
 new heroes at level 1. 

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:58.896
 This is a game mode in itself. 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.639
 The characters of the seasons have their own chests, 

00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:05.411
 progression in craftsmanship, gold and paragon levels. 

00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:09.085
 It is possible to create normal or extreme characters. 

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:11.835
 Let's talk about the rewards of the seasons. 

00:01:12.503 --> 00:01:15.653
 Many legendary items will be introduced each season 

00:01:16.153 --> 00:01:19.753
 and the season's characters will be in the front row to get them. 

00:01:19.853 --> 00:01:22.932
 If you are not tempted by the seasons, no worries: 

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:24.468
 at the end of each season, 

00:01:24.568 --> 00:01:27.918
 these objects will be available in normal mode and accessible to all! 

00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:31.653
 Season participants will also get exclusive 

00:01:31.853 --> 00:01:34.472
 an object of a new transmogrification set. 

00:01:34.572 --> 00:01:36.211
 Each season allows you to land 

00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:38.376
 a new element of this unique set, 

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:41.276
 so come and participate so you can wear it proudly! 

00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:43.885
 Conquests are new exclusive highs, 

00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:45.635
 that offer different challenges, 

00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:47.713
 like defeating Malthael in Torment VI 

00:01:47.813 --> 00:01:50.413
 or finish the entire campaign in less than an hour. 

00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:54.557
 Conquests are accessible to normal and extreme heroes, 

00:01:54.757 --> 00:01:57.557
 so you can try it in your favorite mode. 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 They give points of great deeds 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.205
 who count for the season's score. 

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:04.612
 They are also included in regional rankings, 

00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:05.812
 in order of success. 

00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:08.903
 So, the first 1,000 heroes to complete a conquest 

00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:11.703
 will be immortalized in the corresponding ranking. 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.789
 At the end of the season, your season characters 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.989
 will become normal or extreme heroes 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:18.829
 depending on the type chosen. 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.185
 Rewards obtained during the season, 

00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:24.085
 whether objects, gold, craft recipes, 

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:27.321
 Paragon experience or deeds will be transferred. 

00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:30.141
 Anything remaining in your season trunk 

00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:31.841
 will be sent to you by mail. 

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:33.885
 The upper faults 

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:37.755
 Another big news of this update: 

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:41.107
 the upper faults. These are competitive nephalem faults, 

00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:43.189
 equipped with a progress timer. 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:45.677
 You will have 15 minutes to appear 

00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:47.556
 and defeat the keeper of the fault, 

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:49.443
 the rewards vary according to your speed. 

00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:51.475
 To enter a higher fault, 

00:02:51.575 --> 00:02:54.419
 get a test key on an ordinary fault guardian, 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.179
 then use it on a nephalem obelisk 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:58.279
 to enter the realm of trials. 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.579
 This small arena was designed to test 

00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:03.461
 your ability to defeat waves of enemies. 

00:03:03.661 --> 00:03:04.861
 Overcome this ordeal 

00:03:05.061 --> 00:03:08.113
 to obtain a higher level fault key adapted. 

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.493
 To create a superior fault portal, 

00:03:10.693 --> 00:03:14.221
 just use the key obtained on an obelisk nephalem in town. 

00:03:16.177 --> 00:03:18.627
 A new progress bar in the fault 

00:03:18.727 --> 00:03:21.421
 count the monsters killed and the time remaining. 

00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:23.697
 The toughest creatures advance 

00:03:23.797 --> 00:03:25.752
 your character most effectively! 

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:27.828
 Defeat elite and champion groups 

00:03:27.928 --> 00:03:29.973
 therefore more than a basic monster. 

00:03:30.073 --> 00:03:33.168
 Monsters of higher faults do not give loot. 

00:03:33.368 --> 00:03:36.804
 It is the keeper of the fault, faced at the end, who holds it. 

00:03:37.765 --> 00:03:40.365
 Upper faults present a major challenge 

00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:42.505
 and must be approached with strategy. 

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:45.037
 Do not forget the following rules when entering: 

00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:47.916
 Some functions of resurrection and teleportation 

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:49.009
 have been disabled. 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.252
 Moreover, it is impossible to change 

00:03:51.352 --> 00:03:53.617
 equipment or skills in the fault, 

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:55.317
 so, think of everything. 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.080
 After defeating a superior fault guardian, 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.661
 you will be visited by Urshi, a new NPC. 

00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.828
 If you manage to finish a higher fault in time, 

00:04:04.028 --> 00:04:05.732
 you will get, at choice: 

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:08.533
 a chance to improve one of your legendary gems 

00:04:09.222 --> 00:04:11.822
 or a higher level fault key. 

00:04:12.704 --> 00:04:14.954
 If you do not finish in the allotted time, 

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.104
 the guardian is automatically summoned. 

00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:22.337
 You will not be able to finish the fault after defeating it, 

00:04:23.034 --> 00:04:26.184
 but will still have a chance to enhance a legendary gem 

00:04:26.284 --> 00:04:28.534
 to be able to add additional ranks 

00:04:28.684 --> 00:04:30.484
 at higher fault levels. 

00:04:31.092 --> 00:04:33.424
 Aim high and you will be well rewarded. 

00:04:34.198 --> 00:04:35.998
 Rankings 

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:41.185
 The seasons and the upper faults 

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:43.320
 will be accompanied by rankings, 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.252
 that will allow players to follow their progress 

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:47.843
 in the upper faults, 

00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:50.393
 and the deeds and conquests of the season. 

00:04:50.893 --> 00:04:52.643
 Both detailed and informative, 

00:04:52.843 --> 00:04:55.567
 these rankings allow you to compare your results 

00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:57.527
 to those players in your area, 

00:04:57.651 --> 00:04:59.547
 of your friends and your clan brothers, 

00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:02.031
 each in a slightly different way. 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.620
 Upper loopholes offer different rankings 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.171
 according to the chosen game mode: 

00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:09.171
 normal or extreme, season or classic. 

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.419
 It will also be possible to sort them 

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:14.019
 by group composition: 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:18.369
 Solo game for each class, groups of 2, 3 and 4 players. 

00:05:20.703 --> 00:05:23.953
 Conquests and high points obtained during a season 

00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:28.276
 are only counted for the heroes of the season in question. 

00:05:28.376 --> 00:05:30.835
 Conquests and high points concerning 

00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:32.650
 all the characters in an account, 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.270
 although some challenges require a specific mode, 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.320
 the rankings are not divided between normal mode and extreme mode. 

00:05:38.477 --> 00:05:40.277
 Changes to objects 

00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:44.121
 Now let's go to some of the changes 

00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:46.213
 the most important objects 

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:47.613
 in the 2.1.0 update. 

00:05:47.721 --> 00:05:49.321
 First, basic damage 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.139
 two-handed weapons have all been increased. 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.180
 This change will be retroactive 

00:05:54.494 --> 00:05:56.094
 and all your two-handed weapons 

00:05:57.094 --> 00:05:58.894
 will be automatically updated. 

00:05:59.155 --> 00:06:01.405
 Unique powers have also been added 

00:06:01.605 --> 00:06:03.697
 to several existing legendary objects. 

00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:05.942
 This change will not be retroactive, 

00:06:06.042 --> 00:06:08.142
 it will not be imperative to keep 

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.084
 existing legendary objects. 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.293
 New environments 

00:06:13.988 --> 00:06:16.138
 Have you ever wondered what was hidden 

00:06:16.338 --> 00:06:18.237
 the goblins of the treasure goblins? 

00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:19.637
 Here is the answer! 

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:22.734
 After the 2.1.0 update, the vanquished treasure goblins 

00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:25.884
 will sometimes open behind them a portal leading to Pactole. 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:28.389
 This mystic area is full of new enemies 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:29.939
 and wonderful riches, 

00:06:30.213 --> 00:06:32.363
 so do not let this goblin escape! 

00:06:32.563 --> 00:06:34.874
 We have also added a new environment 

00:06:34.974 --> 00:06:36.150
 to nephalem faults: 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.300
 the cesspools. 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:39.989
 Originally designed as Westmarche sewers, 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:42.526
 they did not find their place in Act V, 

00:06:42.626 --> 00:06:44.506
 at the launch of Reaper of Souls, 

00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:46.156
 but it is now possible 

00:06:46.256 --> 00:06:48.165
 to explore this gloomy and putrid place 

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:50.933
 in any ordinary or higher nephalem fault. 

00:06:51.673 --> 00:06:53.173
 That concludes our overview 

00:06:53.491 --> 00:06:54.741
 of the 2.1.0 update! 

00:06:54.841 --> 00:06:56.934
 In addition to the major features discussed here, 

00:06:57.034 --> 00:06:58.684
 the release notes contain many more. 

00:06:58.784 --> 00:07:00.860
 Do not hesitate to consult them! 

00:07:00.916 --> 00:07:03.458
 We also encourage you to share your opinion 

00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:04.958
 on the Diablo III forums 

00:07:05.058 --> 00:07:08.149
 and hope to see you soon for our very first season. 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:09.649
 Thank you for having followed us 

00:07:09.837 --> 00:07:11.337
 and see you soon in Sanctuary!
