00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.060 

I<00:01:19.780> don't<00:01:20.780> know<00:01:20.870> what<00:01:20.960> this<00:01:21.080> guys<00:01:21.350> doing<00:01:21.380> but

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
I don't know what this guys doing but

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.610 
I don't know what this guys doing but
he's<00:01:22.220> by<00:01:22.460> himself<00:01:25.600> I'm<00:01:26.600> hoping<00:01:26.870> he's<00:01:27.320> with

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
he's by himself I'm hoping he's with

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.170 
he's by himself I'm hoping he's with
that<00:01:27.800> group<00:01:28.070> that's<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.640> boat<00:01:28.880> but<00:01:29.150> we

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
that group that's in that boat but we

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.060 
that group that's in that boat but we
never<00:01:29.510> know

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.399 

but<00:01:37.700> that's<00:01:38.180> not<00:01:38.300> suggested<00:01:41.170> where<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.260> hell

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
but that's not suggested where the hell

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:54.850 
but that's not suggested where the hell
is<00:01:42.590> it<00:01:42.620> now

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:07.570 

what's<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.040> there<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.370> not<00:01:56.550> safe<00:01:58.070> but

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:25.160 

let's<00:02:08.180> let<00:02:08.390> us<00:02:08.509> back<00:02:08.780> something

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:36.690 

sitting<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> chair<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.870> think<00:02:27.870> so

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.570 

probably<00:02:37.420> about<00:02:40.650> five<00:02:41.650> or<00:02:41.800> six<00:02:41.920> inches<00:02:42.310> there

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
probably about five or six inches there

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.720 
probably about five or six inches there
that's<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:43.030> remnant<00:02:43.450> ice<00:02:43.569> that's<00:02:43.840> left<00:02:44.730> again

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
that's the remnant ice that's left again

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.309 
that's the remnant ice that's left again
he's<00:02:45.940> by<00:02:46.180> himself<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.780> wouldn't<00:02:47.140> suggest

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
he's by himself so I wouldn't suggest

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.850 
he's by himself so I wouldn't suggest
that<00:02:47.769> guys<00:02:48.099> but<00:02:48.430> anyway<00:02:48.790> he's<00:02:49.209> out<00:02:49.390> there

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
that guys but anyway he's out there

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.449 
that guys but anyway he's out there
those<00:02:50.860> guys<00:02:51.099> are<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:52.709> think<00:02:53.709> because<00:02:54.099> it<00:02:54.280> looks

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
those guys are I think because it looks

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.479 
those guys are I think because it looks
like<00:02:54.670> that's<00:02:54.819> blind<00:02:55.300> isn't<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.310> over<00:02:57.310> their

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
like that's blind isn't it over their

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.100 
like that's blind isn't it over their
boat<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:57.970> they're<00:02:58.120> going<00:02:58.300> hunting<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:58.900> their

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
boat so they're going hunting in their

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.449 
boat so they're going hunting in their
store<00:02:59.349> decoys<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.840> no<00:03:01.840> ice<00:03:01.989> fishing<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:03.370> can

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459
