00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 here 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.710
 we already know the existence of terminals 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.619
 mobile phones from china brands such as 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.660
 ohio have more and more presence 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.170
 globally and particularly in 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.540
 our country 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.490
 recently yao has started me 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.279
 sound with force and is that one of your 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.260
 terminals the m3 has broken into the 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.610
 market for its amazing potential 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.610
 technical at an extraordinary price 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.219
 waiting for the arrival to our country 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.550
 from this terminal we bring you to our 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.699
 channel 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.410
 the tsja or my dry network is a terminal that 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.969
 we can include within the average range 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.310
 for its price but with some 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.620
 spectacular technical characteristics 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.230
 its design is not a highlight 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.160
 It is finished in plastic which places its 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.750
 weight in 158 grams 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.700
 there is no element that stands out in 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.989
 the same everything has been placed with the 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.420
 order to give maximum sobriety to 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.160
 terminal 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.379
 It has two buttons on its side 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.810
 right one meant to regulate the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.509
 volume and a second thought for 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.220
 lock and turn off the smartphone on 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.770
 speaker has been placed on your part 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.460
 superior something that has surprised us already 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.290
 that is not a usual location 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.180
 with respect to your screen we 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.000
 we found before a 4.7 terminal 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.450
 inches with ips technology its 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.040
 resolution is 1280 x 720 points what 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.890
 which gives us a density of points for 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.420
 312 inch plus the brightness is 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.119
 acceptable especially in conditions 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.470
 high luminosity has gorilla 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.070
 class 2 which will give you a great 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.070
 resistance 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.630
 inside houses version 5 of 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.690
 my wii which is based on android 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.980
 4.2 this layer of customization 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.230
 will allow to get the maximum performance 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.310
 of the smartphone in addition to having a 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.259
 nice user interface 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.630
 for we can see this terminal account 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.610
 with pure muscle within the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.350
 chosen processor is a mediatek of 4 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.500
 1.5 gigahertz nuclei 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.659
 accompanied by a giga ram memory his 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.520
 internal memory is 4 gigas something 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.709
 clearly improvable but thanks to 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.450
 its microsd slot we can expand up 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.400
 the 32 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.170
 It should also be noted that features 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.440
 dual sim and a 2000 battery 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.440
 milliamps 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.440
 all this potential is not only seen 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.540
 reflected in the various tests of 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.280
 performance, but also 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.830
 we can appreciate it when executing 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.090
 games and browse through the internet or 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.090
 move between its interface 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.870
 for the capture of images have 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.660
 two cameras the first one of them 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.400
 located on its back 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.980
 incorporates 8 megapixels a large lens 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.230
 28 mm angle with opening 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.330
 efe 2.2 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.220
 also thanks to the software you can 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.610
 touch up the images to your liking can 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.980
 record video in hd quality 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.140
 with respect to your front camera is of 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.110
 1.3 megapixels and can record video in 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.060
 hd quality 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.650
 For all this, there is no doubt that it is a 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.410
 Exceptional terminal and with a price 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.760
 really adjusted this will make it 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.300
 a purchase option at the time of 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.820
 renew our smartphone 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.040
 Aspects such as its weight or battery design 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.510
 they have some room for improvement but 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.610
 we are sure that this young brand 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.790
 will give us pleasant surprises in the future 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.790
 very closely
