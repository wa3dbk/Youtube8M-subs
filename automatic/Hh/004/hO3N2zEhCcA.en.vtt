00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.360
 we'll continue with one 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.300
 small video this is the 5th 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.980
 Today we take the streets here 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.640
 which you can build as we make it ourselves 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.040
 chance from we only build a shit 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.010
 which then we have here the submenu 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.180
 the streets the fornas first one quite 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.510
 normal diagonal road we build 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.510
 can 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.860
 with the skater break off here below 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 this 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:58.140
 Just look right like it 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.140
 wanted 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.600
 that is a function either now 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.070
 here just from natural good view 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.759
 for or just stop here now 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:19.740
 they bent 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:21.780
 that's a future here that 's that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.560
 really awesome because this is it here 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.560
 could really build 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.890
 the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:38.590
 as you want this is funny here 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:41.040
 just over this road is again 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.040
 back 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.350
 then you want to have minister 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:05.200
 everything else until actually relatively clear 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:10.030
 are circle where there are still the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.269
 Possibility to detain the founder 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.709
 then it makes exactly the round prize as 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.500
 the perfect gyro german believe 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.900
 the others did not exist 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.830
 there was the function just stop with 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:33.120
 ship then just helps certainly 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.120
 exactly the same man exactly 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.849
 90 degrees is actually there 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.030
 or 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.340
 90 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.200
 Oh yes 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.200
 you can thank them because they are exactly 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.890
 You can be together as you see 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.070
 you now, for example, the lines 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.750
 I approached by my form 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.280
 So if the line is gone we wanted to 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.480
 building a new street takes on the 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.250
 mouse goes over the old street and 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.560
 already block the line again and 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.890
 you have with then exactly the distance the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.280
 he needs the perfect distance and 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.500
 so have to the houses at the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.260
 square is just then hold with it 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:49.610
 shy the perfect square or 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:53.780
 Right material or rectangles squares 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.780
 it's a bit like that here 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:09.640
 The straight roads can also be called 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.640
 exactly 45 and 90 degrees angle by exact 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.290
 adjust that way to the point 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.410
 roads 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.410
