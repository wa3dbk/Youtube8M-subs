00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello everyone for sure each of you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.639
 knows such an attraction cartomancy 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.040
 everyone loved him and let's try it 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.040
 make in our game we run 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.470
 mechanism and in greedy prints 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.779
 interactive text that's when on 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.970
 click on the green word us 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.680
 Teleports us more precisely 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.930
 push back forward back blue 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.789
 so you can move that is the most 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.550
 ordinary map 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.570
 peredom let the very mechanism it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.570
 extremely simple 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.100
 as you guessed it is implemented by the team 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.920
 . 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.140
 but there are some interesting things myself 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.010
 Now this mechanism that is 3 team 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.510
 blocks and 1 redstone year nothing more 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.980
 whether you need to have this device 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.570
 only for activation and deactivation 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.900
 don't give these activated 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.080
 well and see it 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.550
 just updating tokyo itself the very heart 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.140
 that's it you lied and a huge team 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.320
 let's take a closer look at when 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.080
 we click on some on some 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.260
 text forward there back here this in 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.240
 particular back is performed this 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:33.790
 command teleports type entity 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:36.480
 empty trolley us -1 on x that's it 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.480
 so for everyone 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.710
 direction is given 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.840
 own team well it's not all very here 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.300
 cool thing that I want to show all 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.300
 you know 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.040
 that in terms of his wife the tide can 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.530
 teleport using a compass 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.370
 let's try it will make vanilla 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.650
 on the lane with a bow, we run 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.330
 mechanism and now where do we want 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.720
 teleport like we want 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.260
 teleport here hop there and we 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.150
 here those teleport where 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.849
 and right here 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.159
 so you can teleport very conveniently 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:24.709
 if you have a big card for you or just 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:27.590
 appetite and gave back as she 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.920
 the most ordinary is the biggest 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:36.349
 update blocks and such a team are you 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:40.730
 target on and she is looking for an arrow in a radius of 300 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.599
 which is on earth engr from equals 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.200
 1b 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:49.519
 Well, when found, it teleports 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:53.709
 player to this arrow well and short 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.709
 time removes this arrow 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.599
 it's simple but let's come to more 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.730
 more interesting thing let's see 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.790
 how to feel arrow test 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.319
 see the numbers at once and the arrows or 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.989
 in other words, run yourself from the bow 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.250
 like this it looks like but to 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:22.879
 Sorry this team 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:26.540
 this mechanism is very stupid so where is it 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.810
 here you have to kill this arrow because 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.209
 that she somehow for long distances 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.919
 buggy and the team for some reason does not remove 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.250
 this arrow 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:42.459
 here the closer to the mechanism the better 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:48.489
 work but the further the worse therefore 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.489
 such a thing how did she do 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.010
 let's see the update blocks and 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.159
 such a thing teleports 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.260
 the player is always behind the arrow that is not 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:03.859
 waiting until the arrow hits the ground 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.489
 is in flight there on earth she is the creators 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.430
 partiro 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.739
 but this command removes this arrow 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.560
 when she will be on earth well unfortunately 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.949
 she somehow bad work here you 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.730
 be able to download this card I will always 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:22.820
 supplement with new gosh 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.800
 this is the sauce and the peregrine falcon subscribe 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.800
 Like all the best to you
