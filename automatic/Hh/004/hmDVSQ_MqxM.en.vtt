00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:16.419
 Let's prepare some fried rolls. The fried rolls the ingredients are; a glass of 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:31.310
 of squeezed orange wine, the same amount of sugar, the same amount of oil, a 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.900
 spoonful of baking soda and flour that admits, as here is half a kilo after we see the 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.519
 that remains and so I tell you exact amounts. Let's start by kneading them. We throw what 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:01:03.759
 first the orange juice, then we put the sugar, it moves a little so that it dissolves 

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:13.039
 sugar, then you can bathe if you want in sugar but if not, it is not necessary because with this amount of sugar they are already 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:21.920
 Sweet, you can eat like that. Then we put the measure of oil, you can put 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:32.020
 all at once, nothing happens. We already have the three measures equal. We put the bicarbonate 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:48.280
 and we started to put the flour. When everything is already mixed, you have to knead 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.470
 the hands to know if the dough is good to form the rolls or not. It is kneading 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:06.799
 so, as you can see, the dough does not stick because it is ready. As I told you about the medium 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.330
 kilo, I have weighed it, and I have put 350 gr. Since he needs a little more, I'll put him in 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:22.249
 total of 350 gr. to 400 gr. because it has to be left that does not stick and now I'm going to explain 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:30.889
 to form the rolls, how they are formed and then we just have to go to the pan 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:39.209
 and start frying them. A roll very easy to make and they are very rich and they are very fast 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:47.669
 and many leave with this amount. Then the roll can be done this way, do it 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:56.379
 so elongated and close it like that, but it has the disadvantage that after frying it 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:06.150
 can be opened by this part, then the most comfortable thing is to make the ball and make it 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:16.980
 a hole in the center, then it does not open when frying, we make the ball, the finger, 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.239
 you can use a little flour if it is still a bit sticky and so do not deform 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:34.079
 the rolls. Let's move on to the fire to start frying. Here in a pan I put oil 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:40.489
 to heat and the rolls are formed. The rolls, as I said, we form the ball and 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:57.629
 we make the hole and put them in the pan. A ball and the hole. Not 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:10.209
 get together with each other and go frying. It has to be warm hot oil 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.969
 when they are thrown out but then very hot, not if you do not want the oil to get 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:21.620
 very black, you put a pair of chopsticks and the oil does not turn black like that. I am 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:33.830
 putting on absorbent paper and we are taking them out. As they fry, they start to get 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:44.870
 a plate and then we will put them in the dish and if you want, you can add the sugar afterwards. 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:54.690
 The fire to fry them is a medium fire and so they are frying one after the other. 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:04.479
 They can be taken out and they can be done. This is how fast it is to assemble the 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:18.280
 two ends and for the pan and that's how they all go. You have to mount them well for 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:32.150
 that do not open When the rolls are already fried, they go through sugar, they are 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:45.110
 turn around so they do not have a lot of sugar and they are getting, but you have to 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.030
 wait for them to cool down because if they are hot when they are picked they are broken. Another trick 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.819
 is to know that the oil is also hot to start frying them is to put 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:03.069
 a lemon crust and when the crust starts to fry is when the oil is 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:09.069
 prepared. This I already tell you, if you catch them to throw the sugar and they are hot, 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:17.870
 they break. And so they are preparing everyone and they are placed. If you do not want to put 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.960
 Sugar are also good without sugar, that's your taste. Well here you have 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.819
 fried rolls of orange. Another thing, do not go over with the baking so that later 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:34.500
 Do not bitter, just a teaspoon of the small ones. I hope you like them 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:55.500
 Thanks for seeing me
