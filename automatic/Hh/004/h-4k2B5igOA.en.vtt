00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
to make blinking lights just like what

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.459 
to make blinking lights just like what
you<00:00:06.540> see<00:00:06.870> on<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.379> left<00:00:07.649> side<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:07.980> my<00:00:08.429> tower<00:00:09.469> so

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
you see on the left side of my tower so

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.220 
you see on the left side of my tower so
we'll<00:00:11.099> sit<00:00:11.309> back<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.880> enjoy<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.809> i<00:00:12.900> also

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
we'll sit back and enjoy and i also

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.829 
we'll sit back and enjoy and i also
recommend<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.820> when<00:00:15.509> i'm<00:00:15.630> actually

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
recommend that you when i'm actually

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.540 
recommend that you when i'm actually
creating<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.130> you're<00:00:17.340> playing

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
creating it is that you're playing

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.279 
creating it is that you're playing
minecraft<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.270> watching<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.810> at<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.020> same

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
minecraft and watching it at the same

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.210 
minecraft and watching it at the same
time<00:00:19.699> so<00:00:20.699> yeah<00:00:21.260> so<00:00:22.260> what<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.560> basically<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:23.189> is

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
time so yeah so what you basically do is

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.519 
time so yeah so what you basically do is
that<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.699> try<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.060> make<00:00:24.269> an<00:00:24.390> uneven<00:00:25.019> circuit

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that you try to make an uneven circuit

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.320 
that you try to make an uneven circuit
and<00:00:26.130> what<00:00:26.250> i<00:00:26.279> mean<00:00:26.340> by<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.880> by<00:00:27.180> making

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
and what i mean by that is by making

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.930 
and what i mean by that is by making
like<00:00:28.230> put<00:00:28.830> five<00:00:29.189> blocks<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.470> then<00:00:31.669> then<00:00:32.669> that

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
like put five blocks and then then that

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.459 
like put five blocks and then then that
would<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.059> basically<00:00:33.300> uneven<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.380> have

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
would be basically uneven and you have

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.290 
would be basically uneven and you have
to<00:00:34.559> try<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> make<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.130> away<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.880> by<00:00:36.270> using

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
to try to make it one away but by using

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.340 
to try to make it one away but by using
the<00:00:37.850> hearthstone<00:00:38.850> torches<00:00:39.270> all<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:40.200> what

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the hearthstone torches all going what

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.100 
the hearthstone torches all going what
about<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.739> one<00:00:40.920> way<00:00:41.149> once<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.300> do<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.570> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
about in one way once you do that you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.049 
about in one way once you do that you
just<00:00:43.140> split<00:00:43.530> two<00:00:43.829> extra<00:00:44.309> blocks<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> side

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
just split two extra blocks on the side

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.470 
just split two extra blocks on the side
to<00:00:45.420> make<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> 15<00:00:47.480> redstone

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
to make it like because the 15 redstone

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.740 
to make it like because the 15 redstone
limit<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.219> then<00:00:50.219> yeah<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.090> cannot<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.539> put

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
limit and then yeah you cannot just put

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.889 
limit and then yeah you cannot just put
one<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:53.030> then<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.120> will<00:00:54.210> make<00:00:54.360> an<00:00:54.480> even

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
one because then it will make an even

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.650 
one because then it will make an even
circuit<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.469> six<00:00:55.829> blocks<00:00:56.129> because<00:00:56.730> five

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
circuit with six blocks because five

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.779 
circuit with six blocks because five
blocks<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.289> minimum<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.010> then<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.520> need<00:00:59.670> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
blocks is minimum and then you need to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.630 
blocks is minimum and then you need to
go<00:01:00.030> five<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.960> know<00:01:02.840> 579<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:05.100> know<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.369> that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
go five you know 579 you know like that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.550 
go five you know 579 you know like that
except<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.420> only<00:01:06.450> need<00:01:06.750> five<00:01:06.900> blocks<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
except you only need five blocks for a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.710 
except you only need five blocks for a
blanking<00:01:08.010> tower<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.549> then<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.479> need<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
blanking tower and then you just need to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.140 
blanking tower and then you just need to
put<00:01:09.900> two<00:01:10.110> extra<00:01:10.500> blocks<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.920> make<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.189> seven<00:01:11.640> so

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
put two extra blocks to make it seven so

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.780 
put two extra blocks to make it seven so
it's<00:01:12.659> always<00:01:12.869> uneven<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> circuit

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it's always uneven and then the circuit

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.780 
it's always uneven and then the circuit
will<00:01:14.909> keep<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.780> keep<00:01:15.840> blinking

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.370 

so<00:01:20.790> what<00:01:21.120> you<00:01:21.240> need<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.750> basically<00:01:21.960> make

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
so what you need to do is basically make

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.730 
so what you need to do is basically make
a<00:01:22.409> rectangle<00:01:23.010> or<00:01:23.130> square<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:25.350> need<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
a rectangle or square and you need to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.830 
a rectangle or square and you need to
have<00:01:25.950> always<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> minimum<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> certain

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
have always a minimum of like a certain

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.600 
have always a minimum of like a certain
amount<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.080> square<00:01:28.320> sexually<00:01:28.860> fit<00:01:29.130> those<00:01:29.310> five

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
amount of square sexually fit those five

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.890 
amount of square sexually fit those five
blocks<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.840> make<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.500> uneven<00:01:32.070> circuit<00:01:32.900> so

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
blocks to make the uneven circuit so

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.990 
blocks to make the uneven circuit so
just<00:01:34.260> set<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.740> down<00:01:34.880> hopefully<00:01:35.880> you're

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
just set it down hopefully you're

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.570 
just set it down hopefully you're
watching<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.930> while<00:01:36.990> you're<00:01:37.440> playing<00:01:37.619> so

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
watching this while you're playing so

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.230 
watching this while you're playing so
it's<00:01:38.610> easier<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:43.400> then<00:01:44.400> yeah<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
it's easier to like do and then yeah you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.690 
it's easier to like do and then yeah you
make<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.540> thing<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.080> put<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> blocks

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
make your thing then you put the blocks

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700 
make your thing then you put the blocks
they<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.150> make<00:01:48.570> sure<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.110> redstone

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
they all and make sure that the redstone

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.270 
they all and make sure that the redstone
torches<00:01:50.159> are<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.550> going<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.090> direction

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
torches are all going in one direction

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.670 
torches are all going in one direction
and<00:01:53.420> then<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.539> okay<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.020> then<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.320> put<00:01:55.470> one

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and then you okay so then you put one

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.580 
and then you okay so then you put one
hearthstone<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:57.180> another<00:01:57.390> vlog<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:58.200> torch

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
hearthstone then another vlog then torch

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.029 
hearthstone then another vlog then torch
redstone<00:01:59.280> block<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.600> torch<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.800> keep

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
redstone block and torch just keep

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.130 
redstone block and torch just keep
repeating<00:02:02.190> that<00:02:02.460> until<00:02:02.580> five<00:02:03.060> hunts<00:02:03.450> mostly

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
repeating that until five hunts mostly

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.719 
repeating that until five hunts mostly
yeah<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.440> that<00:02:04.560> turn<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.220> both<00:02:05.429> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
yeah for that turn you have to both to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:13.800 
yeah for that turn you have to both to
you<00:02:05.910> is<00:02:06.660> to<00:02:06.720> make<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.500> right

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.000 

they're<00:02:14.810> just<00:02:15.140> like<00:02:15.260> messed<00:02:15.500> up<00:02:15.650> right<00:02:15.769> there

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
they're just like messed up right there

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.220 
they're just like messed up right there
because<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.970> saw<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.209> red<00:02:17.420> stone<00:02:17.629> it<00:02:17.870> had<00:02:18.019> been

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
because I saw the red stone it had been

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.910 
because I saw the red stone it had been
they'll<00:02:19.599> pick<00:02:20.599> out<00:02:22.269> what's<00:02:23.269> down<00:02:23.360> there<00:02:23.629> and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
they'll pick out what's down there and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.619 
they'll pick out what's down there and
see<00:02:24.920> nothing<00:02:25.280> happens<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.299> need<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.510> add

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
see nothing happens so you need to add

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.030 
see nothing happens so you need to add
those<00:02:26.810> two<00:02:26.989> extra<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:27.500> side<00:02:27.769> to<00:02:28.010> make

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
those two extra to the side to make

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.460 
those two extra to the side to make
seven<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.120> that's<00:02:29.299> saying<00:02:29.599> like<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:30.079> so<00:02:30.319> that

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
seven so that's saying like it so that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.289 
seven so that's saying like it so that
the<00:02:30.500> circuit<00:02:30.950> can<00:02:31.099> continue<00:02:31.670> for<00:02:32.180> that

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
the circuit can continue for that

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.009 
the circuit can continue for that
because<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.659> 15-block<00:02:33.620> limit<00:02:34.450> but<00:02:35.450> I'm<00:02:35.599> going

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
because a 15-block limit but I'm going

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.179 
because a 15-block limit but I'm going
here<00:02:38.319> also<00:02:39.319> another<00:02:39.439> thing<00:02:39.590> if<00:02:39.829> I<00:02:39.920> put<00:02:40.099> one

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
here also another thing if I put one

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.440 
here also another thing if I put one
just<00:02:40.220> right<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.700> middle<00:02:40.909> would<00:02:41.120> probably

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
just right in the middle would probably

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.099 
just right in the middle would probably
work<00:02:41.599> fine<00:02:41.959> but<00:02:42.760> see<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:44.540> wouldn't<00:02:44.900> have<00:02:45.019> done

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
work fine but see it wouldn't have done

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.809 
work fine but see it wouldn't have done
it<00:02:45.260> because<00:02:45.379> it's<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.709> even<00:02:46.190> block<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.760> that

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
it because it's a even block so that

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.610 
it because it's a even block so that
would<00:02:46.970> be<00:02:47.000> six<00:02:47.090> blocks<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.989> says<00:02:48.170> seven

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
would be six blocks and says seven

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.680 
would be six blocks and says seven
because<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.859> needs<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.129> be<00:02:49.220> always<00:02:49.690> unneeded

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
because it needs to be always unneeded

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.229 
because it needs to be always unneeded
number<00:02:51.500> C<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.159> i<00:02:52.190> put<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.489> 7th<00:02:52.790> block<00:02:52.879> and

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
number C so i put the 7th block and

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.229 
number C so i put the 7th block and
there<00:02:53.329> you<00:02:53.420> go<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.840> blinks<00:02:54.940> alright<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.120> now

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
there you go it blinks alright so now

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.210 
there you go it blinks alright so now
i'm<00:02:56.329> going<00:02:56.359> to<00:02:56.480> show<00:02:56.569> you<00:02:56.599> what<00:02:56.959> not<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.260> do<00:02:57.560> see

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
i'm going to show you what not to do see

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.559 
i'm going to show you what not to do see
what<00:02:58.340> i<00:02:58.370> have<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.670> if<00:02:58.849> i<00:02:58.939> put<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.209> redstone

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
what i have is if i put the redstone

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.740 
what i have is if i put the redstone
torch<00:02:59.870> it<00:03:00.109> just<00:03:00.290> stops<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:01.689> doesn't<00:03:02.689> do

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
torch it just stops it doesn't do

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.839 
torch it just stops it doesn't do
anything<00:03:03.139> nothing<00:03:03.829> just<00:03:04.579> stays<00:03:04.819> there

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
anything nothing just stays there

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.550 
anything nothing just stays there
because<00:03:05.389> it's<00:03:05.569> trying<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:05.959> connect<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.379> that

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
because it's trying to connect to that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.110 
because it's trying to connect to that
so<00:03:07.250> if<00:03:07.340> you're<00:03:07.400> going<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.609> make<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.879> on<00:03:07.970> the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
so if you're going to make it on the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.319 
so if you're going to make it on the
ground<00:03:08.389> like<00:03:08.720> um<00:03:09.079> like<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:10.340> have<00:03:10.609> yep<00:03:11.180> they're

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
ground like um like I have yep they're

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.170 
ground like um like I have yep they're
kind<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.659> like<00:03:11.840> make<00:03:12.079> a<00:03:12.109> trench<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:13.609> make<00:03:14.030> it

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
kind of like make a trench to make it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.270 
kind of like make a trench to make it
like<00:03:14.389> blink<00:03:15.079> I<00:03:15.319> don't<00:03:15.590> know<00:03:15.680> why<00:03:15.889> it<00:03:15.950> does<00:03:16.250> that

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
like blink I don't know why it does that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.059 
like blink I don't know why it does that
but<00:03:16.639> that's<00:03:16.819> I<00:03:16.970> guess<00:03:17.030> how<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.389> is<00:03:17.569> for

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
but that's I guess how it is for

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.559 
but that's I guess how it is for
Minecraft<00:03:19.069> if<00:03:19.609> you're<00:03:19.849> making<00:03:20.120> like<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.269> tower

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
Minecraft if you're making like a tower

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.409 
Minecraft if you're making like a tower
it's<00:03:20.930> well<00:03:21.620> hopefully<00:03:22.069> put<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.609> redstone<00:03:23.269> on

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
it's well hopefully put the redstone on

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.129 
it's well hopefully put the redstone on
the<00:03:23.540> edges<00:03:23.930> like<00:03:24.199> my<00:03:24.440> tower<00:03:24.769> example<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:26.269> yeah

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
the edges like my tower example so yeah

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:44.700 
the edges like my tower example so yeah
and<00:03:27.410> that's<00:03:27.769> how<00:03:27.919> you<00:03:27.980> make<00:03:28.099> blinking<00:03:28.549> lights

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.770 

you
