the industry as tested and prototypes as
many<00:00:18.090> blades<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.570> we<00:00:18.690> did<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.080> year<00:00:19.680> trying

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
many blades as we did this year trying

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.340 
many blades as we did this year trying
to<00:00:20.520> develop<00:00:20.730> our<00:00:21.000> new<00:00:21.270> high-end<00:00:21.630> paddles

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
to develop our new high-end paddles

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.099 
to develop our new high-end paddles
alright<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:24.060> thing<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.359> note<00:00:24.570> right<00:00:24.840> away

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
alright so one thing to note right away

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.140 
alright so one thing to note right away
is<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.650> year<00:00:25.859> gone<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.250> hot-glue<00:00:26.460> system

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
is this year gone to a hot-glue system

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.089 
is this year gone to a hot-glue system
so<00:00:27.330> we're<00:00:27.449> using<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.750> hot<00:00:27.960> glue<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.710> attach<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
so we're using a hot glue to attach the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.490 
so we're using a hot glue to attach the
handles<00:00:29.820> where<00:00:30.510> we're<00:00:30.660> recommending<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.349> for

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
handles where we're recommending it for

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.810 
handles where we're recommending it for
attaching<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.040> handles<00:00:32.399> those<00:00:32.520> will<00:00:32.700> come

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
attaching the handles those will come

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.270 
attaching the handles those will come
unglued<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.660> we're<00:00:33.809> using<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.140> hot<00:00:34.380> glue<00:00:34.410> for

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
unglued but we're using the hot glue for

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.400 
unglued but we're using the hot glue for
the<00:00:35.520> blades<00:00:35.820> as<00:00:36.090> well<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.780> gives<00:00:36.960> us<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.260> lot

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the blades as well this gives us a lot

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.340 
the blades as well this gives us a lot
of<00:00:37.469> versatility<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.570> paddle

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.690 
become a better paddler you start to
take<00:01:43.320> harder<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.829> harder<00:01:43.950> strokes<00:01:44.399> as<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
take harder and harder strokes as you

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700 
take harder and harder strokes as you
get<00:01:44.850> more<00:01:45.000> stable<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.899> need<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> stiff

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
get more stable you need to have a stiff

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.770 
get more stable you need to have a stiff
blade<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.520> isn't<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> flex<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
blade that isn't just going to flex and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.899 
blade that isn't just going to flex and
turn<00:01:49.170> into<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.439> flutter<00:01:49.799> monster<00:01:50.310> all<00:01:50.700> right

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
turn into a flutter monster all right

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.700 
turn into a flutter monster all right
then<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.570> good<00:01:51.840> performance<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.530> this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
then that's not good performance so this

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.800 
then that's not good performance so this
here<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> tough<00:01:53.340> skin<00:01:53.610> at<00:01:53.790> 99<00:01:54.270> bucks<00:01:54.600> I

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.560 
that you can find we've integrated a
little<00:03:42.290> more<00:03:42.440> flex<00:03:42.890> into<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.850> blades<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.420> our

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
little more flex into the blades of our

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.140 
little more flex into the blades of our
paddles<00:03:44.989> this<00:03:45.200> year<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.489> we<00:03:46.670> could<00:03:46.850> stick

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
paddles this year so that we could stick

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.050 
paddles this year so that we could stick
with<00:03:47.330> a<00:03:47.360> much<00:03:47.750> stiffer<00:03:48.470> carbon<00:03:49.250> shaft<00:03:49.640> that's

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
with a much stiffer carbon shaft that's

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.970 
with a much stiffer carbon shaft that's
also<00:03:50.239> lighter<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:51.230> we've<00:03:51.350> gone<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.680> nice

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
also lighter so we've gone to a nice

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.160 
also lighter so we've gone to a nice
stiff<00:03:52.430> carbon<00:03:52.970> shaft<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.690> we've<00:03:53.870> integrated

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
stiff carbon shaft and we've integrated

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.460 
stiff carbon shaft and we've integrated
more<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:54.860> that<00:03:54.980> feel<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:56.090> flex<00:03:56.420> into<00:03:57.260> the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
more of that feel of the flex into the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.320 
more of that feel of the flex into the
blade<00:03:57.799> so<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.400> gives<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.610> a<00:03:58.670> nice<00:03:58.850> organic

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
blade so it gives you a nice organic

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.180 
blade so it gives you a nice organic
feel<00:03:59.750> you're<00:04:00.200> kind<00:04:00.470> of<00:04:00.530> getting<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.920> feel<00:04:01.160> of

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
feel you're kind of getting the feel of

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.880 
feel you're kind of getting the feel of
a<00:04:01.400> would<00:04:01.670> paddle<00:04:01.940> except<00:04:02.660> for<00:04:02.690> out<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:03.049> a<00:04:03.170> 11
