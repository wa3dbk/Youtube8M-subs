00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
I don't think he made it I think someone

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.060 
I don't think he made it I think someone
else<00:00:53.730> made<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.300> uh<00:00:54.590> it's<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.649> really<00:00:55.860> cool

halo<00:00:58.530> reach<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.039> think<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.489> better<00:00:59.640> than<00:00:59.730> halo

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
halo reach I think it's better than halo

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.029 
halo reach I think it's better than halo
reaches<00:01:00.510> sanctuary<00:01:01.050> map<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:01.530> opinion<00:01:01.800> I

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
reaches sanctuary map in my opinion I

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.979 
reaches sanctuary map in my opinion I
never<00:01:02.219> really<00:01:02.520> enjoyed<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.030> math<00:01:03.210> again

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
never really enjoyed that math again

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.420 
never really enjoyed that math again
with<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> new<00:01:04.409> sprint<00:01:04.830> everyone<00:01:05.220> having

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
with the new sprint everyone having

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.859 
with the new sprint everyone having
sprint<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.939> feel<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.360> speeds<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
sprint I feel like it speeds up the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.520 
sprint I feel like it speeds up the
gameplay<00:01:08.270> creating<00:01:09.270> fat<00:01:09.600> faster<00:01:10.110> games<00:01:10.290> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
gameplay creating fat faster games and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.219 
gameplay creating fat faster games and
just<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.740> more<00:01:11.010> fun<00:01:11.340> time<00:01:11.610> us<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.750> really<00:01:13.080> do

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
just a more fun time us but I really do

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
just a more fun time us but I really do
like<00:01:13.409> however<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.010> also<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> instant

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
like however I also do like the instant

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.420 
like however I also do like the instant
respawn<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> instant<00:01:16.860> respond<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
respawn I think the instant respond is a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.359 
respawn I think the instant respond is a
great<00:01:17.729> idea<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> also<00:01:19.530> will<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.220> know

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
great idea I think it also will you know

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.600 
great idea I think it also will you know
speed<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> game<00:01:20.939> as<00:01:21.210> well<00:01:21.360> also<00:01:22.610> some

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
speed up the game as well also some

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.609 
speed up the game as well also some
higher<00:01:23.790> multi<00:01:24.240> kills<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.140> doubt<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.500> will

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
higher multi kills but I doubt it will

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
higher multi kills but I doubt it will
stay<00:01:25.860> I'm<00:01:26.520> assuming<00:01:26.970> too<00:01:27.090> many<00:01:27.270> people<00:01:27.600> will

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
stay I'm assuming too many people will

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.450 
stay I'm assuming too many people will
say<00:01:27.900> that's<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.229> professional<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.220> it'll

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
say that's not professional and it'll

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.480 
say that's not professional and it'll
just<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:30.119> back<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.780> second<00:01:31.140> respawn<00:01:31.530> which

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
just go back to for second respawn which

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.980 
just go back to for second respawn which
will<00:01:32.640> pretty<00:01:32.790> much<00:01:32.880> give<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> same<00:01:33.720> type

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
will pretty much give you the same type

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.609 
will pretty much give you the same type
of<00:01:34.020> MLG<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.829> halo<00:01:35.040> reach<00:01:35.369> um<00:01:35.900> so<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> don't<00:01:37.530> know

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
of MLG as halo reach um so I don't know

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.499 
of MLG as halo reach um so I don't know
maybe<00:01:37.950> maybe<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.670> will<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:39.060> away<00:01:39.180> because

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
maybe maybe that will go away because

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.770 
maybe maybe that will go away because
basically<00:01:39.960> if<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.619> didn't<00:01:41.579> keep<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.479> got<00:01:42.630> rid

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
basically if you didn't keep you got rid

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.359 
basically if you didn't keep you got rid
of<00:01:42.840> instant<00:01:43.229> respawn<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.770> pretty<00:01:44.040> much<00:01:44.100> have

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
of instant respawn you pretty much have

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.060 
of instant respawn you pretty much have
the<00:01:44.399> same<00:01:44.549> game<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.000> halo<00:01:45.570> reach<00:01:45.930> MLG<00:01:46.560> wise<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the same game as halo reach MLG wise and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.690 
the same game as halo reach MLG wise and
as<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:49.170> didn't<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:49.649> end<00:01:49.950> room

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
as we know that didn't really end room

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.210 
as we know that didn't really end room
didn't<00:01:51.479> end<00:01:51.659> too<00:01:51.840> well<00:01:51.869> also<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:52.950> need<00:01:53.130> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
didn't end too well also they need to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.510 
didn't end too well also they need to
get<00:01:53.340> rid<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.979> automatically<00:01:55.979> picking<00:01:56.430> up

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
get rid of the automatically picking up

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.520 
get rid of the automatically picking up
the<00:01:56.670> flag<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.390> capture<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> flag<00:01:57.990> game<00:01:58.229> types

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the flag for capture the flag game types

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.380 
the flag for capture the flag game types
that's<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.009> retarded<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.700> if<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.149> walk

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that's just retarded you if you walk

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.149 
that's just retarded you if you walk
over<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.960> flag<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.380> automatically<00:02:01.860> picks

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
over to the flag it automatically picks

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.010 
over to the flag it automatically picks
up<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.670> can't<00:02:02.909> get<00:02:03.060> rid<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.990> that

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
up and you can't get rid of it so that

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.780 
up and you can't get rid of it so that
eliminates<00:02:04.350> flag<00:02:04.829> juggling<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.610> needs

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
eliminates flag juggling so that needs

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.100 
eliminates flag juggling so that needs
to<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:05.969> taken<00:02:06.119> care<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.689> I'm<00:02:06.810> sure<00:02:06.960> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
to be taken care of but I'm sure that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.889 
to be taken care of but I'm sure that
will<00:02:07.259> be<00:02:07.290> all<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.220> there's<00:02:08.700> some<00:02:09.179> weird<00:02:09.509> like

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
will be all so there's some weird like

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.730 
will be all so there's some weird like
recoil<00:02:10.560> thing

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
recoil thing

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.500 
recoil thing

people that need to get rid of as well I
don't<00:02:21.220> understand<00:02:21.790> why<00:02:21.940> they<00:02:22.090> even<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.480> that

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
don't understand why they even have that

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.480 
don't understand why they even have that
in<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.840> game<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.680> know<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> new<00:02:24.010> idea<00:02:24.280> i'm

and<00:03:25.600> I<00:03:25.720> agree<00:03:25.990> with<00:03:26.020> him<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.350> think<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.710> maps

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
and I agree with him I think the maps

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.590 
and I agree with him I think the maps
are<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.160> little<00:03:27.280> bit<00:03:27.430> too<00:03:27.640> big<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:27.970> awkward<00:03:28.090> for

the swap playlist to run appropriately I

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.850
