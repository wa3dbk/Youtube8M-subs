00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.209 
beta servers to run 128 players I
remember<00:00:41.890> playing<00:00:42.840> Metro<00:00:43.840> back<00:00:44.710> in<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:44.980> beta

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
remember playing Metro back in the beta

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.850 
remember playing Metro back in the beta
and<00:00:45.550> operation<00:00:46.540> metro<00:00:46.810> and<00:00:47.050> playing<00:00:47.710> it<00:00:47.829> on

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
and operation metro and playing it on

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.640 
and operation metro and playing it on
124<00:00:48.550> player<00:00:48.790> or<00:00:49.090> 228<00:00:49.720> players<00:00:49.990> it<00:00:50.170> was<00:00:50.230> it<00:00:50.530> was

124 player or 228 players it was it was

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.140 
124 player or 228 players it was it was
just<00:00:50.860> way<00:00:51.190> over<00:00:51.220> the<00:00:51.550> top<00:00:51.579> way<00:00:51.940> too<00:00:52.000> many

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
just way over the top way too many

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.630 
just way over the top way too many
players<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.720> obviously<00:00:53.050> they<00:00:53.260> didn't<00:00:54.070> stick

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
players and obviously they didn't stick

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.640 
players and obviously they didn't stick
with<00:00:54.790> that<00:00:54.970> they<00:00:55.210> kept<00:00:55.450> 64<00:00:55.960> players<00:00:56.230> they<00:00:56.440> tech

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
with that they kept 64 players they tech

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.040 
with that they kept 64 players they tech
kept<00:00:57.010> what<00:00:57.190> they've<00:00:57.370> always<00:00:57.579> done<00:00:57.760> with<00:00:58.329> even

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
kept what they've always done with even

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.540 
kept what they've always done with even
since<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.320> very<00:00:59.440> first<00:00:59.680> battlefield<00:01:00.310> game

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
since the very first battlefield game

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.400 
since the very first battlefield game
but<00:01:01.180> it's<00:01:01.300> interesting<00:01:01.510> that<00:01:01.690> this<00:01:01.870> this<00:01:02.200> this

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
but it's interesting that this this this

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.560 
but it's interesting that this this this
rumor<00:01:02.770> is<00:01:02.800> popping<00:01:03.190> up<00:01:03.310> because<00:01:03.579> I<00:01:03.670> think<00:01:03.880> 70

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
rumor is popping up because I think 70

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.660 
rumor is popping up because I think 70
players<00:01:04.780> are<00:01:05.110> somewhere<00:01:05.500> around<00:01:05.590> 75<00:01:06.189> 70

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
players are somewhere around 75 70

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.999 
players are somewhere around 75 70
players<00:01:06.790> are<00:01:07.060> gonna<00:01:07.180> make<00:01:07.299> sense<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.680> the

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
players are gonna make sense and the

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.760 
players are gonna make sense and the
idea<00:01:09.430> of<00:01:09.880> moving<00:01:10.060> from<00:01:10.450> 64<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:10.990> 70<00:01:11.350> players<00:01:11.500> is

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
idea of moving from 64 to 70 players is

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.200 
idea of moving from 64 to 70 players is
the<00:01:11.920> fact<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.219> they<00:01:12.399> have<00:01:12.520> new<00:01:12.759> five<00:01:13.030> man

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
the fact that they have new five man

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.230 
the fact that they have new five man
squads<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:13.899> 64<00:01:14.860> divided<00:01:15.219> by<00:01:15.310> five<00:01:15.610> doesn't

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
squads and 64 divided by five doesn't

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.670 
squads and 64 divided by five doesn't
come<00:01:16.360> out<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.600> an<00:01:16.659> even<00:01:16.899> number<00:01:17.200> she<00:01:17.350> wouldn't

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
come out to an even number she wouldn't

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.310 
come out to an even number she wouldn't
have<00:01:17.829> a<00:01:18.100> full<00:01:18.610> set<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:19.000> filled<00:01:19.750> up<00:01:19.900> squads

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
have a full set of filled up squads

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.219 
have a full set of filled up squads
where<00:01:20.620> she<00:01:20.770> had<00:01:20.950> 70<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:22.060> would<00:01:22.180> have<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.390> number

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
where she had 70 you would have a number

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.230 
where she had 70 you would have a number
that's<00:01:23.409> divisible<00:01:23.500> by<00:01:23.950> five<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.729> problem<00:01:25.090> is

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
that's divisible by five the problem is

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.640 
that's divisible by five the problem is
that<00:01:25.270> you<00:01:25.479> also<00:01:25.630> those<00:01:25.900> two<00:01:26.049> commanders<00:01:26.470> and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
that you also those two commanders and

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.870 
that you also those two commanders and
those<00:01:26.770> commanders<00:01:27.159> aren't<00:01:27.490> going<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.670> be<00:01:27.760> in

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
those commanders aren't going to be in

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.940 
those commanders aren't going to be in
squads<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.510> my<00:01:28.780> knowledge<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:29.710> it'd<00:01:29.799> probably

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
squads to my knowledge so it'd probably

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.680 
squads to my knowledge so it'd probably
be<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.159> better<00:01:30.340> idea<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:31.060> have<00:01:31.240> something<00:01:31.570> like

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
be a better idea to have something like

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.180 
be a better idea to have something like
seventy<00:01:32.080> two<00:01:32.260> players<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.680> way<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.010> have

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
seventy two players that way you have

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.390 
seventy two players that way you have
two<00:01:33.520> guys<00:01:33.549> in<00:01:34.450> our<00:01:34.960> two<00:01:35.409> guys<00:01:35.590> one<00:01:35.890> guy<00:01:36.070> on<00:01:36.130> each

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
two guys in our two guys one guy on each

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.030 
two guys in our two guys one guy on each
team<00:01:36.670> in<00:01:36.940> no<00:01:37.900> squad<00:01:38.260> their<00:01:38.530> planes<00:01:38.860> the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
team in no squad their planes the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.670 
team in no squad their planes the
commander<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.520> way<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.700> have<00:01:40.200> 14<00:01:41.200> squads<00:01:41.560> of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
commander that way you have 14 squads of

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.429 
commander that way you have 14 squads of
five<00:01:41.890> or<00:01:42.280> seventy<00:01:42.760> players<00:01:43.030> so<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.540> think<00:01:44.229> it

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
five or seventy players so I think it

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.929 
five or seventy players so I think it
would<00:01:44.560> be<00:01:44.680> a<00:01:44.710> nice<00:01:45.070> addition<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.640> kind<00:01:45.909> of

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
would be a nice addition to kind of

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.550 
would be a nice addition to kind of
increase<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.479> player<00:01:46.630> count<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.080> seems<00:01:47.380> like

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
increase the player count it seems like

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.020 
increase the player count it seems like
at<00:01:47.710> least<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:48.040> map<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:48.400> we've<00:01:48.520> seen<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:49.000> far

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
at least the map that we've seen so far

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.500 
at least the map that we've seen so far
with<00:01:49.479> she's<00:01:49.780> at<00:01:49.960> Shanghai<00:01:50.350> is<00:01:50.619> fairly<00:01:51.159> large

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
with she's at Shanghai is fairly large

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.039 
with she's at Shanghai is fairly large
obviously<00:01:52.510> if<00:01:52.570> you're<00:01:52.659> going<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.869> be<00:01:52.930> playing

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
obviously if you're going to be playing

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.530 
obviously if you're going to be playing
something<00:01:53.290> like<00:01:53.439> operation<00:01:53.890> Metro<00:01:54.540> grand

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
something like operation Metro grand

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.050 
something like operation Metro grand
bazaar<00:01:55.930> or<00:01:56.290> even<00:01:56.890> something<00:01:57.130> like<00:01:57.460> seen

you're really really pushing it and I
would<00:02:02.979> hope<00:02:03.189> that<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.580> maps<00:02:03.850> that<00:02:04.119> they

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
would hope that the maps that they

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.870 
would hope that the maps that they
released<00:02:05.110> for<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.380> game<00:02:05.680> are<00:02:05.920> larger<00:02:06.640> but

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
released for the game are larger but

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.039 
released for the game are larger but
they've<00:02:07.000> also<00:02:07.180> talked<00:02:07.450> about<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.750> know<00:02:07.869> that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
they've also talked about you know that

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.469 
they've also talked about you know that
the<00:02:08.170> first<00:02:08.349> DLC<00:02:08.890> being<00:02:09.329> some<00:02:10.329> of<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
the first DLC being some of the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.600 
the first DLC being some of the
returning<00:02:10.899> maps<00:02:11.140> from<00:02:11.290> battlefield<00:02:11.829> 3<00:02:12.129> with

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
returning maps from battlefield 3 with

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.530 
returning maps from battlefield 3 with
probably<00:02:13.060> caspian<00:02:13.540> border<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:14.049> probably

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
probably caspian border and probably

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.030 
probably caspian border and probably
operation<00:02:16.540> Metro<00:02:17.079> because<00:02:17.319> there's<00:02:17.500> been<00:02:17.680> two

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
operation Metro because there's been two

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.130 
operation Metro because there's been two
of<00:02:18.189> the<00:02:18.250> most<00:02:18.370> popular<00:02:18.640> maps<00:02:19.090> for<00:02:19.689> battlefield

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
of the most popular maps for battlefield

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.420 
of the most popular maps for battlefield
3<00:02:20.349> so<00:02:20.470> I'd<00:02:20.590> be<00:02:20.709> interested<00:02:20.890> if<00:02:21.159> they<00:02:21.280> did

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
3 so I'd be interested if they did

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.830 
3 so I'd be interested if they did
increase<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.879> player<00:02:22.030> count<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.599> know<00:02:22.720> its

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
increase the player count you know its

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.900 
increase the player count you know its
place<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.260> like<00:02:23.410> operation<00:02:23.860> Metro<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.489> 72

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
place in like operation Metro on 72

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.589 
place in like operation Metro on 72
players<00:02:25.300> or<00:02:25.630> even<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:26.590> hired<00:02:26.830> like

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599

players or even with hired like
77<00:02:29.599> players<00:02:29.870> or<00:02:30.910> 82<00:02:31.910> players<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.840> would<00:02:32.989> just

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
77 players or 82 players that would just

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.559 
77 players or 82 players that would just
be<00:02:33.260> way<00:02:33.590> too<00:02:33.650> much<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.879> worries<00:02:35.330> me<00:02:35.450> a

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
be way too much so it worries me a

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.759 
be way too much so it worries me a
little<00:02:35.780> bit<00:02:35.900> if<00:02:36.080> they<00:02:36.200> do<00:02:36.260> increase<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
little bit if they do increase the

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.530 
little bit if they do increase the
player<00:02:36.920> count<00:02:37.129> on<00:02:37.370> those<00:02:37.610> tighter<00:02:38.030> maps<00:02:38.300> if

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
player count on those tighter maps if

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.610 
player count on those tighter maps if
they<00:02:38.660> have<00:02:38.900> those<00:02:39.050> tighter<00:02:39.290> maps<00:02:39.500> in

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
they have those tighter maps in

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.170 
they have those tighter maps in
battlefield<00:02:40.040> 4<00:02:40.099> obviously<00:02:40.610> they're<00:02:40.760> going<00:02:41.030> to

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
battlefield 4 obviously they're going to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.540 
battlefield 4 obviously they're going to
at<00:02:41.390> least<00:02:41.540> one<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.530> them<00:02:42.739> with<00:02:43.040> operation

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
at least one of them with operation

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.520 
at least one of them with operation
Metro<00:02:43.790> if<00:02:43.879> they<00:02:44.000> bring<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.360> map<00:02:44.540> back<00:02:44.810> but<00:02:45.500> I

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
Metro if they bring that map back but I

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.080 
Metro if they bring that map back but I
think<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.800> also<00:02:45.860> would<00:02:46.130> be<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.430> perfect<00:02:46.880> time<00:02:46.910> to

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
think it also would be a perfect time to

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.300 
think it also would be a perfect time to
do<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:47.510> because<00:02:47.690> next-gen<00:02:48.380> consoles<00:02:48.890> are

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
do this because next-gen consoles are

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.890 
do this because next-gen consoles are
going<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.610> allow<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.849> push<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:50.510> that

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
going to allow to push that that

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.979 
going to allow to push that that
boundary<00:02:51.200> farther<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.709> also<00:02:52.069> allow<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:53.060> pc

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
boundary farther and also allow the pc

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.750 
boundary farther and also allow the pc
and<00:02:54.170> next-gen<00:02:54.260> console<00:02:54.890> version<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:55.489> stick

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
and next-gen console version to stick

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.479 
and next-gen console version to stick
out<00:02:55.910> even<00:02:56.239> farther<00:02:56.569> from<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.769> current-gen

out even farther from the current-gen
consoles<00:02:58.849> hopefully<00:02:59.540> promoting<00:03:00.019> people<00:03:00.319> to

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
if that that difference between the pc

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.849 
if that that difference between the pc
and<00:03:40.430> next-gen<00:03:40.519> console<00:03:41.350> player<00:03:42.350> count<00:03:42.620> was

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
and next-gen console player count was

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.559 
and next-gen console player count was
even<00:03:43.130> bigger<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.730> don't<00:03:44.239> know<00:03:44.299> maybe<00:03:44.389> that

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
even bigger I don't know maybe that

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.120 
even bigger I don't know maybe that
would<00:03:44.690> push<00:03:44.870> people<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.799> next<00:03:46.010> gen

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
would push people to the next gen

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.949 
would push people to the next gen
consoles<00:03:46.549> even<00:03:46.760> more<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.209> that<00:03:47.600> might<00:03:47.780> be<00:03:47.930> a

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
consoles even more and that might be a

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.420 
consoles even more and that might be a
good<00:03:48.170> thing<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.470> help<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.859> industry<00:03:49.069> move

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
good thing to help the industry move

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.580 
good thing to help the industry move

it<00:03:58.519> has<00:03:58.639> to<00:03:58.819> be<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:58.970> number<00:03:59.840> that's<00:04:00.109> divisible

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
it has to be a number that's divisible

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.710 
it has to be a number that's divisible
by<00:04:00.709> 5<00:04:01.400> because<00:04:01.880> you<00:04:01.970> have<00:04:02.060> five<00:04:02.209> man<00:04:02.389> squads

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
by 5 because you have five man squads

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
number you come up with that could be a

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.979 
number you come up with that could be a
possible<00:04:07.639> player<00:04:07.880> count<00:04:08.120> for<00:04:08.329> battlefield<00:04:08.720> 4

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
possible player count for battlefield 4
