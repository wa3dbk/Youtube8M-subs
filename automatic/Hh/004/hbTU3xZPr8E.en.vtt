00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.090
 Hello everyone 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.190
 today we will work with the critic for 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.619
 to realize a kind of point is that the 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.810
 blessed terry knit processing 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.860
 shaved or even more commonly 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.629
 known as right and reverse 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.940
 so first let's take ours 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:47.270
 keating and start one for the test 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.550
 dozens of jerseys and to start it I have 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.100
 used the stitch the one with the crochet hook 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.070
 that you find in the other tutorial 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.560
 previous this because I wanted the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.560
 departure was pretty steady and not 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.089
 jerky like this one I made time for 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.970
 it simply uses the dot 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:12.259
 turned around the pole then once 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:17.170
 start our shirts and this 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.170
 case I am 8 so I do it at 32 e 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.160
 start our other shirts we are 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.240
 ready to begin the said point 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.240
 right and backhand 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:40.580
 so here we are, we begin to bring 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.310
 the thread that is behind in front of the peg 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.390
 we lay along the row of pegs and 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.119
 we take the hook to work the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.539
 meeting at this point we limit ourselves to 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:58.300
 take the point below and pass it 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:59.680
 over the other in this way so 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.780
 we can pass 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.780
 among all the pegs to the end 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.660
 that once you get to the bottom 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:34.730
 let's take our son , let's go over it 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:37.580
 in front of the pegs along all the pegs e 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.130
 we can proceed to revise the 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.130
 blue under the new thread 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.150
 in this way we will find ourselves having one 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.620
 processing that on one side makes the ribs 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.860
 we say they look like small ones 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.480
 braids and ideas on the back instead of the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.810
 processing is all the same we can 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.110
 work this point is so on the workpiece 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.640
 rectangular both on the circular la 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.190
 unlike when working on 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.500
 circular and the wire must always be worn 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.780
 forward and never come back like 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.760
 instead it happens in this in this 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.890
 moment we are coming back now 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.290
 back in the case of circulating instead 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.760
 points continue to progress always in 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.760
 in a circular way 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.019
 the advice is to not pull 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.989
 too much the thread because they are at man points 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.180
 hand become harder but to hold it 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.519
 supported quite soft so as to 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.159
 always guarantee a certain flexibility 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.930
 because the more we pull the thread now more 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.480
 later when we are at the passage 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:07.959
 next the buttonholes are obviously more 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:11.730
 stiff and hard so we turn again 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.730
 around the pole and back again 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.200
 after about twenty laps per lap 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.090
 I mean return and you're ready 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.670
 to close your tile of 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.350
 try and then you can attack like me 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:16.750
 in the points booklet and therefore you can 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.970
 continue to close and if you want to do 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.050
 fast you can simply close it 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.860
 passing the thread in each point 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.130
 with the colis effect 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.310
 because you don't care so much anymore 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.650
 so much work what you have to do 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.600
 if instead you want to practice with the 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.090
 crochet point than on 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.330
 crochet then you can bring the 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.280
 frame it this way towards you 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.610
 put the crochet hook in the classic in the 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.190
 first loop and unhook it and then take it 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.770
 the thread and pass it inside at this point 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:55.320
 we have only one in which we take 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.320
 a round of thread and make a chain 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.180
 past the last point you can unhook 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.030
 work cuts you a little piece a 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.990
 good thread and make the last surpassing the 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:17.320
 thread and stopping all this point 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.860
 you have your tile and as you see 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.890
 on the one hand the processing is matricine a 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:27.280
 ribs as we can say while 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:30.840
 on the other hand the processing is that of 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.840
 reverse all the same 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:44.230
 so it's good work has gone on the blog 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:47.820
 take the copy of the card e 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.820
 see you at the next point bye
