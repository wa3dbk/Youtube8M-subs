00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
and I call this beware of bermudagrass

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.980 
and I call this beware of bermudagrass
now<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.319> lot<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:04.890> my<00:00:05.040> work<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:06.029> remodeling

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
now a lot of my work is remodeling

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.450 
now a lot of my work is remodeling
existing<00:00:07.620> properties<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:09.800> what<00:00:10.800> we<00:00:11.040> find<00:00:11.280> a

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
existing properties and what we find a

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.490 
existing properties and what we find a
lot<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.639> times<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> lawns<00:00:12.660> are<00:00:13.080> riddled

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
lot of times is the lawns are riddled

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.950 
lot of times is the lawns are riddled
with<00:00:13.639> Bermuda<00:00:14.639> grass<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.570> rare<00:00:15.929> that

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
with Bermuda grass it's it's rare that

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.529 
with Bermuda grass it's it's rare that
we<00:00:16.199> find<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.949> lawn<00:00:17.190> that's<00:00:17.490> all<00:00:17.730> Bermuda<00:00:18.300> grass

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
we find a lawn that's all Bermuda grass

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.580 
we find a lawn that's all Bermuda grass
but<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.529> same<00:00:19.859> idea<00:00:21.140> applies<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.439> that

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
but the same idea applies to that

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.730 
but the same idea applies to that
situation<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.640> if<00:00:23.939> you've<00:00:24.119> got<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.740> landscape

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
situation so if you've got a landscape

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.939 
situation so if you've got a landscape
that<00:00:26.310> has<00:00:26.490> any<00:00:26.849> Bermuda<00:00:27.570> grass<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.890> is

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
that has any Bermuda grass in it this is

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.310 
that has any Bermuda grass in it this is
why<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.400> need<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.970> eradicate<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:30.990> quickly

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
why you need to eradicate it as quickly

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.270 
why you need to eradicate it as quickly
as<00:00:31.590> possible<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.309> see<00:00:32.790> how<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.540> all

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
as possible you see how this is all

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.180 
as possible you see how this is all
mingled<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.500> manzanita<00:00:37.500> there's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
mingled in with this manzanita there's

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.380 
mingled in with this manzanita there's
no<00:00:38.610> way<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:40.350> now

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
no way to get this out of here now

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.020 
no way to get this out of here now
without<00:00:42.390> basically<00:00:43.350> taking<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.489> ground

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
without basically taking out the ground

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.660 
without basically taking out the ground
cover<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.800> cleaning<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.129> out<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
cover and cleaning all this out and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.459 
cover and cleaning all this out and
these<00:00:48.390> runners<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:50.690> they<00:00:51.690> root<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
these runners that you see they root and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.459 
these runners that you see they root and
all<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:53.219> need<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> little<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.289> these

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
all they need is a little one of these

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.819 
all they need is a little one of these
nodes<00:00:56.010> right<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:57.090> will<00:00:58.020> create<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.469> whole<00:00:58.800> new

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
nodes right here will create a whole new

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.060 
nodes right here will create a whole new
plant<00:00:59.370> so<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.690> gets<00:01:00.989> broken<00:01:01.379> off<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
plant so if this gets broken off and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
plant so if this gets broken off and
buried<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> soil<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.409> already

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
buried in the soil if it's not already

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.070 
buried in the soil if it's not already
dead<00:01:05.189> from<00:01:05.610> being<00:01:05.880> poisoned

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
dead from being poisoned

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.800 
dead from being poisoned
it<00:01:07.350> will<00:01:07.560> start<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.979> new<00:01:08.130> plant<00:01:08.689> the<00:01:09.689> other

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
it will start a new plant the other

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.200 
it will start a new plant the other
thing<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.950> stuff<00:01:11.580> goes<00:01:11.820> dormant

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
thing is is that this stuff goes dormant

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.770 
thing is is that this stuff goes dormant
so<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.619> way<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.010> eradicated<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.479> them

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
so the way it's eradicated is with them

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.130 
so the way it's eradicated is with them
with<00:01:16.470> Roundup<00:01:17.070> typically<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.540> has<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.020> be

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
with Roundup typically and it has to be

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.590 
with Roundup typically and it has to be
actively<00:01:19.710> growing<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> roundup<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
actively growing for the roundup to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.499 
actively growing for the roundup to
affect<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> plant<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.000> if<00:01:24.000> you've<00:01:24.270> got<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
affect the plant so if you've got a

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.350 
affect the plant so if you've got a
winter<00:01:24.869> condition<00:01:25.710> or<00:01:25.920> even<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.430> late<00:01:26.909> fall

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
winter condition or even a late fall

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.990 
winter condition or even a late fall
when<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.110> start<00:01:28.380> enough<00:01:28.650> slow<00:01:29.520> down<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
when this is start enough slow down and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.899 
when this is start enough slow down and
go<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.180> sleep<00:01:30.619> there's<00:01:31.619> no<00:01:31.890> good<00:01:32.250> way<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.490> kill

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
go to sleep there's no good way to kill

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.179 
go to sleep there's no good way to kill
this<00:01:33.150> plant<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.869> get<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.439> out<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.590> your<00:01:34.860> soil

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
this plant and get it out of your soil

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.969 
this plant and get it out of your soil
we<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:36.000> landscapers<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.799> all

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
we have landscapers and the that all

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.609 
we have landscapers and the that all
three<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> guys<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.240> work<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:39.540> what<00:01:40.409> they

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
three of the guys I work with what they

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.490 
three of the guys I work with what they
do<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:41.159> they<00:01:41.430> they<00:01:41.970> wait<00:01:42.210> till<00:01:42.420> spring<00:01:42.689> they

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
do is they they wait till spring they

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.010 
do is they they wait till spring they
water<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.460> fertilize<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.600> needs<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
water it they fertilize it it needs to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.830 
water it they fertilize it it needs to
be<00:01:46.170> actively<00:01:46.740> growing<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.360> poison

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
be actively growing and then they poison

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.810 
be actively growing and then they poison
it<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.079> Roundup<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:49.950> usually<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.579> two

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
it with Roundup and they usually do two

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.700 
it with Roundup and they usually do two
or<00:01:50.970> three<00:01:51.020> applications<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.259> fully<00:01:52.500> eradicate

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
or three applications to fully eradicate

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.370 
or three applications to fully eradicate
it<00:01:53.340> before<00:01:53.700> they<00:01:53.850> feel<00:01:54.060> safe<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:55.170> in

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
it before they feel safe about going in

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130 
it before they feel safe about going in
because<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.579> plant<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.060> new<00:01:57.240> landscape<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
because if you plant a new landscape and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.649 
because if you plant a new landscape and
you've<00:01:58.259> got<00:01:58.469> your<00:01:58.619> plants<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.340> it<00:02:00.149> starts

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you've got your plants going it starts

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.450 
you've got your plants going it starts
off<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.530> where<00:02:01.890> there's<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
off like this where there's just a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.490 
off like this where there's just a
little<00:02:02.640> bit<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:03.329> underground<00:02:03.899> it's

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
little bit of it but underground it's

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.649 
little bit of it but underground it's
running<00:02:04.950> around<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:06.390> virtually

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
running around and it's virtually

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.930 
running around and it's virtually
impossible<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.680> get<00:02:07.860> rid<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.489> that's

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
impossible to get rid of so that's

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.479 
impossible to get rid of so that's
Bermuda<00:02:09.660> grass<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.229> very<00:02:10.590> aware<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:11.250> that

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
Bermuda grass be very aware of that

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.490 
Bermuda grass be very aware of that
dynamic<00:02:12.300> with<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.660> plant

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
dynamic with this plant

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.290 
dynamic with this plant
and<00:02:13.590> by<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.830> way<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.990> seed<00:02:16.290> head<00:02:16.710> and

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
and by the way this is the seed head and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.090 
and by the way this is the seed head and
there<00:02:18.300> are<00:02:18.420> hundreds<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.110> little<00:02:19.410> seeds<00:02:19.710> there

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
there are hundreds of little seeds there

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.660 
there are hundreds of little seeds there
so<00:02:20.730> even<00:02:21.090> if<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:21.360> think<00:02:21.390> you're<00:02:22.430> getting<00:02:23.430> rid

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
so even if you think you're getting rid

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.890 
so even if you think you're getting rid
of<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.000> runners

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
of the runners

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.870 
of the runners
you've<00:02:25.320> got<00:02:25.530> seeds<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.220> deal<00:02:26.400> with<00:02:26.640> as<00:02:26.850> well

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
you've got seeds to deal with as well

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.820 
you've got seeds to deal with as well
and<00:02:27.390> that's<00:02:27.480> one<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.020> reasons<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.680> you

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
and that's one of the reasons that you

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.340 
and that's one of the reasons that you
need<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.130> take<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.490> time<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:30.060> kind<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.420> cycle

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
need to take the time to kind of cycle

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.710 
need to take the time to kind of cycle
it<00:02:31.500> through<00:02:31.830> water<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.730> fertilize<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.570> to

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
it through water it fertilize it to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.690 
it through water it fertilize it to
encourage<00:02:34.080> new<00:02:34.530> growth<00:02:34.560> because<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.490> more

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
actively it's growing the faster it will

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.360 
actively it's growing the faster it will
die<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.370> that's<00:02:39.170> bermudagrass<00:02:40.170> hope<00:02:41.160> you
