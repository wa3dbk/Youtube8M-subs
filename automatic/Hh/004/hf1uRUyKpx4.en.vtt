00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.860
 most often for knitting 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.340
 yarn used in two or three 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.770
 addition rewind yarn very long 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.350
 and tedious even with the presence and 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.820
 electric winder can be easily 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.310
 simplify this process and from one reel 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:39.460
 get 2 which is very convenient for knitting 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:44.620
 at once from two reels we take the reel wide 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:49.150
 by a side of yourself we are plotting a line or 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.840
 yarn layer thickness which we will 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.990
 to separate 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 and start with your fingers in a circle 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:01.740
 separate the outer layer of yarn from the reel 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.740
 gradually this layer on itself 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:09.040
 This method is good for soft and supple 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.460
 yarn in which there is wool 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.430
 acrylic and similar winding on such 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.460
 bobbins looser and separation 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.189
 happens easily and quickly if 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.490
 winding more dense and yarn hard 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:27.340
 such as cotton flax in this case 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:32.310
 the method is unlikely to work and have all 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.310
 rewinding a piece of yarn we push 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.219
 continue to move the outer layer of yarn 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.219
 to myself 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.790
 here we see from this side that layer 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.909
 yarn 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.119
 moves from reel continue 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.540
 evenly stretch this layer of yarn 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.390
 turning bobbin 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.840
 now it is much easier to move 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.460
 you can hold the yarn coils 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.460
 who should stay on the reel 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.660
 now at a sufficient distance 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.940
 we moved this layer we put a hand 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.400
 inwards so that the yarn turns 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.400
 turned up inside not tangled and 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.390
 neatly divide the yarn into two babin 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.830
 here we are not. which separates the two 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:49.959
 babin 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:50.890
 we tear it up align internal 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.080
 yarn twists 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.610
 which are slightly deformed and 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:07.150
 protracted stretch them giving them 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:11.380
 we take the correct form and size now 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:17.519
 bobbin suitable size and pulling 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.519
 stocking layer of yarn on this reel 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.560
 if there is no reel you can take at least 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:42.380
 thick newspaper and roll it up as a cone 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:46.209
 suitable size gradually 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.920
 we stretch the inner turns 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:53.020
 I have a little bit goes tugovato 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.020
 too big reel that I took 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:02.570
 gradually stretch straighten 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:10.100
 Now we can even lower it 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:13.090
 it was knit here in the end we got 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.090
 Here is such a babina 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.419
 can now take 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.960
 thread from this bobbin stand bobbin with 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:27.220
 which we removed the top layer we get 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.220
 2-ply yarn 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.370
 if we need a thread in three additions or in 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:43.070
 4 then we can repeat the same actions and 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.070
 remove another layer from the reel
