handle so in order to open the lid you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.260 
handle so in order to open the lid you
pull<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.290> handle<00:00:49.620> out<00:00:49.820> get<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
pull the handle out get that out of the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.530 
pull the handle out get that out of the
way<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:52.190> pull<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:54.239> topmost

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
way that pull up on that the topmost

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.840 
way that pull up on that the topmost
lever<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.500> releases<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.070> lid<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.760> can

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
lever that releases the lid so you can

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.600 
lever that releases the lid so you can
get<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> shot<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> space<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.860> there<00:00:59.070> once

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
get a shot for the space in there once

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.029

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
you kind of pull forward on that lever a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.070 
you kind of pull forward on that lever a
little<00:01:23.459> bit<00:01:23.610> nice<00:01:24.240> thing<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> shag

with the unlock position you pull that
lever<00:01:33.479> all<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:33.720> way<00:01:33.840> down<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.679> releases<00:01:35.069> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
lever all the way down that releases it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.830 
lever all the way down that releases it
from<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.429> bike<00:01:35.640> you've<00:01:36.209> got<00:01:36.420> your<00:01:36.539> integral

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
from the bike you've got your integral

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.419 
from the bike you've got your integral
handle<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.860> away<00:01:38.069> you<00:01:38.099> go

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
handle and away you go

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.999

just the reverse of that you know this
is<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.259> three<00:01:43.950> alignment<00:01:44.520> fingers<00:01:44.910> there

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
is the three alignment fingers there

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440 
is the three alignment fingers there
those<00:01:46.440> would<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.800> your<00:01:46.830> male<00:01:47.450> alignment

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
those would be your male alignment

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.550 
those would be your male alignment
fingers<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.959> then<00:01:49.050> there's<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.319> female

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
fingers and then there's a female

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.859 
fingers and then there's a female
receiving<00:01:50.220> slots<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:51.270> mounting<00:01:51.630> plate

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
receiving slots on the mounting plate

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.620 
receiving slots on the mounting plate
there<00:01:52.429> so<00:01:53.429> this<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.700> pushes<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.300> there<00:01:54.479> and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
there so this just pushes in there and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.490 
there so this just pushes in there and
then<00:01:54.720> clicks<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.170> place<00:01:57.050> lock<00:01:58.050> it<00:01:58.289> with<00:01:58.440> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
then clicks in place lock it with the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830 
then clicks in place lock it with the
key<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.009> away<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.310> go<00:01:59.459> as<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.239> kind<00:02:00.539> of<00:02:00.630> pan

key and away you go as you kind of pan

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.839 
key and away you go as you kind of pan
on<00:02:00.989> the<00:02:01.110> other<00:02:01.259> side<00:02:01.590> you'll<00:02:02.489> see<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:04.849> shadow

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
on the other side you'll see the shadow

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.749 
on the other side you'll see the shadow

that's<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:11.610> made<00:02:11.760> out<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:11.970> like<00:02:12.090> 3/16

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
that's this it's made out of like 3/16

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.710 
that's this it's made out of like 3/16
steel<00:02:13.680> maybe<00:02:13.950> that's<00:02:14.159> eight

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
steel maybe that's eight

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.840

something<00:02:14.990> like<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.380> as<00:02:15.850> model-specific

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
something like that as model-specific

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.700 
something like that as model-specific
definitely<00:02:17.780> designed<00:02:18.080> for<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.350> one<00:02:18.560> it

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
definitely designed for this one it

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.170 
definitely designed for this one it
comes<00:02:18.830> with<00:02:19.040> spacers<00:02:19.460> so<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.760> can<00:02:19.910> see<00:02:20.060> this

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
comes with spacers so you can see this

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.630 
comes with spacers so you can see this

is the existing grab rail very simple
straightforward<00:02:22.910> installation<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.410> it

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
straightforward installation but it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.950 
straightforward installation but it
makes<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:24.830> this<00:02:25.220> plate<00:02:25.520> is<00:02:25.760> as<00:02:26.000> rigid<00:02:26.630> as

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
makes it so this plate is as rigid as

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.530 
makes it so this plate is as rigid as
the<00:02:27.110> black<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.590> connects<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:29.000> know<00:02:29.120> with
