bottle to landfill and that's down the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.130 
bottle to landfill and that's down the
consistent<00:01:31.320> consumer<00:01:31.890> education<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.450> my

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
consistent consumer education so my

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.600 
consistent consumer education so my
belief<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.590> always<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> vast<00:01:35.460> majority

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
belief is always that the vast majority

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.940 
belief is always that the vast majority
of<00:01:35.970> consumers<00:01:36.570> want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> right<00:01:37.619> thing

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
of consumers want to do the right thing

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.789 
of consumers want to do the right thing
it's<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.430> question<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.820> communication

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
it's just a question of communication

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.469 
it's just a question of communication
consistent<00:01:40.799> communication<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.909> education

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
consistent communication and education

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.660 
consistent communication and education
so<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.530> need<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> consistent<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.490> clear

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
so we need a consistent and clear

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.639 
so we need a consistent and clear
message<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.240> there<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.990> terms<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.439> plastic

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649

contamination is a function of quite a
few<00:01:57.180> issues<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:58.140> about<00:01:58.439> communication<00:01:59.159> so

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
few issues it's about communication so

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.910 
few issues it's about communication so
it's<00:01:59.969> about<00:02:00.180> local<00:02:01.110> authorities<00:02:01.469> waste

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920

management companies get in

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.220 
management companies get in
communication<00:02:03.329> right<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:03.930> a

householders and their systems it's

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.150 
householders and their systems it's
about<00:02:07.390> system<00:02:07.870> it's<00:02:08.290> about<00:02:08.500> choosing<00:02:08.890> the

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
about system it's about choosing the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.280 
about system it's about choosing the
appropriate<00:02:09.220> system<00:02:09.850> so<00:02:10.480> the<00:02:10.900> system<00:02:11.200> is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
appropriate system so the system is

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.660 
appropriate system so the system is
capable<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.890> delivering<00:02:12.040> high<00:02:12.640> quality

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.400 
capable of delivering high quality
materials<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.870> can<00:02:13.960> do<00:02:14.080> all<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.290> right

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
materials you can do all the right

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.260 
materials you can do all the right
things<00:02:14.470> but<00:02:14.920> if<00:02:15.460> you've<00:02:15.580> just<00:02:15.670> got<00:02:15.850> one<00:02:15.880> weak

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
things but if you've just got one weak

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.940 
things but if you've just got one weak
link<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.660> chain<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.410> quality<00:02:17.770> can

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
link in the chain the quality can

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.160 
link in the chain the quality can
disappear<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.550> it's<00:02:18.670> it's<00:02:19.180> about<00:02:19.390> quite<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.080> few

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
disappear so it's it's about quite a few

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.020 
disappear so it's it's about quite a few
things<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.590> get<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.770> good<00:02:21.070> high<00:02:21.400> quality<00:02:21.430> level

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
enemy of recycling you know so the main

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.160 
enemy of recycling you know so the main
contaminants<00:02:27.940> we<00:02:28.060> receive<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.630> we've<00:02:28.810> seen<00:02:29.020> is

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
contaminants we receive as we've seen is

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.390 
contaminants we receive as we've seen is
going<00:02:29.380> around<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.590> plant<00:02:29.800> here<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
going around the plant here the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.160 
going around the plant here the
predominant<00:02:30.940> one<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.390> plastics<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.050> when

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
predominant one is is plastics so when

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.570 
predominant one is is plastics so when
you<00:02:32.230> get<00:02:32.320> plastics<00:02:32.680> mixed<00:02:32.890> together<00:02:33.010> as

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
you get plastics mixed together as

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.430 
you get plastics mixed together as
you've<00:02:33.790> seen<00:02:33.940> today<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.600> causes<00:02:34.960> problems<00:02:35.110> in

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
you've seen today it causes problems in

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.810 
you've seen today it causes problems in

our process for every one percent of
contamination<00:02:37.240> we<00:02:37.480> get<00:02:37.630> we<00:02:38.140> get<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.290> two

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
contamination we get we get a two

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.440 
contamination we get we get a two
percent<00:02:38.770> commercial<00:02:39.160> impact<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:40.120> starts

percent commercial impact that starts
out<00:02:40.540> pretty<00:02:40.600> low<00:02:41.100> actually<00:02:42.100> when<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.310> start

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
out pretty low actually when you start

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.640 
out pretty low actually when you start

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
getting further into the numbers so when

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.320 
getting further into the numbers so when
the<00:02:44.740> numbers<00:02:45.010> start<00:02:45.220> getting<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.970> two<00:02:46.180> or

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
the numbers start getting to two or

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.630 
the numbers start getting to two or
three<00:02:46.360> percent<00:02:46.720> contamination<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.920> cost<00:02:48.490> of

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
three percent contamination the cost of

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.770 
three percent contamination the cost of
the<00:02:48.700> business<00:02:48.790> accelerates<00:02:49.420> away<00:02:49.510> really

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the business accelerates away really

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.080 
the business accelerates away really
really<00:02:50.020> rapidly<00:02:50.410> I'm<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.340> firm<00:02:51.610> believer<00:02:51.640> in

really rapidly I'm a firm believer in

really rapidly I'm a firm believer in

I<00:03:00.550> think<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.910> consumers<00:03:01.300> understand<00:03:01.990> that

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
I think the consumers understand that

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.690 
I think the consumers understand that
little<00:03:02.260> bit<00:03:02.350> more<00:03:02.380> they<00:03:02.980> buy<00:03:03.190> into<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.670> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
little bit more they buy into it a

little bit more they buy into it a

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
little bit more it's about trying to get

little bit more it's about trying to get
the<00:03:05.200> systems<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:06.250> we've<00:03:06.610> got<00:03:06.790> better<00:03:07.090> making

the systems that we've got better making

be suitable for a high quality process
and<00:03:16.209> we<00:03:16.300> like<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.540> think<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:16.840> actually<00:03:16.959> with

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
and we like to think that actually with

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.780 
and we like to think that actually with
just<00:03:17.770> some<00:03:17.860> simple<00:03:18.040> improvements<00:03:18.400> in

that we're doing in the mill it affects

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.420 
that we're doing in the mill it affects
our<00:03:28.450> pricing<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.320> affects<00:03:29.739> our<00:03:29.980> health<00:03:30.220> and

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
the biggest problem is is definitely

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.600 
the biggest problem is is definitely

equipment in cause we're on a machinery
and<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:54.940> is<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.209> significant<00:03:56.050> issue<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.590> us<00:03:56.620> in

and is is a significant issue to us in

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.640 
and is is a significant issue to us in

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
items things like tins cans plastic

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.479 
items things like tins cans plastic
bottles<00:04:02.080> they<00:04:02.260> come<00:04:02.500> in<00:04:02.620> over<00:04:02.890> our<00:04:02.920> Weybridge

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
bottles they come in over our Weybridge

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.610 
bottles they come in over our Weybridge
and<00:04:03.730> in<00:04:04.090> effect<00:04:04.390> we<00:04:04.630> pay<00:04:04.840> for<00:04:05.050> them<00:04:05.170> as<00:04:05.290> fiber

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
and in effect we pay for them as fiber

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.190 
and in effect we pay for them as fiber
and<00:04:05.980> then<00:04:06.340> we<00:04:06.459> have<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.760> pay<00:04:06.940> again<00:04:07.420> for<00:04:07.780> their

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
and then we have to pay again for their

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.100 
and then we have to pay again for their
disposal<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:09.100> think<00:04:09.489> from<00:04:09.670> our<00:04:09.760> perspective<00:04:10.110> it

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
disposal I think from our perspective it

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.840 
disposal I think from our perspective it
starts<00:04:11.530> with<00:04:11.680> communication<00:04:12.340> effective

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
starts with communication effective

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.060 
starts with communication effective
communication<00:04:13.200> from<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.290> local<00:04:14.560> authority

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
communication from a local authority

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.039 
communication from a local authority
perspective<00:04:15.640> out<00:04:15.850> towards<00:04:16.299> their<00:04:16.450> residents

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
perspective out towards their residents

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.990 
perspective out towards their residents
so<00:04:17.170> that<00:04:17.320> general<00:04:17.950> public<00:04:18.310> understand

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
so that general public understand

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000 
so that general public understand
and<00:04:19.090> how<00:04:19.540> to<00:04:19.600> present<00:04:19.989> their<00:04:20.290> recyclables<00:04:20.860> in

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
and how to present their recyclables in

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.150 
and how to present their recyclables in
a<00:04:21.070> way<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.519> suits<00:04:22.000> UK<00:04:22.900> reprocesses<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.830> think

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
a way that suits UK reprocesses I think

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.700 
a way that suits UK reprocesses I think
as<00:04:24.340> well<00:04:24.520> when<00:04:25.450> local<00:04:25.930> authorities<00:04:26.380> have<00:04:26.590> an

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
as well when local authorities have an

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.830 
as well when local authorities have an
opportunity<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.580> review<00:04:28.000> perhaps<00:04:28.540> their

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
opportunity to review perhaps their

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.420 
opportunity to review perhaps their
collection<00:04:29.290> methodology<00:04:29.680> or<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.130> way<00:04:30.250> that

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
collection methodology or the way that

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.280 
collection methodology or the way that
they<00:04:30.580> approach<00:04:30.670> things<00:04:30.970> it's<00:04:31.780> about<00:04:31.960> ensuring

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
they approach things it's about ensuring

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.410 
they approach things it's about ensuring
that<00:04:32.650> they<00:04:32.860> apply<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.220> new<00:04:33.520> teep<00:04:33.790> standards

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
that they apply the new teep standards

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.680 
that they apply the new teep standards
to<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.260> that<00:04:35.410> decision-making<00:04:35.950> process<00:04:36.690> in
