00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.610
 good at 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.680
 hello welcome to our 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.390
 vegan cooking show i am sarina and i 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.529
 would like to show you today like us 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.450
 to bake our delicious wholemeal bread 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.009
 So first I need a big one 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.890
 bowl in the whole day 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.769
 can listen 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.430
 our woman compote with the qualcomm us 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:40.750
 baked 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.750
 I need 500 grams of it first 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.660
 they will come first as well 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.660
 right in the bowl 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:08.810
 here comes the dry yeast out of it 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.020
 will be with a big one ever 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.240
 well emphasized that the yeast is good 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.100
 mixed with the flour and we afterwards 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.530
 a uniform bread get that way 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.340
 is a very barren bread because we are 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.990
 like very much 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.910
 I have different things for it 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.100
 I chose first 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.310
 packed amaranth rain man makes 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.490
 a total of about 150 to 200 grains 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.530
 gram depending on how you have air 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.150
 what you want to know how could you do that 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.740
 You may want to boot it 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.830
 theoretically also without grains 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.140
 if you do not like it then 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.840
 make the building on the edge first 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:58.150
 a little bit goes in whether the ammerland 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.310
 Incidentally, it is very rich in protein and 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.080
 therefore have very healthy and that can 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.860
 you also wonderful in the boat 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.930
 reinmachen 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.509
 Next, I make a little bit 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.629
 We really like milk with pure 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.629
 but you can generally no rhyme 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:17.569
 make you like it month i have i 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:21.340
 next, slowly come away 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.340
 which just tilt me 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:31.599
 then I have but the planner 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:36.709
 finther also delicious and i have 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:40.150
 gold it just the way you buy them 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.150
 can not cook yet 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:48.859
 so now I have a good 160 program on 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.170
 grains in it comes next the salt 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.269
 to do that, you need bread like that 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.099
 from 500 grams of flour about two 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.329
 Teaspoon but if you are a little saltier 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.769
 You just like to do a little bit more 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.230
 pure when it is not so set I like 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.049
 If you take less then you are allowed to open completely 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.120
 trust your own taste so now 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.060
 we have all dry things in it 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.079
 Now the whole thing will be nice to him again 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.299
 stirred and then we start 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.670
 even to the liquid ingredients 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.530
 To fill rhine first you take one 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.810
 fruit vinegar I have one in the case 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.739
 taken from it is two 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.739
 tablespoon pure 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.829
 This ensures that the bread is afterwards 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.269
 not like pizza tastes but also 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.269
 has some acid in it 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.909
 so now we only need one more 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:04:09.870
 half a liter of water and then we have 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:04:17.849
 Already all the ingredients in the bread in it 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:21.539
 whole is now well with everything increases 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:28.349
 stir the spoon well so that it 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:35.250
 a uniform mass is the dough 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:36.660
 must be really nice move rather 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.729
 I prefer the experience 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.180
 A shot of water too much as too little 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.180
 then take the bread is better 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.970
 if the dough is really nice now 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.590
 is mingled by making a box shape 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.349
 I have indeed in the case with 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.639
 Baking paper designed so that afterwards 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.599
 The bread is easier again 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.720
 rauszubekommen 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:06.419
 without having to wash the scary 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.930
 here comes the biomass 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:13.729
 rows are not that sticky either 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:19.620
 the best good decant 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:22.310
 the whole thing will be in shape evenly 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.310
 pushed 

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:32.099
 so now the bread is so far prepared 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.049
 is relatively fast so you can do it 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.099
 also easy to do by the side 

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:36.149
 or for the next day already 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.219
 prepare 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:39.329
 Now there is the possibility if you 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.629
 you still have a little time left 

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:43.439
 go half an hour or hour 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:46.289
 otherwise you can do it already 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:49.469
 right in the oven at 200 degrees 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.869
 it has now been baked 50 minutes with air 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:53.429
 You can tell afterwards whether the bread is ready 

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:56.759
 is when you knock other bottom 

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:58.889
 and it sounds like that then I wish 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.179
 you have a lot of fun doing and 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.739
 I'll show you when the bread 

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:04.159
 baked is what it looks like when it is 

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:04.159
 finished
