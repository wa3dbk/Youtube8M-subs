give you a little bit of grip your

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.750 
give you a little bit of grip your
normal<00:01:06.420> controller<00:01:06.780> doesn't<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.290> these

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
normal controller doesn't have these

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.960 
normal controller doesn't have these
raised<00:01:08.760> bumps<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.450> these<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.520> says

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
raised bumps but these do so it says

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.920 
raised bumps but these do so it says
it's<00:01:12.240> supposed<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.510> improve<00:01:12.840> your

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it's supposed to improve your

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.390 
it's supposed to improve your
performance<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.650> we're<00:01:13.799> gonna<00:01:13.890> put<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
performance but we're gonna put that to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.429 
performance but we're gonna put that to
the<00:01:14.430> test<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.850> course<00:01:15.119> before<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.290> get

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the test of course before we can get

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
the test of course before we can get
into<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.680> let's<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.280> show<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> blue

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
into that let's just show you the blue

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.539 
into that let's just show you the blue
one<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.299> close<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.979> guys<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.189> maybe<00:01:20.310> tell

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
one up close and you guys can maybe tell

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.039 
one up close and you guys can maybe tell
me<00:01:20.729> which<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:20.939> your<00:01:21.210> favorite<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> black<00:01:21.900> one

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049

or the blue one

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.740 
or the blue one
personally<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.610> think<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.330> blue<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.630> is

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
personally I think the blue one is

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.399 
personally I think the blue one is
cooler<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:26.009> I'm<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.640> based<00:01:27.000> on

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
cooler but if I'm just going based on

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.749 
cooler but if I'm just going based on
aesthetics<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.950> black<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.369> matches<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
aesthetics the black one matches the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.310 
aesthetics the black one matches the
controller<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.780> yeah<00:01:30.869> I'll<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> blue

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
controller here yeah I'll get a blue

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.749 
controller here yeah I'll get a blue
controller<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> put<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.610> there

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
controller just to put that one in there

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.850 
controller just to put that one in there
we'll<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.140> let's<00:01:34.140> give<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.470> quick<00:01:34.650> demo

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
we'll see let's give you a quick demo

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.190 
we'll see let's give you a quick demo
how<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.220> put<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.939> install<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
how to put it on and install it so to

how to put it on and install it so to
speak<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.759> went<00:01:38.759> ahead<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> place<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.450> first

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
speak I went ahead and place the first

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.539 
speak I went ahead and place the first
one<00:01:39.840> off<00:01:40.020> camera<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
one off camera just so I can get a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
one off camera just so I can get a
better<00:01:41.729> feel<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.030> how<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:43.380> you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
on the white part and kind of peel it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.469 
on the white part and kind of peel it
inside<00:01:51.240> out<00:01:51.420> once<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.409> did<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.149> took<00:01:54.149> my
