an<00:00:00.450> easy<00:00:00.900> way<00:00:01.079> of<00:00:01.199> finding<00:00:01.290> out<00:00:01.620> what<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.340> wrong

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
an easy way of finding out what is wrong

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.340 
an easy way of finding out what is wrong
with<00:00:02.669> your<00:00:02.850> car<00:00:02.879> I've<00:00:03.570> noticed<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.200> my

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
with your car I've noticed that my

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.470 
with your car I've noticed that my
blinker<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.770> double-timed<00:00:05.339> so<00:00:06.150> let<00:00:06.270> me<00:00:06.359> show

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
blinker is double-timed so let me show

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:15.939 
blinker is double-timed so let me show
you<00:00:06.569> talking<00:00:06.930> about<00:00:13.340> okay<00:00:14.630> so<00:00:15.630> if<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.809> look

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
you talking about okay so if you look

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.560 
you talking about okay so if you look
this<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.130> what<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.490> normal<00:00:17.789> blinker<00:00:18.270> sounds

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
this is what a normal blinker sounds

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.470 
this is what a normal blinker sounds
like<00:00:19.760> my<00:00:20.760> right<00:00:20.970> blinker<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.949> double-time<00:00:23.480> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
like my right blinker is double-time the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.810 
like my right blinker is double-time the
easiest<00:00:24.779> way<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.050> figure<00:00:25.320> out<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:26.580> meaning

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
easiest way to figure out the meaning

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.880 
easiest way to figure out the meaning
the<00:00:27.420> reason<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.930> double<00:00:28.199> x<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.680> side

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the reason that it double x on this side

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.609 
the reason that it double x on this side
is<00:00:29.070> because<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:30.029> telling<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.289> light

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
is because it's telling you the light

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.290 
is because it's telling you the light
one<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.309> your<00:00:32.430> lights<00:00:32.610> your<00:00:32.850> front<00:00:33.059> or<00:00:33.149> your

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
one of your lights your front or your

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.680 
one of your lights your front or your
back<00:00:33.510> he's<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.739> out<00:00:34.980> or<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> up<00:00:35.610> turn<00:00:36.570> on

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
back he's going out or is up turn on

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:48.819 
back he's going out or is up turn on
your<00:00:36.719> securities<00:00:37.500> walk<00:00:38.010> around<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> car<00:00:38.550> and
