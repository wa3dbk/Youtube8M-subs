00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.760
 It is tension conceded open space of good luck place 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.950
 Ricardo plans to have a podium in school competition 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.450
 After the 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:18.030
 Fuel x in the restricted version 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.930
 Red Bull received disapproval as a complaint 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:26.700
 I have issued 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.700
 Broadcasting scene begins with anti-fya mainland from now on after 30 minutes 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.400
 w store 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.480
 Question 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.070
 I had a bad swing 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.070
 It's N child entered the hand 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.190
 Four season 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:36.510
 The psychology that began in the middle of your time in the morning was practiced in the hard time half ago 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.380
 It was a two and so in the room centered about time 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:44.140
 One of the issues is 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.390
 Red Bull did not use the fia approved fuel flow measurement sensor during the race 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.320
 about 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:55.610
 And another one is a used second stunt 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:59.710
 The fuel flow rate regulation which is specified as 100 kg per hour 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.710
 It was two that was over 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:08.200
 Opening as anything there is a non-Red Bull side in relation to the above two points in the vote, which came out the next day of the psychological 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.250
 Of war 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.110
 Support Steward's Judgment 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:20.510
 Ricardo's disqualification was confirmed 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:23.290
 Although various interesting facts came out in the trial over this time, but 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.730
 Among them, I was most surprised 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:35.459
 The mss lawyer who appeared as a witness 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:35.459
 You've criticized the cliff very strictly about Red Blue 's activity this time 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.630
 If you continue to violate this kind of thing 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.090
 Fuel consumption regulation this time 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.600
 It breaks down from the bottom of the floor 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.350
 Red Bull is not only disqualified but more 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.660
 Should receive serious penalties 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:03.290
 It was evacuated until there 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:04.970
 Well one it'd be various idea to say Well backside came to such attitude 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.030
 last year's 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:14.920
 It is Pirelli's stain 2 test so there is a positive Bills, but I stand in a defendant seat 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.030
 I've been in various places first, but it's kind of like a little dentist 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.350
 Wonder if it happened 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.500
 Then one more is that 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.110
 Introduction other team a mistake s 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.450
 tightly 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.720
 Why Red Bull only to keep the rules 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.700
 And what must be to beat it yet forgiven 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.700
 I think there was such a complaint 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:44.260
 Very well or rather lose 18 points Come to Well to Red Bull In this sense 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.090
 painful 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.370
 Also I'd set there in the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:54.510
 Some relief in that it was decided not to suffer any further penalties 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.510
 May not be
