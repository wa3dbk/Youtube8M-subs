00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello friends, I welcome you to 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.879
 Fifteen pikachu my name is Olya I want 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.890
 find out who is really 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.870
 golden freddie in the game five nights at 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.389
 freddy's if you don't understand what is there then 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.250
 link to the passage in the description drove 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.960
 there is an assumption that golden Freddy 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.060
 it's just a hallucination of schmidt shirt 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.710
 protagonist confirmation of this 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.869
 serves the fact that it is not visible on 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.760
 monitors when he goes to the office what 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.900
 refuted by the fact that Jeremy also 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.970
 sees golden freddy 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.800
 alternative theories it is assumed that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.369
 golden Freddie is the guy from the phone in 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.140
 suit 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.360
 another version that golden freddy is 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 spare animatronic chindo skeleton can 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.840
 see behind the scenes and and confirmation 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.820
 serves the fact that in the prequel can 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.980
 see the drawings of the golden right 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 office wall in the second part of the game golden 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.610
 Freddie looks frustrating left ear 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.530
 missing wool became dark 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.690
 brown it seems that from different places 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.760
 his body is sticking with golden freddy's wires 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.590
 becomes active during 6 nights 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.270
 to prevent his death player 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.070
 must quickly wear a freddie mask or 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.930
 turn off the flashlight I want to compare everyone 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.760
 three bears can be then we will understand 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.190
 under whose hidden game now 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.049
 some facts about the main animatronics 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.159
 Game Freddy melody can serve 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.159
 fourth phone call 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.320
 implies that Freddie could be 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.270
 involved in the death of the guys from the phone but he 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.100
 can play this tune in the kitchen 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.110
 explaining the lack of movement of frodi 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.090
 the first two nights you can be what he 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.490
 studying your strategy former security guard 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.440
 claims that Freddie is getting more 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.600
 active in the dark this may explain 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.759
 why is he hiding in dark areas 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.100
 each room unlike slaughter faces 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.810
 which tend to become bright areas 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.850
 seems to appear with human eyes 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.740
 in hallucinations while bonny 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.869
 appears with its endo skeleton or 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.820
 without eyes it could be the theories of what 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.649
 Freddie himself killed the guy from the phone and 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.780
 may have found a free life now 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.310
 the guy with the phone is Freddie, it’s not for nothing 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.290
 the same game is called Freddie’s Five Nights 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.420
 I think the name also has 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.150
 some sense if you look like that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.890
 can and fredy suspect in a bite 87 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.690
 as I said in one of the past 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.430
 parts that he has seen on his face 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.260
 child's hand print is possible 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.780
 the developers have confused us specifically 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.700
 foxy doing such a terrible and a toothy 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.930
 Freddie is sweet and kind but about that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.549
 you can only talk 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.230
 here are the developers in the third part 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.730
 lay the clue by the way 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.530
 developer made recently on 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.540
 official website hint at the output of these 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.370
 parts if it comes out soon 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.380

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.600
