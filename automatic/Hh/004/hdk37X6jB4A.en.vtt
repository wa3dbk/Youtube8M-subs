00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.860
 we have been the diamond camouflages 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.370
 to be more special you can give it 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.370
 quite 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.770
 The truth is that if you notice I lied to you 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.600

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.330
 now I will put you would be if you see it in 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
 third person and the truth is that they are 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.189
 pretty cool all but now then 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.140
 you will see my favorite and good as you see 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.650
 they are all coated in gold and then 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.790
 what the parts have are diamond 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.920
 as you can see there are some more diamonds 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.710
 great than others but the truth is that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.500
 they are very small now the knife in the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.210
 of combat and today is simply like that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.030
 has more has the grip with 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.100
 diamond and the diamond blade is that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.020
 Now when you see him in the third person 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.980
 now you see that if you look you have 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.900
 totally the diamond needle and up 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.900
 where is the edge have two diamonds 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.379
 ok now we are with the knife 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.030
 ballistic the ballistic knife there is a 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.670
 peculiarity in which a person does not 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.399
 you see is that if you look at the sheet 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.750
 It is also diamond, that is, not before 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.590
 you see that the blade was diamond 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.590
 reload the needle 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.580
 and finally we come to him is when and 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.979
 about him without a doubt is my favorite 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.570
 because this is amazing, look at how 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.430
 is that is it has now by means and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.909

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.729
 sides is to say if you notice also you see 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.340
 that the brightness the diamonds go 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.110
 shining as you go moving 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.540
 because it will leave the light 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.409
 then and the truth is that the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.569

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.960
 diamonds down large size by 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.429
