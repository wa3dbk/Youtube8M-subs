00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.410
 What will he look like three months after the crime? 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.650
 It 's the voice of the boy who got it hard . 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.869
 It's a mess. 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.869
 Minutes to eat've'll want to eat something itjyo 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.390
 A little hot 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.670
 Come on, Pooh 5 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.989
 What do you say something ? 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:39.699
 Quickly 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.699
 Who will not send 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:50.670
 [music] 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.670
 The boy is reading a perverse interest towards him in jail for 2 flat world 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:59.140
 U 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:04.210
 Through the medium of sns after another becomes a true privilege for crying Jersey 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:10.450
 I can clearly show what the criminal is thinking about this case. 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:15.159
 Suffering of people in front of any mail is referred to these things rather than throw this 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:20.229
 I do not see it in front of me when some of my actions are online, 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:27.369
 Tens of thousands of people disliked and about a million people 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:30.310
 When a boy who could be much more nervous reaches out and gets help , 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:35.540
 It was smart thing caught 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.680
 And boy gotta spend a little addicted to the world sns 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.479
 [music] 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.829
 This terrible sentence is very important when a criminal appears 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.929
 It is not a psycho pass. 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:53.270
 In this way, before we turn it into someone other than us, 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:58.969
 One of us who routinely uses the essence is doing this terrible crime 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:04.640
 Ok when jeojilreoteul this for real crime in our society 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:09.739
 On such social personal causes that criminals have acted so far 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:13.090
 For more in-depth support to these efforts are three of the most important you ever 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.090
 It can be seen as a point 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.709
 There may be a Jewish third author. 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.769
 [music] 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.840
 And another shocking incident. 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:32.660
 You may reveal yourself 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:35.200
 Receive support through the sns instead to relate to people in reality yet 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:40.240
 The killer who was comforted 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.740
 The more I get away from reality, the more I lose the ability to empathize the pain of others. 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.440
 Maybe not 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.440
 So maybe he's become a acquired psychopath .
