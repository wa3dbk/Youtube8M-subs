rubs against in here and it can like
tangles

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
tangles

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.590 
tangles
that's<00:02:31.280> how<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.700> with<00:02:31.850> curly<00:02:32.150> hair<00:02:32.239> can

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.090 
that's how it is with curly hair can
take<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.810> little<00:02:33.020> bit<00:02:33.200> back<00:02:33.410> there<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.890> that

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
take a little bit back there so that

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.250 
take a little bit back there so that
helps<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.640> throughout<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.060> week<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.570> it

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
helps it throughout the week and it

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.380
