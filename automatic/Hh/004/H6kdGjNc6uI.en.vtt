and<00:00:34.200> tap<00:00:34.739> our<00:00:34.980> bumper<00:00:35.399> because<00:00:35.730> it'll<00:00:36.059> just

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
and tap our bumper because it'll just

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.060

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
like fly you over there and you won't

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.979 
like fly you over there and you won't
get<00:00:38.219> hit<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> fastest<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.719> simplest

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
get hit it's the fastest and simplest

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.440 
get hit it's the fastest and simplest
way<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:40.410> believe<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.670> jump<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.239> high<00:00:42.300> as

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
way I do believe so just jump as high as

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.450 
way I do believe so just jump as high as
you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.960> shoot<00:00:43.200> over<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.620> things

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
you can and shoot over there things

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.250 
you can and shoot over there things
won't<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.969> able<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.180> hit<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.629> easily<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
won't be able to hit you that easily and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.049 
won't be able to hit you that easily and

launcher preferably the Gila hunt well

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.730 
launcher preferably the Gila hunt well
Gallo<00:01:04.650> horn<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.930> once<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.080> do<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.710> just

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
Gallo horn and once you do that you just

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
got to kill them as fast as you can and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.420 
got to kill them as fast as you can and
the<00:01:10.049> reason<00:01:10.260> why<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.500> send<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> show<00:01:10.950> guy<00:01:11.130> over

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the reason why we send the show guy over

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.070 
the reason why we send the show guy over
is<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.210> use<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.540> super<00:01:12.930> where

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
is because you can use the super where

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.539 
is because you can use the super where
you<00:01:13.200> hit<00:01:13.320> left<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.799> right<00:01:13.920> bumper<00:01:14.130> together

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
you hit left and right bumper together

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.969 
you hit left and right bumper together
and<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.270> shoots<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.810> big<00:01:16.020> orb<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and it shoots like that big orb out and

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.289 
and it shoots like that big orb out and
it<00:01:17.070> does<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> lot<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.520> damage<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it does a lot of damage to the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.149 
it does a lot of damage to the
gatekeeper<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.470> that's<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.799> recommend

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
gatekeeper so that's what I recommend

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.890 
gatekeeper so that's what I recommend
doing<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.060> go<00:01:21.180> ahead<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.450> hold<00:01:21.750> your

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
doing and you can go ahead and hold your

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.020 
doing and you can go ahead and hold your
bubble<00:01:22.229> right<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:22.619> while<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.580> opening

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
bubble right there while it's opening

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.670 
bubble right there while it's opening
and<00:01:24.210> I'll<00:01:24.299> stop<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.750> shots<00:01:25.020> from<00:01:25.229> being<00:01:25.439> hit

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and I'll stop all shots from being hit

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.370 
and I'll stop all shots from being hit
towards<00:01:25.979> people<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.580> nobody<00:01:27.119> knew<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.380> and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
very hard thing to do because there is a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.839 
very hard thing to do because there is a
ton<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.240> minotaurs<00:02:06.719> like<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.550> pretty

ridiculous<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.410> both<00:02:10.890> of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
ridiculous you just have to have both of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.340 
ridiculous you just have to have both of
them<00:02:11.280> destroying<00:02:12.060> everything<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.690> can

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
them destroying everything you can

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.670 
them destroying everything you can
and<00:02:13.850> basically<00:02:14.850> that's<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.600> couple<00:02:16.470> words

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
and basically that's it a couple words

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.350 
and basically that's it a couple words
of<00:02:16.860> advice<00:02:16.950> if<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:17.820> have<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.000> defender

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
of advice if you do have a defender

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.880 
of advice if you do have a defender
tight<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.690> try<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.870> put<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.080> bubble<00:02:19.440> right

there at the center center conflux that
does<00:02:22.440> help<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.880> keep<00:02:24.120> bashing<00:02:24.360> all<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
does help and just keep bashing all the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.800 
does help and just keep bashing all the
minotaurs<00:02:25.200> until<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:25.740> done<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:27.510> it

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
minotaurs until it's done and that's it
