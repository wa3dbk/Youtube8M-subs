00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
think I'd be wearing Lolita for about

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.550 
think I'd be wearing Lolita for about
five<00:00:37.800> six<00:00:38.280> years<00:00:38.670> now<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.180> started<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.380> was

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
five six years now I started when I was

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.000 
five six years now I started when I was
about<00:00:41.600> 17<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:43.290> when<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.470> got<00:00:43.680> my<00:00:43.830> first

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
about 17 that's when I got my first

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.310 
about 17 that's when I got my first
dress<00:00:44.310> but<00:00:44.790> I<00:00:44.970> don't<00:00:45.000> count<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.570> first<00:00:45.930> year

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
dress but I don't count that first year

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.819 
dress but I don't count that first year
because<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:48.120> dress<00:00:48.329> was<00:00:48.510> from<00:00:48.720> eBay<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
because the dress was from eBay it

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.790 
because the dress was from eBay it
wasn't<00:00:50.220> particularly<00:00:50.579> nice<00:00:51.060> and<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:52.230> didn't

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
wasn't particularly nice and I didn't

wasn't particularly nice and I didn't
dress<00:00:52.980> particularly<00:00:53.670> well

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
