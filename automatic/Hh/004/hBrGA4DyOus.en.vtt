fix<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:46.890> 50k<00:01:47.250> because<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.030> actually

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
fix with 50k because you can actually

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.810

only<00:01:48.540> projects<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.290> forms<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:50.460> because

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
only projects in forms I think because

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.330 
only projects in forms I think because
otherwise<00:01:51.060> packs<00:01:51.930> are<00:01:52.079> being<00:01:52.229> open<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.680> just

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
otherwise packs are being open and just

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.639 
otherwise packs are being open and just
you<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> continuous<00:01:54.869> flowing<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.409> course

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
you get a continuous flowing of course

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.660 
you get a continuous flowing of course
in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.860> mark<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.549> just

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
in the mark and then it's just

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.730 
in the mark and then it's just
impossible<00:01:57.090> due<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:58.140> price<00:01:58.380> fix<00:01:58.619> an

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
impossible due to price fix an

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.499 
impossible due to price fix an
uninformed<00:01:59.219> player<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.700> my<00:01:59.939> opinion<00:02:00.240> it's

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
uninformed player in my opinion it's

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.209 
uninformed player in my opinion it's
also<00:02:00.659> very<00:02:00.869> hard<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> price<00:02:01.530> fixing<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.920> foreign

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
also very hard to price fixing a foreign

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.530 
also very hard to price fixing a foreign
players<00:02:02.430> since<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.820> don't<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.149> how<00:02:03.329> many

popular times when you have to take into
account<00:03:26.169> most<00:03:26.530> people<00:03:26.979> play<00:03:27.639> automating<00:03:28.090> in

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
account most people play automating in

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.599 
account most people play automating in
Europe<00:03:28.569> so<00:03:28.989> at<00:03:29.409> peak<00:03:29.680> times<00:03:29.889> in<00:03:30.099> Europe<00:03:30.400> let's

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
Europe so at peak times in Europe let's

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.679 
Europe so at peak times in Europe let's
say<00:03:30.849> around<00:03:31.590> six<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.859> ten<00:03:33.040> pm<00:03:33.370> yeah<00:03:34.030> 6<00:03:34.449> 10pm

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
say around six and ten pm yeah 6 10pm

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.149 
say around six and ten pm yeah 6 10pm
something<00:03:35.199> like<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.409> that<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:35.620> think<00:03:36.099> the

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
something like that that I think the

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.920 
something like that that I think the
best<00:03:36.370> time<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.939> buy<00:03:37.150> your<00:03:37.180> place<00:03:37.569> because

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
best time to buy your place because

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.199 
best time to buy your place because
that's<00:03:38.109> when<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.739> prices<00:03:39.040> are<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.400> lowest<00:03:39.549> do

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
that's when the prices are the lowest do

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.839 
that's when the prices are the lowest do
