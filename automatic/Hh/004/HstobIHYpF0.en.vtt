Stanford<00:00:05.460> University<00:00:10.460> good<00:00:11.460> things<00:00:11.790> about

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
Stanford University good things about

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.660 
Stanford University good things about
this<00:00:12.240> process<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.929> really<00:00:13.259> it's<00:00:13.889> very<00:00:13.980> simple

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
this process is really it's very simple

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.380 
this process is really it's very simple
right<00:00:15.630> low<00:00:15.900> cost<00:00:16.230> very<00:00:16.740> easy<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.400> do<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:18.090> think

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
right low cost very easy to do we think

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.170 
right low cost very easy to do we think
this<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.900> really<00:00:19.230> change<00:00:19.800> how<00:00:20.189> people<00:00:20.250> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
this can really change how people the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.029 
this can really change how people the
white<00:00:21.390> people<00:00:21.720> make<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.859> would<00:00:23.010> like

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
white people make that is we would like

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.779 
white people make that is we would like
to<00:00:23.490> use<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:23.970> paper<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:25.230> put<00:00:25.529> inside<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.430> fuel

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
to use this paper to put inside the fuel

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.769 
to use this paper to put inside the fuel
cells<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.390> produce<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.619> new<00:00:28.890> type<00:00:29.220> of

you<00:00:31.199> take<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> piece<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:32.070> paper<00:00:32.540> that<00:00:33.620> printer

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
you take a piece of paper that printer

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.430 
you take a piece of paper that printer
paper<00:00:34.829> Xerox<00:00:35.640> paper<00:00:35.880> or<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.750> copy<00:00:36.960> machine

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
paper Xerox paper or the copy machine

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.880 
paper Xerox paper or the copy machine
paper<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.640> then<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.600> put<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> nanotubes<00:00:40.590> in

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
paper and then you put the nanotubes in

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.119 
paper and then you put the nanotubes in
that's<00:00:41.340> tricolor<00:00:42.270> ink<00:00:42.540> onto<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.469> paper<00:00:43.590> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
that's tricolor ink onto the paper you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.940 
that's tricolor ink onto the paper you
can<00:00:44.309> dip<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.989> print<00:00:46.739> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
can dip it in you can just print it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.750 
can dip it in you can just print it
paper<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.390> highly<00:00:48.899> porous<00:00:49.170> structure<00:00:49.920> so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
paper is a highly porous structure so

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.270 
paper is a highly porous structure so
once<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.239> their<00:00:51.420> paper<00:00:51.660> within<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:53.039> put

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
once you have their paper within you put

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.729 
once you have their paper within you put
it<00:00:53.399> into<00:00:53.550> an<00:00:53.730> oven<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.660> bake<00:00:54.690> off<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it into an oven we bake off all the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.029 
it into an oven we bake off all the
waters<00:00:56.239> then<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:58.039> conducting

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
waters then you have a really conducting

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.840 
waters then you have a really conducting
paper<00:01:00.050> going<00:01:01.050> from<00:01:01.430> initially<00:01:02.430> well

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850

we gain is we can reduce the dead weight

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
we gain is we can reduce the dead weight
of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.350> batteries<00:01:56.130> because<00:01:56.549> paper<00:01:56.789> is<00:01:57.000> life

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
of the batteries because paper is life

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.959 
of the batteries because paper is life
so<00:01:57.869> paper<00:01:58.140> batteries<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.979> change<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.670> energy

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
so paper batteries can change the energy

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:07.930 
so paper batteries can change the energy
in<00:02:00.450> landscape
