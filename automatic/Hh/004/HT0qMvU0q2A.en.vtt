you can't really tell can't really make
a<00:02:09.500> judgment<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:10.130> because<00:02:10.399> make<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:10.970> judgment

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
a judgment just because make a judgment

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
consistent on how you play so I don't I

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.220 
consistent on how you play so I don't I
don't<00:02:17.060> want<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.420> say<00:02:17.570> that<00:02:17.840> it's<00:02:17.990> we're

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
don't want to say that it's we're

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.440 
don't want to say that it's we're
completely<00:02:18.560> different<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:19.250> he<00:02:19.430> he<00:02:20.060> runs<00:02:20.300> the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
completely different but he he runs the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.160 
completely different but he he runs the
team<00:02:20.660> he's<00:02:21.410> he's<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.100> true<00:02:22.370> point<00:02:22.520> guard<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
team he's he's a true point guard the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.900 
team he's he's a true point guard the
difference<00:02:24.470> between<00:02:24.590> playing<00:02:25.190> point<00:02:25.760> guard

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
difference between playing point guard

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.190 
difference between playing point guard
and<00:02:26.240> being<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.870> point<00:02:27.170> where<00:02:27.290> yes<00:02:27.830> there's

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
and being a point where yes there's

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.830 
and being a point where yes there's
there's<00:02:30.200> huge<00:02:30.470> difference<00:02:30.860> um<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:32.390> mean<00:02:32.660> like

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
there's huge difference um I mean like

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.690 
there's huge difference um I mean like
if<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.020> look<00:02:33.170> at<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.290> NBA<00:02:33.590> Steph<00:02:34.190> Curry<00:02:34.400> plays

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
if you look at the NBA Steph Curry plays

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.420 
if you look at the NBA Steph Curry plays
point<00:02:34.940> guard<00:02:35.030> or<00:02:35.930> he<00:02:36.170> is<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.650> point<00:02:37.130> guard<00:02:37.220> he

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
point guard or he is a point guard he

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.259 
point guard or he is a point guard he
doesn't<00:02:37.820> it's<00:02:38.540> not<00:02:38.780> who<00:02:39.140> he<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.320> he's<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.650> guard

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
doesn't it's not who he is he's to guard

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.210 
doesn't it's not who he is he's to guard
but<00:02:41.269> he's<00:02:41.570> forced<00:02:42.470> into<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.769> role<00:02:42.920> if<00:02:43.070> you're

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
but he's forced into that role if you're

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.440 
but he's forced into that role if you're
forced<00:02:43.489> into<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.730> role<00:02:43.760> you're<00:02:44.180> less<00:02:44.420> likely

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
forced into the role you're less likely

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.220 
forced into the role you're less likely

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
about bossing people around even though

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.740

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
he takes control of practices he takes

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.470 
he takes control of practices he takes
control<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.420> our<00:02:54.990> scrimmages<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.470> he<00:02:56.480> just

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
control of our scrimmages and he just

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.940 
control of our scrimmages and he just
all-around<00:02:57.750> point<00:02:58.320> guard<00:02:58.470> what<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:58.830> would

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
all-around point guard what you would

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.070 
all-around point guard what you would
expect<00:02:59.160> regain<00:02:59.640> no<00:02:59.820> matter<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.630> blue-white

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
expect regain no matter the blue-white

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.260 
expect regain no matter the blue-white
game<00:03:01.110> or<00:03:01.500> anything<00:03:01.860> so<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.340> don't<00:03:03.090> think

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
game or anything so I don't think

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.700 
game or anything so I don't think
honestly<00:03:03.840> personally<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.410> don't<00:03:04.470> think

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
honestly personally I don't think

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.930 
honestly personally I don't think
there's<00:03:04.890> much<00:03:05.070> difference<00:03:05.280> between<00:03:05.790> those

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
there's much difference between those

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.000 
there's much difference between those
two<00:03:06.120> obviously<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.900> mean<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.560> means<00:03:07.830> more

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
two obviously I mean it just means more

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.440 
two obviously I mean it just means more
because<00:03:08.400> it's<00:03:08.730> going<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.970> go<00:03:09.090> on<00:03:09.180> our<00:03:09.209> record

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
because it's going to go on our record

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.980 
because it's going to go on our record
but<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:11.100> crowds<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.520> same<00:03:11.990> we're

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
but the crowds the same we're

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.570 
but the crowds the same we're
approaching<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.800> same<00:03:13.980> way<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.220> there's

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
approaching it the same way so there's

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.890 
approaching it the same way so there's
not<00:03:14.670> much<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.970> difference<00:03:15.270> Cal<00:03:15.750> doesn't

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
not much of a difference Cal doesn't

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.990 
not much of a difference Cal doesn't
approach<00:03:16.170> any<00:03:16.380> differently<00:03:16.650> dozer<00:03:16.890> no<00:03:17.490> cows

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
do you approach this any different with

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.650

the<00:03:41.700> be<00:03:41.850> in<00:03:41.910> three<00:03:42.150> games<00:03:42.300> in<00:03:42.570> five<00:03:42.750> days<00:03:44.660> not

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
the be in three games in five days not

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.510 
the be in three games in five days not
not<00:03:45.989> really<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:46.440> mean<00:03:46.560> obviously<00:03:47.010> we're

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
not really I mean obviously we're

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.250 
not really I mean obviously we're
probably<00:03:47.700> not<00:03:47.850> going<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.060> have<00:03:48.239> as<00:03:48.510> long<00:03:49.080> as

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
probably not going to have as long as

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.290 
probably not going to have as long as
practice<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.070> in<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.400> miss<00:03:50.850> next<00:03:51.120> five-day

practice is in this miss next five-day
stretch<00:03:51.510> but<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.260> mean<00:03:52.890> coach<00:03:53.310> Cal's<00:03:53.550> were

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
stretch but I mean coach Cal's were

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.610 
stretch but I mean coach Cal's were
really<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.239> us<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.480> we<00:03:54.540> have<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.810> be<00:03:55.080> one

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
really in on us that we have to be one

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.100

enough what's lacking let's do it um I

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.909 
enough what's lacking let's do it um I
think<00:05:35.720> I<00:05:36.080> think<00:05:36.290> we're<00:05:36.380> definitely<00:05:36.560> a<00:05:36.740> really

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
think I think we're definitely a really

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.000 
think I think we're definitely a really
tough<00:05:37.100> team<00:05:38.110> really<00:05:39.110> competitive<00:05:39.440> team<00:05:39.860> I

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
tough team really competitive team I

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.860 
tough team really competitive team I
think<00:05:40.040> that's<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.370> biggest<00:05:40.550> thing<00:05:40.810> about<00:05:41.810> us

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
think that's the biggest thing about us

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.450 
think that's the biggest thing about us
is<00:05:42.050> that<00:05:42.229> we<00:05:42.410> all<00:05:42.650> just<00:05:42.800> want<00:05:42.979> to<00:05:43.040> win<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.340> my

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
is that we all just want to win to my

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.030 
is that we all just want to win to my
what<00:05:43.700> we<00:05:43.850> might<00:05:44.030> be<00:05:44.870> wrong<00:05:45.110> Coast<00:05:45.620> Guard<00:05:45.890> says

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
what we might be wrong Coast Guard says

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.650 
what we might be wrong Coast Guard says
we<00:05:46.340> might<00:05:46.460> be<00:05:46.610> wrong<00:05:46.790> seventy<00:05:47.210> percent<00:05:47.330> of<00:05:47.570> the

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
we might be wrong seventy percent of the

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.320 
we might be wrong seventy percent of the
time<00:05:47.810> as<00:05:47.990> far<00:05:48.200> as<00:05:48.320> X's<00:05:48.860> and<00:05:48.890> O's<00:05:49.040> goes<00:05:49.310> but<00:05:49.610> at

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
time as far as X's and O's goes but at

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.760 
time as far as X's and O's goes but at
the<00:05:50.419> same<00:05:50.600> time<00:05:50.780> we're<00:05:51.020> competitive<00:05:51.470> and<00:05:51.680> we

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
the same time we're competitive and we

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.040 
the same time we're competitive and we
want<00:05:51.950> to<00:05:52.010> win<00:05:52.190> and<00:05:52.400> I<00:05:52.820> think<00:05:53.540> that<00:05:53.660> might<00:05:53.840> make

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
want to win and I think that might make

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.380 
want to win and I think that might make
up<00:05:54.229> for<00:05:54.530> some<00:05:55.310> of<00:05:55.340> the<00:05:55.490> young<00:05:55.729> the<00:05:56.000> young<00:05:56.030> guys

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
up for some of the young the young guys

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.700 
up for some of the young the young guys
and<00:05:56.419> the<00:05:56.630> freshmen<00:05:57.050> and<00:05:57.169> not<00:05:57.320> really<00:05:57.470> known

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
and the freshmen and not really known

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.170 
and the freshmen and not really known
where<00:05:57.919> we're<00:05:58.010> supposed<00:05:58.190> to<00:05:58.220> be<00:05:58.370> at<00:05:58.400> time<00:05:58.669> so<00:05:58.970> I

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
where we're supposed to be at time so I

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.550 
where we're supposed to be at time so I
think<00:05:59.419> that's<00:05:59.690> the<00:05:59.720> biggest<00:05:59.900> thing<00:06:00.169> or

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
think that's the biggest thing or

started<00:06:36.270> to<00:06:36.330> be<00:06:36.419> a<00:06:36.449> battle<00:06:36.719> so<00:06:37.020> I<00:06:37.229> think<00:06:37.710> I

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
started to be a battle so I think I

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.050 
started to be a battle so I think I
think<00:06:38.310> we<00:06:38.400> definitely<00:06:38.490> have<00:06:38.819> a<00:06:38.849> lot<00:06:39.000> of

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
think we definitely have a lot of

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.550 
think we definitely have a lot of
leaders<00:06:39.360> on<00:06:39.479> our<00:06:39.569> team<00:06:39.750> and<00:06:39.930> and<00:06:40.110> people<00:06:40.379> that

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
leaders on our team and and people that

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.490 
leaders on our team and and people that
are<00:06:40.680> willing<00:06:40.800> to<00:06:41.069> go<00:06:41.639> the<00:06:41.699> extra<00:06:41.789> mile<00:06:42.500> 19

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
are willing to go the extra mile 19

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.260 
are willing to go the extra mile 19
points<00:06:43.830> last<00:06:43.979> rooms<00:06:44.219> you<00:06:44.340> all<00:06:44.490> need<00:06:44.639> each

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
points last rooms you all need each

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.119 
points last rooms you all need each
other<00:06:45.479> more<00:06:45.689> when<00:06:46.020> you're<00:06:46.169> out<00:06:46.229> how<00:06:46.800> is<00:06:46.949> this

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:47.129 
other more when you're out how is this

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.640 
other more when you're out how is this
group<00:06:47.430> and<00:06:47.610> don't<00:06:47.819> do<00:06:47.909> that<00:06:48.120> so<00:06:48.479> I<00:06:49.050> think<00:06:49.469> it's

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
group and don't do that so I think it's

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.550 
group and don't do that so I think it's
been<00:06:49.830> a<00:06:49.860> lot<00:06:50.039> better<00:06:50.120> and<00:06:51.379> honestly<00:06:52.379> without

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
been a lot better and honestly without

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.080 
been a lot better and honestly without
even<00:06:52.949> the<00:06:52.979> coach<00:06:53.189> is<00:06:53.219> really<00:06:53.580> having<00:06:53.849> to<00:06:53.969> get

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
even the coach is really having to get

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.149 
even the coach is really having to get
on<00:06:54.180> us<00:06:54.360> I<00:06:54.479> think<00:06:54.509> that's<00:06:55.469> just<00:06:55.650> kind<00:06:55.830> of<00:06:55.889> part

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:56.159 
on us I think that's just kind of part

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:57.920 
on us I think that's just kind of part
of<00:06:56.250> our<00:06:56.370> mindset<00:06:56.789> is<00:06:57.060> to<00:06:57.270> always<00:06:57.360> be<00:06:57.599> talking

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
of our mindset is to always be talking

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.409 
of our mindset is to always be talking
to<00:06:58.050> each<00:06:58.139> other<00:06:58.289> I<00:06:58.939> think<00:06:59.939> that<00:06:59.969> helps<00:07:00.270> us<00:07:00.389> a

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
to each other I think that helps us a

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.269 
to each other I think that helps us a
lot<00:07:00.539> because<00:07:00.810> we<00:07:00.990> know<00:07:01.259> we<00:07:01.860> know<00:07:01.949> it's<00:07:02.099> behind

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:02.279 
lot because we know we know it's behind

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:03.559 
lot because we know we know it's behind
us<00:07:02.460> if<00:07:02.610> we're<00:07:02.759> guarding<00:07:02.999> the<00:07:03.060> ball<00:07:03.210> and<00:07:03.389> things

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569 
us if we're guarding the ball and things

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:05.600 
us if we're guarding the ball and things
like<00:07:03.749> that<00:07:03.810> so<00:07:03.990> we<00:07:04.860> know<00:07:04.949> if<00:07:05.189> we<00:07:05.310> got<00:07:05.490> each

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
like that so we know if we got each

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.159 
like that so we know if we got each
other's<00:07:05.849> backs<00:07:06.089> and<00:07:06.300> talking<00:07:06.930> is<00:07:06.990> really

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:07.169 
other's backs and talking is really

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:11.659 
other's backs and talking is really
gonna<00:07:07.259> help<00:07:07.409> they're<00:07:10.430> just<00:07:11.430> sort<00:07:11.610> of

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669 
gonna help they're just sort of

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:15.110 
gonna help they're just sort of
physically<00:07:12.120> impose<00:07:12.990> himself

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 
physically impose himself

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.050 
physically impose himself
that<00:07:16.120> big<00:07:16.360> yeah<00:07:17.170> i<00:07:17.200> mean<00:07:17.440> he's<00:07:17.700> way<00:07:18.700> stronger

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
that big yeah i mean he's way stronger

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.880 
that big yeah i mean he's way stronger
than<00:07:19.240> I<00:07:19.480> would<00:07:19.630> die<00:07:19.780> for<00:07:19.810> being<00:07:20.380> a<00:07:20.440> freshman

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:20.890 
than I would die for being a freshman

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.180 
than I would die for being a freshman
he's<00:07:21.070> really<00:07:21.640> strong<00:07:22.140> obviously<00:07:23.140> he's<00:07:23.290> 65<00:07:24.010> or

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
he's really strong obviously he's 65 or

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.940 
he's really strong obviously he's 65 or
66<00:07:24.610> so<00:07:24.880> he's<00:07:25.630> probably<00:07:26.230> gonna<00:07:26.380> be<00:07:26.620> bigger<00:07:26.860> than

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:26.950 
66 so he's probably gonna be bigger than

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.380 
66 so he's probably gonna be bigger than
the<00:07:27.250> guy<00:07:27.370> he's<00:07:27.520> going<00:07:27.730> against<00:07:27.940> every<00:07:28.210> game

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.390 
the guy he's going against every game

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.390 
the guy he's going against every game
this<00:07:28.540> year<00:07:28.600> so<00:07:29.050> he<00:07:29.800> can<00:07:29.830> definitely<00:07:30.310> be

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 
this year so he can definitely be

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.190 
this year so he can definitely be
imposing<00:07:30.910> on<00:07:31.030> another<00:07:31.240> player<00:07:31.510> and<00:07:31.750> I<00:07:31.810> think<00:07:32.050> I

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:32.200 
imposing on another player and I think I

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.810 
imposing on another player and I think I
think<00:07:32.530> that's<00:07:32.650> one<00:07:32.830> of<00:07:32.860> his<00:07:33.070> as<00:07:33.340> big<00:07:33.700> as

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:33.820 
think that's one of his as big as

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.410 
think that's one of his as big as
attributes<00:07:34.270> just<00:07:34.630> his<00:07:34.870> size<00:07:35.110> and<00:07:35.350> strength
