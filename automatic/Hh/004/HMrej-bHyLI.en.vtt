00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
perversion liner and we smudge that up

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.570 
perversion liner and we smudge that up
with<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.779> smudge<00:00:28.230> brush<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.099> little<00:00:29.369> bit<00:00:29.490> of

we are now but we're going to continue
to<00:00:38.309> build<00:00:38.489> upon<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.270> make<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.570> little

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
to build upon this to make it a little

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.869 
to build upon this to make it a little
more<00:00:39.840> hardcore<00:00:40.410> I'm<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> start<00:00:41.610> by

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
more hardcore I'm going to start by

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.060 
more hardcore I'm going to start by
using<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.600> little<00:00:42.840> bit<00:00:42.989> more<00:00:43.140> liner<00:00:43.410> so

using a little bit more liner so
starting<00:00:44.460> at<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> lash<00:00:45.329> line<00:00:45.360> again<00:00:45.960> I'm

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
starting at the lash line again I'm

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.260 
starting at the lash line again I'm
actually<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> bring<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> wing<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:47.969> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
actually going to bring the wing out a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.990 
actually going to bring the wing out a
little<00:00:48.539> bit<00:00:48.750> more<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.730> because<00:00:50.730> we're<00:00:50.910> going

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
little bit more here because we're going

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.350 
little bit more here because we're going
to<00:00:51.090> make<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:51.570> more<00:00:51.840> intense<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:53.360> don't

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
to make it little more intense and don't

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930 
to make it little more intense and don't
be<00:00:54.570> afraid<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.440> kind<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.860> get<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.670> there

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
be afraid to just kind of get in there

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.209 
be afraid to just kind of get in there
and<00:00:57.180> fill<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.320> we're<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> make<00:00:59.100> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
and fill it in we're going to make it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.860 
and fill it in we're going to make it
nice<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.430> dark<00:01:00.140> don't<00:01:01.140> worry<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:03.449> line<00:01:03.690> is

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
nice and dark don't worry if the line is

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.140 
nice and dark don't worry if the line is
not<00:01:03.899> perfect<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.369> we're<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
not perfect because we're just going to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.750 
not perfect because we're just going to
be<00:01:06.299> blending<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.869> smudging<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.369> now<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.549> we

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
be blending and smudging so now that we

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.300 
be blending and smudging so now that we
have<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.060> intensity<00:01:09.810> starting<00:01:10.770> at<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> lash

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
have the intensity starting at the lash

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
have the intensity starting at the lash
we're<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> blend<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.140> it's

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
we're going to blend it up so it's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.230 
we're going to blend it up so it's
fading<00:01:13.950> more<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.369> don't<00:01:14.549> want<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.000> just

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
fading more we don't want it to just

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.830 
fading more we don't want it to just
look<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.900> chunk<00:01:17.299> I'm<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> take<00:01:18.659> the

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
to make sure that the upper shadow is

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.710 
to make sure that the upper shadow is
connected<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.070> bottom<00:04:47.370> shadow<00:04:47.640> so<00:04:48.180> I'm

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
connected to the bottom shadow so I'm

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.060 
connected to the bottom shadow so I'm
doing<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:49.050> little<00:04:49.230> work<00:04:49.380> in<00:04:49.560> this<00:04:49.710> corner<00:04:50.040> over

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
doing a little work in this corner over

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:57.380 
doing a little work in this corner over
here<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.880> last<00:04:54.240> step<00:04:54.510> for<00:04:55.200> this<00:04:55.590> i<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:56.400> to

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
here and the last step for this i is to

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.680 
here and the last step for this i is to
use<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:58.080> black<00:04:58.410> liner<00:04:58.800> on<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.160> inside<00:04:59.570> so<00:05:00.570> i'm

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
use the black liner on the inside so i'm

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.780 
use the black liner on the inside so i'm
going<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.840> do<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.110> inner<00:05:01.260> rim<00:05:01.500> now<00:05:01.710> I'm<00:05:02.250> just

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
going to do the inner rim now I'm just

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.190 
going to do the inner rim now I'm just
pulling<00:05:03.270> down<00:05:03.540> on<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:05.160> eyelid<00:05:05.580> a<00:05:05.610> little<00:05:05.940> bit

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
pulling down on the eyelid a little bit

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.650 
pulling down on the eyelid a little bit
just<00:05:07.200> going<00:05:07.500> ahead<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:07.980> lining<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.510> want

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
just going ahead and lining and you want

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.860 
just going ahead and lining and you want
to<00:05:09.750> make<00:05:09.870> sure<00:05:09.900> that<00:05:10.320> there's<00:05:10.590> no<00:05:11.419> light<00:05:12.419> space

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
to make sure that there's no light space

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.500 
to make sure that there's no light space
between<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:14.190> lash<00:05:14.400> line<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.000> where<00:05:15.360> your

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
lining so you can even take on the

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.610 
lining so you can even take on the
outside<00:05:17.730> when<00:05:18.030> you're<00:05:18.120> done<00:05:18.390> and<00:05:19.230> do<00:05:19.350> a<00:05:19.380> little

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
bit right here get a little bit on this
