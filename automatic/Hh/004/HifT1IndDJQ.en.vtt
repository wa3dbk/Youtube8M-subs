00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
I've seen so far it honestly just looks

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.670 
I've seen so far it honestly just looks
like<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:37.820> little<00:00:38.820> bit<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.450> better<00:00:39.690> version<00:00:40.290> of

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
like a little bit of a better version of

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.000 
like a little bit of a better version of
modern<00:00:41.129> warfare<00:00:41.280> 3<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> new<00:00:42.480> story<00:00:43.010> that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
modern warfare 3 with a new story that

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.799 
modern warfare 3 with a new story that
nobody<00:00:44.370> cares<00:00:44.579> about<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.480> play<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
nobody cares about because you play the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.110 
nobody cares about because you play the
story<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.230> call<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.500> duty<00:00:46.530> once<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.370> that's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
story of a call of duty once and that's

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.650 
story of a call of duty once and that's
it<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.750> bear<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.110> story<00:00:49.410> well<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.219> biology

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
it you bear the story well your biology

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.689 
it you bear the story well your biology
for<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> multiplier<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:52.890> zombies<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
for the multiplier or for zombies and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.209 
for the multiplier or for zombies and
the<00:00:54.300> multiplier<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.320> opinion<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.920> far

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the multiplier in my opinion so far

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.069 
the multiplier in my opinion so far
looks<00:00:56.850> absolutely<00:00:57.360> shit<00:00:59.629> don't<00:01:00.629> dislike<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
video because of that that's my opinion

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.200

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
ecology you can't do that let's process

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.219 
ecology you can't do that let's process
I<00:01:23.100> mean<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.549> first-person<00:01:24.330> fast<00:01:24.900> action

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
I mean it's a first-person fast action
