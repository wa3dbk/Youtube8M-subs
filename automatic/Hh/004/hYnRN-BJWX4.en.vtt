all the stuff you really need to know
some<00:01:00.059> some<00:01:00.420> small<00:01:00.659> illustrations<00:01:01.409> a<00:01:01.860> very

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
some some small illustrations a very

some some small illustrations a very
short<00:01:02.850> listing<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.359> rules<00:01:03.600> which<00:01:03.780> just

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
short listing of rules which just

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.490 
short listing of rules which just
essentially<00:01:04.489> move<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> tile<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.930> take<00:01:07.470> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
essentially move at a tile and take a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.910 
essentially move at a tile and take a
new<00:01:07.710> tile<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.690> not<00:01:09.899> to<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.320> when<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
new tile and what not to do when the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.380 
new tile and what not to do when the
things<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.399> are<00:01:11.580> allowed<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.149> so

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
things that you are allowed to do so

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
things that you are allowed to do so
essentially<00:01:12.899> there's<00:01:13.380> two<00:01:13.590> rules<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.100> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
essentially there's two rules that you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.520 
essentially there's two rules that you
certainly<00:01:14.460> can't<00:01:14.909> break<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.380> there's

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
certainly can't break and then there's

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.840 
certainly can't break and then there's
three<00:01:16.710> things<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.039> have<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.399> on<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.670> turn

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
three things you have to do on your turn

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.480 
three things you have to do on your turn
and<00:01:18.119> really<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.990> whole<00:01:19.170> game<00:01:19.490> why

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
and really that's the whole game why

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.800 
and really that's the whole game why
don't<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.700> take<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.880> look<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> pieces<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
don't we take a look at the pieces that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.359 
don't we take a look at the pieces that
I<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.080> describe<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.619> those<00:01:22.830> things<00:01:23.159> are

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
I can describe what those things are

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.300 
I can describe what those things are
shortly<00:01:23.909> after<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> other<00:01:25.890> thing<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.130> get

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
shortly after so the other thing you get

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.430 
shortly after so the other thing you get
in<00:01:26.429> the<00:01:26.490> game<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.940> these<00:01:27.479> player<00:01:27.780> pieces<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
in the game is these player pieces and

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.020 
in the game is these player pieces and
player<00:01:28.679> color<00:01:28.979> indicators<00:01:29.550> so<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.850> see

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
player color indicators so you can see

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.580 
player color indicators so you can see
here<00:01:30.179> these<00:01:30.270> four<00:01:30.600> round<00:01:30.840> markers<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.380> four

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
here these four round markers and four

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.080 
here these four round markers and four
different<00:01:31.860> colors<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.880> player

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
different colors are the player

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.630 
different colors are the player
indicators<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:33.929> then<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.619> each<00:01:34.950> player<00:01:35.340> gets

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
indicators and then you each player gets

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.120 
indicators and then you each player gets
ten<00:01:35.940> of<00:01:36.090> these<00:01:36.240> frog<00:01:36.800> tiles<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:37.920> these<00:01:38.009> are

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
ten of these frog tiles and these are

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.040 
ten of these frog tiles and these are
all<00:01:38.220> made<00:01:38.399> of<00:01:38.550> bakelite<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.539> they're<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:39.780> very

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
all made of bakelite so they're all very

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.370 
all made of bakelite so they're all very
sturdy<00:01:41.210> they're<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.539> very<00:01:42.899> tough<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
sturdy they're very very tough and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.630 
sturdy they're very very tough and
they're<00:01:43.500> gonna<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.740> usable<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.460> pretty<00:01:44.610> much

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
they're gonna be usable in pretty much

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700 
they're gonna be usable in pretty much
any<00:01:44.909> scenario<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> frogs<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
any scenario but the frogs are the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.200 
any scenario but the frogs are the
central<00:01:47.009> focus<00:01:47.429> and<00:01:47.520> you're<00:01:47.610> gonna<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.850> moving

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
central focus and you're gonna be moving

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.730 
central focus and you're gonna be moving
these<00:01:48.330> around<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:48.960> jumping<00:01:49.289> them<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.590> order

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
these around and jumping them in order

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.260 
these around and jumping them in order
to<00:01:49.830> create<00:01:50.039> a<00:01:50.190> group<00:01:50.429> of<00:01:50.580> at<00:01:50.670> least<00:01:50.850> seven

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
to create a group of at least seven

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.419 
to create a group of at least seven
placing<00:01:52.049> them<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.319> board<00:01:52.590> hopping<00:01:53.310> over

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
placing them on the board hopping over

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.609 
placing them on the board hopping over
other<00:01:53.700> players<00:01:53.909> things<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.959> your<00:01:55.229> attempt<00:01:55.530> to

White's turn white has a piece they may
move<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.420> moving<00:03:46.200> pieces<00:03:46.620> must<00:03:46.800> always<00:03:47.010> be

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
move and moving pieces must always be

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.130 
move and moving pieces must always be
done<00:03:47.400> in<00:03:47.520> a<00:03:47.550> straight<00:03:47.850> line<00:03:47.880> but<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.900> jump

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
done in a straight line but you can jump

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.540 
done in a straight line but you can jump
as<00:03:49.320> many<00:03:49.500> times<00:03:49.770> as<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:50.040> like<00:03:50.070> in<00:03:50.400> that

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
as many times as you like in that

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.930 
as many times as you like in that
straight<00:03:50.850> line<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.720> for<00:03:52.050> example<00:03:52.470> white<00:03:53.430> could

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
straight line so for example white could

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.610 
straight line so for example white could
move<00:03:54.120> their<00:03:54.330> piece<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.080> other<00:03:55.200> side<00:03:55.470> of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
move their piece to the other side of

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.020 
move their piece to the other side of

will continue on in this manner with
another<00:04:35.240> player<00:04:35.480> drawing<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.960> piece<00:04:36.170> and<00:04:36.590> now

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
another player drawing a piece and now

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.360 
another player drawing a piece and now
you<00:04:38.600> know<00:04:38.720> blue<00:04:39.140> would<00:04:39.440> place<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> green<00:04:40.040> piece

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
you know blue would place a green piece

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.700 
you know blue would place a green piece
over<00:04:40.730> here<00:04:40.880> but<00:04:41.540> first<00:04:41.810> they<00:04:42.050> must<00:04:42.080> move<00:04:42.500> one

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
over here but first they must move one

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.400 
over here but first they must move one
of<00:04:42.830> their<00:04:42.980> pieces<00:04:43.220> however<00:04:43.910> they<00:04:44.870> can't<00:04:45.170> move

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
of their pieces however they can't move

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.400 
of their pieces however they can't move
it<00:04:45.590> without<00:04:46.460> breaking<00:04:46.880> up<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.450> group<00:04:47.690> if<00:04:48.290> they

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
it without breaking up the group if they

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.770 
it without breaking up the group if they
move<00:04:48.800> it<00:04:48.950> this<00:04:49.220> direction<00:04:49.820> there's<00:04:50.510> now<00:04:50.720> two

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
move it this direction there's now two

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.390 
move it this direction there's now two
separate<00:04:51.350> groups<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.770> they<00:04:51.980> move<00:04:52.130> at<00:04:52.250> this

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
separate groups and they move at this

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.980 
separate groups and they move at this
direction<00:04:52.610> there's<00:04:53.210> now<00:04:53.390> two<00:04:53.450> separate

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
direction there's now two separate

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.990 
direction there's now two separate
groups<00:04:54.080> this<00:04:54.830> would<00:04:55.040> be<00:04:55.160> an<00:04:55.250> illegal<00:04:55.460> move<00:04:55.760> and

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
groups this would be an illegal move and

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.190 
groups this would be an illegal move and
they<00:04:56.090> wouldn't<00:04:56.360> be<00:04:56.420> allowed<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:56.720> move<00:04:56.990> their

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
they wouldn't be allowed to move their

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.560 
they wouldn't be allowed to move their
piece<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:58.460> other<00:04:58.640> type<00:04:59.000> of<00:04:59.030> move<00:04:59.300> that<00:04:59.480> is

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
piece the other type of move that is

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.110 
piece the other type of move that is
prohibited<00:05:00.110> is<00:05:00.230> to<00:05:01.190> have<00:05:01.370> three<00:05:01.790> stones

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
prohibited is to have three stones

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.360 
prohibited is to have three stones
connected<00:05:02.360> in<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.870> row<00:05:03.050> with<00:05:03.710> only<00:05:04.010> single

connected in a row with only single

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.910 
connected in a row with only single

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
links so for example here we have one

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.520 
links so for example here we have one
single<00:05:07.310> link<00:05:07.520> two<00:05:07.730> single<00:05:08.120> links<00:05:08.450> red<00:05:09.140> could

single link two single links red could
not<00:05:09.740> place<00:05:10.070> their<00:05:10.820> piece<00:05:11.060> here<00:05:11.510> because<00:05:11.660> that

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
not place their piece here because that

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.610 
not place their piece here because that
would<00:05:12.140> be<00:05:12.230> three<00:05:12.530> single<00:05:12.920> links<00:05:13.160> in<00:05:13.280> a<00:05:13.370> row<00:05:14.620> the

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
would be three single links in a row the

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
so are we frogs I gotta be honest I

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.930 
so are we frogs I gotta be honest I
don't<00:05:40.420> like<00:05:40.780> it<00:05:40.930> as<00:05:41.020> much<00:05:41.200> as<00:05:41.320> hive<00:05:41.530> I<00:05:41.940> haven't

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
played it as much as high but that's

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.890 
played it as much as high but that's
because<00:05:44.530> I<00:05:44.680> don't<00:05:44.950> like<00:05:45.070> it<00:05:45.250> as<00:05:45.310> much<00:05:45.370> as<00:05:45.640> hive

the<00:05:46.900> game<00:05:47.080> isn't<00:05:47.410> bad<00:05:47.530> it<00:05:47.740> does<00:05:47.890> allow<00:05:48.100> you

different types of movement and well
it's<00:06:00.580> nice<00:06:00.730> that<00:06:00.760> you<00:06:01.090> can<00:06:01.120> try<00:06:01.420> and<00:06:01.510> create

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
it's nice that you can try and create

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.450 
it's nice that you can try and create
combinations<00:06:02.350> of<00:06:02.500> jumping<00:06:02.830> over<00:06:02.950> one<00:06:03.250> than

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
jumping back and around the whole the

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.860 
jumping back and around the whole the
whole<00:06:05.650> group<00:06:05.980> of<00:06:06.130> frogs<00:06:06.310> um<00:06:06.700> I<00:06:07.390> don't<00:06:07.600> think

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
whole group of frogs um I don't think

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.990 
whole group of frogs um I don't think
it's<00:06:08.290> just<00:06:08.590> as<00:06:08.740> well<00:06:08.920> designed<00:06:09.460> as<00:06:09.730> high<00:06:09.940> this

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
it's just as well designed as high this

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.880 
it's just as well designed as high this
now<00:06:10.720> that's<00:06:10.930> not<00:06:11.080> saying<00:06:11.320> this<00:06:11.410> isn't<00:06:11.590> a<00:06:11.710> good

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
now that's not saying this isn't a good

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.890 
now that's not saying this isn't a good
game<00:06:12.070> it<00:06:12.310> is<00:06:12.550> interesting<00:06:13.150> and<00:06:13.210> it<00:06:13.420> will<00:06:13.750> be

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
game it is interesting and it will be

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.080 
game it is interesting and it will be
good<00:06:14.050> for<00:06:14.110> four<00:06:14.920> more<00:06:15.040> players<00:06:15.310> if<00:06:15.580> you<00:06:15.970> have

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
good for four more players if you have

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.670 
good for four more players if you have
more<00:06:16.300> than<00:06:16.450> two<00:06:16.660> obviously<00:06:17.290> it's<00:06:17.500> a<00:06:17.530> better

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
more than two obviously it's a better

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.160 
more than two obviously it's a better

fan I think you'll enjoy it it's simple
enough<00:06:22.450> to<00:06:22.720> learn<00:06:22.870> but<00:06:23.200> strategic<00:06:23.740> enough

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
enough to learn but strategic enough

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.260 
enough to learn but strategic enough
that<00:06:24.160> there's<00:06:24.340> there's<00:06:24.640> definitely<00:06:25.120> some

that there's there's definitely some

that there's there's definitely some

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
depth to it and it's not really too bad
