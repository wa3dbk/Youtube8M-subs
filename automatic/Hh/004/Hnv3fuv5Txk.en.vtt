00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.059
 hello everyone and everyone welcome one day 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.580
 more to the channel I'm super happy 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:20.080
 come back from being here again and from being able to 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.440
 be back here at the time of the 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.440
 absence 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.860
 It has been three weeks I could not climb 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.009
 videos I know there are always times of 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.870
 stop in my character and times that 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.210
 psychically we are equal in about 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.030
 moments that in others then either 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.449
 I want to roll up a lot and explain to you that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.449
 it happened to me 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.730
 I will explain a little the reason for 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.190
 the absence 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.900
 I had some eye problems since May 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.489
 in fact on May 13 that was party 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.329
 here in valladolid I started with a 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.329
 problem of the eyes 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.950
 but it is also that we do not explain that 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.620
 permance was the extreme dryness in the 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.260
 super red eyes with come to work 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.050
 then he had 2000 because he could not stand 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.990
 the eyes or imagine the paper 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.330
 we have everything this month because it has been 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.609
 one month the one that it takes to recover the 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.820
 think at first that it was an allergy 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:26.000
 and was with a knuckle with allergy not 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.100
 it happened to me I was with the gel that I 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.409
 when I stopped by sight by land 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.079
 dehydration and it did not happen to me and 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.909
 thank god I got a product that 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.459
 I do not know if chance has caused 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.439
 I missed the eyes or that 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.740
 product has helped me I will teach you 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.740
 which 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.400
 because now he goes with me as if he were 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.970
 Well, that has been the gain 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.520
 product 3 is called pharmacy and is 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.020
 a spray that is applied to the eye in the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.020
 eyelid above the eyelid 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.510
 It is applied directly on top of 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.700
 eyelids contains Vitamin D vitamin 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.350
 and admit that what my eye needed 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.140
 a co- worker of the vitamin 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.350
 vitamin that should be the best vitamin 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.080
 for the mucous membranes I bought it a little 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.730
 skeptical and saying impossible to me 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.430
 happens in the eyes of going to the doctor and 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.770
 because this is impossible and it was to start 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.360
 use and the discomfort disappeared if 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.230
 someday you bother to use flight 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:36.070
 it is a product that is not cheap it contains 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.570
 of 100 thousand 10 milliliters and costs 13 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.040
 euros for me is not a cheap product 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.040
 because it's also true that I bought 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.480
 an eye drop for such another for which and me 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.940
 annoy let's go we were being 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.020
 money and I could not find the solution to the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.990
 ocular dryness 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.730
 it was not the reason for my video explained 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.770
 It is this but also wanted good 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.970
 Did you know why it was not because 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:02.860
 I've uploaded videos so often I've had 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.060
 a month of extreme fatigue you know that 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.100
 for those who do not know what I 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.200
 I dedicate myself but I was a beautician 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.810
 makeup artist I dedicate a little bit to the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.340
 world of beauty then they take the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.690
 work where I am right now maquillo 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.670
 hairstyle facials 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.090
 body treatments is a bit 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.370
 general and I work a lot very much 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.430
 we are little staff you know that now 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.150
 with cuts cut staff and 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.120
 work for two or three people is a 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.610
 work that is physically exhausting me 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.440
 and especially psychologically 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.690
 I know the time to leave because I have 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.940
 work people tell me do not complain 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.250
 you have work but my exhaustion 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.340
 you can see the voice I do not recover from a 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.240
 day for another because the seven hours and 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.590
 peak about eight that work are 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.200
 intense are intense like all 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.970
 days at work I do not eat well 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.070
 well I will not complain much more I have 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.570
 work that is earned and is already 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.310
 this is a video I wanted to make for 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.050
 explain a little about my absence on 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.720
 reason for my absence they did not want to rearm 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.760
 a lot but I also wanted you to know 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.340
 I'm grateful to all those people 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.620
 who cares about where I am and what is 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.780
 what happens to me because I do not upload video is 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.570
 so continuous but come on, this is going to 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.350
 change I've proposed that it's not going to 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.880
 can with me a job is not going to be able to 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.590
 with me the stress that there are people saying 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.890
 that stress is all mental for me in 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.840
 this is a lot of physical work to think about 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.160
 my agenda the next day stresses me 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.830
 today for example between the one less 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.930
 room to work and have no or 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.960
 a gap or a gap or free space 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.020
 while overwhelming me is a person who gives 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.750
 many turns in my head and I feel overwhelmed 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.430
 much 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.230
 it's like that and it's that 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.300
 but this past weekend I went to 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.130
 the beach I went on Sunday and Saturday 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.990
 but I was on the beach on Sunday and 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.880
 disconnect a bit and the truth that has 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.190
 come very well to clarify a bit the 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:11.909
 head work I do not know until when 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:15.969
 It will last, I do not know , you know, it's very 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:18.099
 Fluctuating work fluctuates I do not know this 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:19.840
 it's also a point where the head 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.189
 it does not stop spinning because you're 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.310
 working but in the end you're not 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:27.159
 enjoying that money that you are 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.560
 charging for me is being a bit 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:32.470
 oppressive but good 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.940
 the case this month I've decided that I'm going 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.360
 to give an oscar bustillos because 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.820
 I needed that also because unemployment is 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.360
 very hard and in the beginning in the 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.550
 work are hard but stress also 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.040
 it's hard so I know life is hard 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.910
 that is the conclusion is that life in 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.190
 general is fruit 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.590
 another thing that I wanted to tell you is that 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.980
 I am a single star, good marine 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.720
 If you see me I greet you, Marina is one of 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.120
 my best friends who get married this year 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.500
 and good and we have everything finalized the 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.980
 hairstyle here I do not do much 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.930
 illusion and good we went to clear 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.240
 shelter today in Santander which is where 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.300
 we were a girl I stopped in a 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.030
 Pastry shop told me witness in the channel and 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.770
 I was like thank Iker and highlight 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:24.670
 to these people who stop me and me 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.670
 write I just saw you 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:31.930
 exciting because the conditions of 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.310
 world is desperate single 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.620
 of a very long trip 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.300
 because imagine different will be 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.969
 shame because the hotel has not passed 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.119
 to change my clothes but good 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:46.699
 I thank very much all these people that I 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:48.409
 go and stop me like that in a nutshell and 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:50.599
 another thing is that we are close to 15 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:52.519
 thousand subscribers and I have a surprise 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:55.879

 subscribers and 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.350
 and that I find applicants or does not seem 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.180
 flippant because there are times that I say is 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.220
 that I do not deserve it, I do not say 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:13.289
 people keep seeing when and times that 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.270
