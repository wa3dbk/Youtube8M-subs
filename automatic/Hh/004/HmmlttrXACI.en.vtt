00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 and hello to all friends with you works in this 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.350
 video clip I showed the winding so 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.559
 adds an infection to the minecraft like you 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:15.289
 see here is an infection I walked along 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.590
 world and met here is such an interesting 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:22.220
 interesting such a book and here I came 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.210
 to rice see what it is 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.400
 deimos turned on 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.910
 games and went to watch a little bit like this 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.079
 I was superimposed on that varnish soup 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.239
 dried up slowness fatigue and 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.040
 the slowness of fatigue remained then 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.760
 I have such manila 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.010
 I dig barely that his affairs are so barely 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.780
 to make it all go enough 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.110
 fast log or all effects that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.960
 we have been imposed we will pass here 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.090
 This is the add-on of people 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.859
 industrial craft you don't watch it 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.430
 just for this you need a mod 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.519
 industrial craft 2 nostril it adds 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.049
 here are such a fruit so here is this block 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.780
 As you can see 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.150
 the infection spreads very fast here 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.520
 This unit is here this block but this 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.939
 an infection like this I will put it and he 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.299
 starts here infected right away he 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.049
 infected this block is found pretty 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.540
 rarely and we will dig down my 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:34.920
 sometimes in the third of it falls here 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:36.840
 Well this here is the orange plague here from 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.930
 here these blocks fall out 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.710
 green from here these are orange green 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.540
 viruses are common and mutated viruses 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.230
 a virus that does not damage us and 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.290
 this block 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.120
 to create this block 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.060
 the usual block of it can be made well 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.110
 as if the stove and it can be made the stove 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.060
 so I will choose 5 and let us 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.479
 from here these viruses can be made 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.610
 here are these two test tubes these tubes test 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.340
 crafting from this one 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.930
 1 this is a test tube plus viruses get 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.690
 Here, for example, is punching 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.410
 Here is such a craft and as this tube 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.090
 This tube itself can be crafted 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.620
 from six glasses and well and one bubble and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.600
 get and that's when we got two 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.280
 test tubes we definitely need here such 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:37.330
 Here is such a garbage to and where are these 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.350
 lead this virus here it is crafting 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:45.730
 of four of these, we take 4 articles and 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:49.360
 Basik block match rather than grafica 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.239
 still from iron plates and lazurite 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.610
 the plates are also crafted from the plate 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.110
 so that's the way iron sorry 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.019
 the plates are crafted like this 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:08.470
 way then there is a router here 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.519
 flash from rotten flesh and we get here 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.130
 this one is a block 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:17.730
 then croteam is such a wild one 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.200
 was here in the menu and with us and we can 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.220
 Detail this one here's a virus 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.750
 which spreads very fast and 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:31.120
 spreads really very very very 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:34.870
 quickly so to craft this one 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.650
 we need industrial garbage 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.760
 craft 2 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.890
 the link to these two years will be in the description 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.190
 where the bag is draped over in this one 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.569
 block will immediately have two 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.930
 install two mods at once 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.720
 so let's see how this figure 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.209
 acts we right-click 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.540
 and we make you like this 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.579
 the number of blocks here we are 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.900
 all these viral blocks are destroyed 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:07.239
 as you can see down, too, and started a business here 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.829
 we will destroy all the blocks quickly 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:14.410
 there is not so much and it was but 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.359
 this virus does not work when we move away 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.600
 at a sufficient distance but if not 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.579
 chunks will continue then the virus is not 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.199
 will act as you see here 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.570
 such blocks are quite rare 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.510
 let's see when we cut them down and what 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:34.560
 we will fall out 1 they will be afraid 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.560
 hard enough now we cut it down 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.460
 here we cut down we fall 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.740
 surely that's such a garbage as well 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.650
 here you can craft some stove 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.349
 I 'll show you how to craft the stove 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:56.259
 such a film is worth we kill take here 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:05:00.849
 this block is in this block and here is this spirit so 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:03.789
 bricks and here it was so let's 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:07.870
 we will sift on the first and we craft 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:12.039
 such a stove as usual stove 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.440
 at the Pan I krashnulsya lanes kraft here I 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.319
 entered the beautiful world itself is not easy 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.289
 so did not understand why but with this stove 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:23.009
 need to be careful I already understood 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.990
 give the animals we build and everything 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.740
 put this one here is the middle of the stove here 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.650
 we set 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.479
 so I do not need this middle of the stove 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.199
 this one here is the middle of the nickname we 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.990
 put and the stove is then we open 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.710
 the stove when we put a little here 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.539
 the stove is usually pawns to which can 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.169
 anything yes mine for example ore here 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:49.449
 but we put coal here in the ore and sheâ€™s all 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.180
 but little by little the program produces 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:54.460
 does not require energy but still elk aut 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.270
 its quite difficult here 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.219
 bricks and rotten flesh and also from here 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:05.680
 These are the stones that are made with rotten 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:08.080
 the flesh and the stove here still need so 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:14.469
 let's see what else is there 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:16.690
 there is a bullshit here that does well 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.259
 doing here like viruses doing here 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.690
 viruses 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.870
 here we put here you need to stick 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.449
 a bunch of rotten flesh 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:30.039
 somewhere around 100 kav60 to work out 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:32.110
 and to have a chance of making a virus then 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:36.129
 there is a virus added is extracted still here 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:40.169
 This garbage so wait and until here 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:40.169
 need for power shove coal 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.660
 dubai we shove coal 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:54.860
 something didnâ€™t work 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:58.850
 which we did probably this here 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:04.250
 need to do a virus here we are 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:10.940
 remove here we quickly begin 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:14.080
 such a processing of the virus and I realized that 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.950
 it is it makes rotten flesh 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:21.800
 changed my flesh and she makes steaks 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:24.380
 interesting enough this is probably 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.320
 makes and take off the dress can make 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.190
 test tube with a virus but probably I 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.650
 just now 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.530
 mod a little lag and it just doesn't 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:37.550
 do and that's interesting enough 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:40.760
 kill zombies and you get for example 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.350
 steak and zombies you get this movie 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.230
 how to part like this 

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.900
 but it is quite expensive so 

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.580
 you can stand and kill yourself or 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.100
 cows on if the box can do this 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:55.190
 in this way if resources 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:58.520
 many well that's all with you was the mole to everyone 

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.640
 thanks for watching everyone bye bye 

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.640
 until
