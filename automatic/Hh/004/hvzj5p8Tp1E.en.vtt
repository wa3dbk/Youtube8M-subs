but<00:02:07.990> also<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.410> think<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.770> noise<00:02:09.009> might

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
but also I think the noise might

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.190 
but also I think the noise might
actually<00:02:09.520> get<00:02:09.790> a<00:02:09.820> little<00:02:10.119> bit<00:02:10.300> annoying<00:02:10.540> so<00:02:10.899> I

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
actually get a little bit annoying so I

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.810 
actually get a little bit annoying so I
might<00:02:11.620> just<00:02:11.830> shut<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.010> off<00:02:12.160> for<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.460> battle

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
might just shut it off for this battle

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.460 
might just shut it off for this battle
