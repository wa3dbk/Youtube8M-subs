00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.370
 a delegation of engineers from 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.109
 china-taiwan that is in our 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.480

 be the designers of the big project 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.619
 for the next months a team of 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.660
 china-taiwan engineers is located

 in our country to know details of 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.490
 the conditions of the terrain where 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.320

 of baseball and we will check the status 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.519
 of the soil like here is seismic tape 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.440
 we are also going to study this time 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.210
 it's about a team of engineers whose 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.239
 work has been recognized at the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.890
 world his works go from buildings of 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.960
 public institutions up 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.909
 sports facilities in several 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.540
 countries of the world many projects 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.979
 even developed in Latin America 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.409
 now in nicaragua by management of the 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.570

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.590
 corresponding and start the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.170
 construction of the new national stadium 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.619
 we are going to design a stadium that can 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.960
 fit 20,000 people if 20 thousand people 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.630
 and the designer team on behalf of 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.789
 we have a lot of experience in this 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.950
 type of large stadiums the current 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.069
 national stadium denis martÃ­nez dates from 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.960
 the 50s of the last century built 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.899
 on one of the biggest seismic faults 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.090
 Managua experts have recommended no 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.900
 exceed their capacity as their 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.180
 facilities 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.770
 they are in terrible condition many 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.230
 new things that come for this year 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.550
 beginning this year starting with the 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.350
 stadium is a great investment as of 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.360
 previously and a great management of 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.830
 government that would be good that after 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.350
 when finished is that two years that 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.930
 the public can do it I think it goes 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.790
 to do something that people are going to start 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.369
 to come and see the stadium because it's going to 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.290
 have something new going to be lifted more 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.940
 bad people the fans here nicaragua 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.340
 the government has done some good 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.930
 negotiations when Taiwanese and expected 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.910
 that rebuilt the new stadium 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.610

 a capacity of 20 thousand people work 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.280
 estimated at about 35 million dollars 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.890
 and whose construction would begin in mid 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.290
 of the year as explained by the engineers
