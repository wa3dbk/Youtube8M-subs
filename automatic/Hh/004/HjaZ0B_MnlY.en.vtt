white is one and a half inches and I'm

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.719 
white is one and a half inches and I'm
cutting<00:01:37.110> them<00:01:37.409> along<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.040> at<00:01:38.340> two<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
half inch intervals and this will now be

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.810 
half inch intervals and this will now be
the<00:01:41.369> stashing<00:01:42.170> attached<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.380> each<00:01:43.500> square<00:01:43.890> so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the stashing attached to each square so

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.109 
the stashing attached to each square so
these<00:01:45.030> squares<00:01:45.479> together<00:01:45.770> in<00:01:46.770> force<00:01:47.579> with

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
these squares together in force with

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.480 
these squares together in force with
sashing<00:01:48.840> at<00:01:49.110> each<00:01:49.350> end<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.770> well<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.310> you'll

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
sashing at each end as well so you'll

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.850 
sashing at each end as well so you'll
have<00:01:50.930> four<00:01:51.930> squares<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.680> five<00:01:53.369> sashings<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
have four squares and five sashings and

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.740 
have four squares and five sashings and
you'll<00:01:55.860> need<00:01:56.600> seven<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.750> these<00:01:57.899> rows<00:01:59.750> I'm

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you'll need seven of these rows I'm

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.499 
you'll need seven of these rows I'm
using<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.320> same<00:02:01.619> idea<00:02:02.579> for<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.880> sashing<00:02:03.329> to

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
using the same idea for the sashing to

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.510 
using the same idea for the sashing to
go<00:02:03.659> between<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.380> rows<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.920> join<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.369> rows

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
go between the rows to join the rows

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.930 
go between the rows to join the rows
together<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.990> addition<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.590> these<00:02:07.940> strips

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
together but in addition to these strips

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.880 
together but in addition to these strips
I<00:02:09.209> also<00:02:09.599> need<00:02:09.989> some<00:02:10.229> two<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> half<00:02:10.619> inch

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I also need some two and a half inch

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.620 
I also need some two and a half inch
squares

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
squares

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.900 
squares
so<00:02:12.290> for<00:02:12.560> each<00:02:12.590> row<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:12.950> sashing<00:02:13.280> there's<00:02:13.730> going

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
so for each row of sashing there's going

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.200 
so for each row of sashing there's going
to<00:02:14.030> be<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.840> turn-off<00:02:15.260> inch<00:02:15.620> square<00:02:15.980> at<00:02:16.310> each<00:02:16.730> end

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
to be a turn-off inch square at each end

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.160 
to be a turn-off inch square at each end
and<00:02:18.400> three<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.580> these<00:02:19.820> five<00:02:20.480> inch<00:02:20.690> strips<00:02:21.020> of

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
and three of these five inch strips of

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.900 
and three of these five inch strips of
sashing<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.710> same<00:02:21.890> as<00:02:22.070> was<00:02:22.250> used<00:02:22.460> between<00:02:22.790> the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
sashing the same as was used between the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.050 
sashing the same as was used between the
blocks<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.800> altogether<00:02:24.800> there'll<00:02:25.160> be<00:02:25.190> four<00:02:26.030> of

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
blocks so altogether there'll be four of

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
blocks so altogether there'll be four of
these<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.870> three<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.650> these<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:29.270> then<00:02:29.810> if

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
these and three of these and then if

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.780 
these and three of these and then if
they're<00:02:30.260> joined<00:02:30.530> together<00:02:30.620> in<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.070> row<00:02:31.250> they

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
they're joined together in a row they

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.740 
they're joined together in a row they
can<00:02:32.120> go<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.130> top<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.150> bottom<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.570> each

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
can go to the top and the bottom of each

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.910 
can go to the top and the bottom of each
a<00:02:36.760> row<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.910> charm<00:02:38.270> squares<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:39.470> join<00:02:39.620> them<00:02:39.800> all

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
a row of charm squares to join them all

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.860 
a row of charm squares to join them all
together<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:40.460> here<00:02:41.030> we've<00:02:41.210> got<00:02:41.240> one<00:02:41.690> row<00:02:41.810> of

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
together so here we've got one row of

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.470 
together so here we've got one row of
sashing<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.830> charm<00:02:43.100> squares<00:02:43.490> and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
sashing and then the charm squares and

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.780 
sashing and then the charm squares and
then<00:02:44.750> another<00:02:45.080> row<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.380> sashing<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.520> another

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
then another row of sashing and another

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.660 
then another row of sashing and another
of<00:02:47.060> chomps<00:02:47.420> worse<00:02:47.740> so<00:02:48.740> altogether<00:02:49.250> you're

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
of chomps worse so altogether you're

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.020 
of chomps worse so altogether you're
going<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:50.000> need<00:02:50.210> eight<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.480> these<00:02:51.020> strips<00:02:52.030> to

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
going to need eight of these strips to

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.060 
going to need eight of these strips to
go<00:02:53.210> at<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.900> top<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.290> bottom<00:02:54.410> as<00:02:54.740> well<00:02:54.860> as

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
go at the top and the bottom as well as

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.390 
go at the top and the bottom as well as
between<00:02:55.310> all<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.200> all<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.350> rows<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.160> now<00:02:58.370> I

a bit to make sure that I get them so

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.060 
a bit to make sure that I get them so
that<00:03:14.360> they're<00:03:14.480> not<00:03:14.510> all<00:03:14.840> directly<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.950> know
