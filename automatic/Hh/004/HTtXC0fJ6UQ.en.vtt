00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:06.569
 yes 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.680
 what's up kids today we went and this is 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.680
 nba 2k 14 for computer and returns the time 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.470
 from here you have the creation of again 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.470
 this pivot this time let's see 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.449
 where we finish this year to see what 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.029
 is what the game offers us this year 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.460
 here you see that this time the pivot is 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.710
 athletic is not all-terrain like I did 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.750
 last year and well then let's see 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.330
 here the quick process that access you 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.190
 we put is come, I'll go fast 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.080
 because otherwise this does not end in life and 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.470
 let's start now with the game 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.500
 the newbies to see how we are given more 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.269
 or less or was explaining apart from how 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.640
 I was playing and I'm going to explain what 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:59.210
 there are differences or that I have noticed 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.000
 different new in this version of nba 2k 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.420
 because there are new things there are enough 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.310
 news and well I will try more or 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.920
 less in the course of the video that are 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.140
 about 6 minutes and something all the 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.020
 differences that I have noticed that is what 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.149
 It has been strange and good for me 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.920
 start have changed what is the 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.509
 shooting dynamics 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.570
 the movement in the post that you already know 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.939
 that I use it a lot now the right stick 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.850
 is used differently no longer 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.320
 it works as pendants is still worth 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.049
 to do the dribbling if it continues 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.420
 serving for shots but not exactly 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.759
 same as before if for example when 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.119
 before we lean on the button of the 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.159
 trigger left the lt or the l 2 o as 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.080
 whatever you want to call before we had to 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.850
 lean on that button and on the joystick 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.009
 analogue whose phenomenon was used the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.159
 analog stick to perform the 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.500
 different shots that we have now if you 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.780
 hit the left trigger and move the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.580
 right joystick because what it does is give 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.500
 a spectacular pass as they call it 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.740
 them and it gets a little more complicated 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.720
 also something that has changed is those that 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.549
 Two step jump that makes for 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.979
 penetrate the area that was already causing 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.319
 was pushing the button bo circle 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.140
 now that button is used to request the 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.290
 locks or I have not come to know very 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.239
 ok it has a first stopper I have not 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.450
 understood very well what part is used for 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.550
 of the blockade but good 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.459
 that is another button that has changed before 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.920
 was in l 1 now l 1 serves to make 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.640
 plays assigns you an automatic move 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.950
 machine 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.540
 and well there you have a loss that was 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.490
 why he was saying that as 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.200
 It was different because I was not able to move 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.660
 the player because he could not do any 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.060
 movement if you realize what 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.740
 goes of game I try much the blockade and 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.500
 then I try to stay alone 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.930
 under the hoop but they do not give me one 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.490
 they give me not even a pass if it made me very 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.590
 difficult to note is that in fact I do not 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.120
 they gave not one under the ring is very little 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.280
 one I think they gave me in all the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.489
 party and as you can see then it was good 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.170
 just an assistance or anything else 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.840
 that has caught my attention is the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.730
 time to jump to catch the rebounds now 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.440
 they jump better now they have more 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.390
 jump animations so to speak 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.239
 jump differently very selection 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.980
 repetitive when it comes to making plugs and 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.360
 also good there you see that for more than 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.660
 I tried to turn around and I was not able 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.510
 here you have the total good failure does not happen 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.830
 nothing are test matches I was 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.390
 trying to acclimatize is the first 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.630
 game that I play directly I do not play 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.820
 in career mode so you do not see either 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.300
 there I was left alone and they do not decide to pass the 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.140
 ball 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.180
 it would not have cost me anything being the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.580
 plugs apart from the animations 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.950
 it also clogs up a lot easier than 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.840
 happens and ss ss has forgotten to comment what is 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.940
 what told you that you have the version 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.280
 of the director is what I was saying to you 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.750
 I wanted to throw nothing but take the bounce and 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.769
 I was wrong and what I did was a pass 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.709
 here you have again the repetition 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.450
 Clear is an incredible past but no 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.010
 is precisely what he sang looking for 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.209
 that's why I was telling you 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.800
 how they have changed a bit 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.090
 controls for at that moment what 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.080
 I wanted to throw nothing but basket 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.320
 catch the bounce but it 's 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.170
 what else is plugs that are made more 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.690
 easy to few levels is already for 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.489
 better another shit and follow us very well 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.620
 what did he did he won as a 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.690
 lion did not control them very well now 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.100
 and it seems to me yes because I think 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.660
 it was with the trigger and with the button 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.330
 shot to another in which you have first 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.330
 hook in the first basket of the 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:36.700
 match and in the race of the beast in 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:38.320
 the 214 and well I have fish and that's what 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.960
 what has made me buy this version 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.410
 in cc and what differences there are regarding 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.390
 the consoles because first there is no vc with 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.370
 which by not having vc then we do not have 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:54.430
 the advantages of lebron james of the 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.170
 reserve the 10,000 starting points 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.330
 to close the game here you see that a 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.860
 this one is sweating the pear that I wear 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.190
 go ahead to block him from sticking a 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.830
 Triple put her to this party here and nothing 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.330
 well that's not there, that's one of the 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.890
 hanging I see here you're going to see that 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.060
 they are not going to happen to me either and see that 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.210
 I try to put there 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.270
 and under the hoop 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.190
 after so much waiting for three 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.070
 seconds in the frontcourt and 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.580
 house and well then apart from that I do not have 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.220
 vc well clear I go by ph it makes me very 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.850
 difficult if you want there is a system for 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.050
 make tricks with which to upload 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.610
 to raise attributes and see that 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.070
 more we have compiled that already if you want 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.169
 you and in the meantime already within 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.270
 those tricks he would teach us to 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.090
 those that you have pc in case you see a little 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.830
 unfair I at least see it others 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.180
 simulating friendly matches get more 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.190
 points and can go up before the player 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.130
 but that already depends on each one of what 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.139
 tell me you more good things 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.550
 Well, we do not have gang mode there 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.650
 you have an almost beige cap and the 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.690
 animations I was saying before not 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.979
 we have gang mode there are many modes 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.389
 that there is no online and good but for 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.370
 me what serves me that is for the way 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.960
 career will not have problems if 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.580
 I would have gone through 20 golds that I did not 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.560
 you can ask for more so nothing here 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.710
 ends the final match I'm not going to 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.520
 put interviews with teams 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.590
 with the marines 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.610
 because it's a pain in the ass I'm going to put 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.009
 directly what team are you going 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.340
 selecting in position 16 the 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:26.259
 boston celtics good team good team 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.990
 I'm not going to complain, it has a lot of history 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:30.400
 is the team with the most rings and with this 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.930
 I finish I hope you liked it and we 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.930
 we see in the next see you later
