which I'll be taking a look at a little

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.959 
which I'll be taking a look at a little
later<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.890> very<00:00:44.340> unique<00:00:44.700> product

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
later this is a very unique product

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.450 
later this is a very unique product
because<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.629> gem<00:00:45.870> 8<00:00:46.079> UFO<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.800> an<00:00:47.010> all-in-one

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
