00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
mechanism with which it was only to

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.930 
mechanism with which it was only to
avoid<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.470> actually<00:02:32.069> talking<00:02:32.549> about<00:02:32.610> how

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
horrifying it was that he was going

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.119 
horrifying it was that he was going
through<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.299> that<00:02:36.620> he<00:02:37.620> was<00:02:37.769> our<00:02:37.890> friend

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
through this and that he was our friend

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.649

and<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.579> he<00:02:38.640> could<00:02:38.790> die<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:39.420> it

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
and that he could die and that it

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.149 
and that he could die and that it
literally<00:02:39.959> meant<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.560> could<00:02:40.769> happen<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
literally meant it could happen to

that<00:02:50.430> as<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.819> was<00:02:50.910> happening<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:51.569> as<00:02:51.690> we

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
that as it was happening and then as we

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.119 
that as it was happening and then as we
were<00:02:51.870> writing<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.319> movie<00:02:52.680> were<00:02:52.799> like<00:02:52.950> yeah<00:02:53.099> I
