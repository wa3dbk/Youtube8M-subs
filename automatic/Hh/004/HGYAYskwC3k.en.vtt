 also for the setting of a 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.920
 catwalk because if they put music here like 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.600
 which means is one and that is not the same 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.670
 the models have to have like the 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.100
 attitude and the whole country and obviously the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.570
 music helps a lot in this 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.610
 it's exactly like what the 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.940
