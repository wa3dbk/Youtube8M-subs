sweet skate the tempest 90 if you ever
heard<00:00:11.710> about<00:00:11.830> the<00:00:11.950> new<00:00:12.160> tempest<00:00:12.519> lineup<00:00:12.910> in

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
heard about the new tempest lineup in

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.210 
heard about the new tempest lineup in
2011<00:00:13.809> really<00:00:14.139> did<00:00:14.500> a<00:00:14.530> whole<00:00:14.769> new<00:00:14.980> boot

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.220 
2011 really did a whole new boot

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.819 
2011 really did a whole new boot
construction<00:00:15.760> a<00:00:15.940> new<00:00:16.510> slimmer<00:00:16.869> fit<00:00:17.199> which

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:17.829 
construction a new slimmer fit which

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.069 
construction a new slimmer fit which
correlates<00:00:18.579> to<00:00:18.699> better<00:00:18.970> power<00:00:19.239> transfer<00:00:19.960> down

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:20.079 
correlates to better power transfer down

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:21.779 
correlates to better power transfer down
to<00:00:20.259> your<00:00:20.380> Trier<00:00:20.829> wheels<00:00:21.039> and<00:00:21.279> your<00:00:21.369> skates<00:00:21.609> and

to your Trier wheels and your skates and

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.849 
to your Trier wheels and your skates and
give<00:00:21.880> you<00:00:21.970> a<00:00:21.999> more<00:00:22.119> efficient<00:00:22.569> stride<00:00:22.869> so<00:00:23.439> as

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
give you a more efficient stride so as

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.739 
give you a more efficient stride so as
the<00:00:24.099> name<00:00:24.220> implies<00:00:24.249> a<00:00:24.519> tempest<00:00:24.939> 90<00:00:25.210> comes<00:00:25.449> with

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:25.749 
the name implies a tempest 90 comes with

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.259 
the name implies a tempest 90 comes with
a<00:00:25.779> 90<00:00:26.199> millimeter<00:00:26.619> wheel<00:00:26.769> setup<00:00:27.069> this<00:00:28.029> of

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:28.269 
a 90 millimeter wheel setup this of

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.899 
a 90 millimeter wheel setup this of
course<00:00:28.329> is<00:00:28.659> a<00:00:28.720> pretty<00:00:28.929> user-friendly<00:00:29.319> size

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:29.909 
course is a pretty user-friendly size

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.790 
course is a pretty user-friendly size
but<00:00:30.909> this<00:00:31.089> still<00:00:31.300> is<00:00:31.509> a<00:00:31.539> skate<00:00:32.140> targeted<00:00:32.619> to

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
but this still is a skate targeted to

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.740 
but this still is a skate targeted to
your<00:00:32.920> more<00:00:33.130> advanced<00:00:33.970> skater<00:00:34.270> that's<00:00:34.510> doing

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
your more advanced skater that's doing

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.960 
your more advanced skater that's doing
longer<00:00:35.080> skates<00:00:35.350> workouts<00:00:36.340> cross-training

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
longer skates workouts cross-training

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.360 
longer skates workouts cross-training
can<00:00:37.570> even<00:00:37.720> do<00:00:37.810> marathons<00:00:38.260> in<00:00:38.410> this<00:00:38.560> but<00:00:39.100> 90

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
can even do marathons in this but 90

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.530 
can even do marathons in this but 90
millimeters<00:00:39.760> works<00:00:39.940> really<00:00:40.150> well<00:00:40.270> because

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
millimeters works really well because

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.060 
millimeters works really well because
it's<00:00:40.810> really<00:00:41.140> quick<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.380> start<00:00:41.740> and<00:00:41.860> stop

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
it's really quick to start and stop

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.910 
it's really quick to start and stop
unlike<00:00:42.790> a<00:00:42.820> larger<00:00:43.240> 100<00:00:43.810> movie<00:00:43.990> wheel<00:00:44.140> size<00:00:44.380> you

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
unlike a larger 100 movie wheel size you

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.290 
unlike a larger 100 movie wheel size you
still<00:00:45.160> can<00:00:45.280> get<00:00:45.370> over<00:00:45.520> those<00:00:45.640> bumps<00:00:45.970> and<00:00:46.090> rocks

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
still can get over those bumps and rocks

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.130 
still can get over those bumps and rocks
real<00:00:46.600> easy<00:00:46.870> but<00:00:47.590> it's<00:00:48.460> just<00:00:48.700> a<00:00:48.870> good<00:00:49.870> skate

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
real easy but it's just a good skate

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.870 
real easy but it's just a good skate
they<00:00:50.260> can<00:00:50.410> get<00:00:50.530> going<00:00:50.980> real<00:00:51.130> quick<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.580> stop

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
they can get going real quick and stop

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.120 
they can get going real quick and stop
faster<00:00:52.300> if<00:00:52.420> you<00:00:52.480> need<00:00:52.630> to<00:00:52.810> so<00:00:53.620> again<00:00:53.829> 90

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
faster if you need to so again 90

something like that you can move this to

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.910 
something like that you can move this to

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
rollerblade models with that what does

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:24.959 
rollerblade models with that what does
is<00:01:23.380> address<00:01:23.859> where<00:01:24.249> the<00:01:24.369> boot<00:01:24.579> would<00:01:24.700> want<00:01:24.909> a

the back you'll have a neoprene lining

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.630 
the back you'll have a neoprene lining
which<00:02:31.810> helps<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.170> slip<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.680> off<00:02:32.860> but

this<00:02:33.760> will<00:02:33.970> also<00:02:34.060> help<00:02:34.270> cater<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.959> lot<00:02:35.140> more

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
this will also help cater to a lot more

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.020 
this will also help cater to a lot more
range<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.680> motion<00:02:35.740> then<00:02:36.490> you'd<00:02:36.640> find<00:02:36.880> on<00:02:36.970> a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
range of motion then you'd find on a

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.670 
range of motion then you'd find on a
higher<00:02:37.390> profile<00:02:37.870> skate<00:02:38.170> such<00:02:38.410> as<00:02:38.560> the
