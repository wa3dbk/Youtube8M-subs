00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.619
 what I am going to explain is the trick of 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.939
 three since people who have said that they 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.939
 can do what you have not seen in 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.290
 youtube although yes it is ok but 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.290
 it does not cost me much either 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.750
 this is from people textual usb open and 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.750
 how am I going to call and achieve being all 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.280
 I have connected, we have to go to 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.280
 configuration 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.210
 it does not matter how much I gave this 4 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.050
 after 8 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.050
 storage 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.010
 configurator 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.369
 yes 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.369
 it will take nothing 10 seconds depends 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.400
 because today takes more than every day 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 Enough 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.360
 You see, he has already recognized 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.619
 so let's make them 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.719
 and we put it on the portable laptop 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.719
 when you put 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.460
 as you see 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.340
 since it was full good but it's 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.549
 and that's why the woman you want but what 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.549
 is that 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.410
 it's good 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.190
 normally let's put one or two not 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.190
 I'll let you put more 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.430
 the sheep 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.209
 how are these 2 already we have enough 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.209
 we attack 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.910
 let's go for him 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.120
 it's worth it for the pain of the fixed ones that are 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.129
 those that 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.519
 what I have to use this to be able 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.519
 to play 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.150
 to see if I can 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.500
 where the medium 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.470
 it's someone side we select appointment voucher 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.760
 you give him 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.760
 contributory disposition 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.950
 low voice 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.900
 copyright 2 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.569
 we select this 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.060
 it's already sounding okay, you do not listen because 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.269
 low volume but it 's sounding for 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.269
 outside 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.750
 then it 's fifa 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.439
 It is important 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:25.930
 important 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.930
 well the bottom would be yes yes no 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.760
 You see what I'm commenting on the 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:42.500
 online if you have the lt 3.0 you can 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.580
 connect quietly updated and 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.580
 everything if you have the 2.0 not that it's clear 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.910
 but now 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.400
 let's play 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.810
 it's a match worth 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.810
 now this is a music 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.400
 these are the notes of sounds when 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.350
 finish the music will sound again or the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.480
 other music or is in the problem 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.280
 neither is you have much on the menu 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.530
 then the dirty disc radio will jump 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.120
 when you are going to play the good game 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.990

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.259

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.680

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.220

 It runs Relocating music 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.650
 select the music and put the music and 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.010
