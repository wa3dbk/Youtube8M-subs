how's it look so far I took all the
twists<00:03:13.450> out<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:15.450> um<00:03:20.730> there<00:03:21.730> was<00:03:21.820> a<00:03:21.880> little<00:03:22.150> bit

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
twists out and um there was a little bit

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.650 
twists out and um there was a little bit
of<00:03:22.360> like<00:03:22.800> flaking<00:03:23.910> maybe<00:03:24.910> I've<00:03:25.060> used<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.510> bit

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
of like flaking maybe I've used a bit

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.510 
of like flaking maybe I've used a bit
too<00:03:25.840> much<00:03:25.989> product<00:03:26.410> in<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.770> front<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.340> rest

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
too much product in the front the rest

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.270 
too much product in the front the rest
of<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.790> seemed<00:03:28.030> ok<00:03:28.330> was<00:03:28.480> just<00:03:28.660> meaning<00:03:28.840> here<00:03:29.350> so

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
of it seemed ok was just meaning here so

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.100 
of it seemed ok was just meaning here so
just<00:03:30.310> got<00:03:30.580> my<00:03:30.700> pic<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.330> I'm<00:03:31.420> going<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:34.110> lift

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
just got my pic and I'm going to lift

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.150 
just got my pic and I'm going to lift
the<00:03:35.320> roots<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:38.050> I<00:03:38.080> separated<00:03:38.650> all<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.920> twists

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
the roots so I separated all the twists

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.240 
the roots so I separated all the twists
and<00:03:39.310> then<00:03:39.459> separated<00:03:39.940> each<00:03:41.310> half<00:03:42.310> in<00:03:42.670> half<00:03:44.250> so

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
and then separated each half in half so

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.670 
and then separated each half in half so
one<00:03:45.489> twist<00:03:45.850> ended<00:03:46.269> up<00:03:46.360> with<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:47.019> four<00:03:47.380> sections

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
one twist ended up with in four sections

00:03:47.680 --> 00:04:06.920 
one twist ended up with in four sections
basically

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.250 

so<00:04:07.930> I'm<00:04:08.080> not<00:04:08.200> bad<00:04:08.410> right<00:04:09.510> but<00:04:10.510> you<00:04:10.630> get<00:04:10.750> you

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.540 
think i'm just going to use it for
twists<00:04:27.210> instead<00:04:28.210> of<00:04:29.040> using<00:04:30.040> it<00:04:30.250> for<00:04:30.430> like

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
twists instead of using it for like

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.700 
twists instead of using it for like
