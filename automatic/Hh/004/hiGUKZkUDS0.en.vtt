of<00:00:52.219> prosecuting<00:00:53.219> policy<00:00:53.760> has<00:00:53.910> been

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
of prosecuting policy has been

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.819 
of prosecuting policy has been
eliminated<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.989> therefore<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.530> central

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
eliminated so that therefore the central

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.889 
eliminated so that therefore the central

I'm afraid that in a matter of a few

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.880 
I'm afraid that in a matter of a few
years<00:01:23.640> more<00:01:24.060> than<00:01:24.180> half<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.720> human<00:01:24.869> race<00:01:25.080> has

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
first time in hundreds of years and this

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.080 
first time in hundreds of years and this
would<00:01:30.299> go<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.479> whether<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.650> was<00:01:31.799> any

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
would go on whether there was any

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.370 
would go on whether there was any
communist<00:01:33.090> problem<00:01:33.450> at<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.689> well<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.200> would<00:01:34.350> I

the important thing it seems to me jack

the important thing it seems to me jack
is<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.470> persuade<00:02:32.829> these<00:02:33.069> people<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:33.700> they

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
is to persuade these people that they

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.369 
is to persuade these people that they
may<00:02:34.060> preserve<00:02:34.450> their<00:02:34.690> independence<00:02:35.290> that

may preserve their independence that

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.170 
may preserve their independence that
they<00:02:35.440> can<00:02:35.769> keep<00:02:35.950> free<00:02:36.220> -<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.700> way<00:02:36.819> we<00:02:37.030> have

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
they can keep free - the way we have

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.119 
they can keep free - the way we have
been<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.230> do<00:02:38.379> that<00:02:38.530> we're<00:02:38.739> going<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:38.980> have

been but to do that we're going to have

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.429 
been but to do that we're going to have
to<00:02:39.250> help<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.569> think<00:02:40.599> that<00:02:40.900> there<00:02:41.230> would<00:02:41.409> be

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
to help and I think that there would be

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.259 
to help and I think that there would be
nothing<00:02:41.709> more<00:02:42.040> important<00:02:42.549> than<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.939> could<00:02:43.120> do

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
nothing more important than you could do

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.349 
nothing more important than you could do
as<00:02:43.390> president<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:44.019> for<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.409> is<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.329> show<00:02:46.329> that

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
as president is for that is to show that

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:47.729 
as president is for that is to show that
the<00:02:46.599> United<00:02:46.750> States<00:02:46.900> speaks<00:02:47.409> with<00:02:47.620> its

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
the United States speaks with its

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.710 
the United States speaks with its
traditional<00:02:47.950> voice<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.909> puts<00:02:49.180> out<00:02:49.329> its<00:02:49.480> hand

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
traditional voice and puts out its hand

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.500 
traditional voice and puts out its hand
of<00:02:49.870> friendship<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.349> all<00:02:50.590> these<00:02:50.799> people<00:02:51.040> and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
of friendship to all these people and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.170 
of friendship to all these people and
after<00:02:52.510> all<00:02:52.659> you<00:02:52.870> don't<00:02:53.139> stop<00:02:53.560> ideas<00:02:54.489> add

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
after all you don't stop ideas add

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.599 
after all you don't stop ideas add
boundaries<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.349> don't<00:02:56.560> stop<00:02:56.859> them<00:02:57.129> with

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
boundaries and you don't stop them with

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.789 
boundaries and you don't stop them with
bullets<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.290> basically<00:02:59.290> this<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.769> a

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
bullets and basically this is a

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.920 
bullets and basically this is a
competition<00:03:00.310> for<00:03:00.879> people's<00:03:01.389> allegiance

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
competition for people's allegiance

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
and that is the basic issue the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.949 
and that is the basic issue the
