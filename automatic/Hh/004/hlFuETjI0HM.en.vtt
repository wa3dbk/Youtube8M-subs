00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
right guys we have is a 1609 wired

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.210 
right guys we have is a 1609 wired
computer<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> first<00:00:22.710> thing<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.010> need<00:00:23.189> to

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
computer so the first thing we need to

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.759 
computer so the first thing we need to
do<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.580> get<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.939> set<00:00:24.150> up<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.810> push<00:00:25.109> any<00:00:25.380> button

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
do to get this set up is push any button

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.310 
do to get this set up is push any button
to<00:00:25.800> wake<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> from<00:00:26.400> sleep<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.510> go<00:00:27.810> ahead<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.109> do

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
to wake it from sleep so go ahead and do

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.400 
to wake it from sleep so go ahead and do
that<00:00:29.119> to<00:00:30.119> make<00:00:30.269> sure<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.539> see<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> zeros<00:00:31.199> on

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
that to make sure we see the zeros on

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.450 
that to make sure we see the zeros on
the<00:00:31.439> screen<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.759> lock<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.420> place<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:35.160> it's

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the screen and lock it in place and it's

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.940 
the screen and lock it in place and it's
gonna<00:00:35.579> auto<00:00:35.820> detect<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.510> us<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:37.500> gonna<00:00:37.620> find

gonna auto detect for us it's gonna find
which<00:00:38.160> model<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:40.940> alright<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.149> detected

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
which model it is alright it's detected

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.410 
which model it is alright it's detected
the<00:00:42.719> 1609<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.190> let's<00:00:44.340> go<00:00:44.489> ahead<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.940> we'll<00:00:45.270> get

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the 1609 so let's go ahead and we'll get

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.900 
the 1609 so let's go ahead and we'll get
this<00:00:45.539> started<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.739> asking<00:00:47.070> BC<00:00:47.460> sixteen

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
put it onto the fast-setting box if this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.849 
put it onto the fast-setting box if this
is<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> new<00:01:00.390> computer<00:01:00.809> we'll<00:01:01.379> go<00:01:01.559> ahead<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
is a new computer we'll go ahead and

we are ready so we'll push done and we

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:31.570 
we are ready so we'll push done and we
will<00:04:30.530> send<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:30.979> transmitted<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.460> our

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
will send and transmitted to our

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.189 
will send and transmitted to our
computer<00:04:33.880> alright<00:04:34.909> our<00:04:35.570> transmission<00:04:35.930> is

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
computer alright our transmission is

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.830 
computer alright our transmission is
finished<00:04:36.500> we're<00:04:37.430> done<00:04:37.550> with<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.699> 506<00:04:38.030> great

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
finished we're done with the 506 great

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.499 
finished we're done with the 506 great
that<00:04:39.770> was<00:04:39.889> easy<00:04:40.039> enough

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
that was easy enough

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.950 
that was easy enough
now<00:04:41.509> it'll<00:04:41.810> also<00:04:42.020> do<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.440> dew<00:04:42.620> rocks<00:04:43.130> 8.0<00:04:43.849> and

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
now it'll also do the dew rocks 8.0 and

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.990 
now it'll also do the dew rocks 8.0 and
9.0<00:04:44.960> computers<00:04:45.470> correct<00:04:45.770> correct<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.460> it's<00:04:46.909> a

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
9.0 computers correct correct and it's a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.180 
9.0 computers correct correct and it's a
little<00:04:47.120> tricky<00:04:47.300> with<00:04:47.599> the<00:04:47.659> 8.0<00:04:48.500> in<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.650> 9.0<00:04:49.070> if

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
little tricky with the 8.0 in the 9.0 if

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.159 
little tricky with the 8.0 in the 9.0 if
you<00:04:49.250> have<00:04:49.340> to<00:04:49.460> make<00:04:49.610> sure<00:04:49.759> that<00:04:49.849> you're<00:04:50.000> in<00:04:50.090> the

let's<00:05:06.300> go<00:05:06.449> ahead<00:05:06.569> and<00:05:06.780> lock<00:05:06.960> it<00:05:07.169> into<00:05:07.289> our

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
let's go ahead and lock it into our

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.249 
let's go ahead and lock it into our
twist<00:05:08.580> lock<00:05:08.819> system<00:05:09.270> section<00:05:09.660> here<00:05:09.840> this<00:05:10.080> is

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
twist lock system section here this is

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:20.350 
twist lock system section here this is
for<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.500> 2450

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.300 

all<00:05:20.960> right<00:05:21.139> it's<00:05:21.289> going<00:05:21.379> to<00:05:21.439> auto<00:05:21.620> detect<00:05:22.069> for

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
all right it's going to auto detect for

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.290 
all right it's going to auto detect for
us<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.550> find<00:05:22.759> the<00:05:22.849> rocks<00:05:23.060> 9.0<00:05:25.000> and<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.120> rocks

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
us and find the rocks 9.0 and the rocks

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.119 
us and find the rocks 9.0 and the rocks
9.0<00:05:26.840> is<00:05:26.960> going<00:05:27.080> to<00:05:27.139> have<00:05:27.289> a<00:05:27.319> lot<00:05:27.590> more<00:05:27.860> features

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
9.0 is going to have a lot more features

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:29.860 
9.0 is going to have a lot more features
so<00:05:28.460> it<00:05:28.550> might<00:05:28.669> take<00:05:28.969> a<00:05:29.000> little<00:05:29.270> bit<00:05:29.479> longer<00:05:29.659> to

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
so it might take a little bit longer to

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.279 
so it might take a little bit longer to
program<00:05:30.229> them<00:05:30.409> let's<00:05:30.560> say<00:05:30.680> it<00:05:30.800> BC<00:05:31.099> 5
