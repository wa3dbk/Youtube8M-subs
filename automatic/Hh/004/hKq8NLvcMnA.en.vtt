00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.759
 I'm cary and I come to teach you how to do 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:09.110
 artistic gelatins make selections 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.620
 flowers in the selective ones 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:17.510
 to each I have one more in segre messina 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:21.080
 no flavored color but no color 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.570
 there are also bringas from 3 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.570
 milliliters of which I use because 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.939
 not practical to shape colors 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.920
 for your flowers and I here nothing else I have 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.400
 three you can make them the color 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.400
 look for 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.340
 first we have the syringe 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.340
 we remove the needle, fill it with 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.430
 color that you like for example 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.200
 rose for styles the titles are 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.329
 those who go in the middle of their own 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:00.650
 your needle would be right 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:04.340
 they start in the middle of the gelatin 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.220
 doing miniature subjects with rites 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.760
 rights because they would be the pistils of 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.270
 those of the flowers 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.290
 and so on until filling a wheel that would be 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.290
 the center of the area 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.370
 since they have the 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.760
 the pistils the reality 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.760
 ah 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.760
 they take 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.710
 they take other syringes 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.400
 I, to accommodate myself, gave him a little 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.400
 what is the needle 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.799
 in this way 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.980
 they take his eyes off 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.360
 they fill me with more color in it 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:02:00.720
 they put the needle back and now there's 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.659
 that give it shape, not down 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.210
 It impresses me a little 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.450
 and they go around 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.080
 he presses him a little and they give him 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.080
 turns 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.160
 and so we must repeat the following 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.760
 layer would have to be a little bit more 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.760
 down 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.230
 put in the syringe they go a little bit more 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.380
 down without hitting the petals that 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.100
 is it so 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.950
 they were put first 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.470
 comment turn it around 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.210
 and so all the 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.200
 jelly 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:45.040
 you can put 8 to 10 petals for 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.379
 make your flower look beautiful 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.870
 fill in the spaces that are not 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.110
 there is no space without jelly because 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.020
 is going to see is the little bag 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.840
 they are finished refilled 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.360
 and they go back to 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.360
 make the petals of the flowers 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.510
 since they have a certain flower 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.700
 well then we keep turning you 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.519
 and already the last ones would be a little 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.110
 higher when the mold in its 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.180
 jelly 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.890
 the petals can be seen that come from 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.740
 center 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.010
 they're always going to start from the center towards 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.800
 outside the center outwards so that 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.560
 this part of cover do not look 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.770
 although not 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.150
 and although they finished 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:45.740
 and pink you can start filling 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.040
 today you can make little sheets 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.020
 that would be in the biggest jellies 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.170
 because they have more space these are 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.370
 individual would be more and it would be 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.160
 question of filling and nudity that 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.790
 it would be everything 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.200
 and if you have any doubt 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.050
