you would want to get married to him so
the<00:03:23.069> main<00:03:23.220> constituent<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.410> caffeine<00:03:25.410> and

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
the main constituent is caffeine and

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.759 
the main constituent is caffeine and
therapy<00:03:26.760> may<00:03:27.690> affect<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.260> central<00:03:28.530> nervous

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
therapy may affect the central nervous

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.339 
therapy may affect the central nervous
system<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.730> skeletal<00:03:29.970> muscles<00:03:30.569> so

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
system and the skeletal muscles so

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.390 
system and the skeletal muscles so
caffeine<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.280> responsible<00:03:33.030> for<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.660> main

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
caffeine is responsible for the main

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.050 
caffeine is responsible for the main
stimulation<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.669> central<00:03:35.970> nervous

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
stimulation of the central nervous

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.589 
stimulation of the central nervous
system

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
system

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.900 
system
wow<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.169> theobromine<00:03:37.950> affects<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.519> skeletal

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
wow the theobromine affects the skeletal

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.650 
wow the theobromine affects the skeletal
muscles<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:41.250> can<00:03:41.430> see<00:03:42.049> that's<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:44.359> yeah<00:03:45.359> for

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
muscles you can see that's the yeah for

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.300 
muscles you can see that's the yeah for
caffeine<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.349> then<00:03:46.440> there've<00:03:46.769> oh<00:03:46.919> me

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
caffeine and then there've oh me

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.449 
caffeine and then there've oh me
so<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:49.260> caffeine<00:03:49.680> content<00:03:49.829> is<00:03:50.250> actually

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
so the caffeine content is actually

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.270 
so the caffeine content is actually
really<00:03:50.970> high<00:03:51.299> in<00:03:51.989> addition<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:52.650> comparison<00:03:53.250> to

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
really high in addition in comparison to

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.330 
really high in addition in comparison to
coffee<00:03:53.599> it<00:03:54.599> has<00:03:54.989> three<00:03:55.440> times<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.889> amount<00:03:55.949> of

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
coffee it has three times the amount of

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.879 
coffee it has three times the amount of
caffeine<00:03:56.819> so<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.840> really<00:03:58.019> really<00:03:58.739> powerful

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
caffeine so it's really really powerful

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.939 
caffeine so it's really really powerful
and<00:03:59.400> then<00:04:00.389> another<00:04:00.750> active<00:04:01.169> constituent<00:04:01.859> is

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
and then another active constituent is

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.250 
and then another active constituent is
Cola<00:04:02.310> teen<00:04:02.549> which<00:04:02.970> helps<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.049> heart

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
Cola teen which helps like the heart

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.699 
Cola teen which helps like the heart
stimulant

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.860 

so<00:04:09.709> biological<00:04:10.400> studies<00:04:10.760> um<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.390> was<00:04:11.569> known<00:04:11.720> as

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
so biological studies um it was known as

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.500 
so biological studies um it was known as
a<00:04:11.900> bronchial<00:04:12.410> dilator<00:04:12.860> it<00:04:13.280> helps<00:04:13.849> um<00:04:14.090> it

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
a bronchial dilator it helps um it

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.370 
a bronchial dilator it helps um it
blocks<00:04:15.019> an<00:04:15.200> inhibitor<00:04:15.739> so<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.489> allows<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.970> help

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
blocks an inhibitor so it allows to help

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.259 
blocks an inhibitor so it allows to help
people<00:04:18.380> with<00:04:18.530> like<00:04:18.680> asthma<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.850> could<00:04:20.120> help

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
people with like asthma it could help

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.050 
people with like asthma it could help
them<00:04:20.480> also<00:04:20.780> it's<00:04:21.680> used<00:04:21.980> as<00:04:22.100> a<00:04:22.130> diuretic<00:04:22.370> so

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
them also it's used as a diuretic so

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.879 
them also it's used as a diuretic so
like<00:04:23.240> dropsy<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:23.990> could<00:04:24.139> also<00:04:24.260> help<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:24.710> like

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
like dropsy it could also help that like

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.879 
like dropsy it could also help that like
it<00:04:25.010> helps<00:04:25.250> water-retaining<00:04:26.260> it<00:04:27.260> was<00:04:27.500> known<00:04:27.650> as

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
it helps water-retaining it was known as

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.310 
it helps water-retaining it was known as
an<00:04:28.040> anti<00:04:28.340> tumour<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:28.940> then<00:04:29.690> it's<00:04:29.990> said<00:04:30.200> to

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
an anti tumour and then it's said to

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.110 
an anti tumour and then it's said to
have<00:04:30.470> weight<00:04:30.740> loss<00:04:30.979> but<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.520> issue<00:04:31.729> with<00:04:32.060> that

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
have weight loss but the issue with that

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.719 
have weight loss but the issue with that
is<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.750> um<00:04:33.410> it<00:04:33.740> actually<00:04:34.160> puts<00:04:34.400> weight<00:04:34.580> in

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
is that um it actually puts weight in

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.659 
is that um it actually puts weight in
your<00:04:34.760> organs<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.570> so<00:04:36.560> that<00:04:37.190> was<00:04:37.370> one<00:04:37.550> problem

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
your organs and so that was one problem

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.820 
your organs and so that was one problem
with<00:04:38.000> that<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.419> then<00:04:38.990> another<00:04:39.110> thing<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.740> was

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
with that and then another thing and was

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.800 
with that and then another thing and was
that<00:04:40.010> it<00:04:40.190> was<00:04:40.310> sort<00:04:40.550> of<00:04:40.639> found<00:04:40.910> that<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.389> could

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
that it was sort of found that it could

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:42.640 
that it was sort of found that it could
help<00:04:41.930> herpes

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
help herpes

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.920 
help herpes
but<00:04:43.010> that's<00:04:43.190> not<00:04:43.419> necessarily<00:04:44.419> like<00:04:44.570> it

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
but that's not necessarily like it

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.780 
but that's not necessarily like it
hasn't<00:04:45.200> fully<00:04:45.500> been<00:04:45.650> tested<00:04:46.130> so<00:04:46.430> they're

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
hasn't fully been tested so they're

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.360 
hasn't fully been tested so they're
still<00:04:46.970> looking<00:04:47.090> over<00:04:47.479> that<00:04:50.889> so<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.220> only

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
still looking over that so the only

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.890 
still looking over that so the only
clinical<00:04:52.850> study<00:04:53.030> that<00:04:53.210> I<00:04:53.270> found<00:04:53.360> was<00:04:53.660> the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
clinical study that I found was the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.520 
clinical study that I found was the
cardiac<00:04:54.320> effects<00:04:54.770> on<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.639> person<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.530> increases

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
cardiac effects on a person it increases

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.400 
cardiac effects on a person it increases
the<00:04:57.710> metabolites<00:04:58.250> it<00:04:59.060> seemed<00:04:59.690> to<00:04:59.780> increase<00:05:00.169> as

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
the metabolites it seemed to increase as

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.260 
the metabolites it seemed to increase as
you<00:05:00.710> ate<00:05:00.860> more<00:05:01.100> going<00:05:01.639> up<00:05:01.790> because<00:05:01.910> of<00:05:02.180> the

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
you ate more going up because of the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.990 
you ate more going up because of the
caffeine<00:05:02.660> and<00:05:02.870> then<00:05:03.770> also<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.490> rhythmic<00:05:04.820> art

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
caffeine and then also the rhythmic art

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.690 
caffeine and then also the rhythmic art
activity<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:06.590> more<00:05:06.770> colon<00:05:07.160> up<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:07.400> you<00:05:07.490> ate

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
activity the more colon up that you ate

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.080 
activity the more colon up that you ate
the<00:05:08.360> higher<00:05:08.570> the<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.710> heart<00:05:09.919> would<00:05:10.040> be<00:05:10.190> so

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
the higher the the heart would be so

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.629 
the higher the the heart would be so
that<00:05:11.720> was<00:05:11.870> a<00:05:11.900> problem<00:05:12.169> and<00:05:12.560> there's<00:05:13.400> more

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
that was a problem and there's more

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.250 
that was a problem and there's more
studies<00:05:14.120> that<00:05:14.150> they're<00:05:14.539> trying<00:05:14.810> to<00:05:14.840> find<00:05:15.080> out

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
studies that they're trying to find out

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.560 
studies that they're trying to find out
like<00:05:15.410> if<00:05:15.560> it<00:05:15.680> has<00:05:15.800> any<00:05:16.010> other<00:05:16.190> effects<00:05:16.639> but

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
like if it has any other effects but

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.629 
like if it has any other effects but
that's<00:05:18.410> it<00:05:18.680> for<00:05:18.950> so<00:05:19.100> far<00:05:20.889> okay<00:05:21.889> so<00:05:22.460> some

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
that's it for so far okay so some

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:23.770 
that's it for so far okay so some
contradictions<00:05:23.330> um

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
contradictions um

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.140 
contradictions um
one<00:05:24.169> study<00:05:24.470> I<00:05:24.590> found<00:05:24.770> that<00:05:25.310> malaria<00:05:25.729> it

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
one study I found that malaria it

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.620 
one study I found that malaria it
actually<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:28.100> caffeine<00:05:28.610> actually<00:05:28.880> inhibits

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
actually the caffeine actually inhibits

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.890 
actually the caffeine actually inhibits
the<00:05:30.169> camp<00:05:30.470> in<00:05:30.740> our<00:05:31.340> body<00:05:31.550> so<00:05:31.970> then<00:05:32.180> it<00:05:32.510> allows

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
the camp in our body so then it allows

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.260 
the camp in our body so then it allows
the<00:05:33.110> parasites<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.830> multiply<00:05:34.190> faster<00:05:34.400> so

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
the parasites to multiply faster so

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.900 
the parasites to multiply faster so
those<00:05:35.510> who<00:05:35.750> ate<00:05:35.960> :<00:05:36.320> up<00:05:36.470> in<00:05:36.650> um<00:05:36.950> and<00:05:37.250> I<00:05:37.520> malaria

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
those who ate : up in um and I malaria

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.750 
those who ate : up in um and I malaria
infested<00:05:38.270> like<00:05:38.630> area<00:05:39.050> we'd<00:05:39.919> have<00:05:40.100> the<00:05:40.639> higher

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
infested like area we'd have the higher

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.170 
infested like area we'd have the higher
probability<00:05:41.479> of<00:05:41.510> getting<00:05:41.840> malaria<00:05:42.400> also<00:05:43.400> it

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
probability of getting malaria also it

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.430 
probability of getting malaria also it
contains<00:05:44.800> hydrocyanic<00:05:45.800> acid<00:05:46.510> so<00:05:47.510> short<00:05:48.229> term

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
contains hydrocyanic acid so short term

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.350 
contains hydrocyanic acid so short term
it<00:05:48.710> would<00:05:48.830> cause<00:05:48.979> like<00:05:49.280> nervous<00:05:49.580> respiratory

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
it would cause like nervous respiratory

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.629 
it would cause like nervous respiratory
system<00:05:50.780> and<00:05:50.930> cardiovascular<00:05:51.260> system<00:05:52.220> to

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
system and cardiovascular system to

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.450 
system and cardiovascular system to
break<00:05:53.150> down<00:05:53.650> also<00:05:54.650> if<00:05:54.800> you've<00:05:54.950> used<00:05:55.130> it<00:05:55.340> in

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
break down also if you've used it in

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.700 
break down also if you've used it in
long<00:05:55.669> term<00:05:55.970> it<00:05:56.900> would<00:05:57.050> cause<00:05:57.200> headaches

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
long term it would cause headaches

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.980 
long term it would cause headaches
dizziness<00:05:58.450> damages<00:05:59.450> to<00:05:59.599> the<00:05:59.690> nervous<00:05:59.960> system

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
dizziness damages to the nervous system

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.129 
dizziness damages to the nervous system
and<00:06:00.880> then<00:06:01.880> of<00:06:02.000> course<00:06:02.240> like<00:06:02.450> the<00:06:02.510> side<00:06:02.840> effects

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
and then of course like the side effects

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.589 
and then of course like the side effects
of<00:06:03.260> caffeine<00:06:03.680> if<00:06:04.010> you<00:06:04.550> take<00:06:04.789> too<00:06:05.060> much<00:06:05.270> you<00:06:05.510> can

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599 
of caffeine if you take too much you can

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.870 
of caffeine if you take too much you can
get<00:06:05.720> dizzy<00:06:06.410> there's<00:06:06.950> nausea<00:06:09.190> also<00:06:10.190> it<00:06:10.669> was

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
get dizzy there's nausea also it was

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.510 
get dizzy there's nausea also it was
also<00:06:11.270> affect<00:06:11.570> the<00:06:11.750> GI<00:06:12.020> tract<00:06:12.500> so<00:06:12.770> it's<00:06:13.280> said

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
also affect the GI tract so it's said

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.680 
also affect the GI tract so it's said
that<00:06:13.550> it<00:06:14.330> causes<00:06:15.160> gastric<00:06:16.160> secretion<00:06:16.849> so<00:06:17.510> that

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
that it causes gastric secretion so that

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.959 
that it causes gastric secretion so that
could<00:06:17.810> also<00:06:17.960> cause<00:06:18.080> both<00:06:18.590> that<00:06:19.340> cause<00:06:19.640> ulcers

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
could also cause both that cause ulcers

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:27.109 
could also cause both that cause ulcers
in<00:06:21.029> the<00:06:21.509> G<00:06:21.659> I<00:06:21.689> checked<00:06:24.619> current<00:06:25.619> uses<00:06:26.039> it<00:06:26.939> was

00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:27.119 
in the G I checked current uses it was

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:29.499 
in the G I checked current uses it was
reintroduced<00:06:27.419> at<00:06:27.989> the<00:06:28.169> flavoring<00:06:28.649> for<00:06:28.829> drinks

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
reintroduced at the flavoring for drinks

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.469 
reintroduced at the flavoring for drinks
its<00:06:30.509> found<00:06:30.779> in<00:06:31.699> this<00:06:32.699> book<00:06:32.879> came<00:06:33.089> out<00:06:33.209> I<00:06:33.269> think

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
its found in this book came out I think

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.309 
its found in this book came out I think
in<00:06:33.719> 2009<00:06:34.439> it<00:06:35.429> was<00:06:35.549> like<00:06:35.699> a<00:06:35.729> Pepsi<00:06:36.059> redone<00:06:36.869> so

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
in 2009 it was like a Pepsi redone so

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.819 
in 2009 it was like a Pepsi redone so
they<00:06:37.889> added<00:06:38.069> some<00:06:38.549> Cola<00:06:38.759> in<00:06:39.119> it<00:06:39.299> also<00:06:40.110> it<00:06:40.679> can

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:40.829 
they added some Cola in it also it can
