waiting while we're waiting

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.940 
waiting while we're waiting
why<00:01:37.900> don't<00:01:38.170> we<00:01:38.260> see<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:39.390> different<00:01:40.390> outcome<00:01:40.950> and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
a day to just penetrate that surface

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.310
