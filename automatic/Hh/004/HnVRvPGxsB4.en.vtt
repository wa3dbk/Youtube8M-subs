00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.950
 today we make tours of the workshop 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:16.279
 for making cages for horseshoes for 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.090
 birds and sopatke cages do strings 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.300
 wooden panties 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:27.210
 twigs of any diameter of any 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.949
 wood place wire that cage all 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.369
 made 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:35.309
 patchwork trees 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.530
 hinged stationary look and rushed 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.719
 birds 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.489
 but most importantly I want to demonstrate 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.910
 then it becomes that made 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.320
 universal for making a chick plan 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.489
 over the patch cells to drill 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.230
 well and skillfully 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:59.520
 demonstrate how to make a resume 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.820
 engine and then stellar ranging from 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.650
 Spring waits from 22 in diameter to four with 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.750
 by half 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.750
 you need this whole thing a template is made 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.280
 starting the smallest virgin mother two with 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:21.420
 half the hole spacing 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:27.789
 12 millimeters and such 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:31.659
 3 hole diameter 3 and a half 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:36.009
 millimeter 4 and 4s half knowing too 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.770
 goes to a larger bird to 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:49.380
 the distance between the twigs was bigger 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:49.380
 naturally what is the job 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:07.520
 I put the pattern we put the girl we take very 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.520
 quickly convenient and reliable 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.819
 but 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.400
 few seconds and a hole in there 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.710
 well 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:36.390
 the distance and diameter from 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:40.530
 No need to mark the test 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:48.940
 maintains the distance between the holes 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:52.410
 fast sails and comfortable so advise 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:57.120
 who does this cooking 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:01.960
 much easier and time and work and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.490
 quality increase luck to those who 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.490
 engaged in this business
