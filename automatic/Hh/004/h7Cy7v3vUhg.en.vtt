 corsa there are four virginities video 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.060
 diverge in principle standard can 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.810
 believed honestly right now I just 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.030
 believe in the know 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.680
 but it will be one of the phenomenal 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.930
 kombik season if they can now 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.909

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.580
 corsa 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.950
 but legendary already subsided not very 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.570
 a good start for the corsa team but they 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.490
 just pulled harder and tore 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.740
 twice went to see otvetka good distance 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.930
 Damage at what the focus is good and tsd and I 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.460
 I lost my aunt on the course why fks not 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.799
 clear all this attack team 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.509
 core scanned in the center but shells 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.829
 uggs play still gets gets or 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.100
 more nor more 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.130
 they fire at each other 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.619
 different positions further minus all night 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.840
 trips to the ut-1 bull take the virginity 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.950
 and the situation is already five by four for 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.110
 weplay commands 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.210
 and yet they should now 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.030
 Add your opponents hands and go to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.369
 tomorrow's match against nascar but from the forest 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.140
 entering a break through 1 gets the second not 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.549
 gets a tubist miss not at all 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.040

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.869
 promo code course just me guys 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.450
 shooting problems all legendary 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.580
 when armor 99 virtus is skinny fully but he 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.490
 again one in the field is not a warrior and 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.590
 both he takes archer i remains virtus 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.310
 legendary and fort three posts not tank 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.530
 corsa teams it seems to me that there is no 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.300
 should 69 like that go out in the center they 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.820
 must go out on the right side and they 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.100
 not that they did not leave this 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.320
 There are gloves and the team left but not 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.480
 left and such a back and forth to operate 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.720
 us behind the center of this hill are four tanks 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.940
 give the 9 right of the old retiarium caught 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.560
 there are 1 to 2 devyanostika's all wrong 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.300
 more and more google commands and looked in 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.190
 center cards for shouldn't have to doctor 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.400
 tires left and right 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.110
 not giving a chance to a number 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.060
 and bullet there in one another you get 3 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.040
 I get there that is really easy was 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.290
 just lost all the odds of the course on 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.550
 flat place here honestly fellow experienced 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.959
 Well-ka telly apparently nonstandard 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.220
 disperse he was there all the enemy and 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.770
 pivoting towers needed to be rotated 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.070
 left right and all pile together 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.630
 get in the way of shooting letâ€™s come out 2 69 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.030
 right there virginity wouldn't let go 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.610
 just 1 well, and this often happens and 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.320
 a score of 69 usually takes the first tank 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.420
 if you attack from the top base fight 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.600
 from nine are usually those 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.730
 successful start of the battle and maps for the team 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.070
 well good game thanks for the fight 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.630

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.540
 lan-finals at home in 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.060
 Minsk to participate in the season finale but 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.400
 for this you will need to beat tomorrow 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.560
 tt nashorna command which is clearly 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.570
 preparing for his next lan-final 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.170
