00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:21.110
 through the door to door but nobody 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.540
 This is how José's latest work sounds 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.520
 I merced my only key a very disc 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.150

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.490
 disk my only key is a disk 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.410
 flamenquísimo an album as my 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.540
 father to rest more settled 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.840
 maybe with more tradition 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.340
 but without a doubt it is a disc of the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.120
 era of which we are living in the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.120
 21st century 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.440
 the idea came from the lettrist producer and 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.940
 singer javier limon who knew me 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.159

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.530
 had the opportunity to work though 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.750
 pretends to be a party disco in there 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.730
 also a sentimental pinch with a 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.589
 theme composed by Alejandro Sanz in 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.330
 I remember moraito chico 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.630

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.750
 years deceased in 2011 the being of less than 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.750
 purple always institute it of course 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.939
 I am often on stage 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.070
 I'm singing a fuss to your son but not 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.380
 Find your son and they go, I think 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.049
 is with me on stage many 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.530
 Sometimes there are some touches that your child 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.630
 he does things and neither I'm in 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.479

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.700
 the son looks at me and smiles because he knows 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.860
 I'm pulling his father 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.740
 asked about the mercè disc title 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.920
 he has it clear his only key is his voice 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.170
 her throat because at 57 she has not 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.679
 known another job more than his passion 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.679
 for the music 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.790
 my love from nobody 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.790
 through the door to door but not 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.330
 the door to door but nothing 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.850
