00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
but I not statistically but if you

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.119 
but I not statistically but if you
actually<00:05:02.719> watch<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.349> 40<00:05:03.620> minutes<00:05:03.860> that<00:05:03.979> went

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:04.129 
actually watch the 40 minutes that went

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:06.159 
actually watch the 40 minutes that went
by<00:05:04.219> so<00:05:04.430> far<00:05:04.669> I'd<00:05:05.060> say<00:05:05.090> we're<00:05:05.509> dominating<00:05:05.690> them

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169
