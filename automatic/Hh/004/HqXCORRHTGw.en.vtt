pressure-wise did that sort of knock you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.610 
pressure-wise did that sort of knock you
a<00:00:35.280> little<00:00:35.670> bit<00:00:35.820> off<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.260> or<00:00:37.380> did<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
a little bit off out of it or did you

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.619 
a little bit off out of it or did you
expect<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.070> she<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.090> too<00:00:39.300> good<00:00:39.450> with

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
expect that she was just too good with

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.369 
expect that she was just too good with
her<00:00:39.719> um<00:00:40.100> no<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.129> mean<00:00:41.280> yeah<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:42.140> was<00:00:43.140> something

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
her um no I mean yeah that was something

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.500 
her um no I mean yeah that was something
that<00:00:43.530> works<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.070> well<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.640> her<00:00:44.989> coming<00:00:45.989> in

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
that works really well for her coming in

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.209 
that works really well for her coming in
so<00:00:48.510> yeah<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.620> effective

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so yeah I think that that was effective

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.770 
so yeah I think that that was effective
she<00:00:50.940> used<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.270> effectively<00:00:51.690> today<00:00:53.480> we<00:00:54.480> look

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
she used it effectively today we look

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.490 
she used it effectively today we look
back<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:56.730> know<00:00:56.820> maybe<00:00:57.210> two<00:00:57.930> weeks<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.320> now

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
back you know maybe two weeks from now

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.099 
back you know maybe two weeks from now
or<00:00:58.739> after<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.160> immediacy<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.059> law<00:01:00.239> kind

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
or after the immediacy of the law kind

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.139 
or after the immediacy of the law kind
of<00:01:01.230> dissipate<00:01:01.680> what<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.699> think<00:01:03.000> you're

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
of dissipate what do you think you're

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.800 
of dissipate what do you think you're
going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> take<00:01:03.570> away<00:01:03.840> from<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.680> experience

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
going to take away from the experience

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.270 
going to take away from the experience
yeah<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.049> shiny<00:01:07.260> Anna<00:01:07.470> had<00:01:07.680> two<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.100> good

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
yeah for shiny Anna had two really good

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.090 
yeah for shiny Anna had two really good
wins<00:01:08.520> my<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:09.119> two<00:01:09.390> matches<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.890> one

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
wins my first two matches and this one

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.289 
wins my first two matches and this one
was<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:12.000> disappointing<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:14.030> yeah<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.119> think

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
was it's disappointing but yeah I think

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.020 
was it's disappointing but yeah I think
I<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.380> kind<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.070> take<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
I just kind of have to take the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.179 
I just kind of have to take the
positives<00:01:18.540> from<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.110> keep<00:01:19.619> working<00:01:19.770> hard

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
positives from it and keep working hard

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.660 
positives from it and keep working hard
and<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.780> yeah<00:01:21.780> keep<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.340> do<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.430> think

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and and yeah keep going do you think

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.700 
and and yeah keep going do you think
you'll<00:01:23.880> take<00:01:24.840> away<00:01:25.049> any<00:01:25.229> memories<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.530> how

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you'll take away any memories of how

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.880 
you'll take away any memories of how
exciting<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> was<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.729> play<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.180> ash<00:01:27.479> or<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
exciting it was like play on ash or the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.050 
exciting it was like play on ash or the
you<00:01:29.189> know<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.460> feeling<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.909> have

if I had one it would have been for all
and<00:02:46.130> who<00:02:47.060> knows<00:02:47.209> what<00:02:47.420> could<00:02:47.510> have<00:02:47.630> happened

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
and who knows what could have happened

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
do you think that was um I think she was

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.860 
do you think that was um I think she was
playing<00:03:02.269> well<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:04.239> just<00:03:05.239> see<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:05.570> just

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
playing well and I just see I just

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.820 
playing well and I just see I just
sometimes<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.680> just<00:03:06.830> don't<00:03:08.769> feel<00:03:09.769> like

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
sometimes you just don't feel like

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.350 
sometimes you just don't feel like
you're<00:03:10.100> playing<00:03:10.310> your<00:03:10.459> best<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.940> the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
you're playing your best and the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.820 
you're playing your best and the
opponent's<00:03:11.780> playing<00:03:11.989> well<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.440> it's<00:03:12.560> hard<00:03:12.769> to

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
opponent's playing well so it's hard to

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.759 
opponent's playing well so it's hard to
to<00:03:13.760> get<00:03:13.910> it<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.239> balance<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.810> on<00:03:14.989> did<00:03:15.650> you

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
to get it to the balance you on did you

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.350 
to get it to the balance you on did you
have<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.400> do<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:16.730> anything<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.269> would

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
have to do to have anything you would

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.000 
have to do to have anything you would

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
play you know the show cord and having

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.400 
play you know the show cord and having
you<00:03:19.820> know<00:03:19.940> all<00:03:20.150> those<00:03:20.360> things<00:03:20.420> around<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:21.200> I

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
it'll help me though in the long run

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.870 
it'll help me though in the long run
tough<00:03:30.920> loss
