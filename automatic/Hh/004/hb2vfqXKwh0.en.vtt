00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:15.308
From Denmark? it's from Romania.

00:00:15.308 --> 00:00:17.023
Open it.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:27.055
Meze is a maker of headphones in Denmark.
They sent me this. Meze 11 Classics.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.440
Headphone with microphone. and with porch.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.803
The porch.

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:39.227
Inner ear type headphone.
The parts made by wood?

00:00:39.227 --> 00:00:41.877
It's luxury.

00:00:41.877 --> 00:00:46.943
Today I want to do some test by my interesting.

00:00:46.943 --> 00:00:52.952
I have really care about the volume of headphone in public space.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:59.393
I've seen some people who use the headphone with megavolume.
Some people were adult people.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:03.500
I'm so sad, you know.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.737
Really need that megavolume?

00:01:06.737 --> 00:01:09.337
Today I'm using the Meze 11 Classics...

00:01:06.737 --> 00:01:09.845
Today I'm using the Meze 11 Classics...

00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:14.298
Apple iPhone 4S's headphone, and...

00:01:14.298 --> 00:01:18.114
Inner ear type headphone by 100 yen shop.

00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:23.723
I'll do the test of the leak out volume by these three headphones.

00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:28.826
I'll fix the level of the video camera microphone.

00:01:28.826 --> 00:01:30.127
Do now.

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:32.689
I fixed it.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.132
The camera is Canon iVIS HF G10.
The mic level is 45.

00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:44.310
You know, the human's ear is so sensitive.
It's a easy criterion of this test.

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:47.180
The first test, 100 yen headphone.

00:01:47.177 --> 00:01:50.370
The volume is half.

00:01:53.143 --> 00:01:55.440
No problem.

00:01:55.438 --> 00:01:59.370
The volume of full.

00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:15.250
It's 100yen headphone. Sound is so bad.
So broken sound.

00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:20.130
No force to low sound. So stiff sound.

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.270
Actually it's only 100 yen!

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:24.420
It's good and so cheap.

00:02:24.424 --> 00:02:28.450
The next is Apple iPhone's headphone.

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.630
It's not inner ear type.

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.900
The volume is half.

00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:48.530
The sound is pretty good.
It's a difference of headphone.

00:02:48.532 --> 00:02:51.870
Exactly the difference of cost.

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:54.030
The drums sound is clear.

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:58.640
Now the volume is full.
Oh so noisy!

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.420
Noisy.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.510
Not good. It's not good.

00:03:07.973 --> 00:03:09.630
So noisy. No!

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.830
How about the leak sound?

00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:15.830
The next is Meze's headphone.

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:18.210
The volume is half.

00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:23.680
Good sound.

00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:27.680
Oh great sound. So different.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.530
The low sound is better than this.

00:03:30.532 --> 00:03:33.690
Are there the leak sound?

00:03:33.694 --> 00:03:39.840
Apple's headphone was good.
But the Meze's is pretty high quality sound.

00:03:39.835 --> 00:03:42.950
Let full volume.

00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:50.900
It's so loud.

00:03:50.854 --> 00:03:57.100
But I could to hear by the full volume than this.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:06.430
How do you feel?
These two is inner ear type.

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:08.990
I think the sound is not easy to leak.

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.420
I felt the pain at the full volume by the Apple's headphone.

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:18.060
The Meze is better at full volume than Apple's.

00:04:18.064 --> 00:04:22.000
The music is best to hear by the moderate volume.

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:23.880
Finish the test.

00:04:23.877 --> 00:04:29.160
Let have moderation to the volume at public space.
Young people, I hope you'll become good adult.

00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:33.510
The adult people, You should be a norm of young people.
Don't forget. Bye-bye!

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:38.050
Now I'm using Meze 11 Classics at the street.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:49.430
The cord is covered with fiber cloth. So luxury.

00:04:49.428 --> 00:04:55.900
But I feel directly the noise on ear from this cloth line.

00:04:55.901 --> 00:05:03.189
The cord be hit somewhere on body by walking.
The hit noise coming to my ear.

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.160
Like this. Touch the cord.

00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:10.150
The noise "GON! GON! GON!" coming.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.940
It's not good to use by walking.
I don't guess so.

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:21.700
Sound is pretty good but... I'll never use by walking.
