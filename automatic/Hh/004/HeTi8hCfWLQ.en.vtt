00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.390
 ah 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.960
 hello we will all do 1991 and it looks good 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.820
 be that this map will look very good and is 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.650
 curious because I do not like it at all 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.939
 played but for nothing or search and 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.619
 destroy or in any other way I 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.810
 always the votes I prefer to avoid it 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.730
 either the way that is but reviewing 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.779
 the games because I have guards in 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.489
 my computer I have seen that I have a 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.649
 lots of good rounds here in search 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.810
 destroy and even already design a full 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.130
 team of 6 not in a previous video like that 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.750
 what good have I decided to create a 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.910
 video with rolls exclusively here in 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.250
 arcade and extracted by those who have most 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.510
 liked and good in this case you are 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.310
 seeing that they have given me assistance for a 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.740
 enemy not here then it 's failed a little 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.210
 with this I left him and dazed and I just 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.890
 to be alone against the five enemies 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.480
 remaining a quite situation 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.770
 complicated because they have seen me but 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.050
 here we are not told, it wins me, we throw ourselves 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.360
 two then come 2 - this one I miss a 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.800
 little life another one less leaves me the red 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.260
 but nothing happens because I even get 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.299
 well to kill another one more and very good 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.490
 15 seconds here that I have reduced to the 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.920
 living beings not from 5 to 1 I liked 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.270
 very much and now it's me who 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.009
 has the advantage I could not see that I have 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.390
 one uvi and precisely the same as 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.829
 It is here next but from 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.590
 here these rounds for a long time 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.549
 weather 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.619
 I'm totally honest I did not like it 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.609
 nothing like carry on from here 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.579
 the round and I think he had a little bit of 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.020
 luck for getting it completed not 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.759
 because I think that now I would return it 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.439
 to play let's go I want to believe that not the 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.469
 would play for anything the same because he can not 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.149
 be that having a vee do not kill it 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.920
 come on, if you're going to see how 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.179
 I did not take advantage then I go little by little 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.590
 checking if it is getting closer and such 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.329
 but missed the whole advantage of the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.250
 You see that the whole vee now happens 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.350
 the only one that got is to touch it not with 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.030
 the grenade and that the guy knows I'm 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.740
 around here he almost certainly knows I'm 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.270
 over here so that good and 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.679
 totally wasted after that 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.259
 I say that I did not like anything like taken 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.489
 the final part of the round not in this 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.750
 case then nothing checks if it has 

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.780
 I've been running but nothing has been 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.979
 escaped that is that the issue is even worse 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.719
 so good decided to see and I guess 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.950
 if it came from behind, not if it had 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.239
 realized that he had thrown the pilla 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.520
 from here I came from behind but 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:10.329
 neither and time is running out 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.799
 I do not advise you never to leave is to say 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.120
 never leave until the end place a 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.060
 pump not because if you leave it for the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.110
 last 15 seconds is when the enemy 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.370
 surely go to look at bombs and about 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.010
 all if they are so stuck with a map 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.080
 like this one can not get there very fast 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.329
 to surely kill you is from here not so 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.620
 If I had been truthfully little massage 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.150
 the enemy would have hunted me here 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.849
 placing but nothing leaves me five 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.799
 seconds he placed it and I'm going to 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.480
 here did not make the bomb that either 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.010
 I like it too much on your site 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.010
 but good is also not bad at all 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.599
 ok and nothing because I do not know if I heard it or 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.790
 do not leave but I'm going right here 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.459
 when he comes and they killed him that I like 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.870
 it's not I'm killed to 5 only that's why it's 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.310
 I bring but now that I 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.409
 they will like it much better this round 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.060
 I love vouchers this is a round that 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.500
 as for country you are going to lose it 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.209
 this is faster than formula 1 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.709
 because he decided to go up where almost 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.810
 always a lot of enemies I fly 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.980
 well in front of their noses not also 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.060
 With the help of the ub all you have to 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.129
 say it but good here you have to 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.420
 first he reacted fast to the second me 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.400
 is looking for the third there was no 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.959
 even look for me for the third come 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.180
 I want more and there is another one above 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.590
 take and liquid to the fourth 4000 hits 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.299
 with double up liquid to all 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.920
 that went up and now I'm going to look for the 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.379
 two others that were down there I already have 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.340
 I've caught the fifth one does not give you the 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.659
 I do not give pineapple but it comes out and I kill it 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.950
 I say uncle the project to hunt an uncle 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.049
 but I had the good luck that I was at 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.220
 side could have killed the last one there and 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.860
 I stayed with the project 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.840
 style fire unwrapped by another five 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.340
 enemies more than the most but good 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.020
 let's go with the last round that you 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.480
 I want to bring that it's a future I do not 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.770
 charge to 5 this that I charge the 6 not and 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.720
 beige that I'm playing because of the other 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.830
 side is not a side that is much more 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.420
 easy to play because obviously 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.640
 defend yep is easier because this one 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.170
 killed it seems to defend me if you get there 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.820
 to position it up so let's say that 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.490
 It is much easier and Competitive 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.680
 it is crucial not to take the areas above 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.150
 fast and there is a lot of fight but good 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.520
 here in public the people do not care 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.690
 so much and if you catch it up then well 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.500
 it's much easier since you see that I am now 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.420
 I the one with the advantage of 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.880
 position and come to load two no 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.440
 here then I decide to hold a little pint 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.720
 recover a little health and I passed the 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.790
 critical ahead the truth a little bit of 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.770
 luckily I could not foresee a little 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.110
 I could go around that's why I looked for the 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.610
 coverage but he had a bit of luck and 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.700
 now I 'm alone against three with 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.739
 the game is very easy killed this and nothing 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.750
 I do not have two here I try to move 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.400
 a little the challenges of a little bit because 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.840
 always after killing then dealing with 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.700
 look for another position that I do not know 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.230
 Exactly the same is more difficult for 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.390
 the enemies change position after 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.010
 kill but well here I see that they do not come 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.729
 they are not holding up enough or I do not know if 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.650
 will be 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.870
 thinking that I'm going up I say by 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.849
 that have gone up and now I'm going 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.710
 little by little and I'm going to go upstairs I'm going 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.689
 reach half behind as I will see 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.180
 if you see that I have seen one I have not 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.979
 seen the other no and well here is something 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.300
 pointing I do not have to do it and if I go 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.339
 for a franc is that the possible occasion 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.229
 that react faster than me and nothing 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:54.789
 I do not know where the fifth is the sixth 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.259
 I want to say and it is indeed there 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.969
 up and it 's amazing that I do not 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.610
 will kill for what I had to contribute 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.080
 of their noses but world I face it 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.460
 the sixth I think a pretty round 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.900
 good also and nothing I hope that I have 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.870
 liked kids 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.409
 it seems that arcades is good for me and 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.409
 until another
