to<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.340> everything<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.660> pretty

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
to have everything but I have pretty

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.970 
to have everything but I have pretty
much<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.980> norm<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.610> there<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:46.110> let's<00:00:46.800> let

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
much the norm out there so let's let

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.770 
much the norm out there so let's let
let's<00:00:47.370> let<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> remote<00:00:47.969> do<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> talking

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
let's let the remote do the talking

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.770 
let's let the remote do the talking
instead<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.010> remote<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.760> made<00:00:51.600> by

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
instead so this remote here is made by

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.110 
instead so this remote here is made by
an<00:00:51.960> acai<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.800> device<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.460> called<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.789> TV

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.820 
device will come up automatically with
all<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:51.640> buttons<00:05:51.820> already<00:05:52.539> there<00:05:52.690> very<00:05:53.500> cool

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
all the buttons already there very cool

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.909 
all the buttons already there very cool
but<00:05:55.680> aside<00:05:56.680> from<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:58.050> infrared<00:05:59.050> which<00:05:59.650> all

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
but aside from the infrared which all

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.610 
but aside from the infrared which all
these<00:06:00.010> remotes<00:06:00.340> are<00:06:00.460> infrared<00:06:01.020> so<00:06:02.020> any<00:06:02.200> remote

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
these remotes are infrared so any remote

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.860 
these remotes are infrared so any remote
basically<00:06:03.100> that<00:06:03.460> is<00:06:03.580> infrared<00:06:03.880> these<00:06:04.360> devices

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
basically that is infrared these devices

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.400 
basically that is infrared these devices
will<00:06:05.110> learn<00:06:05.340> them<00:06:06.340> this<00:06:07.120> device<00:06:07.479> I<00:06:07.810> want<00:06:08.320> to

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
will learn them this device I want to

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.230 
will learn them this device I want to
warn<00:06:08.650> you<00:06:08.740> is<00:06:09.039> no<00:06:09.520> longer<00:06:10.440> available

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
warn you is no longer available

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.060 
warn you is no longer available
however<00:06:13.240> this<00:06:14.080> device<00:06:14.380> does<00:06:14.680> not<00:06:14.890> only

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
however this device does not only

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.740 
however this device does not only
infrared<00:06:16.110> but<00:06:17.110> it<00:06:17.200> does<00:06:17.350> Wi-Fi<00:06:18.510> it's<00:06:19.510> part<00:06:19.720> of

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
infrared but it does Wi-Fi it's part of

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.960 
infrared but it does Wi-Fi it's part of
my<00:06:19.840> network<00:06:20.130> so<00:06:21.130> if<00:06:21.280> I'm<00:06:21.430> playing<00:06:21.669> something

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
my network so if I'm playing something

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.420 
my network so if I'm playing something
on<00:06:22.210> Windows<00:06:22.510> Media<00:06:22.690> Player<00:06:22.840> 11<00:06:23.260> and<00:06:23.860> above<00:06:24.190> I

say that again Windows Media Player 11
and<00:06:26.740> above<00:06:27.010> this<00:06:28.000> device<00:06:28.390> not<00:06:28.930> only<00:06:28.960> can

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
and above this device not only can

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.470 
and above this device not only can
into<00:06:30.250> it<00:06:30.340> right<00:06:30.520> on<00:06:30.640> a<00:06:30.670> device<00:06:30.940> yes<00:06:31.210> it<00:06:31.360> has

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
into it right on a device yes it has

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.980 
into it right on a device yes it has
speakers<00:06:31.830> but<00:06:32.830> it<00:06:33.100> also<00:06:33.490> controls<00:06:34.330> Windows

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
speakers but it also controls Windows

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.280 
speakers but it also controls Windows
Media<00:06:35.170> Player<00:06:35.610> right<00:06:36.610> here<00:06:36.910> so<00:06:37.360> as<00:06:37.630> you<00:06:38.140> know

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
Media Player right here so as you know

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.400 
Media Player right here so as you know
infrared<00:06:39.130> I<00:06:39.600> can't<00:06:40.600> go<00:06:40.720> through<00:06:40.870> walls<00:06:41.140> with

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
infrared I can't go through walls with

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.010 
infrared I can't go through walls with
this<00:06:41.530> so<00:06:41.800> if<00:06:42.100> this<00:06:42.460> computer<00:06:42.700> was<00:06:43.060> in<00:06:43.180> a<00:06:43.210> TV<00:06:43.870> was

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
this so if this computer was in a TV was

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.990 
this so if this computer was in a TV was
in<00:06:44.110> another<00:06:44.350> room<00:06:44.590> I<00:06:44.860> couldn't<00:06:45.370> control<00:06:45.670> it

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
in another room I couldn't control it

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.150 
in another room I couldn't control it
but<00:06:46.210> with<00:06:48.270> Wi-Fi<00:06:49.270> I<00:06:49.570> can<00:06:50.290> control<00:06:50.620> the<00:06:50.830> device

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 
but with Wi-Fi I can control the device

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.190 
but with Wi-Fi I can control the device
in<00:06:51.400> another<00:06:51.640> room<00:06:51.880> or<00:06:52.090> location<00:06:52.570> at<00:06:52.660> a<00:06:52.720> home<00:06:52.900> I

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
in another room or location at a home I

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.230 
in another room or location at a home I
thought<00:06:53.860> that<00:06:54.070> was<00:06:54.160> really<00:06:54.310> cool<00:06:54.580> so<00:06:55.090> yeah

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
thought that was really cool so yeah

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.060 
thought that was really cool so yeah
