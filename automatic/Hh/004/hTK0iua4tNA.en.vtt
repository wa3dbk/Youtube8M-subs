side teeth have cleaning deficits this

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:34.510 
side teeth have cleaning deficits this
is<00:05:32.089> not<00:05:32.330> without<00:05:32.539> consequence<00:05:33.289> hidden<00:05:34.219> layers

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
is not without consequence hidden layers

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.279 
is not without consequence hidden layers
especially<00:05:35.330> in<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.509> gaps<00:05:35.719> between<00:05:35.870> teeth

especially in the gaps between teeth
later<00:05:37.009> lead<00:05:37.309> to<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.669> destruction<00:05:37.819> of<00:05:38.330> enamel

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:38.779

periodontists<00:05:42.339> this<00:05:43.339> is<00:05:43.520> why<00:05:43.699> we<00:05:43.969> get

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:44.089 
periodontists this is why we get

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:46.899 
periodontists this is why we get
