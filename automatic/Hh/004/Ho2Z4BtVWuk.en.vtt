00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.540
 well i am renovating 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.670
 and now I've been there a few times 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.410
 required 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.210
 and of course I want that cheap 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.089
 possibly the mouth year for which must 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.619
 durable that it can be cheap I have 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.119
 never made small and coincidence 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 wish we were going to drill that had a whole 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.600
 being close likes good and I could go for it 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.800
 take nothing it was all one 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.070
 little racks are old what yes what 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.489
 what was rejected and here you see 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.250
 for example why put here 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.850
 for example, show a bar in between 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.260
 which one is also trying this for example 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.260
 there's a good one there 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.949
 sheep no about a milling defects 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.320
 they are simply wrong from the mill 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.719
 shot and yes then you get this kind 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.289
 frills 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.589
 or sometimes there is a dent in it or just now 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.330
 whatever this wood have knees 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.659
 for nothing 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.310
 the village itself year what kind of type 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.600
 wood you actually have a where do you need 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.270
 well pay attention and 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.650
 what problems do you encounter and then 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.060
 actually shows that there are many 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:27.040
 standard wood is on the market and there 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.500
 a meranti also different 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.410
 quality differences say yes then 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.630
 of course you come across 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.360
 and for example if you have meranti frames 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.180
 wood picks there is also quite a bit 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.040
 mahogany we are old for 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.470
 and that is usually a lot 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.470
 constant quality but 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.840
 for example, this bar that is located here 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.910
 it is a bit darker in color 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.930
 and that is also much heavier than 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.150
 for example these lights that you have here 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.240
 and he knows almost nothing 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.700
 and in that number it doesn't make it that whole 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.160
 very much out but in the quality and 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.050
 the weight 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.640
 how heavy that and balls of meranti 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.160
 for better quality than you can 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.760
 actually a bit stuffy and go 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.800
 that is also a bit the difference 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.830
 quality also with rotting and so or with 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.380
 mold or whatever you put on the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.570
 getting expensive in out is actually best 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.850
 man yes for that quality that dark 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.430
 quality as much as possible 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.290
 but yes sometimes they are already painted 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.019
 and then it's very hard to get that there 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.769
 to determine from which 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.269
 meranti quality budget well but I am 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.760
 the more behind 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.760
 First is for the window frames you have 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.850
 three different frame profiles and 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.260
 those are the following 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.600
 I just recorded here 4 the left 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.910
 that she put her on the so-called 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.130
 str'en that use for the top bar 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:13.220
 and the sidebars then you have a b 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.230
 beam that is the in-between set that use 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.230
 just for windows for example here 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.200
 in that drawing you have this is the on 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.680
 couple couple 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.329
 b-style recovery and have below and 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.970
 that 's the c-style 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.500
 that is sill the also runs one 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.750
 little bit as you can see with 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.909
 10 degrees 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.200
 the piece so 10 degrees 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:41.329
 and so you can so the water is good 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.250
 walk straight sometimes there is such a thing here 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.110
 notches 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.450
 but you don't necessarily have to do that here 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.840
 for example also runs under beat 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.090
 and then you can here so you can over here 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.769
 luck the brick or a heart 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.769
 aftimmering or whatever run 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:05.989
 this is really under the bottom 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:08.030
 because of this it seems yes where am I 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.510
 find out more 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.099
 You also have the window frames again 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.549
 if you are going to be making then you make it 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.120
 it always following these you let your 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.100
 run through 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.049
 So to extinguish it through to shock 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.520
 in chassis just go straight to it 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.560
 you don't really care about that 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.360
 sorry business number that shortens you only 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.660
 but finished 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.990
 something that often occurs with meranti 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.539
 that the loot piece so here for example 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.270
 this is a business man I will enter later on 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:41.090
 the following video know how far that is here 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.639
 a bit of what was lubricated on and on 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.050
 That is to dry out and tear up 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.580
 the short end also not yes what a 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.070
 to become less or at least 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.990
 reduce the chance of it but usually 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.820
 for you that piece of hair matters there 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.300
 first off so here you start business 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:03.220
 to a piece immediately that again now 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.720
 about the ball account 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:11.720
 so you have the upper sill here 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:18.770
 sill she drips or sill 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:21.840
 said set a least lhd profile here 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.370
 a super big one 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.740
 I have one more time below 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.400
 drawn 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.040
 this to profile on t profile and 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.540
 c-profile i have here such a small one 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.840
 cut out a bit then you can also see 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.440
 This is the fits options beautiful 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.889
 this is a b profile and this is a c 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.139
 profile 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.680
 you can actually find any frame there 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.680
 experience it 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.750
 and why is this why this shows you this 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.460
 always walk this way and this one 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.979
 Well first of all it's easier to 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:04.040
 for example the spacers 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:04.040
 to be able to saw it in one go 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.979
 so you just need the bill 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.450
 keep in mind the height of this and the 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.729
 profiles of these 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.840
 and no more with this that is a one 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:15.150
 benefit 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:21.720
 So the two is another side here 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:24.930
 so that ass show is lying here 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.060
 a notch and here is the 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.479
 drainage them edge in or sometimes it here 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.550
 also looked so small in shades once and 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.800
 the red examples of that is later 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.850
 always easy to leave and you do 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.479
 then no more in that 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.620
 vertical pieces to cut or whatever 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:42.360
 also 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.770
 This is simply the best finish to it 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.990
 bottom 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.910
 yes and then you just keep your top profile 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.370
 of course keep it that way because yes 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.979
 why would you do otherwise 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.970
 and a third benefit is if you go on 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.970
 gentlemen and this one 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.220
 shortages have forty-eight that never 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.789
 oh you can always use it for the 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.389
 someone's mistake is like that 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.630
 made 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:09.320
 And well that 's really the problem 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.780
 with this man this is extremely beautiful 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.979
 pretty expensive we just got one 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.270
 how after viewing began 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:17.580
 precious 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:20.460
 with a raper filorga you go the other way around 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:24.539
 to do then you do the vertical you 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.760
 I take it as my length and it costs 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:28.010
 you just wonder and the 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.120
 want profiles that try the in between 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.140
 to get 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.140
 but more about that later 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:40.520
 I now I will well on the 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:42.200
 sit down on a tripod and I will say yes 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.490
 tell more about how you are not 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.490
 matters to which dave should pay attention 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.500
 showering 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.500
 to the next video
