00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
working that it was turning into a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.080 
working that it was turning into a
phenomenon<00:02:39.160> with<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.490> public

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090

much of that went to effect it was it

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.940 
much of that went to effect it was it
wasn't<00:02:44.800> really<00:02:44.950> until<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.190> came<00:02:45.400> out<00:02:46.950> whatever

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950
