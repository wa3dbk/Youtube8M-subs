00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
this car because of the branding and

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.580 
this car because of the branding and
they<00:02:18.940> make<00:02:19.150> four<00:02:19.810> cars<00:02:20.079> right<00:02:20.290> now<00:02:20.319> in<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590

they make four cars right now in the
series<00:02:20.829> would<00:02:21.010> probably<00:02:21.459> have<00:02:21.640> more<00:02:21.849> out

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
series would probably have more out

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.610 
series would probably have more out
there<00:02:22.209> so<00:02:22.450> if<00:02:22.540> Dale<00:02:22.720> Earnhardt<00:02:23.170> jr.<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.590> not

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
there so if Dale Earnhardt jr. is not

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.990 
there so if Dale Earnhardt jr. is not
your<00:02:23.890> driver<00:02:24.069> you<00:02:24.370> can<00:02:24.400> pick<00:02:24.670> one<00:02:24.849> of<00:02:24.940> the
