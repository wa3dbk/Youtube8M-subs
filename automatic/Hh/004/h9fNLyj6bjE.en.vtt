00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
one age saw a quick glimpse of it then

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.179 
one age saw a quick glimpse of it then
was<00:00:28.199> 100<00:00:29.160> blocks<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:30.289> this<00:00:31.289> one<00:00:31.560> at<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
was 100 blocks to this one at the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.900 
was 100 blocks to this one at the
longest<00:00:32.669> points<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.440> 200<00:00:34.440> blocks<00:00:34.800> wide<00:00:35.250> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
longest points is 200 blocks wide and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.319 
longest points is 200 blocks wide and
about<00:00:36.329> 100<00:00:36.899> blocks<00:00:37.110> tool<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:38.190> big<00:00:38.579> Pixlr

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
about 100 blocks tool it's a big Pixlr

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.049 
about 100 blocks tool it's a big Pixlr
and<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.920> probably<00:00:41.100> read<00:00:41.370> from<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> title

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and as you probably read from the title

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.000 
and as you probably read from the title
already<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:43.430> shelby<00:00:45.020> gt500<00:00:46.020> which<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
already it is a shelby gt500 which is a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.610 
already it is a shelby gt500 which is a
really<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.730> nice<00:00:47.910> guy<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.690> blue<00:00:49.230> one

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
really really nice guy it's a blue one

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.950 
really really nice guy it's a blue one
so<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.850> figured<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> way<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
so we figured out the way on here the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.049 
so we figured out the way on here the
wheel<00:00:52.140> was<00:00:52.350> probably<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.100> hut<00:00:53.399> probably

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
wheel was probably the hut probably

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.360 
wheel was probably the hut probably
probably<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.379> hardest<00:00:55.800> part<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> whole

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
probably the hardest part of the whole

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.080 
probably the hardest part of the whole
bill<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.329> took<00:00:57.600> ages<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.760> build

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
bill that took ages to do this build

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.180 
bill that took ages to do this build
from<00:01:00.449> start<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.960> finish<00:01:01.350> her<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.859> once

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
from start to finish her that in once

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.450 
from start to finish her that in once
did<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:03.149> took<00:01:03.329> me<00:01:03.449> four<00:01:03.719> hours<00:01:03.769> 57<00:01:04.769> minutes<00:01:04.949> so

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
did it took me four hours 57 minutes so

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.830 
did it took me four hours 57 minutes so
a<00:01:05.810> five-hour<00:01:06.810> pixel<00:01:07.650> art<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.570> like<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.720> all

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
a five-hour pixel art and like that all

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.920 
a five-hour pixel art and like that all
in<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.909> my<00:01:11.909> legs<00:01:12.210> ached<00:01:12.450> after<00:01:12.750> that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
in one go and my legs ached after that

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
in one go and my legs ached after that
time<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.439> laptop<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.159> my<00:01:14.189> lap<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.640> most<00:01:14.790> of

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
time they laptop on my lap for most of

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.249 
time they laptop on my lap for most of
it<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.869> off<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.500> picture<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:18.110> finishing<00:01:19.110> off

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
it going off a picture so finishing off

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.330 
it going off a picture so finishing off
the<00:01:19.380> wheel<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.560> wheel<00:01:19.680> turned<00:01:20.040> out<00:01:20.189> really

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the wheel the wheel turned out really

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.060 
the wheel the wheel turned out really
nice<00:01:20.549> after<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.939> had<00:01:21.060> figured<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:22.070> putting

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
nice after I had figured it out putting

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.840 
nice after I had figured it out putting
down<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> skirting<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.430> bit<00:01:26.430> more<00:01:26.610> skirt

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
down the skirting to the bit more skirt

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
down the skirting to the bit more skirt
and<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.540> starting<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> other<00:01:28.140> wheel<00:01:28.350> now

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and then starting on the other wheel now

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.190 
and then starting on the other wheel now
the<00:01:29.189> wheel<00:01:29.430> looks<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> very<00:01:29.820> dodgy<00:01:30.450> shape<00:01:30.930> at

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the wheel looks a very dodgy shape at

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.670 
the wheel looks a very dodgy shape at
the<00:01:31.229> start<00:01:31.729> it's<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:33.720> even<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.350> wheel

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the start it's not even at all wheel

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.620 
the start it's not even at all wheel
shape<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.579> doesn't<00:01:35.820> eat<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.150> because

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
shape but it doesn't eat it up because

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.030 
shape but it doesn't eat it up because
you've<00:01:36.930> got<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> front<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.560> wheel<00:01:37.680> there

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
you've got the front of the wheel there

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.399 
you've got the front of the wheel there
and<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:39.060> really<00:01:39.540> enjoy<00:01:39.780> i'm<00:01:40.020> really<00:01:40.290> enjoying

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the next episode as well I found a

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.020 
the next episode as well I found a
really<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.350> nice<00:01:49.649> thing<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.549> want<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
really really nice thing that I want to

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.789 
really really nice thing that I want to
try<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.329> replicate<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.409> gonna<00:01:52.500> take<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
try and replicate but it's gonna take a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.260 
try and replicate but it's gonna take a
long<00:01:53.070> time<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.700> probably<00:01:53.939> gonna<00:01:54.060> take<00:01:54.149> about

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
long time it's probably gonna take about

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.149 
long time it's probably gonna take about
five<00:01:54.689> hours<00:01:54.720> at<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.740> same<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.820> building

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
five hours at the same as this building

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.730 
so yeah I was laughing that this blog is
200<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.630> build<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.930> 200<00:02:04.229> blocks<00:02:04.469> wide

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
200 that this build is 200 blocks wide

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.229 
200 that this build is 200 blocks wide
and<00:02:05.040> then<00:02:05.460> xbox<00:02:05.969> 360<00:02:06.719> map<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.530> only<00:02:08.239> 850

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
and then xbox 360 map is only 850

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.350 
and then xbox 360 map is only 850
something<00:02:09.690> blocks<00:02:09.989> wide<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:12.180> actually

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
something blocks wide so it actually

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.280 
something blocks wide so it actually
spans

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
spans

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.209 
spans
quarter<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.280> whole<00:02:14.579> map<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.829> which<00:02:16.829> is<00:02:17.010> it

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
quarter of the whole map and which is it

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.509 
quarter of the whole map and which is it
which<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.629> surprising<00:02:18.629> I<00:02:19.140> thought<00:02:19.829> Xbox<00:02:20.370> map

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
which is surprising I thought Xbox map

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.089 
which is surprising I thought Xbox map

most<00:05:26.820> expensive<00:05:27.470> minecraft<00:05:28.470> car<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:29.010> amount

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
most expensive minecraft car the amount

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.760
