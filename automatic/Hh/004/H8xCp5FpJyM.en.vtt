00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.719 
a lot mind more and I've been and I've
been<00:06:30.229> away<00:06:30.409> from<00:06:30.469> quite<00:06:30.860> a<00:06:30.889> lot<00:06:31.069> he's<00:06:31.610> a<00:06:31.639> good

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
been away from quite a lot he's a good

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.700 
been away from quite a lot he's a good
fire<00:06:32.060> and<00:06:32.240> I<00:06:32.270> think<00:06:32.479> a<00:06:32.569> little<00:06:32.930> bit<00:06:33.110> little<00:06:33.650> bit

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
fire and I think a little bit little bit

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.839 
fire and I think a little bit little bit
further<00:06:33.919> down<00:06:34.069> the<00:06:34.250> line<00:06:34.370> I<00:06:34.430> think<00:06:34.669> he<00:06:34.729> could

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
further down the line I think he could

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.119 
further down the line I think he could
take<00:06:35.030> it<00:06:35.270> but<00:06:35.810> I<00:06:35.900> think<00:06:35.930> right<00:06:36.259> now<00:06:36.500> hold<00:06:36.949> on<00:06:37.069> a

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.129 
take it but I think right now hold on a

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:39.339 
take it but I think right now hold on a
roll<00:06:37.400> now<00:06:37.430> I<00:06:37.789> know<00:06:38.569> it's<00:06:38.719> amateur<00:06:39.139> pro

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:39.349 
roll now I know it's amateur pro

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:40.659 
roll now I know it's amateur pro
difference<00:06:39.800> but<00:06:39.979> when<00:06:40.099> i<00:06:40.129> won<00:06:40.370> the<00:06:40.400> World

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
difference but when i won the World

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.969 
difference but when i won the World
amateurs<00:06:41.120> gave<00:06:41.840> me<00:06:42.050> different<00:06:42.259> spring<00:06:42.680> in<00:06:42.860> my

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 
amateurs gave me different spring in my

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.040 
amateurs gave me different spring in my
step<00:06:43.009> different<00:06:43.699> confidence<00:06:44.150> and<00:06:44.659> it<00:06:44.870> made<00:06:45.020> me

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
step different confidence and it made me

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.749 
step different confidence and it made me
a<00:06:45.229> better<00:06:45.349> fighter<00:06:45.800> so<00:06:46.099> I<00:06:46.159> think<00:06:46.219> did<00:06:46.520> it<00:06:46.550> same

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
a better fighter so I think did it same

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:50.230 
a better fighter so I think did it same
for<00:06:46.939> Hall<00:06:47.090> Pass<00:06:47.900> thinker<00:06:48.759> to<00:06:49.759> take<00:06:49.939> what<00:06:50.120> law

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
for Hall Pass thinker to take what law

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.399 
for Hall Pass thinker to take what law
right<00:06:50.360> after<00:06:50.659> that<00:06:50.810> I<00:06:50.960> think<00:06:51.199> they've<00:06:51.379> been

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:51.409 
right after that I think they've been

00:06:51.409 --> 00:07:01.650 
right after that I think they've been
trouble<00:06:51.919> both

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.720
