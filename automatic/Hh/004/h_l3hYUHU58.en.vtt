00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.840 
the water and we're in a bizarre
situation<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.520> into<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
situation because really going into the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.249 
situation because really going into the
second<00:01:51.210> leg<00:01:51.329> Madrid<00:01:51.720> shouldn't<00:01:51.960> even<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.200> in

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
second leg Madrid shouldn't even be in

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:52.570 
second leg Madrid shouldn't even be in
it

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.030 
it
from<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.240> 412<00:01:53.690> bar<00:01:53.960> sign<00:01:54.140> up<00:01:54.230> to<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.350> 32<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:54.860> 30

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
from the 412 bar sign up to the 32 in 30

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.340 
from the 412 bar sign up to the 32 in 30
seconds<00:01:55.550> barsana<00:01:56.270> I<00:01:56.540> think<00:01:56.930> completely

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
seconds barsana I think completely

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.450 
seconds barsana I think completely
dominate<00:01:57.680> image<00:01:57.860> in<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.040> first<00:01:58.190> game<00:01:58.280> so

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
dominate image in the first game so

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.190 
dominate image in the first game so
rigidly<00:01:58.970> if<00:01:59.150> you<00:01:59.270> like<00:01:59.390> being<00:01:59.600> kind<00:01:59.930> of<00:01:59.990> given

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
rigidly if you like being kind of given

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.350 
rigidly if you like being kind of given
a<00:02:00.230> second<00:02:00.560> chance<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.160> I<00:02:01.730> think<00:02:02.060> in<00:02:02.150> terms<00:02:02.270> of

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
a second chance and I think in terms of

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.820 
a second chance and I think in terms of
the<00:02:02.450> crisis<00:02:02.750> that's<00:02:02.870> quite<00:02:03.080> important<00:02:03.530> ok<00:02:03.800> I

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
the crisis that's quite important ok I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.380 
the crisis that's quite important ok I
think<00:02:04.100> we're<00:02:04.400> doing<00:02:04.550> something<00:02:04.670> wrong<00:02:05.150> we

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
think we're doing something wrong we

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.720 
think we're doing something wrong we
need<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.690> ask<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:06.050> lady<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:07.280> need<00:02:07.430> an<00:02:07.550> answer

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
need to ask the lady we need an answer

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.030 
need to ask the lady we need an answer
no<00:02:08.149> no<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.420> think<00:02:08.720> they're<00:02:09.140> psychologically

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
no no I think they're psychologically

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.950 
no no I think they're psychologically
that's<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.490> huge<00:02:11.120> part<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.720> plays

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
that's the huge part that it plays

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.170 
that's the huge part that it plays
whichever<00:02:12.530> team<00:02:12.770> wins<00:02:12.800> it's<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.910> huge

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
whichever team wins it's a huge

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.790 
whichever team wins it's a huge
psychological<00:02:14.900> blow<00:02:15.110> for<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.380> other<00:02:15.560> or<00:02:15.770> a

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
psychological blow for the other or a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.500 
psychological blow for the other or a
chance<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.280> say<00:02:16.490> okay<00:02:16.880> this<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.270> what<00:02:17.390> you're

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
chance to say okay this is what you're

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.390

untried<00:02:32.120> at<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.390> moment<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:32.810> it's<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.990> really

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
untried at the moment so it's a really

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.780 
untried at the moment so it's a really
exciting<00:02:33.770> season<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.280> could<00:02:34.459> be<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.610> big

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
exciting season it could be a big

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.130 
exciting season it could be a big
turning<00:02:35.180> point<00:02:35.209> there's<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> good<00:02:36.020> way<00:02:36.110> of

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
turning point there's a good way of

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.390 
turning point there's a good way of
asking<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.620> question<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:37.040> isn't<00:02:37.250> there<00:02:37.340> if

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
asking that question that isn't there if

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.380 
asking that question that isn't there if
we're<00:02:37.520> talking<00:02:37.640> about<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:38.000> psychological

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
we're talking about the psychological

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.920

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
okay it's a good turning point for an

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.979 
okay it's a good turning point for an
early<00:02:54.680> but<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:54.980> doesn't<00:02:55.340> matter<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:55.580> much

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
early but it doesn't matter that much
