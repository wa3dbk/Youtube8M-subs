solution the same issues we've
experienced<00:02:36.870> there<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.709> fact<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.129> is<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.400> as

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
experienced there the fact is is that as

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.709 
experienced there the fact is is that as
soon<00:02:38.819> as<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.120> put<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.329> skin<00:02:39.719> on<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.980> ipad<00:02:41.719> you

a little sort of shaking it yeah and the
end<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.889> weight<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.430> get<00:02:59.639> with<00:02:59.790> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000

of<00:03:29.879> the<00:03:30.000> other<00:03:30.120> things<00:03:30.180> we<00:03:30.569> wanted<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.870> demo

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
of the other things we wanted to demo

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.659 
of the other things we wanted to demo
because<00:03:31.379> we<00:03:31.560> hadn't<00:03:31.859> seen<00:03:32.040> very<00:03:32.489> other

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
because we hadn't seen very other

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.369 
because we hadn't seen very other
reviews<00:03:33.180> do<00:03:33.389> this<00:03:33.569> was<00:03:33.750> actually<00:03:33.959> the

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
reviews do this was actually the

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.000 
reviews do this was actually the
difficult<00:03:35.189> task<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.669> taking<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.299> skin<00:03:36.599> off

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
difficult task of taking the skin off

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.110 
difficult task of taking the skin off
and<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.159> was<00:03:38.250> difficult<00:03:38.370> because<00:03:38.669> you<00:03:38.909> know<00:03:39.000> we

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
and it was difficult because you know we

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.610 
and it was difficult because you know we
enjoyed<00:03:39.419> our<00:03:39.629> skin<00:03:39.930> but<00:03:40.139> it<00:03:40.199> was<00:03:40.319> something

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
enjoyed our skin but it was something

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.710 
enjoyed our skin but it was something
that<00:03:40.650> we<00:03:40.829> had<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:41.129> demo<00:03:41.370> for<00:03:41.699> you<00:03:41.790> guys<00:03:42.000> because

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
that we had to demo for you guys because

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.069 
that we had to demo for you guys because
I<00:03:43.590> carbon<00:03:44.220> say<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:45.120> there's<00:03:45.389> no<00:03:45.599> residue

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
I carbon say that there's no residue

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.710
