hey<00:00:01.260> guys<00:00:01.469> let<00:00:01.860> me<00:00:01.890> show<00:00:02.010> you<00:00:02.190> my<00:00:02.490> internet<00:00:03.179> of

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hey guys let me show you my internet of

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.179 
hey guys let me show you my internet of
things<00:00:03.570> fire<00:00:04.319> alarm<00:00:05.690> basically<00:00:06.690> it's<00:00:06.810> really

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
things fire alarm basically it's really

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.280 
things fire alarm basically it's really
a<00:00:08.189> cheap<00:00:10.400> fire<00:00:11.400> detection<00:00:12.030> alarm<00:00:12.389> both<00:00:12.929> for<00:00:13.170> me

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
a cheap fire detection alarm both for me

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.200 
a cheap fire detection alarm both for me
day<00:00:14.000> and<00:00:15.740> what<00:00:16.740> I've<00:00:16.859> done<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.750> fit<00:00:18.750> inside<00:00:20.210> an

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
day and what I've done I fit inside an

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.990 
day and what I've done I fit inside an
80<00:00:21.720> tiny<00:00:24.140> 84<00:00:25.140> based<00:00:26.480> wireless<00:00:27.480> sensor<00:00:29.000> that

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
80 tiny 84 based wireless sensor that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.979 
80 tiny 84 based wireless sensor that
would<00:00:30.710> tap<00:00:31.710> into<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.520> PSoC<00:00:33.239> iron<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:35.989> upon

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
would tap into the PSoC iron and upon

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.440 
would tap into the PSoC iron and upon
activation<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:38.070> would<00:00:38.250> make<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> wireless

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
activation it would make a wireless

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.240 
activation it would make a wireless
transmission<00:00:41.090> to<00:00:42.590> my<00:00:43.590> home<00:00:43.800> automation

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
transmission to my home automation

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.639 
transmission to my home automation
system<00:00:44.820> running<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.329> our<00:00:45.710> Raspberry<00:00:46.710> Pi<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
system running on our Raspberry Pi and

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.369 
system running on our Raspberry Pi and
it<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.800> equipped<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.940> receiver<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:52.230> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
it is equipped with a receiver this is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.709 
it is equipped with a receiver this is
RFM<00:00:52.910> 12<00:00:53.910> 2<00:00:54.180> pi<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:57.890> these<00:00:58.890> guys<00:00:59.219> could<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.730> up<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
RFM 12 2 pi so these guys could be up to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.820 
RFM 12 2 pi so these guys could be up to
50<00:01:01.109> metres<00:01:01.680> away<00:01:01.890> from<00:01:02.340> each<00:01:02.489> other<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.830> I

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
50 metres away from each other and I

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.270 
50 metres away from each other and I
have<00:01:05.299> more<00:01:06.299> than<00:01:06.920> 20<00:01:09.680> connected<00:01:10.680> things<00:01:11.070> at

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
have more than 20 connected things at

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.670 
have more than 20 connected things at
home<00:01:11.490> already<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.330> let's<00:01:12.540> see<00:01:12.780> how<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.409> works

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.530 

basically<00:01:20.840> there<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.960> note<00:01:22.680> read<00:01:23.009> flow<00:01:23.540> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
basically there is a note read flow that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.910 
basically there is a note read flow that
runs<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> Raspberry<00:01:26.040> Pi<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:28.530> upon

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
runs on the Raspberry Pi and upon

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.990 
runs on the Raspberry Pi and upon
activation<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.880> will<00:01:32.210> send<00:01:33.210> me<00:01:33.710> in<00:01:35.000> short

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
activation it will send me in short

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.929 
activation it will send me in short
message<00:01:39.110> yeah<00:01:42.799> short<00:01:43.799> message<00:01:44.250> pushbullet

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
message yeah short message pushbullet

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539 
message yeah short message pushbullet
and<00:01:45.299> email<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:46.259> these<00:01:46.619> things<00:01:46.890> show<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and email all these things show that I

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.340 
and email all these things show that I
make<00:01:47.759> sure<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.810> received<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
make sure that I received the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.330 
make sure that I received the
notification<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:51.090> let's<00:01:51.329> let's<00:01:51.720> test<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.340> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
notification so let's let's test it and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.920 
notification so let's let's test it and
here's<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:54.000> phone<00:01:54.299> ah<00:01:56.479> there<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.600> test

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
here's my phone ah there is a test

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.230 
here's my phone ah there is a test
button<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.530> would<00:01:58.920> make<00:01:59.159> a

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
button here that would make a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.429 
button here that would make a
transmission<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> look<00:02:01.170> carefully

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
transmission and if you look carefully

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:09.880 
transmission and if you look carefully
you'll<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.340> actual<00:02:02.640> blink<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.020 

we<00:02:10.880> have<00:02:11.180> picked<00:02:11.600> it<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:12.260> my<00:02:12.560> phone<00:02:12.920> is

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
we have picked it up and my phone is

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.980 
we have picked it up and my phone is
going<00:02:14.030> crazy<00:02:14.360> with<00:02:14.840> push<00:02:15.350> boards<00:02:15.880> texts<00:02:16.990> and

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
going crazy with push boards texts and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.640 
going crazy with push boards texts and
emails<00:02:18.730> alerting<00:02:19.730> me<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.150> have<00:02:20.500> fired<00:02:21.500> at

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
emails alerting me that I have fired at

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.410 
emails alerting me that I have fired at
home<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.980> basically<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:29.240> can

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
home so basically this is it you can

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.420 
home so basically this is it you can
read<00:02:29.690> more<00:02:29.930> about<00:02:30.200> this<00:02:30.620> project<00:02:30.950> on<00:02:31.400> my<00:02:31.960> blog

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
read more about this project on my blog

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.430 
read more about this project on my blog
thanks
