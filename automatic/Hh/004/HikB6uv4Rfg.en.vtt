00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.700 
mingling gardening big difference a
couple<00:00:02.100> of<00:00:02.460> days<00:00:02.610> make<00:00:03.350> temperatures<00:00:04.350> gotten

couple of days make temperatures gotten

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.559 
couple of days make temperatures gotten
into<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:04.980> low<00:00:05.100> 40s<00:00:05.370> past<00:00:05.790> couple<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.180> days<00:00:06.330> so

we've had a little bit of a meltdown but
I<00:00:10.530> thought<00:00:10.769> I'd<00:00:10.950> do<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> quick<00:00:11.160> video<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
I thought I'd do a quick video on the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.789 
I thought I'd do a quick video on the
citrus<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.719> greenhouse<00:00:13.170> here<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.620> can

citrus on the greenhouse here you can
see<00:00:14.009> there's<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.250> lot<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.490> orange<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.529> yellow

see there's a lot of orange and yellow

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.800 
see there's a lot of orange and yellow
visible<00:00:17.400> through<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.850> polycarbonate<00:00:20.630> and<00:00:21.630> on

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
visible through the polycarbonate and on

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.630 
visible through the polycarbonate and on
a<00:00:21.840> day<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.080> today<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.650> really<00:00:22.890> nice<00:00:23.100> blue

partly<00:00:25.980> cloudy<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:27.000> quickly<00:00:27.090> get<00:00:27.420> up<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
partly cloudy it can quickly get up to

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.929 
partly cloudy it can quickly get up to
well<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.769> think<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.130> 82<00:00:29.550> degrees

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
well it's I think it's like 82 degrees

well it's I think it's like 82 degrees
in<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.179> greenhouse<00:00:30.599> don't<00:00:30.900> come<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
in the greenhouse don't come in the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.500 
in the greenhouse don't come in the
spring<00:00:31.700> I'm<00:00:32.700> gonna<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.180> concentrate<00:00:33.480> on

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
spring I'm gonna have to concentrate on

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.389 
spring I'm gonna have to concentrate on
ventilation<00:00:36.510> an<00:00:36.690> exhaust<00:00:37.500> fan<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
ventilation an exhaust fan to get the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.130 
ventilation an exhaust fan to get the
heat<00:00:38.579> out<00:00:38.610> because<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.210> imagine<00:00:39.420> it'll<00:00:39.930> get

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
heat out because I can imagine it'll get

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.810 
heat out because I can imagine it'll get
pretty<00:00:40.579> hot<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> greenhouse<00:00:42.210> real<00:00:42.510> quick

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820

was<00:02:32.300> hoping<00:02:32.540> some<00:02:32.780> growth<00:02:33.050> would<00:02:33.760> would

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
was hoping some growth would would

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.610 
was hoping some growth would would
appear<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.860> even<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:36.980> out<00:02:38.170> but<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.200> might<00:02:39.500> have

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
appear to even it out but I might have

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.610 
appear to even it out but I might have
to<00:02:39.770> try<00:02:40.010> grafting<00:02:40.850> see<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.960> can<00:02:42.170> graft<00:02:42.470> a

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
to try grafting see if I can graft a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.100 
to try grafting see if I can graft a
branch<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.790> other<00:02:44.090> side<00:02:44.300> theater<00:02:44.720> even<00:02:44.990> it

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
branch to the other side theater even it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.920 
branch to the other side theater even it
out<00:02:48.820> what<00:02:49.820> about<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.240> I<00:02:50.330> don't<00:02:50.510> seem<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.750> have

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
out what about it I don't seem to have

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.340 
out what about it I don't seem to have
any<00:02:51.580> scale<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.940> don't<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.540> don't<00:02:53.690> notice<00:02:54.110> any

any scale I don't I don't notice any

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.870 
any scale I don't I don't notice any
residue<00:02:54.770> when<00:02:54.890> any<00:02:55.070> of<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.250> leaves<00:02:55.460> I<00:02:55.670> don't

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
residue when any of the leaves I don't

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.730

notice any cottony cushion scale either
so<00:03:01.220> hopefully<00:03:04.390> that's<00:03:05.390> not<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.600> problem

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
so hopefully that's not a problem

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.010 
so hopefully that's not a problem

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
outside so it's in the original

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.620 
outside so it's in the original
container<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.400> came<00:03:34.610> in<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:37.270> thought<00:03:38.270> well

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
support that brush and it's a lot of

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.770 
support that brush and it's a lot of
