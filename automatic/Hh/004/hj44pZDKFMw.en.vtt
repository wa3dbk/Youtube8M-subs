bit and I thought that was frustration
that<00:02:11.009> he<00:02:11.220> wasn't<00:02:11.790> able<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.060> control<00:02:12.420> things

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
that he wasn't able to control things

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.790 
that he wasn't able to control things
the<00:02:13.110> way<00:02:13.230> he<00:02:13.319> wanted<00:02:13.620> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the way he wanted to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.530 
the way he wanted to
which<00:02:13.950> was<00:02:14.160> get<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> roughhouse<00:02:15.030> fight

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
which was get it to a roughhouse fight

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.060 
which was get it to a roughhouse fight
and<00:02:15.810> get<00:02:16.230> his<00:02:16.350> way<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.740> think<00:02:16.800> what

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
and get his way and I think what

happen I think that Cotto will do a

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.680 
happen I think that Cotto will do a
better<00:04:36.350> job<00:04:36.470> than<00:04:37.160> hadn't<00:04:37.580> it<00:04:37.760> and<00:04:37.940> he<00:04:38.480> likes

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
better job than hadn't it and he likes

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.450 
better job than hadn't it and he likes
to<00:04:38.780> go<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.140> body<00:04:39.290> and<00:04:39.530> again<00:04:39.620> that's<00:04:40.190> the

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
to go to the body and again that's the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.040 
to go to the body and again that's the
theory<00:04:40.730> against<00:04:41.300> Mayweather<00:04:41.660> you<00:04:41.810> know<00:04:41.930> he

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
theory against Mayweather you know he

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.570 
theory against Mayweather you know he
moves<00:04:42.230> that<00:04:42.410> upper<00:04:42.620> body<00:04:42.770> pretty<00:04:43.100> good<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.460> go

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
moves that upper body pretty good you go

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.190 
moves that upper body pretty good you go
downstairs<00:04:44.000> colder<00:04:44.720> we'll<00:04:44.810> go<00:04:44.960> downstairs

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
downstairs colder we'll go downstairs

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.020 
downstairs colder we'll go downstairs
Cotto<00:04:45.740> could<00:04:45.980> adjust<00:04:46.280> he<00:04:46.460> can<00:04:46.610> box<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:46.940> little

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
Cotto could adjust he can box a little

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.730 
Cotto could adjust he can box a little
bit<00:04:47.270> more<00:04:47.480> he's<00:04:47.960> a<00:04:47.990> little<00:04:48.350> bit<00:04:48.500> better

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
bit more he's a little bit better

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.280 
bit more he's a little bit better
technically<00:04:49.550> than<00:04:50.060> Hatton<00:04:50.420> but<00:04:50.600> in<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.840> end<00:04:51.020> I

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
technically than Hatton but in the end I

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.620 
technically than Hatton but in the end I
think<00:04:51.740> it<00:04:52.040> is<00:04:52.160> still<00:04:52.370> being<00:04:52.610> even<00:04:53.060> in<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.240> codel

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
think it is still being even in a codel

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.610 
think it is still being even in a codel
fight<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:53.840> think<00:04:54.200> it<00:04:54.290> would<00:04:54.410> still<00:04:54.440> be

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
fight I think it would still be

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.830 
fight I think it would still be
Mayweather<00:04:55.190> with<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.730> superior<00:04:56.270> skills<00:04:56.630> he's

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
Mayweather with the superior skills he's

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.080 
Mayweather with the superior skills he's
got<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.140> full<00:04:57.350> package<00:04:57.590> inside<00:04:58.220> outside<00:04:58.790> and

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
got the full package inside outside and

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.270 
got the full package inside outside and
don't<00:04:59.600> forget<00:04:59.960> when<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.710> pressure<00:05:00.980> was

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
don't forget when the pressure was

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.310 
don't forget when the pressure was
coming<00:05:01.310> not<00:05:02.180> only<00:05:02.510> did<00:05:02.690> he<00:05:02.780> conduct<00:05:03.170> himself

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
coming not only did he conduct himself

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.930 
coming not only did he conduct himself
like<00:05:03.620> a<00:05:03.740> fight<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.220> technically<00:05:04.670> and

him
even<00:05:44.990> if<00:05:45.200> the<00:05:45.350> chordal<00:05:45.680> fight<00:05:45.890> can't<00:05:46.190> be<00:05:46.370> made

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
even if the chordal fight can't be made

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.030 
even if the chordal fight can't be made
or<00:05:47.090> Mayweather<00:05:47.630> that<00:05:48.410> would<00:05:48.560> be<00:05:48.680> a<00:05:48.710> fight<00:05:49.010> that

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
or Mayweather that would be a fight that

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.950 
or Mayweather that would be a fight that
you<00:05:49.550> know<00:05:49.700> I'm<00:05:49.880> sure<00:05:49.910> would<00:05:50.300> be<00:05:50.480> a<00:05:50.510> big<00:05:50.750> fight

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960

you know I'm sure would be a big fight
essentially<00:05:51.470> you<00:05:51.530> could<00:05:51.620> see<00:05:51.770> a<00:05:51.800> rematch<00:05:52.070> yeah

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
essentially you could see a rematch yeah

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.890 
essentially you could see a rematch yeah
maybe<00:05:52.550> even<00:05:52.670> over<00:05:53.030> there<00:05:53.180> no<00:05:53.480> I<00:05:53.510> don't<00:05:53.750> see<00:05:53.870> a

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
maybe even over there no I don't see a

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.840 
maybe even over there no I don't see a
rematch<00:05:54.290> was<00:05:54.500> too<00:05:54.710> dominant<00:05:55.220> okay<00:05:55.580> but<00:05:55.820> I

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
rematch was too dominant okay but I

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.790 
rematch was too dominant okay but I
could<00:05:56.060> see<00:05:56.270> if<00:05:56.390> the<00:05:56.510> Codel<00:05:56.900> fight<00:05:57.140> is<00:05:57.290> not<00:05:57.440> made

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
could see if the Codel fight is not made

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.950 
could see if the Codel fight is not made
with<00:05:58.100> Mayweather<00:05:58.520> maybe<00:05:59.270> Cotto<00:05:59.630> fights

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
with Mayweather maybe Cotto fights
