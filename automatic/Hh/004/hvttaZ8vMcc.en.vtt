00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
know I didn't put this on my first video

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.080 
know I didn't put this on my first video
but<00:02:34.230> my<00:02:34.920> shopping<00:02:35.160> video<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.520> noticed<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
but my shopping video I noticed that the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.380 
but my shopping video I noticed that the
boxes<00:02:36.480> are<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.630> lot<00:02:36.959> smaller<00:02:38.060> which<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.209> not<00:02:39.360> a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
boxes are a lot smaller which is not a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.330 
boxes are a lot smaller which is not a
big<00:02:39.630> deal<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.050> actually<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:40.800> me<00:02:40.950> for<00:02:41.310> a

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
big deal and actually for me for a

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.890 
big deal and actually for me for a
collector<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.880> makes<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.150> lot<00:02:42.420> easier<00:02:42.630> to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
collector it makes a lot easier to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.360 
collector it makes a lot easier to
display<00:02:43.260> them<00:02:43.410> cuz<00:02:43.709> see<00:02:43.890> they<00:02:44.010> kind<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.310> just

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
display them cuz see they kind of just

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.809 
display them cuz see they kind of just
stacked<00:02:44.910> like<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.650> kind<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.069> stack<00:02:47.370> so

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
stacked like this and kind of stack so

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.009 
stacked like this and kind of stack so
you<00:02:47.910> can<00:02:48.030> display<00:02:48.150> them<00:02:48.300> like<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.600> which<00:02:48.840> was

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
you can display them like this which was

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.460 
you can display them like this which was
the<00:02:49.200> first<00:02:49.500> series<00:02:50.480> can't<00:02:51.480> really<00:02:51.840> stack<00:02:52.230> them

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
the first series can't really stack them

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.220 
the first series can't really stack them
because<00:02:52.620> they<00:02:52.709> took<00:02:52.830> up<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.160> much<00:02:53.220> room<00:02:53.340> see<00:02:54.230> so

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
because they took up so much room see so

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.960 
because they took up so much room see so
I<00:02:55.260> actually<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.340> they've<00:02:56.610> done<00:02:56.760> these

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
I actually like that they've done these

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.910 
I actually like that they've done these
smaller<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.569> like<00:02:57.720> this<00:02:57.959> makes<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.620> easier

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
smaller and like this makes it easier

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.710 
smaller and like this makes it easier
for<00:02:59.069> me<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.190> display<00:02:59.580> them<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.330> that<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.600> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
for me to display them so that is the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.660 
for me to display them so that is the
last<00:03:00.930> three<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.769> be<00:03:01.860> reviewed<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.489> the
