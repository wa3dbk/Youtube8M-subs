artificial intelligence module now the
last<00:00:12.780> video<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.349> did<00:00:13.849> kind<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.940> went<00:00:15.089> a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
long-winded so the nice thing about

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.880 
long-winded so the nice thing about
videos<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.900> at<00:00:25.050> least<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.500> go<00:00:25.650> back<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
videos is at least you can go back and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.429 
videos is at least you can go back and
pause<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.820> replay<00:00:27.150> eet<00:00:27.810> but<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.199> stuff's

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
pause and replay eet but this stuff's

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
pause and replay eet but this stuff's
pretty<00:00:28.560> basic<00:00:28.859> i<00:00:29.220> don't<00:00:29.369> think<00:00:29.580> we're<00:00:30.330> going

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
pretty basic i don't think we're going

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.389 
pretty basic i don't think we're going
to<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.599> doing<00:00:30.689> anything<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.980> incredibly

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
to be doing anything to incredibly

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.799 
to be doing anything to incredibly
difficult<00:00:32.669> you'd<00:00:33.090> have<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.329> go<00:00:33.420> back<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
difficult you'd have to go back and

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.220 
difficult you'd have to go back and
review<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> will<00:00:36.450> pick<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:37.050> where<00:00:37.079> i

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
review but so will pick up right where i

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
review but so will pick up right where i
left<00:00:37.260> off<00:00:37.559> before<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.100> get<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> scene<00:00:38.640> open

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
left off before you get the scene open

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
left off before you get the scene open
here<00:00:39.719> then<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.379> were<00:00:40.469> looking<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
here then we were looking at the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.119 
here then we were looking at the
different<00:00:41.309> attributes<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.910> exist<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.530> one

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
different attributes that exist so one

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.569 
different attributes that exist so one
of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.340> things<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.239> do<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:46.579> we

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
of the things that we can do is we

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.650 
of the things that we can do is we
already<00:00:47.700> went<00:00:47.879> over<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> game<00:00:48.300> editor<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
already went over the game editor a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.270 
already went over the game editor a
while<00:00:48.870> back<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.170> you'll<00:00:49.590> notice<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.920> there

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
while back but you'll notice that there

is you know a user meany I that's
assigned<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.940> game<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.710> we'll<00:00:55.710> talk<00:00:55.920> more

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
assigned to the game and we'll talk more

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.250 
assigned to the game and we'll talk more
about<00:00:56.309> how<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> eyes<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.840> applied<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260

will go to the AI model menu and we have

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.359 
will go to the AI model menu and we have
some<00:01:15.270> options<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.750> create<00:01:15.930> or<00:01:16.140> open<00:01:16.680> it'll

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
like about this code desktop is that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.780 
like about this code desktop is that
we've<00:01:33.780> got<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.110> AI<00:01:34.350> model<00:01:34.890> editor<00:01:35.070> over<00:01:35.549> here

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
we've got the AI model editor over here

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
we've got the AI model editor over here
and<00:01:35.970> over<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> right<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.560> script

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
and over on the right we have the script

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.100 
and over on the right we have the script
editor<00:01:38.220> which<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.729> was<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.119> cover<00:01:39.930> in

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
editor which I was going to cover in

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.929 
editor which I was going to cover in
another<00:01:40.200> video<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.610> knock<00:01:41.790> them

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
another video but we can just knock them

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.190 
another video but we can just knock them
out<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> same<00:01:42.420> time<00:01:42.630> since<00:01:42.990> they're

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
out at the same time since they're

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.469 
out at the same time since they're
related<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> AI<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.610> variables

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
related so for the AI you have variables

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.060

in<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.319> know<00:02:45.440> whenever<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.950> thing

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
in it is you know whenever the thing

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.150 
in it is you know whenever the thing
starts<00:02:46.489> up<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:48.140> that's<00:02:48.590> basically<00:02:48.739> what<00:02:49.040> you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
starts up so that's basically what you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.039 
starts up so that's basically what you
have<00:02:49.190> you've<00:02:49.580> got<00:02:49.610> any<00:02:50.390> time<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:50.690> click<00:02:50.900> on

the + next to add function it's going to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.670 
the + next to add function it's going to
give<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.269> ability<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:54.350> know<00:02:54.440> add<00:02:54.650> a

function pretty simple stuff they give
you<00:02:58.160> some<00:02:58.340> basic<00:02:58.790> code<00:02:59.030> now<00:02:59.870> all<00:03:00.049> this<00:03:00.200> stuff

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
you some basic code now all this stuff

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.059 
you some basic code now all this stuff
is<00:03:00.560> Luis<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.220> tax<00:03:01.459> it's<00:03:01.760> pretty<00:03:02.030> simple<00:03:03.069> don't

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
is Luis in tax it's pretty simple don't

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.630 
is Luis in tax it's pretty simple don't
really<00:03:04.280> mess<00:03:04.519> with<00:03:04.549> much<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:06.430> extra<00:03:07.430> stuff

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
really mess with much of the extra stuff

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.789 
really mess with much of the extra stuff
around<00:03:08.450> here<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.930> just<00:03:09.110> put<00:03:09.350> right<00:03:09.560> where<00:03:09.709> it

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
around here you just put right where it

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.430 
around here you just put right where it
says<00:03:10.010> write<00:03:10.220> your<00:03:10.340> code<00:03:10.519> here<00:03:11.200> that's<00:03:12.200> where

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
says write your code here that's where

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.259 
says write your code here that's where
it<00:03:12.560> goes<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.069> you<00:03:13.160> just<00:03:13.640> put<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:13.970> I<00:03:14.030> mean<00:03:14.150> you

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
it goes and you just put it I mean you

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.120 
it goes and you just put it I mean you
can<00:03:14.420> come<00:03:14.450> up<00:03:14.690> here<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.900> label<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.739> altar<00:03:16.040> in

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
can come up here and label the altar in

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.640 
can come up here and label the altar in
description<00:03:16.609> whatnot<00:03:17.140> but<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.260> idea<00:03:18.500> is<00:03:18.560> that

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
description whatnot but the idea is that

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.300 
description whatnot but the idea is that
you<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.519> write<00:03:20.030> your<00:03:20.690> script<00:03:21.079> and<00:03:21.500> then

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
you that you write your script and then

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.810 
you that you write your script and then
you<00:03:22.790> know<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:22.940> have<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.420> ability<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.810> save

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
you know you have the ability to save

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.099 
you know you have the ability to save
there's<00:03:25.820> different<00:03:26.150> view<00:03:26.329> options<00:03:26.810> like

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
there's different view options like

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.360 
there's different view options like
whether<00:03:27.320> or<00:03:27.440> not<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.620> want<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.859> show<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.190> line

these options over here I typically

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.569 
these options over here I typically
don't<00:03:47.780> show<00:03:48.109> that<00:03:48.140> just<00:03:48.560> because<00:03:48.890> as<00:03:49.250> you're

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
don't show that just because as you're

sometimes I'll go in and I'll change the

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.090 
sometimes I'll go in and I'll change the
script<00:04:56.150> but<00:04:56.870> then<00:04:57.080> I<00:04:57.110> don't<00:04:57.410> hit<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.770> compile

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
script but then I don't hit the compile

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.250 
script but then I don't hit the compile
button<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:58.640> go<00:04:58.790> and<00:04:58.820> run<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.450> game<00:04:59.960> and

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.020 
button and you go and run the game and
you<00:05:00.290> notice<00:05:00.710> nothing<00:05:00.890> changes<00:05:01.460> it's<00:05:01.640> probably

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
you notice nothing changes it's probably

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.870 
you notice nothing changes it's probably
because<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.390> have<00:05:02.480> a<00:05:02.540> compile<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.200> saved<00:05:03.470> it

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.850 
it's handy to be able to stay just close
the<00:05:16.700> one<00:05:16.850> that's<00:05:17.030> on<00:05:17.210> or<00:05:17.450> close<00:05:17.600> all<00:05:17.960> or<00:05:18.440> you

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
the one that's on or close all or you

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.160 
the one that's on or close all or you
know<00:05:19.040> go<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.460> next<00:05:19.640> or<00:05:19.910> previous<00:05:20.060> or<00:05:20.750> maybe

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
know go to the next or previous or maybe

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.770 
know go to the next or previous or maybe
a<00:05:21.260> specific<00:05:21.830> one<00:05:22.010> I<00:05:22.280> mean<00:05:22.550> it's<00:05:22.750> usually<00:05:23.750> just

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
a specific one I mean it's usually just

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.500 
a specific one I mean it's usually just
as<00:05:24.200> easy<00:05:24.380> to<00:05:24.530> click<00:05:25.400> on<00:05:25.580> a<00:05:25.610> tab<00:05:25.850> but<00:05:26.150> sometimes

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
as easy to click on a tab but sometimes

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.290 
as easy to click on a tab but sometimes
it<00:05:26.690> can<00:05:26.810> come<00:05:26.990> in<00:05:27.080> handy<00:05:27.970> so<00:05:28.970> that's<00:05:29.120> basically

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
it can come in handy so that's basically

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.700 
it can come in handy so that's basically
all<00:05:29.600> there<00:05:29.780> is<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.260> the<00:05:30.350> ala<00:05:30.740> I<00:05:31.190> model<00:05:31.760> editor

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
all there is to the ala I model editor

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.690 
all there is to the ala I model editor
you<00:05:33.710> know<00:05:33.830> when<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:34.040> come<00:05:34.220> in<00:05:34.370> to<00:05:34.490> do<00:05:34.670> the

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
you know when you come in to do the

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.320 
you know when you come in to do the
handlers<00:05:35.950> I<00:05:36.950> guess<00:05:37.490> I<00:05:37.610> should<00:05:37.760> cover<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:38.000> so

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
handlers I guess I should cover that so

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.750 
handlers I guess I should cover that so
the<00:05:38.990> handlers<00:05:39.380> are<00:05:39.410> some<00:05:39.710> specific<00:05:39.950> ones<00:05:40.310> you

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
the handlers are some specific ones you

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.300 
the handlers are some specific ones you
can<00:05:40.940> do<00:05:41.090> custom<00:05:41.360> but<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:42.080> game<00:05:42.320> comes<00:05:42.650> with<00:05:42.860> or

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
can do custom but the game comes with or

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.560 
can do custom but the game comes with or
the<00:05:43.460> game<00:05:43.640> engine<00:05:43.910> comes<00:05:44.120> with<00:05:44.270> a<00:05:44.300> lot<00:05:44.540> of

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
the game engine comes with a lot of

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.290 
the game engine comes with a lot of
built-in<00:05:44.990> one<00:05:45.170> so<00:05:45.850> you<00:05:46.850> know<00:05:46.940> when<00:05:47.060> you<00:05:47.120> go<00:05:47.240> to

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
built-in one so you know when you go to

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.330 
built-in one so you know when you go to
add<00:05:47.480> one<00:05:47.660> you<00:05:47.840> want<00:05:47.990> to<00:05:48.080> pick<00:05:48.230> one<00:05:48.380> of<00:05:48.500> these<00:05:48.590> if

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
add one you want to pick one of these if

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.850 
add one you want to pick one of these if
you're<00:05:49.490> going<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.670> do<00:05:49.760> a<00:05:49.790> custom<00:05:50.680> handler<00:05:51.680> then

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
you're going to do a custom handler then

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.380 
you're going to do a custom handler then
you've<00:05:52.010> got<00:05:52.190> to<00:05:52.310> wire<00:05:52.580> that<00:05:52.760> up<00:05:52.940> on<00:05:53.120> your<00:05:53.270> own

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
you've got to wire that up on your own

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.560 
you've got to wire that up on your own
you<00:05:53.810> know<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.140> fire<00:05:54.350> the<00:05:54.530> event<00:05:54.800> and<00:05:54.890> whatnot

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
you know the fire the event and whatnot

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.390 
you know the fire the event and whatnot
the<00:05:56.570> same<00:05:56.780> thing<00:05:56.930> with<00:05:57.050> variables<00:05:57.590> you're

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
the same thing with variables you're

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.340 
the same thing with variables you're
kind<00:05:58.640> of<00:05:58.730> you<00:05:59.420> know<00:05:59.450> you<00:05:59.600> have<00:05:59.810> the<00:05:59.930> ability<00:06:00.320> to

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
kind of you know you have the ability to

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.640 
kind of you know you have the ability to
select<00:06:00.830> certain<00:06:01.130> variables<00:06:02.410> variable<00:06:03.410> types

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
select certain variables variable types

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.060 
select certain variables variable types
and<00:06:04.160> you<00:06:04.610> can<00:06:04.760> set<00:06:04.940> the<00:06:05.030> initial<00:06:05.210> value<00:06:05.980> so<00:06:06.980> you

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
and you can set the initial value so you

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.200 
and you can set the initial value so you
know<00:06:07.160> you<00:06:07.250> have<00:06:07.280> like<00:06:07.460> billions<00:06:07.790> numbers

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
know you have like billions numbers

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.590 
know you have like billions numbers
object<00:06:08.630> strings<00:06:08.930> blah<00:06:09.320> blah<00:06:09.470> blah<00:06:10.330> so<00:06:11.330> the

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
object strings blah blah blah so the

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.540 
object strings blah blah blah so the
basics<00:06:11.930> behind<00:06:12.050> the<00:06:12.290> AI<00:06:12.410> model<00:06:12.920> editor<00:06:13.040> is<00:06:13.340> it

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
basics behind the AI model editor is it

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.670 
basics behind the AI model editor is it
gives<00:06:13.790> you<00:06:14.000> like<00:06:14.300> a<00:06:14.330> little<00:06:14.660> mini<00:06:14.900> ide<00:06:15.170> where

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
gives you like a little mini ide where

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.860 
gives you like a little mini ide where
you<00:06:15.770> can<00:06:15.920> go<00:06:16.070> in<00:06:16.250> and<00:06:16.400> you<00:06:16.520> can<00:06:16.700> code<00:06:17.630> your

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
you can go in and you can code your

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.590 
you can go in and you can code your
scripts<00:06:18.230> you<00:06:19.190> can<00:06:19.400> set<00:06:19.790> the<00:06:19.940> variables<00:06:20.390> and

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
scripts you can set the variables and

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.420 
scripts you can set the variables and
things<00:06:20.810> the<00:06:20.960> idea<00:06:21.350> behind<00:06:21.590> this<00:06:22.040> being<00:06:22.370> that

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
things the idea behind this being that

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.990 
things the idea behind this being that
this<00:06:23.120> AI<00:06:23.450> is<00:06:23.990> going<00:06:24.980> to<00:06:25.130> be<00:06:25.250> attached<00:06:25.580> to<00:06:25.850> an

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
this AI is going to be attached to an

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.690 
this AI is going to be attached to an
object<00:06:26.210> or<00:06:26.750> seen<00:06:27.080> or<00:06:27.710> well<00:06:28.190> I<00:06:28.220> don't<00:06:28.580> know<00:06:28.640> if

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
object or seen or well I don't know if

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.070 
object or seen or well I don't know if
you<00:06:28.790> can<00:06:28.880> touch<00:06:29.090> from<00:06:29.240> the<00:06:29.330> scenes<00:06:29.570> but<00:06:29.840> to<00:06:29.990> the

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
you can touch from the scenes but to the

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.860 
you can touch from the scenes but to the
game<00:06:30.700> they're<00:06:31.700> kind<00:06:31.940> of<00:06:31.970> encapsulated<00:06:32.630> that

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
game they're kind of encapsulated that

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.120 
game they're kind of encapsulated that
you<00:06:32.960> get<00:06:33.110> all<00:06:33.260> the<00:06:33.380> functionality<00:06:33.980> you<00:06:34.100> need

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
you get all the functionality you need

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.140 
you get all the functionality you need
for<00:06:34.460> that<00:06:34.580> particular

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
for that particular

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.890 
for that particular
object<00:06:35.510> it's<00:06:36.500> neat<00:06:36.770> that<00:06:36.800> way<00:06:37.130> because<00:06:37.900> you

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
object it's neat that way because you

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.350 
object it's neat that way because you
know<00:06:38.990> if<00:06:39.140> you<00:06:39.320> have<00:06:39.800> a<00:06:40.340> particular<00:06:40.730> way<00:06:41.120> that<00:06:41.330> a

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
know if you have a particular way that a

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.690 
know if you have a particular way that a
camera<00:06:41.780> will<00:06:41.930> follow<00:06:42.200> a<00:06:42.350> player<00:06:42.710> through<00:06:43.130> a

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
camera will follow a player through a

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.090 
camera will follow a player through a
level<00:06:44.480> you<00:06:44.630> can<00:06:44.840> script<00:06:45.290> that<00:06:45.500> into<00:06:45.830> your<00:06:45.920> AI

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
level you can script that into your AI

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.850 
level you can script that into your AI
and<00:06:46.610> you<00:06:46.700> can<00:06:46.850> call<00:06:47.030> it<00:06:47.180> like<00:06:47.360> third<00:06:48.350> person

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
and you can call it like third person

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.630 
and you can call it like third person
camera<00:06:49.750> and<00:06:50.750> then<00:06:51.380> you<00:06:51.680> save<00:06:51.980> that<00:06:52.250> the<00:06:52.430> next

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
camera and then you save that the next

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.100 
camera and then you save that the next
time<00:06:52.760> you<00:06:52.880> need<00:06:52.970> a<00:06:53.030> third<00:06:53.270> person<00:06:53.510> camera<00:06:53.660> you

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
time you need a third person camera you

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.720 
time you need a third person camera you
put<00:06:54.380> a<00:06:54.410> camera<00:06:54.710> in<00:06:54.920> the<00:06:55.040> scene<00:06:55.280> and<00:06:55.490> then<00:06:55.580> you

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.730 
put a camera in the scene and then you

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.640 
put a camera in the scene and then you
just<00:06:55.880> attach<00:06:56.210> this<00:06:56.450> AI<00:06:56.660> to<00:06:56.870> it<00:06:57.170> and<00:06:57.290> then<00:06:57.440> boom

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
just attach this AI to it and then boom

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.520 
just attach this AI to it and then boom
you've<00:06:57.890> got<00:06:58.070> your<00:06:58.310> your<00:06:59.090> functionality<00:06:59.570> so

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
you've got your your functionality so
