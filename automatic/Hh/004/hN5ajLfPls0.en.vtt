hi guys thanks for checking out the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.330 
hi guys thanks for checking out the
video<00:00:12.269> um<00:00:12.719> somebody<00:00:13.320> posted<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.040> comment

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
video um somebody posted a comment

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.080 
video um somebody posted a comment
asking<00:00:15.059> does<00:00:15.420> mud<00:00:16.400> affect<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.580> flight<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
asking does mud affect the flight of the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.929 
asking does mud affect the flight of the
ball<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:19.100> said<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> bit<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.699> silly

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
ball and said it's a bit of a silly

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.450 
ball and said it's a bit of a silly
question<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.449> does<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:23.100> answer<00:00:23.430> is

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
question but does it and the answer is

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.640 
question but does it and the answer is
yes<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.880> certainly<00:00:24.090> does<00:00:24.420> I'm<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.470> watch

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
yes it certainly does I'm if you watch

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.380 
yes it certainly does I'm if you watch
guys<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.099> tour<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.699> one<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> things<00:00:27.210> they

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
guys on tour it's one of the things they

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.599 
guys on tour it's one of the things they
hate<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.810> most<00:00:27.990> because<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:29.160> makes<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
hate the most because it it makes the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.820 
hate the most because it it makes the
ball<00:00:29.760> very<00:00:30.029> unpredictable<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:31.439> means<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.710> can

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
ball very unpredictable it means you can

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650 
ball very unpredictable it means you can
get<00:00:31.920> huge<00:00:32.279> amounts<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.669> curvature<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.420> clubs

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
get huge amounts of curvature with clubs

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.030 
get huge amounts of curvature with clubs
that<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.930> probably<00:00:34.200> wouldn't<00:00:34.469> associate

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
that you probably wouldn't associate

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.160 
that you probably wouldn't associate
that<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.579> possible<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.930> would<00:00:37.079> be

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
that it's possible with so that would be

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.660 
that it's possible with so that would be
like<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> pitching<00:00:37.860> wedge<00:00:37.890> where<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.460> very

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
like a pitching wedge where it's very

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
like a pitching wedge where it's very
difficult<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.270> get<00:00:39.420> cut<00:00:39.780> or<00:00:39.989> hook<00:00:40.200> spin<00:00:40.469> when

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
difficult to get cut or hook spin when

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.610 
difficult to get cut or hook spin when
you've<00:00:41.190> got<00:00:41.280> mud<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.760> during<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.629> ball<00:00:42.870> can

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
you've got mud on it during the ball can

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.069 
you've got mud on it during the ball can
really<00:00:44.250> move<00:00:44.489> violently<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
really move violently and that the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.810 
really move violently and that the
reason<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.770> if<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.010> actually<00:00:47.070> look<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
reason is is if you actually look at a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.600 
reason is is if you actually look at a
ball<00:00:48.090> you've<00:00:48.300> got<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> dimples<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.430> it's<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
ball you've got the dimples and it's the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.450 
ball you've got the dimples and it's the
dimples<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.809> they<00:00:52.020> really<00:00:52.289> does<00:00:52.530> change<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
dimples that they really does change the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.029 
dimples that they really does change the
way<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.719> air<00:00:54.899> flows<00:00:55.320> around<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.829> ball

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
way that the air flows around the ball

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.040 
way that the air flows around the ball
the<00:00:56.219> whole<00:00:56.399> point<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.820> dimple<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.510> it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the whole point of a dimple is it

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.680 
the whole point of a dimple is it
changes<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> airflow<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.940> turbulent<00:01:00.510> air

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
changes the airflow so the turbulent air

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.200 
changes the airflow so the turbulent air
is<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> lot<00:01:01.079> further<00:01:01.410> back<00:01:01.980> from<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> ball<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
is a lot further back from the ball it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.539 
is a lot further back from the ball it
allows<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.809> ball<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.100> cut<00:01:05.100> through<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> air

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
allows the ball to cut through the air

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.130 
allows the ball to cut through the air
better<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.000> allows<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> ball<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> stay<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.990> in

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
better it allows the ball to stay up in

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.969 
better it allows the ball to stay up in
the<00:01:07.170> air<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.250> as<00:01:08.400> soon<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.850> put<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.270> mass<00:01:09.979> on

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the air so as soon as you put a mass on

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
the air so as soon as you put a mass on
the<00:01:11.549> ball<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.119> you're<00:01:12.450> changing<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.020> center<00:01:13.320> of

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the ball a you're changing the center of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.649 
the ball a you're changing the center of
mass<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.010> that's<00:01:14.640> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.939> change<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.509> way

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
mass so that's going to change the way

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.510 
mass so that's going to change the way
that<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> ball<00:01:16.049> wants<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.619> move<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.400> you're

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that the ball wants to move but you're

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.730 
that the ball wants to move but you're
also<00:01:17.729> covering<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.659> dimples<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:21.740> very

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
also covering up dimples so very

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.440 
also covering up dimples so very
difficult<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> reason<00:01:23.970> why

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
difficult one and it's the reason why

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
difficult one and it's the reason why
the<00:01:24.509> pros<00:01:25.320> absolutely<00:01:25.979> hate<00:01:26.159> them<00:01:26.369> because

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the pros absolutely hate them because

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.880 
the pros absolutely hate them because
there<00:01:27.090> isn't<00:01:27.420> really<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.810> set<00:01:28.110> answer<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.710> how

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
there isn't really a set answer on how

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.340 
there isn't really a set answer on how
do<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.100> deal<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.930> what<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
do you deal with it what one of the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.069 
do you deal with it what one of the
things<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.740> will<00:01:31.950> check<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.600> mud<00:01:33.869> is

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
things I will check is if if the mud is

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.950 
things I will check is if if the mud is
sort<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.400> side<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.270> contact<00:01:36.750> I'll

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
sort of this side of the contact I'll

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.350 
sort of this side of the contact I'll
think<00:01:37.650> will<00:01:37.890> can't<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> contact

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
think will can't will the contact

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.080 
think will can't will the contact
actually<00:01:39.770> smash<00:01:40.770> into<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> mud<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.610> actually

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
actually smash into the mud and actually

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
actually smash into the mud and actually
make<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.770> doesn't<00:01:43.829> really<00:01:44.189> affect<00:01:44.310> it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
make it so it doesn't really affect it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.630 
make it so it doesn't really affect it
so<00:01:45.509> when<00:01:45.869> when<00:01:46.140> I'm<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.680> size<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> ball

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
so when when I'm this size of the ball

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.069 
so when when I'm this size of the ball
I'll<00:01:47.880> try<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.210> hit<00:01:48.420> through<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.899> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
I'll try and hit through it and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.620 
I'll try and hit through it and
hopefully<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.890> won't<00:01:50.130> change<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.970> great<00:01:51.509> deal

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
hopefully it won't change a great deal

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.010 
hopefully it won't change a great deal
and<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:54.060> other<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.600> I'll<00:01:54.720> do<00:01:54.899> is

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and the other one that I'll do is

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.810 
and the other one that I'll do is
actually<00:01:55.140> check<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.799> look<00:01:56.100> does<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.399> look<00:01:56.520> like

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
actually check in look does it look like

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.490 
actually check in look does it look like
that<00:01:57.000> mud<00:01:57.240> will<00:01:57.420> fall<00:01:57.689> off<00:01:57.930> because<00:01:58.200> some

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
that mud will fall off because some

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.260 
that mud will fall off because some
sometimes<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.369> looks<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.729> it's<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.119> sort

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
sometimes it looks like it's just sort

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.179 
sometimes it looks like it's just sort
of<00:02:00.329> propped<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.619> soon<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> ball

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
of propped on it so as soon as the ball

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.130 
of propped on it so as soon as the ball
goes<00:02:02.579> off<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.210> off<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> quiet<00:02:03.719> speed

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
goes off it's going off a quiet speed

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.770 
goes off it's going off a quiet speed
the<00:02:04.799> mud<00:02:05.009> might<00:02:05.189> drop<00:02:05.430> off<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.329> again<00:02:06.570> if

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
the mud might drop off so again if

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.199 
the mud might drop off so again if
that's<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.469> case<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.860> will<00:02:07.920> try<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:09.060> play

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that's the case I will try and just play

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.180 
that's the case I will try and just play
a<00:02:09.239> normal<00:02:09.330> shot<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.739> looks<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.039> it's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
a normal shot if it looks like it's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.520 
a normal shot if it looks like it's
caked<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.120> not<00:02:12.300> going<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.540> come<00:02:12.660> off

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
caked and it's not going to come off

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.650 
caked and it's not going to come off
I<00:02:13.650> was<00:02:14.459> always<00:02:14.640> told<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.390> what<00:02:15.510> i<00:02:15.540> use

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
I was always told and this is what i use

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.500 
I was always told and this is what i use
and<00:02:16.020> i<00:02:16.490> would<00:02:17.490> like<00:02:17.640> some<00:02:17.970> comments<00:02:18.360> down

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
and i would like some comments down

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.390 
and i would like some comments down
below<00:02:18.630> if<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.170> have<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.740> different<00:02:20.190> opinion

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
below if you have a different opinion

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.900 
below if you have a different opinion
because<00:02:20.790> i'm<00:02:21.709> not<00:02:22.709> sure<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.069> I'm<00:02:23.250> right<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.580> I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
because i'm not sure if I'm right and I

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.600 
because i'm not sure if I'm right and I
have<00:02:24.330> no<00:02:24.510> idea<00:02:24.630> why<00:02:25.020> but<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.860> was<00:02:26.130> always<00:02:26.280> told

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
have no idea why but I was always told

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.490 
have no idea why but I was always told
if<00:02:26.819> there<00:02:27.030> was<00:02:27.180> mud<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.600> one<00:02:27.780> side<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.290> ball

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
if there was mud on one side of the ball

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.900 
if there was mud on one side of the ball
it<00:02:28.950> will<00:02:29.130> tend<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.430> move<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> other

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
it will tend to move in the other

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.660 
it will tend to move in the other
direction<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:31.760> doesn't<00:02:32.760> kind<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:34.640> yeah<00:02:35.640> I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
direction that doesn't kind of yeah I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.210 
direction that doesn't kind of yeah I
don't<00:02:35.910> know<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.739> honestly<00:02:37.739> don't<00:02:37.860> know<00:02:38.010> why

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
don't know I honestly don't know why

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.490 
don't know I honestly don't know why
dude<00:02:38.910> I'm<00:02:39.180> kind<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.510> thinking<00:02:39.720> sort<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.410> is

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
dude I'm kind of thinking sort of is

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.260 
dude I'm kind of thinking sort of is
like<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> cricket<00:02:41.010> ball<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.910> know<00:02:42.030> how<00:02:42.150> they

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
like a cricket ball you know how they

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.030 
like a cricket ball you know how they
shine<00:02:42.510> up<00:02:42.690> one<00:02:42.870> side<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.170> make<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.770> move

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
shine up one side to make it move

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.540 
shine up one side to make it move
quicker<00:02:44.400> through<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.700> air<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.870> again<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> a

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
quicker through the air but again I a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.400 
quicker through the air but again I a
little<00:02:47.910> confused<00:02:48.420> with<00:02:48.540> us<00:02:48.660> again<00:02:48.840> if<00:02:49.080> you

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
little confused with us again if you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.960 
little confused with us again if you
actually<00:02:49.530> know<00:02:49.769> this<00:02:49.980> answered<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.550> get<00:02:50.760> get

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
actually know this answered you get get

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.610 
actually know this answered you get get
the<00:02:51.000> comment<00:02:51.360> down<00:02:51.510> below<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:52.260> that's

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the comment down below but that's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.790 
the comment down below but that's
certainly<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.400> strategy<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.390> I'm<00:02:54.800> employ

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
certainly the strategy that I'm employ

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.160 
certainly the strategy that I'm employ
so<00:02:56.640> if<00:02:56.760> I've<00:02:56.880> got<00:02:57.030> mud<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.360> one<00:02:57.690> side<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:58.110> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
so if I've got mud on one side of the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.809 
so if I've got mud on one side of the
ball<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.410> will<00:02:58.650> assume<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.250> going<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.459> move<00:02:59.670> in

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
ball I will assume it's going to move in

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.040 
ball I will assume it's going to move in
the<00:02:59.910> other<00:02:59.940> direction<00:03:01.970> but<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.510> nasty<00:03:03.690> one

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
the other direction but it's a nasty one

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.130 
the other direction but it's a nasty one
its<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.440> mud<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.040> always<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> nasty<00:03:05.760> one<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
its it mud is always a nasty one so the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.600 
its it mud is always a nasty one so the
other<00:03:07.260> one<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.500> do<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.709> if<00:03:07.830> I've<00:03:07.980> got<00:03:08.130> mud<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.400> i

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
other one I do is if I've got mud on i

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.250 
other one I do is if I've got mud on i
know<00:03:08.670> i'm<00:03:09.000> not<00:03:09.209> going<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.750> much

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
know i'm not going to have that much

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.530 
know i'm not going to have that much
control<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.980> sometimes<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.790> can<00:03:11.910> feel<00:03:11.940> unfair

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
control and sometimes it can feel unfair

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.420 
control and sometimes it can feel unfair
especially<00:03:12.810> if<00:03:13.110> you're<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.380> fairway<00:03:13.769> but

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
especially if you're on the fairway but

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.220 
especially if you're on the fairway but
i<00:03:14.459> will<00:03:14.670> certainly<00:03:15.000> take<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.300> more

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
i will certainly take a more

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.580 
i will certainly take a more
conservative<00:03:16.650> approach<00:03:18.170> when<00:03:19.170> i've<00:03:19.290> got<00:03:19.320> the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
conservative approach when i've got the

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.890 
conservative approach when i've got the
shot<00:03:19.829> just<00:03:20.220> because<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.459> know<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:21.450> ball<00:03:21.660> might

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
shot just because I know the ball might

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.550 
shot just because I know the ball might
do<00:03:22.140> anything<00:03:23.180> anyway<00:03:24.180> thanks<00:03:24.630> would<00:03:24.750> place<00:03:25.440> to

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
do anything anyway thanks would place to

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.590 
do anything anyway thanks would place to
check<00:03:25.709> another<00:03:25.890> video<00:03:26.160> yeah<00:03:27.000> like<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.269> said<00:03:27.360> get
