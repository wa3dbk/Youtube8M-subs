00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
you like writing the note rather than

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.050 
you like writing the note rather than
jumping<00:03:15.140> around<00:03:15.379> backwards<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:16.849> can<00:03:16.940> go

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
jumping around backwards so you can go

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.210

to<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.299> note<00:03:17.540> mm-hmm<00:03:18.079> what<00:03:18.650> we<00:03:18.769> have<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.040> here<00:03:19.159> is

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
to a note mm-hmm what we have in here is

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.619 
to a note mm-hmm what we have in here is
something<00:03:19.400> called<00:03:19.519> time<00:03:19.879> marks<00:03:20.209> if<00:03:20.329> we<00:03:20.420> press

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
something called time marks if we press

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.660 
something called time marks if we press
the<00:03:20.750> record<00:03:20.900> button<00:03:21.200> so<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.010> point<00:03:22.040> of<00:03:22.280> this<00:03:22.340> I

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
the record button so the point of this I

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.940 
the record button so the point of this I
guess<00:03:23.030> is<00:03:23.239> it's<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.930> real-life<00:03:24.139> application

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
guess is it's a real-life application

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
guess is it's a real-life application
you<00:03:25.010> know<00:03:25.099> someone<00:03:25.400> might<00:03:25.549> be<00:03:25.700> in<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.819> meeting

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
you know someone might be in a meeting

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.020 
you know someone might be in a meeting
they<00:03:26.750> might<00:03:26.930> be<00:03:27.109> taking<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.099> lecture<00:03:28.459> this<00:03:28.819> will

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
they might be taking a lecture this will

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.539 
they might be taking a lecture this will
then<00:03:29.150> record<00:03:29.299> all<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:29.900> my<00:03:30.170> voice<00:03:30.349> notes<00:03:30.709> if<00:03:31.430> I

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
then record all of my voice notes if I

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.240 
then record all of my voice notes if I
then<00:03:31.700> draw<00:03:32.030> beyond<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.959> they<00:03:33.739> select

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
then draw beyond that they select

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.910 
then draw beyond that they select
different<00:03:34.459> pens<00:03:34.790> hide

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.880 

so<00:03:38.520> draw<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.760> couple<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.150> notes<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.780> then<00:03:40.680> we

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
so draw a couple of notes and then we

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.729 
so draw a couple of notes and then we
stop<00:03:41.490> the<00:03:41.610> recording<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:43.080> go<00:03:43.230> back<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.530> play

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
stop the recording and go back to play
