00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
working for me i'm going to try it one

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.850 
working for me i'm going to try it one
more<00:02:15.790> time<00:02:16.020> because<00:02:17.020> i<00:02:17.170> know<00:02:17.230> people<00:02:17.650> love<00:02:17.800> it

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
more time because i know people love it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.070 
more time because i know people love it
and<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:19.300> know<00:02:19.330> if<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.540> doesn't<00:02:19.780> work<00:02:19.870> for<00:02:20.050> me

and you know if it doesn't work for me
maybe<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.709> propose<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.550> do<00:02:21.880> like<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:23.160> watch

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
maybe I propose that we do like a watch

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.880 
maybe I propose that we do like a watch
or<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.670> swap<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.690> products<00:02:26.410> like<00:02:26.650> maybe

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
or a swap of products like maybe

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.040 
or a swap of products like maybe
something<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.849> gently<00:02:28.269> use<00:02:28.599> that<00:02:28.930> you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
something that you gently use that you

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.400 
something that you gently use that you
use<00:02:29.290> once<00:02:29.739> or<00:02:29.950> twice<00:02:30.099> literally<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.569> it

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
use once or twice literally and it

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.110 
use once or twice literally and it
didn't<00:02:32.650> work<00:02:32.680> on<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.489> somebody<00:02:33.940> else
