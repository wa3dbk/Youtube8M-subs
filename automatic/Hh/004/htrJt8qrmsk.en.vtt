00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
foil so that's what I'm going to use now

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.840 
foil so that's what I'm going to use now
once<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.189> base<00:01:08.369> color<00:01:08.580> which<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
once you have your base color which is

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.550 
once you have your base color which is
not<00:01:09.090> always<00:01:09.240> necessary<00:01:09.540> don't<00:01:10.110> always<00:01:10.380> need

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
not always necessary don't always need

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.140 
not always necessary don't always need
to<00:01:10.680> use<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> base<00:01:11.159> color<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.880> decided

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
to use a base color but I just decided

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.480 
to use a base color but I just decided
to<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.659> instance<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.680> want<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.010> paint<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
to in this instance you want to paint a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.510 
to in this instance you want to paint a
thin<00:01:14.790> layer<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.570> glue<00:01:15.840> onto<00:01:16.170> your<00:01:17.159> nail

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
thin layer of the glue onto your nail

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.320 
thin layer of the glue onto your nail
now<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.240> goes<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:18.990> sort<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.409> weird<00:01:20.330> UV

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
now it goes on to this sort of weird UV

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.780 
now it goes on to this sort of weird UV
kind<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.930> bluish<00:01:22.320> color<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> dries

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
kind of bluish color but that dries

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.070 
kind of bluish color but that dries
clear<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.330> don't<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.720> worry<00:01:24.960> about

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
clear so you don't have to worry about

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.679 
clear so you don't have to worry about
that<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.430> most<00:01:26.640> important<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.600> part

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that and then the most important a part

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.710 
that and then the most important a part
about<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.740> think<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.729> waiting<00:01:30.420> four

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
about this I think is waiting four

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.140 
about this I think is waiting four
minutes<00:01:31.079> now<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.310> just<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.520> particular<00:01:32.820> piece

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
minutes now this just a particular piece

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.870 
minutes now this just a particular piece
of<00:01:33.180> footage<00:01:33.360> has<00:01:33.990> was<00:01:34.500> actually<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.189> full<00:01:35.610> four

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
of footage has was actually a full four

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880 
of footage has was actually a full four
minutes<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.390> speeded<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.650> only

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
minutes but I speeded it up so it's only

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.890 
minutes but I speeded it up so it's only
a<00:01:37.950> few<00:01:38.130> seconds<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.329> shows<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.750> how

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
a few seconds but it shows you how

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.870 
a few seconds but it shows you how
quickly<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.439> dries<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:41.130> how<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.460> drives<00:01:41.640> over

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
quickly it dries well how it drives over

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.810 
quickly it dries well how it drives over
the<00:01:42.060> four<00:01:42.270> minutes<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> don't<00:01:44.490> wait

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the four minutes but if you don't wait

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.240 
the four minutes but if you don't wait
for<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.240> long<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
for that long then this is not going to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.340 
for that long then this is not going to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
curved line almost like a curved french

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.949 
curved line almost like a curved french
tip<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.639> then<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.329> want<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.569> paint<00:03:36.750> your

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
tip and then you want to paint your

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.199 
tip and then you want to paint your
lines<00:03:37.260> coming<00:03:37.680> from<00:03:37.980> your<00:03:38.130> critical<00:03:38.579> down<00:03:38.940> and

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
lines coming from your critical down and

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.589 
lines coming from your critical down and
then<00:03:40.139> what<00:03:40.470> you'll<00:03:40.620> do<00:03:40.829> is<00:03:41.160> put<00:03:42.090> some<00:03:42.269> curved

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
then what you'll do is put some curved

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.830 
then what you'll do is put some curved
lines<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:43.739> before<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.549> cuticle<00:03:45.090> so<00:03:45.690> that

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
lines just before the cuticle so that

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.240 
lines just before the cuticle so that
you<00:03:45.959> can<00:03:46.169> make<00:03:46.319> your<00:03:46.470> butt<00:03:46.620> affordance<00:03:47.069> and

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
you can make your butt affordance and

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:56.730 
you can make your butt affordance and
then<00:03:47.639> paint<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.150> black<00:03:48.440> above<00:03:49.440> that

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:12.020
