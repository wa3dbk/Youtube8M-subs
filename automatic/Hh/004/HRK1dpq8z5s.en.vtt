so like I was saying this will actually

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.199 
so like I was saying this will actually
take<00:02:37.230> two<00:02:37.469> or<00:02:37.739> three<00:02:37.769> double<00:02:38.400> A<00:02:38.489> batteries<00:02:38.519> and

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
than one lithium ion battery which you

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.909 
than one lithium ion battery which you
can<00:02:56.489> use<00:02:56.849> two<00:02:57.269> or<00:02:57.299> three<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.319> nickel<00:02:58.889> metal

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
can use two or three of the nickel metal

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.069 
can use two or three of the nickel metal
hydride<00:02:59.129> or<00:02:59.519> alkaline<00:03:00.060> batteries<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> nice

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
hydride or alkaline batteries so a nice

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.330 
hydride or alkaline batteries so a nice
option<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:01.680> not<00:03:01.709> going<00:03:01.919> to<00:03:01.980> give<00:03:02.099> you<00:03:02.189> higher

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
option it's not going to give you higher

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.339 
option it's not going to give you higher
output<00:03:02.819> but<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.359> do<00:03:03.480> get<00:03:03.659> better<00:03:03.810> run<00:03:04.109> time

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
output but you do get better run time

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.069 
output but you do get better run time
which<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:05.099> be<00:03:05.250> very<00:03:05.489> very<00:03:05.609> useful<00:03:06.209> especially

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
which can be very very useful especially

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.659 
which can be very very useful especially
if<00:03:07.530> you're<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.709> earth<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.159> field<00:03:08.400> where

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
if you're in earth in a field where

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.789 
if you're in earth in a field where
you're<00:03:08.879> using<00:03:09.359> your<00:03:09.510> light<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> lot<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.590> don't

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
you're using your light a lot you don't

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:11.929 
you're using your light a lot you don't
have<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.069> keep<00:03:11.159> on<00:03:11.310> swapping<00:03:11.730> out<00:03:11.819> the

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
have to keep on swapping out the

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.670 
have to keep on swapping out the
batteries<00:03:12.299> but<00:03:12.989> anyway<00:03:13.200> we're<00:03:13.379> gonna<00:03:13.469> go

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
batteries but anyway we're gonna go

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.709 
batteries but anyway we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.010> put<00:03:14.159> a<00:03:14.370> sanyo<00:03:15.030> eneloop<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.540> here

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:15.719 
ahead and put a sanyo eneloop in here

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.170 
ahead and put a sanyo eneloop in here
nickel<00:03:16.019> metal<00:03:16.109> hydride<00:03:16.260> battery<00:03:17.000> put<00:03:18.000> that

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
nickel metal hydride battery put that

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.030 
nickel metal hydride battery put that
tail<00:03:18.359> cap<00:03:18.569> back<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.260> show<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:19.889> the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
tail cap back on and show you the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.430 
tail cap back on and show you the
interface<00:03:20.489> on<00:03:20.699> here<00:03:21.139> so<00:03:22.139> here's<00:03:22.319> the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
interface on here so here's the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.990 
interface on here so here's the
interface<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.220> interface<00:03:23.549> is<00:03:23.729> another

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
interface and the interface is another

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.460 
interface and the interface is another
reason<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.359> find<00:03:24.510> myself<00:03:24.690> using<00:03:25.079> it<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.409> much

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
reason I find myself using it so much

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.199 
reason I find myself using it so much
because<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.370> can<00:03:26.459> get<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.699> that<00:03:26.849> right<00:03:27.060> to

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
because you can get to that right to

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.699 
because you can get to that right to
that<00:03:27.359> low<00:03:27.510> output<00:03:27.780> that<00:03:28.109> I<00:03:28.139> was<00:03:28.319> talking<00:03:28.650> about

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
that low output that I was talking about

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.610 
that low output that I was talking about
from<00:03:29.489> off<00:03:29.729> so<00:03:30.419> same<00:03:30.659> interface<00:03:31.079> as<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.379> find

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
from off so same interface as you find

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.649 
from off so same interface as you find
on<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.769> new<00:03:31.919> s10<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.340> s20<00:03:32.970> if<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.239> press<00:03:33.479> and

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
on the new s10 and s20 if you press and

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.780 
on the new s10 and s20 if you press and
hold<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:34.019> switch<00:03:34.349> they<00:03:34.979> learn<00:03:35.189> how<00:03:35.400> long<00:03:35.639> you

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
hold that switch they learn how long you

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
hold that switch they learn how long you
hold<00:03:35.939> it's<00:03:36.180> not<00:03:36.299> going<00:03:36.419> to<00:03:36.479> cycle<00:03:36.629> through

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
hold it's not going to cycle through

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.629 
hold it's not going to cycle through
other<00:03:37.049> outputs<00:03:37.439> or<00:03:37.590> anything<00:03:37.889> it's<00:03:38.310> gonna<00:03:38.430> go

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
other outputs or anything it's gonna go

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.580 
other outputs or anything it's gonna go
right<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.849> that<00:03:38.970> lowest<00:03:39.329> output<00:03:39.659> which<00:03:40.409> is<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
right to that lowest output which is the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.589 
right to that lowest output which is the
perfect<00:03:40.769> amount<00:03:41.129> of<00:03:41.250> light<00:03:41.459> for<00:03:42.030> your<00:03:42.180> eyes<00:03:42.329> or

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
perfect amount of light for your eyes or

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.390 
perfect amount of light for your eyes or
adjusted<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.169> darkness<00:03:43.530> or<00:03:43.949> you<00:03:44.129> turn<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
adjusted to the darkness or you turn the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.619 
adjusted to the darkness or you turn the
lights<00:03:44.609> off<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:45.120> want<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.329> see<00:03:45.419> something

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
lights off and you want to see something

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:46.819 
lights off and you want to see something
that's<00:03:45.810> going<00:03:46.079> on<00:03:46.139> right<00:03:46.199> in<00:03:46.409> front<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.739> you

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
that's going on right in front of you

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.439 
that's going on right in front of you
like<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.489> said<00:03:47.669> when<00:03:47.849> I<00:03:47.879> don't<00:03:48.060> want<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.239> wake<00:03:48.329> my

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
like I said when I don't want to wake my

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.179 
like I said when I don't want to wake my
wife<00:03:48.479> up<00:03:48.780> at<00:03:48.870> night<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.049> grab<00:03:49.409> this<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.859> go<00:03:50.009> right

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.890 
wife up at night I grab this I go right
to<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.729> can<00:03:51.030> see<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.299> ground<00:03:51.449> in<00:03:51.629> front<00:03:51.720> of

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
to that I can see the ground in front of

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.240 
to that I can see the ground in front of
me<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.379> know<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.500> can<00:03:52.650> see<00:03:52.769> stuff<00:03:52.979> on<00:03:53.159> our

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
me you know I can see stuff on our

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.610 
me you know I can see stuff on our
nightstand<00:03:53.729> a<00:03:54.000> great<00:03:54.780> amount<00:03:55.079> of<00:03:55.139> light<00:03:55.290> for

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
nightstand a great amount of light for

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.039 
nightstand a great amount of light for
low<00:03:55.979> light<00:03:56.129> situations<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:57.389> all<00:03:57.540> can<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.930> can

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
low light situations you all can you can

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.050 
low light situations you all can you can
also<00:03:58.199> get<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.769> max<00:03:59.009> output<00:03:59.489> from<00:03:59.669> off<00:03:59.849> if

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
also get to the max output from off if

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.819 
also get to the max output from off if
you<00:04:00.150> double<00:04:00.509> click<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:01.259> if<00:04:01.319> you<00:04:01.409> just<00:04:01.560> double

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
you double click so if you just double

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.559 
you double click so if you just double
click<00:04:02.009> real<00:04:02.220> quickly<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:03.000> get<00:04:03.120> right<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.419> that

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
click real quickly you get right to that

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.780 
click real quickly you get right to that
max<00:04:03.840> output<00:04:04.319> so<00:04:05.189> you<00:04:05.280> get<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.579> lowest

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
max output so you get to the lowest

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.420 
max output so you get to the lowest
output<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.509> highest<00:04:06.930> output<00:04:07.079> from<00:04:07.439> off<00:04:07.650> super

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
output and highest output from off super

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.189 
output and highest output from off super
useful<00:04:08.759> feature<00:04:08.939> so<00:04:09.720> when<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:09.959> have<00:04:10.079> it

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
useful feature so when you have it

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.890 
useful feature so when you have it
turned<00:04:10.409> on<00:04:10.560> press<00:04:10.829> and<00:04:11.189> hold<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.750> it'll<00:04:12.750> cycle

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
turned on press and hold and it'll cycle

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.550 
turned on press and hold and it'll cycle
through<00:04:13.379> your<00:04:14.009> different<00:04:14.159> outputs<00:04:15.349> so<00:04:16.349> you<00:04:16.409> do

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
through your different outputs so you do

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.930 
through your different outputs so you do
have<00:04:16.590> other<00:04:16.889> outputs<00:04:17.310> in<00:04:17.430> there<00:04:17.579> but<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.909> can

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
have other outputs in there but you can

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.029 
have other outputs in there but you can
get<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.269> lowest<00:04:18.599> and<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.870> highest<00:04:19.039> from

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
get to the lowest and the highest from

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.480 
get to the lowest and the highest from
off<00:04:20.299> pretty<00:04:21.299> nice<00:04:21.479> interface

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
off pretty nice interface

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.890 
off pretty nice interface
you<00:04:23.490> also<00:04:23.610> have<00:04:23.789> strobe<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.360> there<00:04:24.510> so<00:04:24.719> if<00:04:24.779> you

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
you also have strobe in there so if you

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.750 
you also have strobe in there so if you
have<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.080> turned<00:04:25.260> on<00:04:25.440> double<00:04:26.219> click<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.669> you

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
have it turned on double click and you

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.560 
have it turned on double click and you
have<00:04:26.849> strobe<00:04:27.240> is

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
have strobe is

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.880 
have strobe is
well<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:28.020> if<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.140> don't<00:04:28.290> happen<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.500> need<00:04:28.680> that

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
well so if you don't happen to need that

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.010 
well so if you don't happen to need that
it's<00:04:29.520> really<00:04:29.760> easy<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:30.060> access<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:30.960> we

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
it's really easy to access that so we

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.390 
it's really easy to access that so we
can<00:04:31.140> real<00:04:31.290> quick<00:04:31.440> on<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.650> interface<00:04:31.980> press

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
can real quick on the interface press

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.210 
can real quick on the interface press
and<00:04:32.610> hold<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:33.060> you<00:04:33.120> have<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.630> lowest<00:04:34.020> output

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
and hold and you have that lowest output

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.380 
and hold and you have that lowest output
double<00:04:35.220> click<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.670> have<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.880> max<00:04:36.120> output

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
double click and you have the max output

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.150 
double click and you have the max output
and<00:04:36.870> then<00:04:37.170> when<00:04:37.260> you<00:04:37.350> have<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.470> turned<00:04:37.680> on<00:04:37.950> if

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
and then when you have it turned on if

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.860 
and then when you have it turned on if
you<00:04:38.250> press<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:38.550> hold<00:04:38.730> you'll<00:04:39.360> cycle<00:04:39.720> through

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
you press and hold you'll cycle through

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.140 
you press and hold you'll cycle through
your<00:04:39.900> different<00:04:40.110> outputs<00:04:41.030> double-click<00:04:42.030> for

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
your different outputs double-click for

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.910 
your different outputs double-click for
strobe<00:04:42.420> when<00:04:42.600> it's<00:04:42.720> on<00:04:42.870> all<00:04:43.560> right<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:43.800> that's

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
strobe when it's on all right so that's

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.890 
strobe when it's on all right so that's
the<00:04:44.040> interface<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.790> s10<00:04:45.240> let<00:04:45.630> me<00:04:45.720> go<00:04:45.840> ahead

that s 15 baton so let it cycle through
the<00:05:30.570> different<00:05:30.600> outputs<00:05:31.460> so<00:05:32.460> there<00:05:32.580> it<00:05:32.640> is<00:05:32.700> on

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
the different outputs so there it is on

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.570 
the different outputs so there it is on
max<00:05:33.060> output<00:05:33.530> you<00:05:34.530> see<00:05:34.710> not<00:05:34.830> too<00:05:35.010> bad<00:05:35.190> for<00:05:35.490> a

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
max output you see not too bad for a

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.900 
max output you see not too bad for a

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
you see it a little bit better so pretty

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.800 
you see it a little bit better so pretty

put a lithium-ion battery in here but
you're<00:05:56.310> not<00:05:56.460> really<00:05:56.610> gonna<00:05:56.760> get<00:05:56.910> that<00:05:57.030> much

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
you're not really gonna get that much

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.520 
you're not really gonna get that much
more<00:05:57.360> performance<00:05:57.660> unlike<00:05:58.230> some<00:05:58.410> other

more performance unlike some other

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.960 
more performance unlike some other
lights<00:05:58.770> they<00:05:58.980> really<00:05:59.190> optimize<00:05:59.550> it<00:05:59.760> for<00:05:59.790> the

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
lights they really optimize it for the

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.540 
lights they really optimize it for the
nickel<00:06:00.180> metal<00:06:00.210> hydrides<00:06:00.750> and<00:06:01.070> outlines<00:06:02.070> so

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
nickel metal hydrides and outlines so

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.070 
nickel metal hydrides and outlines so
the<00:06:02.820> lithium<00:06:03.180> ions<00:06:03.450> you<00:06:03.570> just<00:06:03.690> gonna<00:06:03.840> eat<00:06:03.960> you

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
the lithium ions you just gonna eat you

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.790 
the lithium ions you just gonna eat you

slightly higher output recycle through
those<00:06:08.060> outputs<00:06:09.060> again<00:06:09.570> just<00:06:09.840> a<00:06:09.900> little<00:06:10.080> bit

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
those outputs again just a little bit

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.540 
those outputs again just a little bit
closer<00:06:10.380> level<00:06:10.770> interesting<00:06:11.220> see<00:06:11.370> what<00:06:11.460> they

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
closer level interesting see what they

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.050 
closer level interesting see what they
look<00:06:11.700> like<00:06:13.160> and<00:06:14.160> on<00:06:14.280> the<00:06:14.370> very<00:06:14.460> lowest<00:06:14.790> one

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
look like and on the very lowest one

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.960 
look like and on the very lowest one
that<00:06:15.210> moonlight<00:06:15.600> mode<00:06:16.520> that<00:06:17.520> you<00:06:17.580> can<00:06:17.670> see<00:06:17.790> for

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
that moonlight mode that you can see for

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.940 
that moonlight mode that you can see for
up<00:06:18.060> close<00:06:18.090> kind<00:06:18.570> of<00:06:18.630> stuff<00:06:18.870> is<00:06:19.230> perfect<00:06:19.740> I

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
up close kind of stuff is perfect I

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.100 
up close kind of stuff is perfect I
usually<00:06:20.610> keep<00:06:20.730> the<00:06:20.880> camera<00:06:21.270> adjusted<00:06:22.020> to

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
usually keep the camera adjusted to

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.140 
usually keep the camera adjusted to
about<00:06:22.320> like<00:06:22.500> how<00:06:22.650> I<00:06:22.680> would<00:06:22.890> have<00:06:23.040> it<00:06:23.190> but<00:06:24.030> how<00:06:24.120> I

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
about like how I would have it but how I

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.080 
about like how I would have it but how I
see<00:06:24.480> it<00:06:24.510> with<00:06:25.110> my<00:06:25.140> eyes<00:06:25.500> and<00:06:25.920> looking<00:06:26.730> at<00:06:26.820> Mike

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
see it with my eyes and looking at Mike

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.430 
see it with my eyes and looking at Mike
and<00:06:27.120> and<00:06:27.600> I'm<00:06:27.660> looking<00:06:27.840> at<00:06:27.990> the<00:06:28.140> the

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
and and I'm looking at the the

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.560 
and and I'm looking at the the
viewfinder<00:06:28.650> is<00:06:29.010> pretty<00:06:29.220> accurate<00:06:29.430> so<00:06:29.790> pretty

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
viewfinder is pretty accurate so pretty

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.640 
viewfinder is pretty accurate so pretty
good<00:06:30.720> for<00:06:30.840> up<00:06:30.930> close<00:06:30.960> kind<00:06:31.380> of<00:06:31.470> stuff

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
good for up close kind of stuff

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.870 
good for up close kind of stuff
obviously<00:06:31.920> it's<00:06:32.280> not<00:06:32.370> going<00:06:32.550> to<00:06:32.610> do<00:06:32.730> any<00:06:32.850> kind

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
obviously it's not going to do any kind

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.700 
obviously it's not going to do any kind
of<00:06:33.090> distance<00:06:33.450> I'm<00:06:33.960> shining<00:06:34.200> it<00:06:34.380> down<00:06:34.530> at<00:06:34.650> the

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
of distance I'm shining it down at the

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.119 
of distance I'm shining it down at the
dock<00:06:34.890> house<00:06:35.100> you<00:06:35.370> know<00:06:35.460> you're<00:06:35.550> not<00:06:35.610> gonna<00:06:35.760> see

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:36.129 
dock house you know you're not gonna see

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.129 
dock house you know you're not gonna see
out<00:06:36.219> there<00:06:36.429> you<00:06:37.239> got<00:06:37.389> something<00:06:37.689> inside<00:06:37.839> your

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
out there you got something inside your

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.839 
out there you got something inside your
tent<00:06:38.349> or<00:06:38.499> inside<00:06:38.770> your<00:06:38.800> pack<00:06:39.129> or<00:06:39.429> inside<00:06:39.669> your

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
tent or inside your pack or inside your

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:42.119 
tent or inside your pack or inside your
house<00:06:39.999> up<00:06:40.629> close<00:06:40.899> stuff<00:06:41.169> that<00:06:41.439> lowest<00:06:41.830> level

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:42.129 
house up close stuff that lowest level

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:43.049 
house up close stuff that lowest level
is<00:06:42.219> perfect<00:06:42.399> for<00:06:42.729> that

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:43.059 
is perfect for that

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:45.649 
is perfect for that
let's<00:06:43.479> try<00:06:43.599> a<00:06:43.629> little<00:06:43.839> bit<00:06:43.959> longer<00:06:44.080> distance

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:45.659 
let's try a little bit longer distance

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:47.549 
let's try a little bit longer distance
all<00:06:46.659> right<00:06:46.719> so<00:06:46.899> we<00:06:46.989> have<00:06:47.019> some<00:06:47.110> more<00:06:47.349> distance

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:47.559 
all right so we have some more distance

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:50.070 
all right so we have some more distance
to<00:06:47.769> use<00:06:48.039> to<00:06:48.189> s15<00:06:48.819> let's<00:06:49.360> go<00:06:49.539> and<00:06:49.689> try<00:06:49.809> it<00:06:49.929> out

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
to use to s15 let's go and try it out

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.559 
to use to s15 let's go and try it out
see<00:06:50.289> how<00:06:50.409> it<00:06:50.439> does<00:06:50.709> so<00:06:51.550> bowed<00:06:52.119> out<00:06:52.300> there<00:06:52.479> at

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:52.569 
see how it does so bowed out there at

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.389 
see how it does so bowed out there at
about<00:06:52.659> 20<00:06:53.050> feet<00:06:53.169> away<00:06:53.319> you<00:06:53.979> can<00:06:54.069> see<00:06:54.159> the<00:06:54.249> two

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:54.399 
about 20 feet away you can see the two

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.339 
about 20 feet away you can see the two
targets<00:06:54.789> that<00:06:54.879> I<00:06:54.969> used<00:06:55.239> for<00:06:55.539> the<00:06:55.689> comparison

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:56.349 
targets that I used for the comparison

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.379 
targets that I used for the comparison
 videos<00:06:57.099> out<00:06:57.279> there<00:06:57.519> first<00:06:58.209> things

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
 videos out there first things

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:00.269 
 videos out there first things
out<00:06:58.509> there<00:06:58.659> are<00:06:58.749> 50<00:06:59.019> yards<00:06:59.379> doesn't<00:07:00.159> really

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:00.279 
out there are 50 yards doesn't really

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:01.350 
out there are 50 yards doesn't really
make<00:07:00.429> it<00:07:00.459> up<00:07:00.639> to<00:07:00.729> the<00:07:00.819> second<00:07:01.119> one<00:07:01.209> although

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
make it up to the second one although

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.119 
make it up to the second one although
well<00:07:01.629> topped<00:07:01.929> out<00:07:02.050> about<00:07:02.229> 100<00:07:02.559> yards<00:07:02.860> and<00:07:03.069> in

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:03.129 
well topped out about 100 yards and in

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:05.850 
well topped out about 100 yards and in
the<00:07:03.189> treeline<00:07:03.399> beyond<00:07:03.849> is<00:07:04.119> 130<00:07:04.779> yards<00:07:04.959> this<00:07:05.709> is

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
the treeline beyond is 130 yards this is

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.159 
the treeline beyond is 130 yards this is
a<00:07:05.889> compact<00:07:06.339> light<00:07:06.639> and<00:07:07.209> this<00:07:07.419> is<00:07:07.539> Georgia<00:07:07.869> and

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169 
a compact light and this is Georgia and

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:10.739 
a compact light and this is Georgia and
it's<00:07:08.349> a<00:07:08.439> really<00:07:08.589> humid<00:07:08.979> night<00:07:09.009> so<00:07:09.639> you<00:07:10.599> don't

00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:10.749 
it's a really humid night so you don't

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:12.209 
it's a really humid night so you don't
really<00:07:10.839> expect<00:07:10.990> it<00:07:11.289> to<00:07:11.379> do<00:07:11.529> great<00:07:11.769> distances

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:12.219 
really expect it to do great distances

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:14.489 
really expect it to do great distances
but<00:07:12.879> you<00:07:12.999> can<00:07:13.119> see<00:07:13.269> single<00:07:13.569> double-a<00:07:14.019> battery

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:14.499 
but you can see single double-a battery

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:16.889 
but you can see single double-a battery
