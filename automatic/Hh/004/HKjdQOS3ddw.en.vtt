00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.330 

I've<00:00:07.890> chosen<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.429> pattern<00:00:08.849> now<00:00:09.240> um<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:10.190> cheated<00:00:11.190> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
I've chosen a pattern now um I cheated a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.410 
I've chosen a pattern now um I cheated a
little<00:00:11.580> bit<00:00:11.700> because<00:00:11.820> I've<00:00:12.000> already<00:00:12.150> bought

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
little bit because I've already bought

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.940 
little bit because I've already bought
my<00:00:12.599> pattern<00:00:13.019> but<00:00:13.200> what<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.590> would<00:00:13.740> normally

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
my pattern but what you would normally

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.340 
my pattern but what you would normally
do<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.120> will<00:00:15.240> go<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.570> pattern<00:00:15.900> company

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
do is you will go to the pattern company

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.340 
do is you will go to the pattern company
and<00:00:16.560> or<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> fabric<00:00:18.270> store<00:00:18.449> rather<00:00:18.720> and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
and or to the fabric store rather and

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.900 
and or to the fabric store rather and
you<00:00:19.470> will<00:00:19.590> look<00:00:19.710> at<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> pattern<00:00:20.279> company<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
you will look at the pattern company the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.310 
you will look at the pattern company the
big<00:00:21.119> books<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.660> they<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:21.930> back<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
big books that they have back in the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.500 
big books that they have back in the
pattern<00:00:22.619> company<00:00:23.269> section<00:00:24.269> where<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
pattern company section where the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.420 
pattern company section where the
patterns<00:00:24.869> are<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.619> actually<00:00:25.859> flip<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> book

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
patterns are you actually flip the book

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.670 
patterns are you actually flip the book
open<00:00:26.789> find<00:00:27.060> your<00:00:27.359> picture<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.289> then<00:00:28.560> you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
open find your picture and then you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.380 
open find your picture and then you
would<00:00:28.830> look<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.160> see<00:00:29.189> what<00:00:29.519> size<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.000> purchase

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
would look to see what size to purchase

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.799 
would look to see what size to purchase
well<00:00:31.170> remember<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> last<00:00:33.300> chapter

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
well remember in just the last chapter

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.049 
well remember in just the last chapter
we<00:00:34.500> were<00:00:34.620> learning<00:00:34.860> how<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.190> measure

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
we were learning how to measure

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.389 
we were learning how to measure
ourselves<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.320> remember<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> measured

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
ourselves and remember I measured

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.869 
ourselves and remember I measured
raelynne<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.210> she<00:00:39.570> measured<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.050> 39<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.829> 29<00:00:41.700> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
raelynne and she measured a 39 a 29 and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.779 
raelynne and she measured a 39 a 29 and
42<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:43.559> I've<00:00:43.649> already<00:00:43.950> chosen<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.370> pattern<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
42 so I've already chosen a pattern and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.590 
42 so I've already chosen a pattern and
that's<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> work<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.480> her

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
that's going to work for her

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.420 
that's going to work for her
measurements<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
measurements and so what we're going to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.010 
measurements and so what we're going to
do<00:00:47.550> now<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.030> we're<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> closer

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
do now is we're going to get a closer

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.439 
do now is we're going to get a closer
look<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.559> look<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.610> back<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.059> pattern

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
look up look at the back of the pattern

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.020 
look up look at the back of the pattern
so<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.170> see<00:00:52.559> how<00:00:53.129> much<00:00:53.280> fabric<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.789> need<00:00:53.940> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
so we can see how much fabric we need to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.389 
so we can see how much fabric we need to
purchase<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:54.989> sewing<00:00:55.469> notions<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.070> we

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
purchase and what sewing notions that we

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.599 
purchase and what sewing notions that we
need<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> purchase<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.270> our<00:00:57.420> project<00:00:58.460> now<00:00:59.460> as

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
need to purchase for our project now as

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.220 
need to purchase for our project now as
you<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.879> see<00:00:59.940> I've<00:01:00.390> already<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you can see I've already this is the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.810 
you can see I've already this is the
back<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.620> pattern<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.190> I've<00:01:02.640> already

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
back of the pattern and I've already

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.939 
back of the pattern and I've already
circled<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> measurements<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:04.650> going

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
circled the measurements that I'm going

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.910 
circled the measurements that I'm going
to<00:01:05.070> use<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.519> rail<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.939> skirt<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:07.530> see<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> have

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
to use for rail and skirt you see I have

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.130 
to use for rail and skirt you see I have
chosen<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.430> size<00:01:08.640> 16<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.479> her<00:01:09.600> her

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
chosen the size 16 for her her

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.310 
chosen the size 16 for her her
measurements<00:01:10.470> were<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.070> 39<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.939> 29<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.869> 42

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
measurements were a 39 a 29 and a 42

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.080 
measurements were a 39 a 29 and a 42
well<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.220> see<00:01:14.369> we're<00:01:14.520> off<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.060> little

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
well we can see we're off just a little

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.789 
well we can see we're off just a little
bit<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.720> as<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.140> mentioned<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.470> pattern

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
bit but as I mentioned the pattern

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.649 
bit but as I mentioned the pattern
companies<00:01:17.130> give<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.460> little<00:01:17.670> bit<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.970> room

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
companies give you a little bit of room

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.840 
companies give you a little bit of room
to<00:01:18.720> play<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.189> chose<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.490> size

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
to play with on that so we chose a size

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.840 
to play with on that so we chose a size
16<00:01:21.420> pattern<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:21.990> her<00:01:22.280> now<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.610> see

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
16 pattern for her now as you can see

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.370 
16 pattern for her now as you can see
here's<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> close-up<00:01:24.479> look<00:01:24.900> at<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> back<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
here's a close-up look at the back of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.499 
here's a close-up look at the back of
the<00:01:25.590> pattern<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.970> see<00:01:27.180> here's<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the pattern as you can see here's a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.929 
the pattern as you can see here's a
suggestion<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> fabrics<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.670> saying
