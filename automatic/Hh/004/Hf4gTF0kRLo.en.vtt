to<00:01:15.229> just<00:01:15.440> barely<00:01:15.799> stick<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:16.880> use<00:01:17.060> onion<00:01:17.450> sets

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
to just barely stick we use onion sets

to just barely stick we use onion sets
around<00:01:18.110> here<00:01:18.350> which<00:01:19.100> means<00:01:19.280> we<00:01:19.430> don't<00:01:19.610> plant

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
around here which means we don't plant

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.700 
around here which means we don't plant
from<00:01:20.119> seed<00:01:20.390> someone<00:01:20.900> else<00:01:21.049> plants<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.470> seed

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
from seed someone else plants the seed

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.480 
from seed someone else plants the seed
and<00:01:22.040> then<00:01:22.640> we<00:01:22.909> buy<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.260> bunch<00:01:24.260> of<00:01:24.680> onions<00:01:25.010> it's<00:01:25.310> a

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.900 
shallow when you plant your onions if
you<00:02:11.090> put<00:02:11.269> them<00:02:11.329> in<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.569> ground<00:02:12.010> very<00:02:13.010> deep<00:02:13.370> the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
you put them in the ground very deep the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.910 
you put them in the ground very deep the
ground<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:14.450> guess<00:02:14.540> compacts<00:02:15.230> around<00:02:15.590> them<00:02:15.739> for

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
ground I guess compacts around them for

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.770 
ground I guess compacts around them for
whatever<00:02:16.069> reason<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:17.120> doesn't<00:02:17.360> let<00:02:17.660> them

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
whatever reason it doesn't let them

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.190 
whatever reason it doesn't let them
expand

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
expand

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.300

got some other things playing here some

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.740 
got some other things playing here some
carrots<00:02:24.440> that's<00:02:24.739> some<00:02:24.890> carrots<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.569> did

carrots that's some carrots and I did
some<00:02:26.959> buckwheat<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.739> planted<00:02:28.190> last<00:02:28.400> year

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
some buckwheat that I planted last year

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.850 
some buckwheat that I planted last year
that's<00:02:28.879> coming<00:02:29.390> up<00:02:29.510> again<00:02:29.870> kind<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.290> voluntary

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
that's coming up again kind of voluntary

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.780 
that's coming up again kind of voluntary
but<00:02:31.840> again<00:02:32.840> some<00:02:33.050> more<00:02:33.200> onions<00:02:36.430> but<00:02:37.430> it's<00:02:37.580> just

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
but again some more onions but it's just

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.670 
but again some more onions but it's just
as<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.090> can<00:02:38.390> see<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.720> top<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:38.959> that<00:02:39.170> onion<00:02:39.380> is

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
as you can see the top of that onion is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.290 
as you can see the top of that onion is
above<00:02:40.010> ground<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.489> I've<00:02:40.640> got<00:02:40.819> a<00:02:40.849> layer<00:02:41.090> of

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
above ground and I've got a layer of

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.449 
above ground and I've got a layer of
compost<00:02:41.720> on<00:02:41.989> top<00:02:42.019> of<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.530> probably<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.950> half

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
compost on top of it probably a half

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.820 
compost on top of it probably a half
inch<00:02:43.790> thick<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:44.959> barely<00:02:45.319> put<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
inch thick so I just barely put the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.140 
inch thick so I just barely put the
onion<00:02:46.130> in<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.549> looked<00:02:46.760> like<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.060> was

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
onion in there it looked like it was

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.940 
onion in there it looked like it was
struggling<00:02:47.599> for<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.870> while<00:02:47.959> look<00:02:48.590> like<00:02:48.769> it

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
struggling for a while look like it

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.430 
struggling for a while look like it
really<00:02:49.220> wasn't<00:02:49.400> going<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.670> grow<00:02:50.349> until<00:02:51.349> we

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
really wasn't going to grow until we

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.400 
really wasn't going to grow until we
start<00:02:52.390> that's<00:02:53.390> why<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.569> put<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.840> compost<00:02:54.230> on

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
start that's why I put the compost on

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.449 
start that's why I put the compost on
top<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.690> we<00:02:57.590> started<00:02:57.920> getting<00:02:58.400> a

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
top and and and we started getting a

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.589 
top and and and we started getting a
little<00:02:58.549> bit<00:02:58.670> more<00:02:58.849> ranger<00:02:59.239> actually<00:02:59.569> I

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
little bit more ranger actually I

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.120 
little bit more ranger actually I
started<00:02:59.959> water<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.319> we're<00:03:00.739> in<00:03:00.829> a<00:03:00.860> drought

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130
