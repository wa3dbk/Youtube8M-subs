00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
of the UJ now that's my hitch point of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.420 
of the UJ now that's my hitch point of
which<00:00:28.260> 2<00:00:28.439> UJ<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.939> basically<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:33.320> it's

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
which 2 UJ which is basically this it's

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.510 
which 2 UJ which is basically this it's
basically<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.820> flat<00:00:36.149> sheet<00:00:36.390> steel<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.520> cut

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
basically a flat sheet steel that I cut

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.310 
basically a flat sheet steel that I cut
into<00:00:38.730> 4<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:39.239> bent<00:00:39.450> into<00:00:39.629> shape<00:00:39.750> using<00:00:40.170> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
into 4 and then bent into shape using a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.670 
into 4 and then bent into shape using a
former<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.510> used<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.989> use<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> wooden<00:00:43.530> block

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
former so I used it I use a wooden block

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.670 
former so I used it I use a wooden block
former<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.820> basically<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.600> created<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
former so basically I created the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.130 
former so basically I created the
squares<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:47.969> see<00:00:48.030> there<00:00:48.450> I've

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
squares and as you can see there I've

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.880 
squares and as you can see there I've
got<00:00:49.940> tube<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.329> through<00:00:51.719> there<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.289> that's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
got tube going through there and that's

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.439 
got tube going through there and that's
a<00:00:52.980> strengthening<00:00:53.489> tube<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.000> keep<00:00:54.149> everything

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
a strengthening tube to keep everything

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.229 
a strengthening tube to keep everything
in<00:00:54.750> place<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> bolts<00:00:56.940> go<00:00:57.090> through

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
in place and so the bolts go through

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.770 
in place and so the bolts go through
that<00:00:58.250> through<00:00:59.250> here<00:00:59.520> now<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> bolts

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that through here now the bolts

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
that through here now the bolts
themselves<00:01:00.960> I've<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> shorter<00:01:02.190> bolt

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
themselves I've got a shorter bolt

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
themselves I've got a shorter bolt
I've<00:01:02.579> got<00:01:02.730> lug<00:01:02.940> nuts<00:01:03.210> but<00:01:03.600> I'm<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:04.530> gonna<00:01:04.650> be

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.500 

you<00:02:38.040> know<00:02:38.159> where<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.580> stay<00:02:39.030> away<00:02:39.209> from<00:02:39.269> the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
you know where to stay away from the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.820 
you know where to stay away from the
threads<00:02:39.810> because<00:02:40.049> I'm<00:02:40.200> gonna<00:02:40.349> have<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.680> lock

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
threads because I'm gonna have to lock

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:51.589 
threads because I'm gonna have to lock
tight<00:02:41.099> them<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.489> place<00:02:43.700> actively<00:02:49.189> gently<00:02:50.599> ease

tight them in place actively gently ease

00:02:51.599 --> 00:03:02.030 
tight them in place actively gently ease
at

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:12.259 

hey<00:03:07.470> ineffectively<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:09.150> guess<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.329> there

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
hey ineffectively I guess in there

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.660 
hey ineffectively I guess in there
the<00:03:13.269> bolt<00:03:13.510> goes<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:13.989> there<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.890> then<00:03:15.430> I'm

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
the bolt goes on there and then I'm

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:23.759 
the bolt goes on there and then I'm
gonna<00:03:16.030> lock<00:03:16.269> tight<00:03:16.510> this<00:03:16.720> up<00:03:20.849> effectively<00:03:22.769> as

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
gonna lock tight this up effectively as

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.869 
gonna lock tight this up effectively as
you<00:03:23.890> can<00:03:23.980> see<00:03:24.510> makes<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.599> difference<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:27.730> can

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
you can see makes a difference you can

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.059 
you can see makes a difference you can
see<00:03:28.060> there<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.989> I'm<00:03:29.290> gonna<00:03:29.409> put<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.799> rest<00:03:29.950> of

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
in place if you can look in the tube

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.400 
in place if you can look in the tube
itself<00:06:08.050> I<00:06:08.440> don't<00:06:08.680> know<00:06:08.800> if<00:06:08.860> you<00:06:08.920> can<00:06:09.100> see<00:06:09.490> that

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
itself I don't know if you can see that

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.040 
itself I don't know if you can see that
there<00:06:11.410> we<00:06:11.710> go<00:06:12.210> as<00:06:13.210> you<00:06:13.270> see<00:06:13.540> the<00:06:13.660> bolts

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
there we go as you see the bolts

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.380 
there we go as you see the bolts
actually<00:06:14.560> go<00:06:14.710> into<00:06:15.220> the<00:06:15.310> tube<00:06:15.610> they<00:06:15.910> extend

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
actually go into the tube they extend

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.660 
actually go into the tube they extend
into<00:06:16.630> the<00:06:16.900> tube<00:06:17.170> so<00:06:17.410> when<00:06:17.530> is<00:06:17.650> it<00:06:17.800> a<00:06:17.860> tube<00:06:18.430> in

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
into the tube so when is it a tube in

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.150 
into the tube so when is it a tube in
there<00:06:19.030> it's<00:06:19.870> basically<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.440> hitch<00:06:20.620> point<00:06:20.950> and

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
there it's basically the hitch point and

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.420 
there it's basically the hitch point and
the<00:06:22.030> bolts<00:06:22.300> go<00:06:22.330> into<00:06:22.780> that<00:06:22.930> and<00:06:23.280> prevent<00:06:24.280> it

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
the bolts go into that and prevent it

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.830 
the bolts go into that and prevent it
from<00:06:24.490> coming<00:06:24.760> out<00:06:25.030> and<00:06:25.210> it's<00:06:25.360> quite<00:06:25.570> easy<00:06:25.690> to

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
from coming out and it's quite easy to

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.040 
from coming out and it's quite easy to
do<00:06:26.050> quite<00:06:26.470> easy<00:06:26.620> to<00:06:26.860> undo<00:06:27.250> so<00:06:27.940> it's<00:06:28.420> a<00:06:28.660> fairly

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
do quite easy to undo so it's a fairly

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.720 
do quite easy to undo so it's a fairly
simple<00:06:29.260> job<00:06:29.680> that's<00:06:30.490> job<00:06:30.730> done<00:06:32.430> 1uj<00:06:33.430> for<00:06:33.640> the

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
simple job that's job done 1uj for the

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.260 
simple job that's job done 1uj for the
trailer<00:06:35.460> so<00:06:36.460> that's<00:06:36.880> it

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
trailer so that's it

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.060 
trailer so that's it
still<00:06:37.690> got<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:37.900> lid<00:06:38.050> to<00:06:38.170> do<00:06:38.320> still<00:06:38.950> got<00:06:39.130> the

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
still got the lid to do still got the

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.410 
still got the lid to do still got the
electrics<00:06:42.070> to<00:06:42.160> do<00:06:42.430> still<00:06:42.940> got<00:06:43.060> the<00:06:43.180> hitch

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420 
electrics to do still got the hitch

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.440 
electrics to do still got the hitch
itself<00:06:44.290> for<00:06:44.620> the<00:06:44.710> bike<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:45.160> redo<00:06:45.610> I'll<00:06:46.120> show
