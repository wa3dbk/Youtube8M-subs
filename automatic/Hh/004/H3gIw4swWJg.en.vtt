break it down nice and slowly whatever

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.139 
break it down nice and slowly whatever
look<00:00:31.439> at<00:00:31.470> beats<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:31.949> two<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.460> then<00:00:32.880> beats

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
look at beats one and two and then beats

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.549 
look at beats one and two and then beats
three<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.420> four<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.230> we'll<00:00:34.350> look<00:00:34.440> at

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
three and four and then we'll look at

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.139 
three and four and then we'll look at
the<00:00:34.649> dynamics<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.489> are<00:00:35.610> used<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.969> sort<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the dynamics that are used to sort of

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.850 
the dynamics that are used to sort of
make<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> groove<00:00:36.719> sound<00:00:37.079> how<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.469> does<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
make the groove sound how it does on the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.389 
make the groove sound how it does on the
record

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
record

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.880

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
play that note on its own in between the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.249 
play that note on its own in between the
high<00:01:28.710> hats<00:01:28.950> one<00:01:29.400> E<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.700> AH<00:01:30.240> okay<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.200> just

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
high hats one E and AH okay so it's just

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.429 
high hats one E and AH okay so it's just
in<00:01:31.470> between<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.780> got<00:01:33.869> little<00:01:33.990> right

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
in between and then you got little right

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.440 
in between and then you got little right
left<00:01:34.710> after<00:01:35.009> hit<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.250> snare<00:01:35.460> drum<00:01:35.729> that's

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
left after hit that snare drum that's

left after hit that snare drum that's
the<00:01:36.600> first<00:01:36.840> half<00:01:37.079> down<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.920> second<00:01:38.369> half

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
the first half down the second half

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.760 
the first half down the second half
beats<00:01:39.810> three<00:01:40.110> we've<00:01:40.320> got<00:01:40.350> three<00:01:41.220> E<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.770> easy

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
beats three we've got three E and easy

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.219 
beats three we've got three E and easy
so<00:01:44.130> we've<00:01:44.250> got<00:01:44.399> right<00:01:44.790> left<00:01:45.390> kick

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
so we've got right left kick

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.660 
so we've got right left kick
so<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.740> kicking<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.159> high<00:01:47.280> school<00:01:47.520> asked

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
so that kicking that high school asked

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.370 
so that kicking that high school asked
for<00:01:47.790> an<00:01:47.850> eighth<00:01:48.000> note<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:49.020> four<00:01:49.200> beat

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
for an eighth note and then four beat

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.020 
for an eighth note and then four beat
four<00:01:49.680> we've<00:01:50.100> got<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.250> fairly<00:01:50.520> sort<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.880> thing

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
four we've got a fairly sort of thing

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.700 
four we've got a fairly sort of thing
similar<00:01:51.479> thing<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.780> beat<00:01:52.079> one<00:01:52.259> except<00:01:52.590> we've

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
similar thing to beat one except we've

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.800 
similar thing to beat one except we've
got<00:01:52.920> four<00:01:53.399> E<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.590> snare<00:01:55.590> kick<00:01:56.009> right<00:01:56.399> left<00:01:56.820> so

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
got four E and snare kick right left so

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.300 
got four E and snare kick right left so
let's<00:01:57.930> play<00:01:58.049> both<00:01:58.290> these<00:01:58.439> ideas<00:01:58.799> back<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.159> back

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
let's play both these ideas back to back

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.139 
let's play both these ideas back to back
and<00:01:59.460> then<00:01:59.549> we'll<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.759> look<00:01:59.880> at<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.030> old

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and then we'll have look at the old

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.120 
and then we'll have look at the old
dynamics<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.049> here<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.259> go<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.560> we've<00:02:01.680> got<00:02:01.770> one

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
dynamics so here we go so we've got one

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:17.620 
dynamics so here we go so we've got one
E<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.909> two<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.570> three<00:02:04.290> E<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.500> four<00:02:05.130> E<00:02:05.399> and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.670 

so<00:02:18.630> for<00:02:18.750> those<00:02:18.810> ghost<00:02:19.140> notes<00:02:19.380> I'm<00:02:19.530> not

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
so for those ghost notes I'm not

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.230 
so for those ghost notes I'm not
actually<00:02:19.830> using<00:02:20.190> much<00:02:20.430> wrist<00:02:20.730> action<00:02:20.880> all<00:02:21.120> I'm

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
actually using much wrist action all I'm

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
actually using much wrist action all I'm
doing<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.510> literally<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.900> sort<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.050> letting

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
doing is literally just sort of letting

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.170 
doing is literally just sort of letting
my<00:02:22.380> fingers<00:02:22.680> go<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.310> let<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.580> stick<00:02:23.880> drop

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
my fingers go and I let the stick drop

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.460 
my fingers go and I let the stick drop
and<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:24.480> collect<00:02:24.840> them<00:02:25.050> after<00:02:25.230> they've<00:02:25.350> made

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
and then collect them after they've made

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.010 
and then collect them after they've made
contact<00:02:25.920> with<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.130> snare<00:02:26.400> okay<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.840> sort

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
contact with the snare okay so you sort

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.600 
contact with the snare okay so you sort
of<00:02:28.080> getting<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.710> motion<00:02:29.100> rather<00:02:29.460> than

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
of getting this motion rather than

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.710 
of getting this motion rather than
actually<00:02:29.820> sort<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.030> hitting<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.420> get<00:02:30.690> a

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
actually sort of hitting it you get a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.140 
actually sort of hitting it you get a
much<00:02:30.900> more<00:02:31.050> delicate<00:02:31.260> sound<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:32.700> sounds<00:02:32.970> much

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
much more delicate sound it sounds much

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.120 
much more delicate sound it sounds much
more<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.900> has<00:02:34.080> less<00:02:34.320> force<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.920> cakes

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
more this has less force the cakes

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.350 
more this has less force the cakes
