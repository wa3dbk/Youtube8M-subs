00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
today those were how did I get to this

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.400 
today those were how did I get to this
point<00:00:20.320> at<00:00:21.760> 255<00:00:22.760> pounds<00:00:23.000> 26<00:00:23.750> years<00:00:23.990> old<00:00:24.170> and

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
point at 255 pounds 26 years old and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.980 
point at 255 pounds 26 years old and
then<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.070> second<00:00:25.490> was<00:00:25.610> just<00:00:25.640> to<00:00:25.939> show<00:00:25.970> on<00:00:26.510> film

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
then the second was just to show on film

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.839 
then the second was just to show on film
where<00:00:27.170> I'm<00:00:27.260> at<00:00:27.410> now<00:00:27.470> just<00:00:27.950> my<00:00:28.099> physique<00:00:28.490> my

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
where I'm at now just my physique my

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.720 
where I'm at now just my physique my
baseline<00:00:29.599> just<00:00:30.169> the<00:00:30.349> starting<00:00:30.800> point<00:00:30.860> being

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
baseline just the starting point being

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.700 
baseline just the starting point being
the<00:00:31.880> fattest<00:00:32.240> I've<00:00:32.390> ever<00:00:32.570> been<00:00:32.840> what<00:00:33.590> does

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
the fattest I've ever been what does

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.350 
the fattest I've ever been what does
that<00:00:33.740> look<00:00:34.040> like<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:34.489> that<00:00:34.520> way<00:00:34.760> I<00:00:34.790> can<00:00:35.120> use

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
that look like so that way I can use

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.510 
that look like so that way I can use
that<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:36.170> track<00:00:36.350> my<00:00:36.590> progress<00:00:36.620> and<00:00:37.310> as

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
that to track my progress and as

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.220 
that to track my progress and as
motivation<00:00:38.180> for<00:00:38.510> not<00:00:38.690> only<00:00:38.810> myself<00:00:38.960> but

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
motivation for not only myself but

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.580 
motivation for not only myself but
hopefully<00:00:39.710> for<00:00:39.739> others<00:00:40.160> as<00:00:40.370> well<00:00:41.500> so<00:00:42.500> the

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
hopefully for others as well so the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.050 
hopefully for others as well so the
first<00:00:42.620> thing<00:00:43.070> was<00:00:43.250> how<00:00:43.430> did<00:00:43.579> I<00:00:43.670> get<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:43.940> this

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
first thing was how did I get to this

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.410 
first thing was how did I get to this
point<00:00:44.380> I<00:00:45.380> think<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.220> main<00:00:46.490> thing<00:00:46.820> was<00:00:47.390> just

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
point I think the main thing was just

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.020 
point I think the main thing was just
having<00:00:48.260> all<00:00:48.560> these<00:00:48.680> visions<00:00:49.130> and<00:00:49.340> dreams<00:00:49.370> that

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
having all these visions and dreams that

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.170 
having all these visions and dreams that
could<00:00:50.930> be<00:00:51.050> accomplished<00:00:51.680> in<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:51.920> future<00:00:52.370> but

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
could be accomplished in the future but

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.880 
could be accomplished in the future but
then<00:00:53.330> not<00:00:53.510> having<00:00:53.750> goals<00:00:54.110> of<00:00:54.410> how<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.650> even

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
then not having goals of how to even

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.020 
then not having goals of how to even
start<00:00:54.950> today<00:00:55.520> so<00:00:56.390> I'd<00:00:56.630> see<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.620> know<00:00:58.030> people

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
start today so I'd see you know people

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.910 
start today so I'd see you know people
or<00:00:59.420> picture<00:00:59.840> or<00:00:59.900> whatever<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.500> be<00:01:00.620> like<00:01:00.770> oh

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
or picture or whatever and be like oh

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.530 
or picture or whatever and be like oh
it'd<00:01:01.010> be<00:01:01.130> awesome<00:01:01.310> to<00:01:01.580> look<00:01:01.910> like<00:01:02.090> that<00:01:02.270> or<00:01:02.450> to

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
it'd be awesome to look like that or to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.270 
it'd be awesome to look like that or to
feel<00:01:02.750> like<00:01:02.900> better<00:01:03.110> to<00:01:03.290> be<00:01:03.410> able<00:01:03.560> to<00:01:03.680> run<00:01:03.920> that

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
feel like better to be able to run that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.820 
feel like better to be able to run that
half<00:01:04.580> marathon<00:01:05.119> or<00:01:05.150> whatever<00:01:05.509> it<00:01:05.630> is<00:01:05.720> but<00:01:06.590> then

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
half marathon or whatever it is but then

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.320 
half marathon or whatever it is but then
forgetting<00:01:07.400> about<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.640> because<00:01:08.030> I<00:01:08.060> really

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
forgetting about it because I really

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.230 
forgetting about it because I really
didn't<00:01:08.869> want<00:01:08.900> it<00:01:09.110> bad<00:01:09.290> enough<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.520> today

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
didn't want it bad enough and so today

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.179 
didn't want it bad enough and so today
it<00:01:11.540> didn't<00:01:11.869> seem<00:01:11.990> relevant<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.590> start<00:01:12.860> or<00:01:13.070> it

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
it didn't seem relevant to start or it

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.880 
it didn't seem relevant to start or it
seemed<00:01:13.430> too<00:01:13.670> hard<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.329> so<00:01:15.170> I'm<00:01:15.259> just<00:01:15.290> tired<00:01:15.710> of

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
seemed too hard and so I'm just tired of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.130 
seemed too hard and so I'm just tired of
that<00:01:16.040> because<00:01:16.460> as<00:01:17.000> easy<00:01:17.300> it<00:01:17.510> is<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.780> sit<00:01:17.960> on<00:01:18.020> the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
that because as easy it is to sit on the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.770 
that because as easy it is to sit on the
couch<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:18.770> eat<00:01:19.010> what<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.640> want<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.210> not

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
couch and eat what you want and not

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.470 
couch and eat what you want and not
really<00:01:21.080> think<00:01:21.409> about<00:01:21.500> anything<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.490> not<00:01:23.120> work

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
really think about anything and not work

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.930 
really think about anything and not work
and<00:01:23.750> not<00:01:23.930> exercise<00:01:24.530> like<00:01:25.340> that's<00:01:25.580> really<00:01:25.730> the

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
and not exercise like that's really the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.550 
and not exercise like that's really the
easiest<00:01:25.970> thing<00:01:26.480> in<00:01:26.510> the<00:01:26.570> world<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.960> do<00:01:27.110> nothing

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
easiest thing in the world to do nothing

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.340 
easiest thing in the world to do nothing
but<00:01:28.400> I<00:01:28.460> think<00:01:28.820> it's<00:01:29.060> equally<00:01:29.600> as<00:01:29.690> hard<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.200> look

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
but I think it's equally as hard to look

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.020 
but I think it's equally as hard to look
yourself<00:01:30.530> in<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:30.920> mirror<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.370> next<00:01:31.400> day<00:01:31.790> or

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
yourself in the mirror the next day or

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.820 
yourself in the mirror the next day or
the<00:01:32.150> following<00:01:32.330> week<00:01:32.510> or<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.320> month<00:01:33.350> later

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
the following week or the month later

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.620 
the following week or the month later
that<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:34.220> said<00:01:34.430> you're<00:01:34.610> going<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:34.850> start<00:01:35.120> and

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
that you said you're going to start and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.170 
that you said you're going to start and
to<00:01:36.170> realize<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.650> kind<00:01:36.860> of<00:01:36.920> just<00:01:37.100> gave<00:01:37.250> up<00:01:37.520> or

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
to realize you kind of just gave up or

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.580 
to realize you kind of just gave up or
you<00:01:38.360> that<00:01:38.570> you<00:01:38.840> didn't<00:01:39.110> believe<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:39.500> was

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
you that you didn't believe it was

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.410 
you that you didn't believe it was
possible<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.340> I'm<00:01:40.430> just<00:01:40.580> I'm<00:01:40.820> kind<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.180> tired

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
possible and I'm just I'm kind of tired

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.930 
possible and I'm just I'm kind of tired
of<00:01:41.600> that<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.990> it's<00:01:42.740> something<00:01:43.010> that<00:01:43.220> now<00:01:43.610> I

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
of that and it's something that now I

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.140 
of that and it's something that now I
want<00:01:44.390> I<00:01:44.630> know<00:01:44.900> it's<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.620> it's<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.760> non-negotiable

along my way that are already there so

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.410 
along my way that are already there so
that's<00:02:03.650> a<00:02:03.799> huge<00:02:03.979> thing<00:02:04.280> for<00:02:04.310> me<00:02:04.640> was<00:02:05.030> just<00:02:05.270> that

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
that's a huge thing for me was just that

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.350 
that's a huge thing for me was just that
I<00:02:05.780> had<00:02:06.140> these<00:02:06.619> far-off<00:02:06.920> dreams<00:02:07.430> but<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.030> never

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
I had these far-off dreams but I never

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.630 
I had these far-off dreams but I never
had<00:02:08.569> goals<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.920> reminds<00:02:10.189> me<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.519> quote

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
had goals and it reminds me of a quote

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.550 
had goals and it reminds me of a quote
that<00:02:10.729> I've<00:02:10.939> heard<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.269> other<00:02:11.390> day<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.900> think<00:02:12.470> it

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
that I've heard the other day I think it

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.190 
that I've heard the other day I think it
goes<00:02:12.739> like<00:02:13.159> your<00:02:13.939> system<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.659> perfectly

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
goes like your system is perfectly

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.640 
goes like your system is perfectly
designed<00:02:15.409> for<00:02:15.769> your<00:02:15.980> outcome<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:17.959> don't

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
designed for your outcome and so I don't

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.980 
designed for your outcome and so I don't
have<00:02:18.799> an<00:02:18.950> excuse<00:02:19.370> anymore<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:20.060> can't<00:02:20.660> look<00:02:20.840> at

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
have an excuse anymore I can't look at

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.780 
have an excuse anymore I can't look at
myself<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.530> just<00:02:21.590> feel<00:02:21.830> sorry<00:02:22.099> that<00:02:22.459> this<00:02:22.610> is

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
myself and just feel sorry that this is

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.130 
myself and just feel sorry that this is
just<00:02:22.910> something<00:02:23.180> that's<00:02:23.450> happened<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.930> me

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
just something that's happened to me

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.920 
just something that's happened to me
you're<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:25.310> know<00:02:25.490> nobody<00:02:26.060> told<00:02:26.300> me<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:26.810> know

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
you're you know nobody told me you know

you're you know nobody told me you know
whatever<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.530> case<00:02:27.710> is<00:02:28.150> like<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.420> is

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
whatever the case is like this is

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.970 
whatever the case is like this is
something<00:02:29.780> I've<00:02:30.020> done<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.350> myself<00:02:30.500> I've

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
something I've done to myself I've

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.800 
something I've done to myself I've
designed<00:02:31.520> my<00:02:31.640> system<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:32.540> my

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
designed my system and this is my

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.230 
designed my system and this is my
outcome<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.470> if<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.680> want<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.040> be<00:02:34.160> healthy<00:02:34.790> and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
outcome so if I want to be healthy and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.080 
outcome so if I want to be healthy and
shaped<00:02:35.590> muscular<00:02:36.590> then<00:02:37.220> my<00:02:37.430> system<00:02:37.850> my

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
shaped muscular then my system my

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.810 
shaped muscular then my system my
lifestyle<00:02:38.750> has<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.319> match<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.670> not

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
lifestyle has to match that and it's not

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.550 
lifestyle has to match that and it's not
going<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.060> happen<00:02:41.240> by<00:02:41.540> magic<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:42.170> not<00:02:42.350> just

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
going to happen by magic it's not just

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.890 
going to happen by magic it's not just
going<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.740> be<00:02:42.830> something<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:44.090> get<00:02:44.390> dealt<00:02:44.810> a

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
going to be something that I get dealt a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.080 
going to be something that I get dealt a
good<00:02:45.050> hand<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.440> all<00:02:45.560> sudden<00:02:45.980> like<00:02:46.310> I'm<00:02:46.520> just

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
good hand and all sudden like I'm just

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.090 
good hand and all sudden like I'm just
walking<00:02:47.600> out<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:48.140> magazine<00:02:48.320> ripped<00:02:48.920> like

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
walking out of a magazine ripped like

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.740 
walking out of a magazine ripped like
it's<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.459> not<00:02:49.670> going<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.820> happen<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.510> I

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
it's just not going to happen and so I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.150 
it's just not going to happen and so I
know<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.709> now

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
know that now

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.890 
know that now
that<00:02:52.310> seems<00:02:52.520> pretty<00:02:52.700> simple<00:02:52.940> but<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.780> was

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
that seems pretty simple but that was

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.070 
that seems pretty simple but that was
kind<00:02:54.080> of<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.319> big<00:02:55.310> for<00:02:55.580> me<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:55.940> think<00:02:56.450> another

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
kind of a big for me I think another

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.040 
kind of a big for me I think another
thing<00:02:57.440> was<00:02:57.680> just<00:02:58.420> seeing<00:02:59.420> things<00:02:59.690> in<00:02:59.959> their

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
thing was just seeing things in their

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.979 
thing was just seeing things in their
proper<00:03:00.200> context<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:01.760> rather<00:03:01.970> than<00:03:02.239> seeing<00:03:02.510> you

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
proper context so rather than seeing you

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.340 
proper context so rather than seeing you
know<00:03:03.110> food<00:03:03.440> or<00:03:03.709> laziness<00:03:04.190> as<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.430> reward<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.420> have

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
know food or laziness as a reward I have

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.470 
know food or laziness as a reward I have
to<00:03:06.500> see<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.860> as<00:03:07.010> something<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.480> food

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
to see that as something that food

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.100 
to see that as something that food
obviously<00:03:09.230> has<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.769> be<00:03:09.950> for<00:03:10.310> fuel<00:03:10.720> it's<00:03:11.720> not

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
obviously has to be for fuel it's not

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.290 
obviously has to be for fuel it's not
it's<00:03:12.860> not<00:03:13.100> something<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.640> should<00:03:13.910> just<00:03:14.090> come

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
it's not something that should just come

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.820 
it's not something that should just come
for<00:03:14.450> me<00:03:14.540> because<00:03:14.840> at<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.080> end<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.350> day<00:03:15.530> if

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
for me because at the end of the day if

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.509 
for me because at the end of the day if
I'm<00:03:16.310> using<00:03:16.519> those<00:03:16.820> things<00:03:17.030> inappropriately

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
I'm using those things inappropriately

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.009 
I'm using those things inappropriately
I'm<00:03:19.519> only<00:03:19.790> going<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.150> get<00:03:20.300> more<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.720> shape

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
I'm only going to get more of a shape

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.810 
I'm only going to get more of a shape
which<00:03:21.290> then<00:03:21.500> defeats<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.100> purpose<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.640> why<00:03:22.790> I

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
which then defeats the purpose of why I

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.490 
which then defeats the purpose of why I
consumed<00:03:23.390> them<00:03:23.540> in<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.750> first<00:03:23.959> place<00:03:24.050> you

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
consumed them in the first place you

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.210 
consumed them in the first place you
know<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.840> that's<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.170> first<00:03:27.410> thing<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.860> then

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
know so that's the first thing and then

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.640 
know so that's the first thing and then
secondly<00:03:28.700> for<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.600> guys<00:03:29.810> because<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.290> know<00:03:30.440> you

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
secondly for you guys because I know you

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.160 
secondly for you guys because I know you
really<00:03:31.190> want<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.459> see<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.760> just<00:03:31.970> because<00:03:32.959> maybe

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
really want to see it just because maybe

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.720 
really want to see it just because maybe
you're<00:03:33.650> trying<00:03:33.829> to<00:03:33.950> throw<00:03:34.130> up<00:03:34.250> a<00:03:34.370> little<00:03:34.489> bit

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
you're trying to throw up a little bit

like<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.380> build<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.830> significant<00:04:31.370> amount<00:04:31.520> of

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
like to build a significant amount of

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.550 
like to build a significant amount of
muscle<00:04:31.760> along<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.390> period<00:04:32.930> as<00:04:33.050> well<00:04:33.229> so

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
muscle along that period as well so

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.860 
muscle along that period as well so
we'll<00:04:34.310> see<00:04:34.460> where<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.640> end<00:04:34.700> up<00:04:34.970> but<00:04:35.240> this<00:04:35.539> is<00:04:35.720> the

we'll see where I end up but this is the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.180 
we'll see where I end up but this is the
beginning<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.349> I'm<00:04:36.470> excited<00:04:36.860> about<00:04:36.919> it
