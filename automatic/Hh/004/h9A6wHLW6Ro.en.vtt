00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.060
 Attention, this video contains spoilers! Just look if you're stuck or just boring. 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.600
 First we need our "tool". We start at this point 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.380
 Here is the right place, look at the right stone. 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.400
 Go to this place to use the grenade. 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.060
 Now go through the mine. The puzzles are not necessary. Only reach the exit. 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.140
 First you have to solve the puzzle of Ethan's father. 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.300
 That will open the door at the generator house. 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.780
 Leave the building on the other side. 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.560
 Congratulations, there's the gun. (and the poor diver you blew up. ^^) 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.020
 The diver has disappeared. Was it just a dream? Find it out in the game. 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.600
 No divers, birds, grenades or light trucks were injured or painted in this manual.
