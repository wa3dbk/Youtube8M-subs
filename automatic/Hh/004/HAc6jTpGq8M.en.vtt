mid<00:02:34.379> mid<00:02:35.129> top<00:02:35.370> collar<00:02:35.700> for<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.659> comfort<00:02:37.079> and

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
mid mid top collar for for comfort and

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:43.399 
mid mid top collar for for comfort and
where<00:02:38.609> you<00:02:38.730> ollie<00:02:39.469> that's<00:02:42.079> where<00:02:43.079> you<00:02:43.200> ollie

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
where you ollie that's where you ollie

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.879 
where you ollie that's where you ollie
this<00:02:43.769> is<00:02:43.919> where<00:02:44.129> I<00:02:44.159> this<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.209> where<00:02:45.359> I<00:02:45.389> ollie

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
this is where I this is where I ollie

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:51.259 
this is where I this is where I ollie
obviously<00:02:46.889> it's<00:02:47.819> triple<00:02:48.239> stitch<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:50.269> that

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
obviously it's triple stitch and that

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.940 
obviously it's triple stitch and that
means<00:02:51.599> this<00:02:51.780> triple<00:02:52.169> stitch<00:02:52.409> to<00:02:52.680> space

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
means this triple stitch to space

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.759 
means this triple stitch to space
self-explanatory<00:02:53.549> so<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.840> lasts<00:02:55.079> longer<00:02:55.620> and

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
self-explanatory so it lasts longer and

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.069 
self-explanatory so it lasts longer and
these<00:02:56.370> are<00:02:56.519> ninety<00:02:56.730> dollars<00:02:56.849> shoes<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.750> I

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
these are ninety dollars shoes so I

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.929 
these are ninety dollars shoes so I
guess<00:02:58.769> s<00:02:59.549> made<00:03:00.150> them<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:01.260> being<00:03:02.010> made<00:03:02.639> them<00:03:02.790> to

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
guess s made them to being made them to

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.250 
guess s made them to being made them to
last<00:03:03.150> liking<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.079> night<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:04.349> shoes<00:03:04.969> so<00:03:06.260> they

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
last liking that night I shoes so they

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.220 
last liking that night I shoes so they
triple<00:03:07.650> stitch<00:03:07.859> that<00:03:08.209> both<00:03:09.209> areas<00:03:09.599> for<00:03:10.049> this

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
triple stitch that both areas for this

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.470 
triple stitch that both areas for this
one<00:03:10.409> in<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.680> one<00:03:10.889> so<00:03:11.730> if<00:03:11.879> I'm<00:03:12.000> doing<00:03:12.120> switch

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
one in this one so if I'm doing switch

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.270 
one in this one so if I'm doing switch
tricks<00:03:12.900> or<00:03:13.169> in<00:03:13.799> goofy<00:03:14.239> skaters<00:03:15.239> case<00:03:15.720> if<00:03:16.560> they

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
tricks or in goofy skaters case if they

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.189 
tricks or in goofy skaters case if they
be<00:03:17.340> doing<00:03:17.729> regular<00:03:17.909> trips<00:03:18.419> and<00:03:18.690> switch<00:03:18.900> trip

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
be doing regular trips and switch trip

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.610 
be doing regular trips and switch trip
so<00:03:20.040> topo<00:03:20.970> stitched<00:03:21.239> on<00:03:21.479> both<00:03:21.659> sides<00:03:22.019> for

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
so topo stitched on both sides for

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.319 
so topo stitched on both sides for
switching<00:03:22.979> regular<00:03:23.340> trips<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:26.329> that's

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
switching regular trips and that's

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.360 
switching regular trips and that's
basically<00:03:27.540> about<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:28.199> at<00:03:28.709> oh<00:03:28.769> yeah<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.280> it

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
basically about it at oh yeah and it

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.259 
basically about it at oh yeah and it
also<00:03:29.489> has<00:03:30.139> hidden<00:03:31.139> leaf<00:03:31.470> loops<00:03:31.799> so<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:33.120> don't

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
also has hidden leaf loops so you don't

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.140 
also has hidden leaf loops so you don't
have<00:03:33.419> to<00:03:33.599> be<00:03:33.780> if<00:03:34.049> you're<00:03:34.939> having<00:03:35.939> a<00:03:36.030> good

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
have to be if you're having a good

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.369 
have to be if you're having a good
session<00:03:36.419> and<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.780> rip<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.930> whole<00:03:37.079> bunch<00:03:37.229> of

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
session and you rip a whole bunch of

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.899 
session and you rip a whole bunch of
shoelaces<00:03:38.419> then<00:03:39.979> that<00:03:40.979> will<00:03:41.220> prevent<00:03:41.639> that<00:03:41.849> a

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
shoelaces then that will prevent that a

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.969 
shoelaces then that will prevent that a
little<00:03:42.329> bit<00:03:42.419> not<00:03:42.780> completely<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:43.829> won't

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:43.979 
little bit not completely it won't

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:45.949 
little bit not completely it won't
completely<00:03:44.489> prevent<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.239> from<00:03:45.329> happening<00:03:45.419> but

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
completely prevent it from happening but

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.530 
completely prevent it from happening but
it<00:03:46.169> will<00:03:46.319> prevent<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.549> little<00:03:47.759> bit<00:03:48.000> but<00:03:48.419> it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
it will prevent it a little bit but it

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.179 
it will prevent it a little bit but it
won't<00:03:48.659> stop<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.049> from<00:03:49.169> happening<00:03:49.319> so<00:03:50.129> you

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
won't stop it from happening so you

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.740 
won't stop it from happening so you
still<00:03:50.519> don't<00:03:50.549> have<00:03:50.759> to<00:03:50.849> go<00:03:50.970> through<00:03:51.120> laces<00:03:51.540> but

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
still don't have to go through laces but

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.199 
still don't have to go through laces but
