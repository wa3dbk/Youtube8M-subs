00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.500
Hi! In this video I'm testing and reviewing the new F50 Adizero from the Earth Pack Adidas

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.500
It's a really showy colorway, yellow for the upper, orange for the soleplate and dark green for the adidas logo

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.900
Adidas promised us many innovations on this boots. We'll speak of that, follow us!

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.600
The upper is one of the innovations.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.600
Indeed in the synthetic version of the boot has been

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.200
"scrapped" the Sprintskin to take place for the Hybrid Touch, already used in other adidas boots

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.800
This Hybrid Touch is also more thin and comfortable than the ones on the Predator LZ or on the Nitrocharge 1.0

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.800
I think that this is a great innovations from adidas because now the Synthetic version is  better than the Leather version

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.800
Usually on the previous models the leather version was always preferred because the sprintskin did not guaranteed comfort

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.800
as the leather variant did

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:43.900
Also, on the toe box we find the dribble tex, little rubber extrusions that help you to control the ball also in wet conditions

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:51.900
On the heel part we find the speedfoil, a really light weight material that provides stability

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:03.900
On the internal part of the heel we find a thin covering that provides a more comfortable fit
