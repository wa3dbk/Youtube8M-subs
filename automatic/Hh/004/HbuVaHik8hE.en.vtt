00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
that was only my second attempt of

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.920 
that was only my second attempt of
trying<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.310> which<00:02:03.000> was<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> same

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
trying to do it which was in the same

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.530 
trying to do it which was in the same
thing<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.140> never<00:02:04.200> forget<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.979> second<00:02:05.369> try<00:02:05.549> but

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
thing I never forget it second try but

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.990 
thing I never forget it second try but
it's<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.290> really<00:02:07.560> cool<00:02:07.950> easter<00:02:08.399> egg<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> only

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it's a really cool easter egg the only

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.080 
it's a really cool easter egg the only
problems<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.660> one

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
problems on one

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.229 
problems on one
once<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.569> do<00:02:11.959> get<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.260> if<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.620> die<00:02:13.129> I<00:02:13.519> haven't

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
once you do get it if you die I haven't

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.790 
once you do get it if you die I haven't
found<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.569> way<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.840> getting<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.260> back<00:02:15.440> because

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
found a way of getting it back because

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.190 
found a way of getting it back because
it<00:02:16.340> doesn't<00:02:16.760> drop<00:02:17.000> as<00:02:17.209> far<00:02:17.420> as<00:02:17.569> I<00:02:17.660> can<00:02:17.720> see<00:02:17.900> you

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
it doesn't drop as far as I can see you

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.680 
it doesn't drop as far as I can see you
can't<00:02:18.470> like<00:02:18.620> pick<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.980> up<00:02:19.040> after<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.510> I'm<00:02:20.660> not

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
can't like pick it up after so I'm not

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.740 
can't like pick it up after so I'm not
sure<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:22.730> know<00:02:22.879> if<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.269> was<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.450> good<00:02:23.690> idea

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
sure you know if that was a good idea

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.690 
sure you know if that was a good idea
run<00:02:24.319> infinity<00:02:24.830> worlds<00:02:25.069> apart<00:02:25.129> I<00:02:25.430> think<00:02:25.610> they

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
run infinity worlds apart I think they

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.770 
run infinity worlds apart I think they
should<00:02:25.879> have<00:02:25.910> made<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.209> someone<00:02:26.480> else<00:02:26.569> could

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
should have made it someone else could

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.809 
should have made it someone else could
pick<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:26.989> up<00:02:27.170> afterwards<00:02:27.620> because<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.519> can

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
pick it up afterwards because you can

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.630 
pick it up afterwards because you can
get<00:02:29.000> shot<00:02:29.269> really<00:02:29.780> easily<00:02:30.190> because<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
get shot really easily because of the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.720 
get shot really easily because of the
crane<00:02:31.940> once<00:02:32.599> you've<00:02:32.900> made<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.470> come<00:02:33.680> down<00:02:33.920> and

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
crane once you've made it come down and

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.360 
crane once you've made it come down and
taking<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.510> venom<00:02:35.780> Ock's<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.349> can<00:02:36.769> press<00:02:37.099> the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
taking the venom Ock's you can press the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.890 
taking the venom Ock's you can press the
controls<00:02:37.819> on<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.090> side<00:02:38.330> which<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.660> see<00:02:38.840> in

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
controls on the side which you see in

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.199 
controls on the side which you see in
the<00:02:38.989> first<00:02:39.230> gameplay<00:02:39.560> me<00:02:39.920> doing<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.400> it

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
the first gameplay me doing and it

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.600 
the first gameplay me doing and it
literally<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:42.049> lifts<00:02:42.560> up<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.739> people<00:02:43.190> in<00:02:43.459> it

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
literally it lifts up the people in it

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.280 
literally it lifts up the people in it
and<00:02:43.790> carries<00:02:44.390> them<00:02:44.540> out<00:02:44.660> of<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.840> map<00:02:45.049> and<00:02:45.230> you

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
and carries them out of the map and you

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.900 
and carries them out of the map and you
can<00:02:45.440> shoot<00:02:45.680> down<00:02:45.709> at<00:02:46.069> everyone<00:02:46.430> from<00:02:46.579> above

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
can shoot down at everyone from above

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.039 
can shoot down at everyone from above
and<00:02:47.060> that's<00:02:47.180> what<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.390> stopped<00:02:47.660> doing<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
and that's what I stopped doing the

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.210 
and that's what I stopped doing the
venom<00:02:48.349> Ock's<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.670> cool<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:51.079> it<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.769> really

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
venom Ock's is so cool but it is really

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.100 
venom Ock's is so cool but it is really
difficult<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.940> do<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.360> best<00:02:53.630> way<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:53.900> to

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
difficult to do and the best way is to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.140 
difficult to do and the best way is to
wait<00:02:54.500> until<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:55.010> spawn<00:02:55.280> on<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.549> side<00:02:55.790> with

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
wait until you spawn on the side with

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.300 
wait until you spawn on the side with
you<00:02:56.780> know<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.049> Federation<00:02:57.530> spawn<00:02:57.799> point<00:02:58.069> and

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
you know the Federation spawn point and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.460 
you know the Federation spawn point and
shoot<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.150> with<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.299> grenade<00:02:59.629> launcher<00:03:00.140> and

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
shoot it with the grenade launcher and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.690 
shoot it with the grenade launcher and
that's<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.769> only<00:03:01.040> way<00:03:01.160> you're<00:03:01.370> going<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.549> get

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
with it but I think I should have made

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.789 
with it but I think I should have made
this<00:03:10.190> fairly<00:03:10.489> clear<00:03:10.849> just<00:03:11.599> shoot<00:03:11.840> us<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.290> red

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
this fairly clear just shoot us the red

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.160 
this fairly clear just shoot us the red
clams<00:03:13.190> on<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.819> crane<00:03:14.060> with<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:14.900> grenade

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
clams on the crane with a grenade

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.490 
clams on the crane with a grenade
launcher<00:03:15.829> then<00:03:16.100> come<00:03:16.400> down<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.790> can<00:03:16.970> grab<00:03:17.180> it

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
launcher then come down you can grab it

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.660 
launcher then come down you can grab it
and<00:03:18.500> I'll<00:03:18.739> see<00:03:18.799> it<00:03:19.069> if<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.370> don't<00:03:19.489> know<00:03:19.609> what

so<00:03:23.150> green<00:03:23.739> grenade<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:25.790> press<00:03:26.090> LT<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.720> it

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
so green grenade and you press LT and it

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.900 
so green grenade and you press LT and it
detonates<00:03:27.349> and<00:03:27.620> fossil<00:03:28.040> acid<00:03:28.459> everywhere

detonates and fossil acid everywhere

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.809 
detonates and fossil acid everywhere
from<00:03:29.420> extinction<00:03:29.810> might<00:03:30.109> is<00:03:30.230> pretty<00:03:30.500> cool<00:03:30.819> the

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
from extinction might is pretty cool the

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.309 
from extinction might is pretty cool the
other<00:03:32.180> Easter<00:03:32.630> eggs<00:03:32.750> if<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.049> look<00:03:33.200> around

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
other Easter eggs if you look around

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.240 
other Easter eggs if you look around
this<00:03:33.530> map<00:03:33.739> it's<00:03:34.040> actually<00:03:34.489> based<00:03:34.790> off<00:03:35.239> of<00:03:35.269> like

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
this map it's actually based off of like

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.250 
this map it's actually based off of like
scientific<00:03:37.389> excavation<00:03:38.389> essentially<00:03:39.019> and

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
scientific excavation essentially and

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.190 
scientific excavation essentially and
it's<00:03:39.889> very<00:03:40.069> interesting<00:03:40.669> is<00:03:40.790> only<00:03:41.000> strokes<00:03:41.750> of

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
it's very interesting is only strokes of

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.349 
it's very interesting is only strokes of
laying<00:03:42.709> around<00:03:42.859> there's<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.489> tunnels<00:03:44.000> in<00:03:44.209> the

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
laying around there's the tunnels in the

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.729 
laying around there's the tunnels in the
underground<00:03:44.780> section<00:03:45.139> at<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.440> back<00:03:45.680> are

underground section at the back are

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.460 
underground section at the back are
interesting<00:03:46.549> but<00:03:47.329> this<00:03:47.569> is<00:03:47.930> like<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.260> main

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
interesting but this is like the main

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.140 
interesting but this is like the main

pretty cool you get that with the filled

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.250 
pretty cool you get that with the filled
waters<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:03.549> that's<00:04:04.549> all<00:04:05.299> i<00:04:05.329> have<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.780> say<00:04:05.989> at

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
waters and that's all i have to say at

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.920 
waters and that's all i have to say at
the<00:04:06.380> moment<00:04:06.530> there<00:04:07.310> is<00:04:07.340> going<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.269> be<00:04:08.299> most

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
the moment there is going to be most

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.860 
the moment there is going to be most
likely<00:04:09.019> an<00:04:09.590> egg<00:04:09.889> for<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.310> extra<00:04:10.760> XP<00:04:10.970> but<00:04:11.750> i'll

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
likely an egg for the extra XP but i'll

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.330 
likely an egg for the extra XP but i'll
put<00:04:12.079> that<00:04:12.109> in<00:04:12.319> a<00:04:12.380> different<00:04:12.560> video<00:04:12.859> because

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
put that in a different video because

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.800 
put that in a different video because
that's<00:04:13.700> for<00:04:13.970> all<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.359> maps<00:04:14.569> in<00:04:14.750> the
