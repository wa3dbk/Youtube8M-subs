00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.899 

we<00:00:00.390> think<00:00:00.510> about<00:00:00.659> the<00:00:00.870> brewing<00:00:01.110> process<00:00:01.909> we

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
we think about the brewing process we

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.860 
we think about the brewing process we
have<00:00:03.090> four<00:00:03.929> main<00:00:04.290> ingredients<00:00:04.970> water<00:00:05.970> malt

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
have four main ingredients water malt

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.160 
have four main ingredients water malt
hops<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.980> yeast<00:00:08.330> if<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.420> think<00:00:09.540> about<00:00:09.660> our<00:00:09.929> malt

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
hops and yeast if I think about our malt

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.350 
hops and yeast if I think about our malt
it<00:00:10.469> comes<00:00:10.679> from<00:00:10.800> barley<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.910> gives<00:00:12.059> us<00:00:12.210> our

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
it comes from barley and it gives us our

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.970 
it comes from barley and it gives us our
main<00:00:12.690> constituents<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.679> we're<00:00:13.799> going<00:00:13.920> to

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
main constituents that we're going to

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.340 
main constituents that we're going to
use<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.360> brewing<00:00:15.630> process

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
use in the brewing process

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.240 
use in the brewing process
it<00:00:16.440> has<00:00:17.160> carbohydrates<00:00:18.140> proteins<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.410> some

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
it has carbohydrates proteins and some

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.720 
it has carbohydrates proteins and some
lipids<00:00:21.529> let's<00:00:22.529> focus<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> carbohydrates

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
lipids let's focus on the carbohydrates

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.420 
lipids let's focus on the carbohydrates
if<00:00:24.660> we<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:24.900> about<00:00:25.050> carbohydrate<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.310> is

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
if we think about carbohydrate this is

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.429 
if we think about carbohydrate this is
going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.730> our<00:00:26.820> main<00:00:27.090> source<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
going to be our main source for the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.370 
going to be our main source for the
sugar<00:00:28.619> that's<00:00:28.949> going<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.310> converted<00:00:29.820> into

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
sugar that's going to be converted into

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.690 
sugar that's going to be converted into
alcohol<00:00:31.380> ethanol<00:00:32.930> what<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> carbohydrate

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
alcohol ethanol what is a carbohydrate

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.850 
alcohol ethanol what is a carbohydrate
well<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> carbohydrate<00:00:36.210> from<00:00:37.200> its<00:00:37.380> name<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
well a carbohydrate from its name is a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.970 
well a carbohydrate from its name is a
carbon<00:00:38.719> hydrated<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
carbon hydrated so it's going to be a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.209 
carbon hydrated so it's going to be a
carbon<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.899> water<00:00:42.899> added<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.860> therefore<00:00:44.160> if

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
carbon with water added so therefore if

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.220 
carbon with water added so therefore if
we<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.460> about<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> structure<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
we think about the structure we have a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.639 
we think about the structure we have a
very<00:00:46.530> simple<00:00:46.890> formula<00:00:47.989> cnh2n<00:00:50.329> o

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
very simple formula cnh2n o

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.090 
very simple formula cnh2n o
n<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> most<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.140> our<00:00:55.230> sugars<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> be

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
n so most of our sugars are going to be

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.639 
n so most of our sugars are going to be
c6<00:00:56.969> h-12<00:00:57.840> o-6<00:00:59.660> now<00:01:00.660> let's<00:01:00.989> look<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
c6 h-12 o-6 now let's look at the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.810 
c6 h-12 o-6 now let's look at the
structure<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.280> our<00:01:02.789> simple<00:01:03.210> carbohydrates<00:01:04.820> if

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
structure of our simple carbohydrates if

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.730 
structure of our simple carbohydrates if
we<00:01:05.970> look<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.240> our<00:01:06.360> carbohydrate<00:01:07.110> such<00:01:07.530> as

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
we look at our carbohydrate such as

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.320 
we look at our carbohydrate such as
glucose<00:01:08.369> which<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:08.939> our<00:01:09.060> main

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
glucose which is going to be our main

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.100 
glucose which is going to be our main
carbohydrate<00:01:10.400> it's<00:01:11.400> usually<00:01:11.610> shown<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.510> few

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
carbohydrate it's usually shown in a few

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.859 
carbohydrate it's usually shown in a few
different<00:01:13.530> forms<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:15.000> first<00:01:15.299> structure<00:01:15.720> we

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
different forms the first structure we

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.370 
different forms the first structure we
see<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.619> actually<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
see here is actually in a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.630 
see here is actually in a
three-dimensional<00:01:19.380> form<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:20.159> organic

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
three-dimensional form that organic

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.859 
three-dimensional form that organic
chemists<00:01:20.970> are<00:01:21.060> very<00:01:21.210> comfortable<00:01:21.509> with

chemists are very comfortable with

chemists are very comfortable with
because<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.740> gives<00:01:23.150> accurately<00:01:24.150> what<00:01:24.990> the

because it gives accurately what the

because it gives accurately what the

structure will look like energetically
in<00:01:28.310> solution<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:30.270> notice<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
in solution but notice that it is a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.440 
in solution but notice that it is a
straight<00:01:31.409> chain<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.579> other<00:01:32.909> structure<00:01:33.420> that

straight chain the other structure that

straight chain the other structure that
we're<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> use<00:01:34.079> quite<00:01:34.350> often<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.950> the

we're going to use quite often is the

Fischer projection a Fischer projection

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.890 
Fischer projection a Fischer projection
doesn't<00:01:37.799> give<00:01:38.070> us<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.490> correct<00:01:38.900> information

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
doesn't give us the correct information

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.260 
doesn't give us the correct information
as<00:01:40.020> far<00:01:40.259> as<00:01:40.439> how<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.310> molecule<00:01:41.759> will<00:01:41.909> look<00:01:42.119> in

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
as far as how the molecule will look in

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.090 
as far as how the molecule will look in
three<00:01:42.450> dimensions<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> gives<00:01:43.829> us<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.070> very

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
three dimensions but it gives us a very

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.179 
three dimensions but it gives us a very
easy<00:01:44.670> way<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> draw<00:01:45.810> structure<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.530> tell<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
easy way to draw structure and tell the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.179 
easy way to draw structure and tell the
difference<00:01:47.520> between<00:01:47.670> different<00:01:48.210> sugars<00:01:49.189> now

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
difference between different sugars now

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.020 
difference between different sugars now
both<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.700> these<00:01:50.970> are<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.540> call<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.990> cyclic

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
both of these are what we call a cyclic

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.539 
both of these are what we call a cyclic
they<00:01:54.030> both<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.720> an<00:01:54.869> aldehyde<00:01:55.439> group<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.979> we

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
they both have an aldehyde group and we

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.450 
they both have an aldehyde group and we
can<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.740> five<00:01:58.740> hydroxide

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
can see that they have five hydroxide

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.109 
can see that they have five hydroxide
groups<00:02:00.200> every<00:02:01.200> carbon<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.399> structure<00:02:02.880> has

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
groups every carbon in the structure has

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.999 
groups every carbon in the structure has
at<00:02:03.390> least<00:02:03.540> one<00:02:03.840> oxygen<00:02:04.229> bond<00:02:05.750> now<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
at least one oxygen bond now this is the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.949 
at least one oxygen bond now this is the
acyclic<00:02:08.610> form<00:02:08.849> we<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.030> also<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.569> cyclic

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
acyclic form we can also have the cyclic

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.100 
acyclic form we can also have the cyclic
form<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:11.069> we<00:02:11.160> look<00:02:11.400> at<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.610> cyclic<00:02:12.030> form<00:02:12.300> we

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
form if we look at the cyclic form we

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.970 
form if we look at the cyclic form we
have<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.470> possible

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
have the possible

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.020 
have the possible

of the Rings coming around so instead of
being<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.629> straight<00:02:19.170> chain<00:02:19.409> we<00:02:19.920> now<00:02:20.069> are

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
being a straight chain we now are

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.000 
being a straight chain we now are
forming<00:02:20.610> these<00:02:20.730> rings<00:02:21.560> notice<00:02:22.560> when<00:02:22.739> we<00:02:22.769> do

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
forming these rings notice when we do

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.949 
forming these rings notice when we do
this<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.360> one<00:02:24.930> position<00:02:26.659> that<00:02:27.659> has

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
this that we have one position that has

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.190 
this that we have one position that has
two<00:02:28.379> possibilities<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:30.239> how<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.569> occurs<00:02:30.930> is

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
two possibilities so how this occurs is

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.229 
two possibilities so how this occurs is
that<00:02:31.230> one<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.530> those<00:02:31.680> alcohols<00:02:32.250> comes<00:02:32.940> around

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
that one of those alcohols comes around

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.780 
that one of those alcohols comes around
and<00:02:33.360> attacks<00:02:33.720> our<00:02:33.930> carbonyl<00:02:34.349> position<00:02:34.890> when

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
and attacks our carbonyl position when

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.369 
and attacks our carbonyl position when
it<00:02:35.910> attacks<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.330> carbons<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.780> this<00:02:36.870> position

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
it attacks that carbons in this position

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.470 
it attacks that carbons in this position
that<00:02:37.890> hydroxide<00:02:38.549> that's<00:02:38.670> form<00:02:39.000> can<00:02:39.180> either<00:02:39.360> go

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
that hydroxide that's form can either go

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.380 
that hydroxide that's form can either go
up<00:02:39.720> or<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.500> go<00:02:40.620> down<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.760> we<00:02:41.849> can<00:02:41.970> either<00:02:42.120> end

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
up or can go down so we can either end

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.339 
up or can go down so we can either end
up<00:02:42.569> with<00:02:42.750> an<00:02:42.870> alpha<00:02:43.319> or<00:02:43.579> a<00:02:44.579> beta<00:02:45.049> this<00:02:46.049> is<00:02:46.230> going

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
up with an alpha or a beta this is going

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.500 
up with an alpha or a beta this is going
to<00:02:46.410> be<00:02:46.530> important<00:02:47.220> as<00:02:47.310> we<00:02:47.940> look<00:02:48.180> at<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
to be important as we look at the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.220 
to be important as we look at the
functionality<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.379> larger<00:02:50.540> carbohydrates<00:02:51.540> so

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
functionality of larger carbohydrates so

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.670 
functionality of larger carbohydrates so
here<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.799> simple<00:02:53.489> glucose<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:55.500> other

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
here we have simple glucose the other

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.830 
here we have simple glucose the other
thing<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> realize<00:02:56.160> about<00:02:56.430> glucose<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.209> that

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
thing to realize about glucose is that

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.050 
thing to realize about glucose is that
all<00:02:58.079> of<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.680> hydroxide<00:02:59.250> groups<00:02:59.549> are<00:02:59.879> in<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
all of the hydroxide groups are in the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.000 
all of the hydroxide groups are in the
most<00:03:00.329> stable<00:03:00.569> formation<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.620> fact<00:03:01.799> if<00:03:01.950> we

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
most stable formation and in fact if we

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.759 
most stable formation and in fact if we
look<00:03:02.099> at<00:03:02.810> beta-d-glucose<00:03:03.810> you'll<00:03:04.319> see<00:03:04.560> that

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
look at beta-d-glucose you'll see that

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.009 
look at beta-d-glucose you'll see that
all<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.250> our<00:03:05.670> hydroxide<00:03:06.120> groups<00:03:06.599> are<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.930> the

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
all of our hydroxide groups are in the

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.289 
all of our hydroxide groups are in the
equatorial<00:03:07.560> plane<00:03:07.920> which<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.060> most

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
equatorial plane which is the most

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.789 
equatorial plane which is the most
stable<00:03:09.769> conformation<00:03:11.060> now<00:03:12.440> these<00:03:13.440> were

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
stable conformation now these were

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.319 
stable conformation now these were
monosaccharides<00:03:14.579> when<00:03:15.060> we<00:03:15.150> go<00:03:15.269> to

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
monosaccharides when we go to

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.839 
monosaccharides when we go to
disaccharides<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.890> when<00:03:17.040> we<00:03:17.160> have<00:03:17.340> two

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
disaccharides this is when we have two

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.909 
disaccharides this is when we have two

into smaller carbohydrates in malt what
we're<00:04:31.900> looking<00:04:32.230> for<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.740> maltose

we're looking for is maltose

one for if we look at this structure
here<00:05:07.000> you'll<00:05:07.480> see<00:05:07.720> that<00:05:07.930> we<00:05:08.080> have<00:05:08.110> our<00:05:08.620> normal

has<00:05:45.990> cellulose<00:05:46.990> because<00:05:47.350> we<00:05:47.590> have<00:05:47.770> cell<00:05:48.160> walls

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
has cellulose because we have cell walls

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.720

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
that in cellulose we don't have alpha

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.660 
that in cellulose we don't have alpha
linkage<00:06:02.170> just<00:06:02.350> like<00:06:02.500> we<00:06:02.680> would<00:06:02.830> in<00:06:03.100> starch<00:06:03.490> or

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.770 
linkage just like we would in starch or
amulets<00:06:04.150> but<00:06:04.690> we<00:06:04.810> have<00:06:05.050> a<00:06:05.290> beta<00:06:05.680> linkage<00:06:06.690> so<00:06:07.690> we

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
amulets but we have a beta linkage so we

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.200 
amulets but we have a beta linkage so we
can<00:06:07.900> see<00:06:08.220> carbohydrates<00:06:09.220> is<00:06:09.520> where<00:06:10.060> we're

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
can see carbohydrates is where we're

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.670 
convert it into alcohol we start with

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.310 
convert it into alcohol we start with
long-chain<00:06:15.670> carbohydrates<00:06:16.600> and<00:06:16.810> then

long-chain carbohydrates and then

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.040 
long-chain carbohydrates and then
through<00:06:17.620> enzymes<00:06:18.160> we<00:06:18.610> break<00:06:18.910> that<00:06:19.090> down<00:06:19.360> into

start that in the malting process by
activating<00:06:26.470> those<00:06:26.740> enzymes<00:06:27.510> then<00:06:28.510> we're

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
activating those enzymes then we're

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.210 
activating those enzymes then we're
going<00:06:28.840> to<00:06:28.900> finish<00:06:29.110> that<00:06:29.200> process<00:06:29.560> during<00:06:30.070> the
