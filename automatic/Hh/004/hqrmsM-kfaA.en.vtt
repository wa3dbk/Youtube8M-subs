00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.910 

by<00:01:30.030> time<00:01:30.270> i<00:01:30.390> get<00:01:30.450> down<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.810> 60<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.470> not<00:01:31.680> hearing

by time i get down to 60 I'm not hearing
any<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:34.159> that's<00:01:35.159> not

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
any of it and you know that's not

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.710 
any of it and you know that's not
actually<00:01:35.520> affecting<00:01:36.090> what's<00:01:36.240> being<00:01:36.390> recorded

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
actually affecting what's being recorded

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.870 
actually affecting what's being recorded
so<00:01:37.159> it's<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.250> what's<00:01:38.490> coming<00:01:38.580> through<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
so it's just what's coming through the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.450 
so it's just what's coming through the
headphones<00:01:39.000> now<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> stay<00:01:40.020> quiet<00:01:40.320> hear

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.640 

the<00:01:44.460> audio<00:01:44.759> levels<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.330> camera<00:01:46.290> drop<00:01:46.500> all

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
the audio levels on the camera drop all

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.060 
the audio levels on the camera drop all
the<00:01:46.710> way<00:01:46.770> down<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.950> notch<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.560> if<00:01:49.560> i<00:01:49.740> wanted

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the way down to notch it so if i wanted

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.740 
the way down to notch it so if i wanted
to<00:01:50.130> theoretically<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.820> could<00:01:50.940> turn<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
to theoretically I could turn up the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.740 
to theoretically I could turn up the
volume<00:01:52.470> level<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.399> camera<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.149> think<00:01:54.600> I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
volume level on the camera and I think I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.940 
volume level on the camera and I think I
will<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.280> will<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:57.710> want<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.800> pick
