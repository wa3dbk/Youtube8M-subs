00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hello my name is Lena and now I 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.809
 I want to talk to you very seriously about 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.670
 food product like coconut 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.910
 associations do you have when you 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.160
 hear that word well, I personally remember 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.529
 advertising bounty from the 90's that us 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.510
 promises heavenly delight and yet 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.820
 absolutely tasteless coconut chips 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.470
 from the store who love to decorate 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.380
 confectionery 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.869
 That's actually all coconut is not very 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.149
 popular in our kitchen in our culture 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.370
 among our compatriots and even 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.530
 in spite of the fact that in our century its developed 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.739
 you can buy in absolutely any major 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.260
 supermarket at an inexpensive price I do not see 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.140
 to put his grocery baskets 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.539
 and meanwhile in Asia it occupies one of 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.489
 key places not only in cooking but also 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.300
 in the cosmetic industry its 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.090
 add salads soups and second courses 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.480
 desserts naturally in cosmetics it 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.640
 the pulp 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.850
 used to make creams and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.290
 masks for hair of the skin of the face and body skin and 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.240
 it is no coincidence 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.650
 This is not just because 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.600
 coconut there is common but due to his 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.479
 the biochemical composition studied it 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.530
 delving into this topic I learned a few 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.770
 interesting facts 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.560
 Well, first of all, this is what coconut is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.020
 mostly consists of fat but not 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.150
 it is necessary this husband scares the fats they need 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.689
 our body along with carbohydrates and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.689
 squirrels 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.540
 they perform a number of important functions and if 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.369
 we do not eat that organism 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.900
 all this harmony is smoothed 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.439
 balanced system coming out of 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.950
 building 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.619
 so we need fats but hearing this is not 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.460
 need to run and bathe cakes and pastries 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.130
 and screw them up because fat and fat 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.680
 discord surely heard that in the world 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.829
 there are saturated and unsaturated 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.009
 fats 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.170
 as well as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.670
 and these fatty acids 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.700
 they are for our body 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.380
 irreplaceable ie he himself cannot 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 synthesize them so we need 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.000
 extract them from food and if we are 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.920
 on vegetable nutrition then in our 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.260
 diet is not so much 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.530
 products that will help us make up 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.050
 behind 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.260
 with these essential fatty acids and here 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.810
 coconut is just one of these products 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.930
 he is absolutely indispensable in that 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.830
 plan that it does not just contain and 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.660
 omega-3 and omega-6 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.610
 but it contains them precisely in that 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.200
 amount in the balance sheet which 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.810
 necessary for our body 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.290
 that's why i want to ask you 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.340
 pay attention to this product 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.280
 you can use it completely 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.090
 differently the easiest way is 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.730
 his flesh 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.140
 but you can do more interesting for example 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.600
 make coconut milk 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.950
 it is done very quickly and simply 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.380
 I'll tell you now 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.410
 we just need water blender 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.420
 and coconut pulp on my blender I 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.750
 I use about a third of the nut 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.959
 you need to finely crumble add water 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.019
 and whip whisk until water 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.870
 will not become uniform and white during 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.209
 whipping is possible on the surface 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.130
 liquids will form white foam 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.239
 do not be alarmed it separates fat 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.989
 beat until the nut is using 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.140
 not crushed 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.570
 and the water will not become white after that you need 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.910
 strain and through gauze and at the exit we 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.430
 get two products first this 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.310
 coconut I like it 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.590
 I dry in the dehydrator and I must say 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.209
 that it is very different from 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.780
 shopping because she is much 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:44.370
 more aromatic and tastier and more crunchy 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:47.150
 and this coconut milk can drink it 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.060
 just like that you can add with the museum in 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.040
 medium muesli in flax porridge and in 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.590
 various raw food desserts 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.540
 so skin use options 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.730
 a lot of milk is possible you 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.920
 think up some of your own 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.739
 be sure to write about it in 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.019
 comments to this video and if she 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.600
 did you like it if you found out something 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.299
 new to yourself or cooked coconut 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.040
 milk in my recipe then put huskies 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.420
 I will be very happy 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.489
