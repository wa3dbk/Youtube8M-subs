while measuring you should wear what

while measuring you should wear what
you'll<00:00:15.509> be<00:00:15.690> wearing<00:00:16.020> under<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.440> suit<00:00:16.680> I'm

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.599 
wearing cycle shorts and the shirt
because<00:00:19.320> they're<00:00:19.680> thin<00:00:19.920> enough<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.189> ignore

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.240 
because they're thin enough to ignore
and<00:00:20.939> YouTube<00:00:21.600> doesn't<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.170> nakedness<00:00:22.619> I'm

and YouTube doesn't like nakedness I'm

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.620 
and YouTube doesn't like nakedness I'm
keeping<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:23.789> end<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> tape<00:00:24.480> measure

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490

taut<00:00:26.760> while<00:00:27.029> reading<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.660> I'll<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.170> using<00:00:28.349> the

taut while reading and I'll be using the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.320 
taut while reading and I'll be using the
other<00:00:28.800> measure<00:00:29.099> for<00:00:29.400> various<00:00:29.760> circumference

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
other measure for various circumference

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.200 
other measure for various circumference
is<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> way<00:00:30.960> up<00:00:31.189> now<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.579> cat<00:00:32.910> suits

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
is on the way up now I like cat suits

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.209 
is on the way up now I like cat suits
with<00:00:33.450> built-in<00:00:33.989> socks<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.649> making<00:00:35.100> your

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
with built-in socks and making your

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.920 
with built-in socks and making your
lowest<00:00:35.579> leg<00:00:35.820> measurement<00:00:36.300> from<00:00:36.450> your<00:00:36.600> ankle

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
lowest leg measurement from your ankle

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.450 
lowest leg measurement from your ankle
bone<00:00:37.079> where<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:37.920> pointing

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
bone where I'm pointing

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.459 
bone where I'm pointing
makes<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.120> obvious<00:00:39.510> how<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.750> join<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> foot

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
makes it obvious how to join the foot

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.619 
makes it obvious how to join the foot
measurements<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.010> later<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.210> here's<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
measurements on later so here's the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.569 
measurements on later so here's the
first<00:00:42.840> measurement<00:00:43.260> being<00:00:43.590> taken<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
first measurement being taken the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.340 
first measurement being taken the
distance<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.180> from<00:00:45.450> my<00:00:45.629> heel<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
distance up from my heel and the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.040 
distance up from my heel and the
distance<00:00:46.710> around<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:47.219> ankle<00:00:47.579> if<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
distance around my ankle if you have a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.690 
distance around my ankle if you have a
friend<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.590> copy<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.010> measurements<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
friend to copy the measurements as you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.880 
friend to copy the measurements as you
call<00:00:50.940> them<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.600> really<00:00:51.840> helpful<00:00:52.289> but

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
call them out that's really helpful but

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.889 
call them out that's really helpful but
if<00:00:53.039> you're<00:00:53.190> too<00:00:53.399> shy<00:00:53.699> or<00:00:54.000> don't<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.750> any

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
if you're too shy or don't have any

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.439 
if you're too shy or don't have any
friends<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.800> much<00:00:56.100> faster<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.850> record<00:00:57.270> your

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
friends it's much faster to record your

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.450 
friends it's much faster to record your
voice<00:00:57.690> than<00:00:58.020> breaking<00:00:58.320> each<00:00:58.770> time<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.280> write

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
voice than breaking each time to write

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.520 
voice than breaking each time to write
the<00:00:59.579> numbers<00:00:59.910> down<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.359> was<00:01:00.989> reading<00:01:01.350> my

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the numbers down I was reading my

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.229 
the numbers down I was reading my
measurements<00:01:02.010> out<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> camera<00:01:02.789> but

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
measurements out to the camera but

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.670 
measurements out to the camera but
you're<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.750> interested<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.409> hearing

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you're not really interested in hearing

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.710 
you're not really interested in hearing
those<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.489> I've<00:01:05.610> dubbed<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.090> commentary<00:01:06.630> on

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
those so I've dubbed this commentary on

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.380 
those so I've dubbed this commentary on
top<00:01:07.250> now<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.640> fairly<00:01:08.939> well-developed

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
top now I have fairly well-developed

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.170 
top now I have fairly well-developed
calfs<00:01:09.990> because<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> cycle<00:01:10.979> too<00:01:11.130> much<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> take

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
calfs because I cycle too much so I take

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.820 
calfs because I cycle too much so I take
enough<00:01:12.479> measurements<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.200> describe<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
enough measurements to describe the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.570 
enough measurements to describe the
curves<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.850> they're<00:01:15.210> below<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:16.080> knee<00:01:16.369> above<00:01:17.369> my

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
curves so they're below my knee above my

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.249 
curves so they're below my knee above my
knee<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.000> along<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.689> thigh

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
knee and along my thigh

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.590 
knee and along my thigh
you<00:01:20.220> might<00:01:20.430> notice<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.119> my<00:01:21.420> measurements

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
you might notice not all my measurements

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.289 
you might notice not all my measurements
are<00:01:21.990> perfectly<00:01:22.439> horizontal<00:01:22.830> or<00:01:23.189> vertical

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
are perfectly horizontal or vertical

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.120 
are perfectly horizontal or vertical
that's<00:01:24.299> okay<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:25.170> long<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.530> they're<00:01:25.710> mostly

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
that's okay as long as they're mostly

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.039 
that's okay as long as they're mostly
might<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:27.030> measuring<00:01:27.479> from<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> heel

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
might because measuring from the heel

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
might because measuring from the heel
each<00:01:28.229> time<00:01:28.560> prevents<00:01:29.070> errors<00:01:29.280> accumulating

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
each time prevents errors accumulating

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.179 
each time prevents errors accumulating
because<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.140> pretty<00:01:31.439> forgiving<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
because like this pretty forgiving and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.679 
because like this pretty forgiving and
because<00:01:32.820> we'll<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:32.970> scaling<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
because we'll be scaling the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.499 
because we'll be scaling the
measurements<00:01:34.110> down<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.380> bit<00:01:34.680> anyway<00:01:35.299> once<00:01:36.299> I've

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
measurements down a bit anyway once I've

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.210 
measurements down a bit anyway once I've
measured<00:01:36.780> around<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.470> top<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.740> my<00:01:37.890> leg

there

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210

tape<00:01:43.619> around<00:01:43.649> both<00:01:44.340> legs<00:01:44.670> at<00:01:44.939> exactly<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
tape around both legs at exactly the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.170 
tape around both legs at exactly the
same<00:01:45.840> height<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.380> that's<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.310> first<00:01:47.579> body

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
same height and that's the first body

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.870 
same height and that's the first body
measurement<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.950> slide<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> up<00:01:50.640> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
measurement I then slide it up to

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.940 
measurement I then slide it up to
measure<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.270> bums<00:01:51.600> widest<00:01:52.079> point<00:01:52.409> because

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
measure my bums widest point because

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.859 
measure my bums widest point because
that's<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.340> curve<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.729> need<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.149> fit<00:01:54.360> well<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that's a curve I need to fit well and

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.350 
that's a curve I need to fit well and
then<00:01:55.409> continue<00:01:55.890> upwards<00:01:56.369> along<00:01:56.549> my<00:01:56.880> body<00:01:57.119> to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
then continue upwards along my body to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.810 
then continue upwards along my body to
my<00:01:57.479> underarms<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.799> had<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> bust<00:01:59.310> I'd<00:01:59.549> need<00:01:59.790> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
my underarms if I had a bust I'd need to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.639 
my underarms if I had a bust I'd need to
take<00:02:00.119> more<00:02:00.299> measurements<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.619> I

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
take more measurements for that but I

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.550 
take more measurements for that but I
wasn't<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.100> lady<00:02:02.310> last<00:02:02.579> time<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> checked<00:02:03.560> during

wasn't a lady last time I checked during

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.410 
wasn't a lady last time I checked during
this<00:02:04.799> measurement<00:02:05.310> takes<00:02:05.670> longer<00:02:06.180> than<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
this measurement takes longer than the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
this measurement takes longer than the

here I'm measuring my foot from my ankle
bone<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.560> remember<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.099> first<00:03:51.400> leg

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
bone you remember the first leg

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.729 
bone you remember the first leg
measurement<00:03:52.150> was<00:03:52.330> just<00:03:52.629> above<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.050> bone<00:03:53.230> stop

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739

if<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.739> were<00:03:56.890> picky<00:03:57.280> I'd<00:03:57.489> worry<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.060> ankle

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
if I were picky I'd worry that the ankle

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.660 
if I were picky I'd worry that the ankle
bone<00:03:58.599> is<00:03:58.780> higher<00:03:59.080> than<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.560> inner<00:03:59.739> one<00:03:59.980> but<00:04:00.640> I

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
bone is higher than the inner one but I

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.369 
bone is higher than the inner one but I

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
like to make the soccer little loose so
