00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.859 
tissue of centuries the chicken state is
unusual<00:00:15.889> in<00:00:16.160> that<00:00:16.189> from<00:00:16.910> its<00:00:17.060> earliest<00:00:17.390> years

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
unusual in that from its earliest years

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.839 
unusual in that from its earliest years
it<00:00:18.140> began<00:00:18.349> to<00:00:18.710> talk<00:00:18.890> about<00:00:18.919> the<00:00:19.189> campus<00:00:19.669> as<00:00:19.820> a

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
it began to talk about the campus as a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.760 
it began to talk about the campus as a
park<00:00:20.180> and<00:00:20.980> valued<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.779> actual<00:00:23.779> geography<00:00:24.079> and

the plants as part of their agricultural

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.799 
the plants as part of their agricultural
heritage<00:00:27.919> so<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:28.910> campus<00:00:29.210> has<00:00:29.390> always<00:00:29.570> been

student today for study it might be
easier<00:00:34.700> to<00:00:34.820> think<00:00:34.850> of<00:00:35.179> campus<00:00:35.629> this<00:00:36.109> whole

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
easier to think of campus this whole

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.130 
easier to think of campus this whole
campus<00:00:37.250> as<00:00:37.429> your<00:00:37.730> house<00:00:37.910> with<00:00:38.719> a<00:00:38.750> really<00:00:38.989> big

if you are going to add on to your home

if you are going to add on to your home
what<00:00:49.489> would<00:00:49.579> you<00:00:49.730> add<00:00:49.879> how<00:00:50.659> would<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:50.929> do<00:00:51.050> it

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
what would you add how would you do it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.619 
what would you add how would you do it
MSU<00:00:52.070> is<00:00:52.129> a<00:00:52.219> little<00:00:52.489> like<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:53.120> reflects

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
MSU is a little like that it reflects

MSU is a little like that it reflects
what<00:00:53.899> was<00:00:54.260> is<00:00:54.859> and<00:00:55.429> hopefully<00:00:55.909> will<00:00:56.600> be<00:00:56.899> going

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
what was is and hopefully will be going

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.880 
what was is and hopefully will be going
on<00:00:57.530> in<00:00:57.710> society<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.969> campus<00:00:59.569> is<00:00:59.929> a<00:01:00.319> reflection

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
on in society the campus is a reflection

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.340 
on in society the campus is a reflection
of<00:01:01.249> it's<00:01:01.819> a<00:01:01.940> reflection<00:01:02.420> of<00:01:02.569> a<00:01:02.659> society<00:01:03.170> but

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
of it's a reflection of a society but

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.259 
of it's a reflection of a society but
also<00:01:03.409> as<00:01:04.010> president<00:01:04.220> Hanna<00:01:04.699> said<00:01:05.030> it<00:01:05.180> was

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
also as president Hanna said it was

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.540 
also as president Hanna said it was
meant<00:01:05.540> to<00:01:05.600> be<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:05.810> demonstration<00:01:06.050> model<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.340> as

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
meant to be a demonstration model so as

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.030 
meant to be a demonstration model so as
as<00:01:08.060> population<00:01:08.990> changes<00:01:09.500> as<00:01:09.710> we've<00:01:09.890> become

as population changes as we've become

as population changes as we've become
more<00:01:10.700> urban<00:01:11.120> the<00:01:12.020> challenge<00:01:12.500> is<00:01:12.680> not<00:01:12.860> to

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
more urban the challenge is not to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.790 
more urban the challenge is not to
preserve<00:01:13.430> this<00:01:13.730> as<00:01:13.970> a<00:01:14.000> bucolic<00:01:14.600> Museum<00:01:15.200> but<00:01:15.620> to

preserve this as a bucolic Museum but to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.330 
preserve this as a bucolic Museum but to
make<00:01:15.950> it<00:01:15.980> be<00:01:16.250> a<00:01:16.280> working<00:01:16.820> living<00:01:18.340> environment

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
make it be a working living environment

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.330 
make it be a working living environment
a<00:01:19.400> living<00:01:19.790> educational<00:01:20.750> environment<00:01:21.260> if<00:01:22.190> you

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
a living educational environment if you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.160 
a living educational environment if you
go<00:01:22.610> along<00:01:23.030> circle<00:01:23.420> Drive<00:01:23.630> there<00:01:23.900> are<00:01:23.960> places

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
go along circle Drive there are places

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.290 
go along circle Drive there are places
where<00:01:24.620> they're<00:01:24.890> grouping<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.820> four<00:01:25.850> or<00:01:26.120> five

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
where they're grouping of four or five

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.640 
where they're grouping of four or five
buildings<00:01:26.720> that<00:01:26.870> would<00:01:27.020> transport<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:27.620> back

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
buildings that would transport you back

to anywhere between 1890 and 1910 if you

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.160 
to anywhere between 1890 and 1910 if you
wanted<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.370> experience<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:32.120> and<00:01:32.390> yet<00:01:32.990> you

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
wanted to experience that and yet you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.930 
wanted to experience that and yet you
can<00:01:33.380> walk<00:01:33.590> on<00:01:33.770> other<00:01:33.950> parts<00:01:34.160> of<00:01:34.340> campus<00:01:34.730> and

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
can walk on other parts of campus and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.820 
can walk on other parts of campus and
feel<00:01:35.060> as<00:01:35.210> though<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.540> were<00:01:35.600> in<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.780> 1960s<00:01:36.620> and

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
other parts that really lead you into

other parts that really lead you into
the<00:01:38.780> future<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.350> that's<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.710> big<00:01:39.890> challenge

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
the future and that's the big challenge

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.510 
the future and that's the big challenge
so<00:01:41.120> in<00:01:41.750> making<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.680> decision<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.070> add<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.430> the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
so in making the decision to add to the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.390 
so in making the decision to add to the
stadium<00:01:44.000> for<00:01:44.210> example<00:01:44.720> which<00:01:44.900> was<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.400> radical

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
stadium for example which was a radical

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.900 
stadium for example which was a radical
decision<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.930> idea<00:01:48.320> was<00:01:48.560> also<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:49.010> add<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.880> a

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
decision the idea was also to add to a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.660 
decision the idea was also to add to a
big<00:01:50.180> building<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:50.750> make<00:01:51.350> it

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
big building and make it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.740 
big building and make it
multi-dimensional<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.850> its<00:01:52.970> usefulness<00:01:53.420> and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
multi-dimensional and its usefulness and

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.060 
multi-dimensional and its usefulness and
that<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:54.110> actually<00:01:54.260> works<00:01:54.590> as<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.800> fairly

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
that it actually works as a fairly

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.520 
that it actually works as a fairly
unique<00:01:55.430> poor<00:01:55.910> school<00:01:56.180> our<00:01:56.360> size<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:57.170> have<00:01:57.350> the
