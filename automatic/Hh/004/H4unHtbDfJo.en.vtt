 go well today I find you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.120
 to show how to do this 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.670
 hairstyle is a braid ears of wheat 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.440
 school is reversed which has been asked 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.000
 by camille so thank you camille for your 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.199
 message 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.510
 I hope you'll do it again 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.740
 little parenthesis we are Monday and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.119
 it's a hairstyle video 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.470
 that they are will be the only video of the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.250
 week because I'm going on vacation so I 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.960
 creates a registry 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.480
 this one is the one of the week 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.949
 next and if not I put my feet 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.939
 fan I enjoy the sun 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.109
 I will try to focus a 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.279
 little bit for explanations because 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.390
 that there are children who scream but 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.540
 as it's hot I let that sound 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 to be open and this morning I made myself 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.829
 wake up by a super mosquitoes who 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.670
 it stung me it was 5:15 am and I 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.500
 did not fall asleep 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.059
 so that's the end of the morning I 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.770
 begins to have a little dark circles 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.969
 and I tell myself that this is the moment that I 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.590
 take a nap 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.840
 so the first advice for this 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.620
 hairdressing is to train you on 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.600
 wet hair 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.190
 it's a lot easier and it's a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.960
 hairstyle listen well end horses 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.219
 which is very good for horses form 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.300
 because we can add a lot of 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.680
 volume very easily 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.329
 so you do not need to have a 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.700
 huge mass by cons it takes a small 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.930
 little length on these good words 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.970
 we do not attack right away then the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 principle is that we will start from 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.530
 ear to make a diagonal like 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.479
 it happened on the other side so 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.850
 choose which side you like 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.930
 to have a truce that falls on the shoulder 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.549
 is it rather the right or 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.350
 is it rather the left and the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.330
 blow you off the opposite side 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.110
 then you take your two wicks from 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.420
 start and it's good to show you 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.210
 be careful it's own country then you 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.299
 take a wick from the bottom wick from below 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.210
 must pass below and you the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.850
 do join the wick duo you 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.820
 take a duet wick or pass it 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.220
 underneath and she joins the wick of 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.049
 low 2nd step 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.729
 you pick up a bit from below she 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.200
 goes below and just before 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.920
 integrate it to the extent that you take 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.420
 a wick of the skull and you there it's 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.670
 underneath also so that they both 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.149
 actually join the first wick that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.780
 come from here 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.479
 and both join the hard wick 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.550
 like for up you take people 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.950
 opt to pass it underneath and 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.450
 just before the descent really you 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.959
 take a wick of the skull and you have it 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.720
 grouped with the first is there they 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.400
 join the bottom wick and there I am 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.920
 already made so wick of the lower men have 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.370
 down a little wood below and we 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:41.250
 take a lock of the skull and pass them 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.830
 below May 6 th 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.970
 a job 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.519
 a little game we pass below 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.709
 and we take a lock of the skull and we 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:55.590
 go underneath also up and there we 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:03:00.239
 tightens but old bast a little end in 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:04.230
 under a little bit of the skull and in 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:08.159
 russel same duo a little bit in 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.580
 under a little bit of the skull and we 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.580
 shed 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.459
 these tired beings you can do some 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.459
 pauses years 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.990
 very important once you are 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.209
 here in the middle of the skull 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.090
 started to take for the same duos 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.400
 the matches that come from here because 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.480
 otherwise they will stay here it will not be 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.790
 beautiful must they go a little to 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:44.630
 the back of the braid and images of the 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.720
 in front of force who will see them from rock 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.280
 was done in every way and a 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.380
 Once you have more hair 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.430
 added you end up between tasteless 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.350
 so normal for the braid ears of wheat 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.440
 normal from below you see I 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.260
 take with the index finger a little bit and 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.730
 ja goes underneath a peach and I 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.660
 call it without all that's the part 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.660
 a little easy 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.239
 and then it's a little bit 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.400
 almost the most important phase of 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.500
 the hairstyle is the pancake king for 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.539
 give it a lot of volume we take d 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.850
 a piece of wicks from the outside 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:31.169
 like here and we pull up and that 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.660
 must thicken the thick braid of the 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.240
 will be more air land on the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.400
 skull and you can go there a month I 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.009
 never have a lot but you can 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.900
 really thicken especially if 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.060
 you have fine hair do not hesitate 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.240
 it's okay not to worry 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.539
 hairstyle should not fall but it's tenfold 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.500
 the wow effect 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:56.699
 for the bottom of the after if you do 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:01.620
 like the outside to the top and that 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:02.820
 must give moult for the moment I you 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.050
 advise to hold the elastic when 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.460
 you do not do what you feel 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.490
 the hair that slips and it avoids that 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.479
 move so it's a little better and 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.280
 if you want a result a little 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.470
 clutter you can do something a 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.300
 little uneven pull a little more certain 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.889
 wick that others it's nice enough 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.270
 in general and that's the end result 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.590
 Camille I hope it pleases others 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.389
 so I hope you like it I you 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.039
 do big big kisses I hope that 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.039
 everything is fine and I tell you very quickly
