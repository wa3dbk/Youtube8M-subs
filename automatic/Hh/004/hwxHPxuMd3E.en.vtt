I wanted to try this brand because I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.580

wanted to try the mousse instead of the
normal<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.520> have<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.850> mix<00:00:42.090> everything

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.590 
normal one so you have to mix everything
together<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.340> light<00:00:44.579> golden<00:00:45.090> brown<00:00:45.270> in

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
together so the light golden brown in

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.479 
together so the light golden brown in
this<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:45.990> was<00:00:46.230> really<00:00:46.650> light<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.160> was<00:00:47.280> almost

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.150 
this one was really light it was almost
like<00:00:47.880> blonde<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.380> decided<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.010> get

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
like blonde so I just decided to get

no mix and it's reusable so basically if

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.010 
no mix and it's reusable so basically if

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
short hair you have full to applications

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.359 
short hair you have full to applications
medium<00:02:01.259> hair<00:02:01.499> you<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:02.159> full

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
medium hair you have one full

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.519 
medium hair you have one full
application<00:02:02.999> plus<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.599> root<00:02:03.869> touch-up<00:02:04.109> and

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:04.529 
application plus a root touch-up and

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:07.550 
application plus a root touch-up and
then<00:02:05.099> for<00:02:05.459> longer<00:02:06.060> hair<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:07.289> full

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
then for longer hair you have one full

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.850 
then for longer hair you have one full
application<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:09.270> we'll<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.810> -<00:02:10.110> kind<00:02:10.500> of

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
application so we'll see - kind of

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.210 
application so we'll see - kind of
medium<00:02:11.130> -<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:12.060> mean<00:02:12.810> that's<00:02:13.110> long<00:02:13.410> according<00:02:14.130> to

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
medium - I mean that's long according to

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.090 
medium - I mean that's long according to
the<00:02:14.340> Box<00:02:14.580> long<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.150> right<00:02:15.360> here<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.840> had<00:02:16.470> really

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the Box long is right here I had really

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.070 
the Box long is right here I had really
long<00:02:17.130> hair<00:02:17.310> before<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.420> actually<00:02:18.660> could

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
long hair before and I actually could

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.040 
long hair before and I actually could
have<00:02:19.170> used<00:02:19.410> two<00:02:19.710> hair<00:02:19.920> dyes<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:21.030> we'll<00:02:21.810> see<00:02:22.020> I

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
have used two hair dyes so we'll see I

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.710 
have used two hair dyes so we'll see I
might<00:02:22.410> have<00:02:22.800> one<00:02:23.100> full<00:02:23.310> application<00:02:23.940> or<00:02:24.210> one

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
might have one full application or one

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.840 
might have one full application or one
flaw<00:02:24.930> application<00:02:25.410> plus<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:26.010> root<00:02:26.610> touch-up

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
flaw application plus a root touch-up

actually have some left over which is
really<00:04:41.650> nice<00:04:41.830> because<00:04:42.190> if<00:04:42.670> I<00:04:43.180> wanted<00:04:43.450> just<00:04:43.750> to

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
really nice because if I wanted just to

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.020

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
touch up my roots with that color then I

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.940 
touch up my roots with that color then I
could<00:04:46.330> which<00:04:47.050> i<00:04:47.230> think<00:04:47.440> is<00:04:47.560> really<00:04:47.710> nice

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
could which i think is really nice

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.350 
could which i think is really nice
because<00:04:48.340> you<00:04:48.520> get<00:04:48.700> more<00:04:48.940> for<00:04:49.180> your<00:04:49.270> money

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
because you get more for your money

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.390 
because you get more for your money
instead<00:04:50.200> of<00:04:50.320> just<00:04:50.470> throwing<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:51.010> rest<00:04:51.160> away

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
instead of just throwing the rest away

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.360 
instead of just throwing the rest away
so<00:04:52.060> I<00:04:52.090> did<00:04:52.420> actually<00:04:53.170> like<00:04:53.380> the<00:04:53.770> hair<00:04:54.130> dye<00:04:54.310> it

David's mom to help me because I would
have<00:05:06.970> made<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.180> complete<00:05:07.780> mess<00:05:07.860> so<00:05:08.860> what<00:05:09.010> you're

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
have made a complete mess so what you're

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.530 
have made a complete mess so what you're
supposed<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.490> do<00:05:09.640> is<00:05:09.880> section<00:05:10.360> your<00:05:10.510> hair

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
supposed to do is section your hair

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.350 
supposed to do is section your hair
apply<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.560> foam<00:05:11.890> and<00:05:12.190> then<00:05:12.430> keep<00:05:12.730> sectioning

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
apply the foam and then keep sectioning

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.320 
apply the foam and then keep sectioning
it<00:05:13.510> and<00:05:13.750> keep<00:05:14.620> applying<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.160> foam<00:05:15.370> but<00:05:16.180> the

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
it and keep applying the foam but the

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.750 
it and keep applying the foam but the
thing<00:05:16.540> is<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:17.170> foam<00:05:17.470> liquefies<00:05:18.310> pretty

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
thing is the foam liquefies pretty

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.490 
thing is the foam liquefies pretty
quickly<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:19.510> you<00:05:19.600> have<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:19.930> work<00:05:20.170> pretty

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
quickly so you have to work pretty

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500 
quickly so you have to work pretty
quickly<00:05:21.340> like<00:05:21.460> it<00:05:21.760> was<00:05:21.880> dripping<00:05:22.300> down<00:05:22.450> my

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
quickly like it was dripping down my

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.240 
quickly like it was dripping down my
head<00:05:22.900> so<00:05:23.410> that's<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:23.680> only<00:05:23.860> thing<00:05:23.980> that<00:05:24.130> was

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
head so that's the only thing that was

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.070 
head so that's the only thing that was
kind<00:05:24.370> of<00:05:24.490> a<00:05:24.610> bummer<00:05:24.850> and<00:05:25.480> I<00:05:25.810> would<00:05:25.930> suggest

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
kind of a bummer and I would suggest

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.960 
kind of a bummer and I would suggest
covering<00:05:26.770> your<00:05:26.920> neck<00:05:27.100> with<00:05:27.280> something<00:05:27.610> I<00:05:27.790> was
