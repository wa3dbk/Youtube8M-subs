00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.500
 at Porsche it does not have to be saved because of the financial and euro crisis and also 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.139
 not because VW is too stupid 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.150
 but because the fleet consumption of the sports car manufacturer must under 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.550
 the sports car forge powerful as the consequence afford and owner of the left 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.409
 Motorway lane 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.039
 Spend your keys on gasoline 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.890
 or alternatively these 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.529
 and right on the cup-out already 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.460
 the animal is the new Porsche Panamera 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.900
 well, it's not that new he looks like any other Porsche Panamera 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.500
 six cylinders life looks like 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.480
 but this one is not unique and indeed only this one and that is 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.940
 this lettering is just not this that means has a diesel 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.020
 under the hood and that at the sports car manufacturer quite something 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020
 special 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.520
 after the Zuffenhausen already some features in their families Porsche 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.520
 have installed 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.920
 Now comes a self-ignition of woman who makes under the hood in the Panamera 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.090
 the six-cylinder 250 hp thus managed an acceleration from zero to one hundred 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.330
 in less than seven seconds the force has also come for 242 though 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.790
 You have to be a bit patient and especially street available 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.650
 to have 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.510
 the real sensation is consumption 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.020
 Minute + Porsche promises six and a half liters per 100 kilometers as a reminder 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.440
 the angry Porsche 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.750
 In everyday life, however, only very few will achieve this 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.670
 and those are the ones that are pushing against the sales record 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.620
 maybe even theoretically beat up to a thousand 200 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.780
 Kilometer with a tank filling in it 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.860
 but whoever manages to do that will not enjoy Porsche 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.540
 because the election result even offers a Panamera Diesel 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.200
 at least partially 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.090
 the first thing you notice when you sit in here is the house you 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.020
 Nothing at least does not hear anything from this, therefore, at all 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.110
 not the interior, it was also really well covered but as something 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.990
 You can hear that the expansion was that he made it true fun 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.970
 he is clearly sportier and taut on the road than the work the museum 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.630
 Doing the competition in this class is next to a Porsche and it notices 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.979
 you in every situation even if you drove her at the intermediate sprint Oscars 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.999
 Well that looks right what their 550 Newton meters of torque that is 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:18.309
 Diesel that is fun maybe it's just big and heavy and there is 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.829
 really only with the automatic to buy and he just does not go 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.829
 quite as brute forward we expected the better explored 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.089
 Nevertheless, it is quite amazing how good are bad grades and Porsche 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.539
 citation program 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:36.419
 Disposition maneuvers is definitely present even that really 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.959
 Fancy just 520 many teenagers who are dedicated to their goals 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.509
 detuned known 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.309
 but there are also things he can not hide one 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:47.939
 start-stop automatics surely they would 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.019
 almost finished Hentschel 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.790
 Low-rolling-resistance tires can do the job and bring two again 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.349
 To save liters of fuel 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.669
 but the trend is going to get in 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:59.219
 here is 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.190
 Porsche also at St 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.190
 sell it for that 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.370
 even if this is really hard to hear 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.510
 Do not expect a fountain to sit in a sports car 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.139
 Minsk Zuffenhausen on going 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.120
 stronger 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.609
 quick relief 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.509
 All this is not the Porsche Panamera Diesel so it is not for the small one 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.599
 Alley memorial round ever gave 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.670
 should it be something for those who can get used to it 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.899
 Detonator stuck in front under the hood 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:29.359
 on the scales goes out at the traffic lights and of course again 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.639
 The animal may be sporty, the touring sedan is good on the market 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.499
 And certainly the only industry with the 1000 square meters of forest driving 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.799
 can do it with just one tank 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.760
 most people will now ask the question for which strollers 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.479
 Model variants you should decide because there 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.939
 for all who do it 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.589
 does the price come to her? 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:54.659
 You have to pay about three and a half thousand euros diesel surcharge at Porsche 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:00.319
 the problem he is the base price of about 80 thousand euros certainly no 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.859
 Bargain especially as an Audi a8 with the engine already too good 7000 euros less 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.619
 but gets the faces and in the wallet to save but also at 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:10.449
 consumption 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.449
 and that can be the Panamera Diesel 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:14.719
 that is
