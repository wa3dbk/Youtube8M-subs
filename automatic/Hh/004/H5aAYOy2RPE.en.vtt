don't have a mouse you don't have right

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.960 
don't have a mouse you don't have right
clicks<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:39.709> we<00:01:39.830> started<00:01:40.130> from<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.399> clean<00:01:40.670> slate

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
clicks so we started from a clean slate

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.249 
clicks so we started from a clean slate
and<00:01:41.119> developing<00:01:41.630> an<00:01:41.750> interface<00:01:41.989> that<00:01:42.110> we

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
and developing an interface that we

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.229 
and developing an interface that we
think<00:01:42.500> is<00:01:42.619> really<00:01:42.649> optimized<00:01:43.520> for<00:01:43.819> how<00:01:43.940> people

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:44.239 
think is really optimized for how people

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:46.150 
think is really optimized for how people
actually<00:01:44.360> use<00:01:44.509> their<00:01:44.840> iPads<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:45.920> here<00:01:46.099> it

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
actually use their iPads so here it

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.469 
actually use their iPads so here it
shows<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:46.640> list<00:01:46.729> of<00:01:46.880> all<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.030> servers

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
shows you the list of all the servers

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.850 
shows you the list of all the servers
that<00:01:47.630> are<00:01:47.690> being<00:01:47.869> managed<00:01:48.229> by<00:01:48.289> this<00:01:48.410> virtual

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
that are being managed by this virtual

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
that are being managed by this virtual
sessions<00:01:49.099> like<00:01:49.190> you've<00:01:49.310> got<00:01:49.459> about<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.670> dozen

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
sessions like you've got about a dozen

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.639 
sessions like you've got about a dozen
of<00:01:50.090> them<00:01:50.119> on<00:01:50.330> there<00:01:50.509> yeah<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:50.989> this<00:01:51.080> is<00:01:51.349> stuff

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
of them on there yeah and this is stuff

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.380 
of them on there yeah and this is stuff
that<00:01:51.709> we<00:01:51.860> play<00:01:52.099> with<00:01:52.160> all<00:01:52.459> day<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.149> I'm<00:01:53.239> going

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
that we play with all day so I'm going

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.540 
that we play with all day so I'm going
to<00:01:53.420> click<00:01:53.630> on<00:01:53.660> one<00:01:53.899> of<00:01:53.959> the<00:01:54.080> servers<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:55.340> once

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
to click on one of the servers and once

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.339 
to click on one of the servers and once
the<00:01:55.819> information<00:01:56.300> comes<00:01:56.509> up<00:01:56.660> it<00:01:56.780> shows<00:01:57.020> me<00:01:57.229> the

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
the information comes up it shows me the

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:58.570 
the information comes up it shows me the
list<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.619> all<00:01:57.739> the<00:01:57.890> virtual<00:01:58.160> machines<00:01:58.489> that

virtual machines and and look I'm
actually<00:02:12.770> using<00:02:12.980> my<00:02:13.190> finger<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.580> kind<00:02:13.970> of

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
actually using my finger to kind of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.460 
actually using my finger to kind of
scroll<00:02:14.300> through<00:02:14.540> right<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.230> very

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
scroll through right this is very

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.290 
scroll through right this is very
similar<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.890> like<00:02:16.129> how<00:02:16.340> we<00:02:16.400> do<00:02:16.610> album<00:02:16.970> in<00:02:17.239> a

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
similar to like how we do album in a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.540 
similar to like how we do album in a
cover<00:02:17.480> flow<00:02:17.750> right<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.650> change<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.310> that

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
cover flow right and I change it's that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.430 
cover flow right and I change it's that
kind<00:02:19.850> of<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.060> model<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.510> in<00:02:20.960> terms<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.260> how<00:02:21.380> we

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
kind of a model and in terms of how we

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.070 
kind of a model and in terms of how we
interact<00:02:21.920> with

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
interact with

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.990 
interact with
system<00:02:22.500> then<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.310> can<00:02:23.460> click<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.850> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
system then I can click on the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.350 
system then I can click on the
performance<00:02:24.450> icon<00:02:24.780> here<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.200> actually<00:02:25.590> get

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
performance icon here and actually get

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.310 
performance icon here and actually get
historical<00:02:27.360> as<00:02:27.480> well<00:02:27.540> as<00:02:27.840> real<00:02:28.020> time

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
historical as well as real time

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.560 
historical as well as real time
performance<00:02:29.220> data<00:02:29.460> in<00:02:29.550> terms<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.970> how<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.150> ESX

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
performance data in terms of how the ESX

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.970 
performance data in terms of how the ESX
server<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.870> behaving<00:02:31.200> how<00:02:31.380> much<00:02:31.530> CPU<00:02:31.680> it's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
server is behaving how much CPU it's

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.890 
server is behaving how much CPU it's
consuming<00:02:32.430> how<00:02:33.000> much<00:02:33.150> memory<00:02:33.540> how<00:02:33.750> much

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
consuming how much memory how much

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.200 
consuming how much memory how much
network<00:02:34.230> how<00:02:34.470> much<00:02:34.620> disk<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.670> actually<00:02:36.000> seems

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
network how much disk it actually seems

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.400 
network how much disk it actually seems
fairly<00:02:36.420> intuitive<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.990> mean<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.230> says

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
fairly intuitive I mean it says

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.810 
fairly intuitive I mean it says
performance<00:02:37.830> right<00:02:37.980> there<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.490> seems<00:02:38.700> like

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
performance right there so it seems like

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.060 
performance right there so it seems like
you<00:02:38.910> could<00:02:39.060> just<00:02:39.620> intuitively<00:02:40.620> know<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:40.980> you

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
you could just intuitively know that you

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.050 
you could just intuitively know that you
have<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.430> click<00:02:41.550> there<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.850> get<00:02:41.970> yeah

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
have to just click there and get yeah

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.550 
have to just click there and get yeah
exactly<00:02:42.480> we<00:02:42.690> tried<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.960> simplify<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.410> as<00:02:43.530> much

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
exactly we tried to simplify it as much

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.890 
exactly we tried to simplify it as much
as<00:02:43.890> possible<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.340> goal<00:02:44.550> work<00:02:45.270> for<00:02:45.570> us<00:02:45.630> was<00:02:45.870> not

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
as possible the goal work for us was not

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.020 
as possible the goal work for us was not
certainly<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.710> have<00:02:46.950> every<00:02:47.460> single<00:02:47.820> feature

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
certainly to have every single feature

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.460 
certainly to have every single feature
that<00:02:48.240> is<00:02:48.360> available<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.930> Windows<00:02:49.110> product

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
that is available on the Windows product

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.740 
that is available on the Windows product
right<00:02:49.860> but<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.250> really<00:02:50.460> get<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.120> core<00:02:51.480> set<00:02:51.720> of

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
right but to really get the core set of

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.480 
right but to really get the core set of
capabilities<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.590> IT<00:02:52.740> admins<00:02:53.130> would<00:02:53.280> need

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
capabilities that IT admins would need

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.400 
capabilities that IT admins would need
on<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.730> day<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.000> day<00:02:54.180> basis<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.750> really

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
on a day to day basis and really

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.040 
on a day to day basis and really
optimize<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:56.040> interface<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.810> then

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
optimize the interface for that and then

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.810 
optimize the interface for that and then
the<00:02:58.200> other<00:02:58.350> thing<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.560> we<00:02:58.740> have<00:02:58.950> here<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.370> the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
the other thing that we have here is the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.090 
the other thing that we have here is the
tools<00:03:00.030> icon<00:03:00.510> when<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.080> click<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.440> allows

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
tools icon when I click on that allows

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.680 
tools icon when I click on that allows
me<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.370> ping<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.850> allows<00:03:03.060> me<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.240> do<00:03:03.420> trace

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
me to ping it allows me to do trace

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.300 
me to ping it allows me to do trace
routes<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.140> do<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.560> little<00:03:04.709> bit<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.890> debugging

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
routes and do a little bit of debugging

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.480 
routes and do a little bit of debugging
type<00:03:05.480> activities<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:07.560> then<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.190> other<00:03:08.340> thing

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
type activities and then the other thing

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.860 
type activities and then the other thing
that<00:03:08.520> I<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:08.880> do<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.180> actually<00:03:09.390> bring<00:03:09.600> up<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
that I can do is actually bring up a

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.470 
that I can do is actually bring up a
different<00:03:10.050> server<00:03:10.440> I'm<00:03:11.250> going<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.030> switch<00:03:12.450> to

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
different server I'm going to switch to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.810 
different server I'm going to switch to
a<00:03:12.690> different<00:03:12.810> server<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.410> has<00:03:13.590> more<00:03:14.370> virtual

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
a different server that has more virtual

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.449 
a different server that has more virtual
machines<00:03:15.120> running<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.860> here<00:03:16.860> there's<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.220> few

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
machines running and here there's a few

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.710 
machines running and here there's a few
virtual<00:03:17.790> machines<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.090> are<00:03:18.240> powered<00:03:18.450> on<00:03:18.570> and

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
virtual machines that are powered on and

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.020 
virtual machines that are powered on and
you<00:03:18.780> can<00:03:18.930> see<00:03:19.110> how<00:03:19.260> we<00:03:19.320> represent<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:20.250> power

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
you can see how we represent the power

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.699 
you can see how we represent the power
lines<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.690> paragraphs<00:03:22.080> slightly

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
lines and the paragraphs slightly

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.740 
lines and the paragraphs slightly
differently<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:24.090> for<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.390> ones<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.660> are

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
differently and for the ones that are

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.090 
differently and for the ones that are
powered<00:03:24.990> on<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:25.140> can<00:03:25.410> actually<00:03:25.530> click<00:03:25.800> on<00:03:25.980> this

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
powered on I can actually click on this

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.280 
powered on I can actually click on this
little<00:03:26.280> icon<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.910> get<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.690> it's<00:03:27.989> almost<00:03:28.140> like

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
little icon and get it it's almost like

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.050 
little icon and get it it's almost like
a<00:03:28.380> flip<00:03:28.650> card<00:03:28.890> as<00:03:29.190> if<00:03:29.370> you're<00:03:29.580> playing<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:30.000> a

a flip card as if you're playing in a

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.820 
a flip card as if you're playing in a
playing<00:03:30.269> cards<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:30.750> flipped<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.470> car<00:03:31.680> it

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
playing cards I flipped the car it

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.040 
playing cards I flipped the car it
actually<00:03:32.250> shows<00:03:32.489> me<00:03:32.519> information<00:03:32.940> about<00:03:33.269> you

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
actually shows me information about you

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.509 
actually shows me information about you

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
know how that how much memory has been

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.920 
know how that how much memory has been
consumed<00:03:35.880> by<00:03:35.970> just<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.450> one<00:03:36.600> virtual

good view in terms of what's going on in
my<00:04:16.590> data<00:04:16.830> center<00:04:17.120> absolutely<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.180> seems<00:04:18.330> like

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
my data center absolutely it seems like

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.820 
my data center absolutely it seems like
most<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.900> things<00:04:19.080> that<00:04:19.229> administrator

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
most of the things that administrator

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.490 
most of the things that administrator
will<00:04:20.040> need<00:04:20.070> right<00:04:20.580> at<00:04:20.880> one<00:04:21.060> screen<00:04:21.330> yeah<00:04:21.690> yep

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
will need right at one screen yeah yep

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.170 
will need right at one screen yeah yep
so<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:22.650> mean<00:04:23.070> we're<00:04:23.550> pretty<00:04:23.700> excited<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.090> bring
