a dark shady color so here's my very

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.390 
a dark shady color so here's my very
untidy<00:03:00.680> palette<00:03:01.280> here<00:03:02.230> I'm<00:03:03.230> taking<00:03:03.500> some<00:03:04.130> lamp

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
untidy palette here I'm taking some lamp

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.680 
untidy palette here I'm taking some lamp
black<00:03:06.220> but<00:03:07.220> first<00:03:07.519> I'm<00:03:07.760> going<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.060> add<00:03:08.269> shading

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
black but first I'm going to add shading

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.610 
black but first I'm going to add shading
to<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:08.989> rocks<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:10.700> we're<00:03:10.849> going<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.090> add<00:03:11.620> some

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
to the rocks so we're going to add some

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.670 
to the rocks so we're going to add some
burnt<00:03:12.889> umber<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.669> make<00:03:14.599> sure<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:15.079> that<00:03:15.260> shade

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
burnt umber to make sure that that shade

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.159 
burnt umber to make sure that that shade
of<00:03:15.709> dark<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.549> going<00:03:16.819> to<00:03:16.970> be<00:03:17.120> rich<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.349> warm<00:03:20.169> mix

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
of dark is going to be rich and warm mix

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:27.339 
of dark is going to be rich and warm mix
it<00:03:21.349> up<00:03:21.470> like<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.889> with<00:03:22.099> a<00:03:22.130> little<00:03:22.810> medium<00:03:26.349> and

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
it up like that with a little medium and

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.319 
it up like that with a little medium and
Here<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:27.590> am<00:03:28.209> just<00:03:29.209> adding<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.880> this<00:03:32.000> rocky

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
Here I am just adding it to this rocky

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.570 
Here I am just adding it to this rocky
outcrop<00:03:32.480> here

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.290 

by<00:03:37.480> increasing<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:39.250> dark<00:03:39.580> area<00:03:39.880> of<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.180> air

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
by increasing that dark area of the air

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.260 
by increasing that dark area of the air
I'm<00:03:40.450> making<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:42.010> crevice<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.790> rock<00:03:43.000> even

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
I'm making that crevice in the rock even

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.300 
I'm making that crevice in the rock even
deeper<00:03:46.080> don't<00:03:47.080> overdo<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.800> course<00:03:48.070> but

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
deeper don't overdo it of course but

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.770 
deeper don't overdo it of course but
just<00:03:48.340> here<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:48.850> there<00:03:49.000> just<00:03:49.180> in<00:03:49.360> areas<00:03:49.660> where

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
just here and there just in areas where

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.190 
just here and there just in areas where
you<00:03:49.900> want<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.290> give<00:03:51.480> your<00:03:52.480> rocks<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.930> bit<00:03:53.080> of

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
you want to give your rocks a bit of

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:05.070 
you want to give your rocks a bit of
extra<00:03:53.440> dimension<00:03:54.160> like<00:03:54.340> that<00:04:02.100> like<00:04:03.100> so<00:04:04.080> I'm

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
extra dimension like that like so I'm

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.610 
extra dimension like that like so I'm
now<00:04:05.260> adding<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.710> little<00:04:05.860> to<00:04:06.160> these<00:04:06.310> rocks<00:04:07.620> over

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
now adding a little to these rocks over

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:23.790 
now adding a little to these rocks over
here<00:04:15.359> giving<00:04:16.359> them<00:04:16.510> some<00:04:16.720> more<00:04:16.870> cracks<00:04:22.800> like

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
here giving them some more cracks like

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.990 
here giving them some more cracks like
that<00:04:24.510> do<00:04:25.510> rock<00:04:25.780> faces<00:04:26.110> as<00:04:26.440> well<00:04:26.680> just<00:04:27.640> very

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
that do rock faces as well just very

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.680 
that do rock faces as well just very
lightly<00:04:29.730> touching<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:30.850> brush<00:04:31.090> over<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.480> area

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
lightly touching the brush over the area

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.440 
lightly touching the brush over the area
without<00:04:31.780> putting<00:04:32.170> too<00:04:32.380> much<00:04:32.680> paint<00:04:33.070> on<00:04:33.450> just

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
without putting too much paint on just

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.350 
without putting too much paint on just
very<00:04:34.720> lightly<00:04:35.020> if<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:35.830> add<00:04:36.010> too<00:04:36.250> much<00:04:36.360> then

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
very lightly if you add too much then

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.600 
very lightly if you add too much then
that's<00:04:37.570> when<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:37.990> just<00:04:38.170> give<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:38.890> cloth<00:04:39.310> or<00:04:39.550> a

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
that's when you just give a cloth or a

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.990 
that's when you just give a cloth or a
tissue<00:04:41.340> like<00:04:42.340> this<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:42.820> just<00:04:43.230> wipe<00:04:44.230> it<00:04:44.440> back

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
tissue like this and just wipe it back

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.280 
tissue like this and just wipe it back
so<00:04:46.000> therefore<00:04:46.360> it's<00:04:46.480> important<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.020> your

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
so therefore it's important that your

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.770 
so therefore it's important that your
layers<00:04:47.560> behind<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.640> dry<00:04:48.910> before<00:04:49.210> you<00:04:49.510> go<00:04:49.660> about

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
layers behind to dry before you go about

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.370 
layers behind to dry before you go about
doing<00:04:50.140> this<00:04:51.480> now<00:04:52.480> that<00:04:52.660> I've<00:04:52.780> finished<00:04:53.050> adding

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
doing this now that I've finished adding

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.920 
doing this now that I've finished adding
my<00:04:53.650> low<00:04:53.890> darks<00:04:54.370> for<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.700> time<00:04:54.940> being<00:04:55.240> I'm

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
my low darks for the time being I'm

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.750 
my low darks for the time being I'm
going<00:04:56.169> to<00:04:56.290> add<00:04:56.440> some<00:04:56.830> of<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.340> brightest

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
going to add some of the brightest

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.810 
going to add some of the brightest
highlights<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.450> ears<00:04:58.690> of<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.080> water<00:04:59.820> stones

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
highlights to ears of the water stones

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.100 
highlights to ears of the water stones
and<00:05:01.470> maybe<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.680> clouds<00:05:03.540> so<00:05:04.540> to<00:05:04.630> do<00:05:04.810> that<00:05:04.840> I'm

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
and maybe the clouds so to do that I'm

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.710 
and maybe the clouds so to do that I'm
taking<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.620> fine<00:05:05.980> brush<00:05:06.370> here<00:05:06.730> I'm<00:05:07.390> going<00:05:07.600> to

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
taking this fine brush here I'm going to

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.380 
taking this fine brush here I'm going to
mix<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.320> shade<00:05:08.770> of<00:05:08.950> white<00:05:09.160> of<00:05:09.910> course<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.270> won't

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
mix a shade of white of course it won't

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.750 
mix a shade of white of course it won't
be<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.600> pure<00:05:10.900> white<00:05:11.169> but<00:05:11.740> once<00:05:12.010> again<00:05:12.340> we<00:05:12.520> need

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
be a pure white but once again we need

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.030 
be a pure white but once again we need
to<00:05:12.820> decide<00:05:13.360> whether<00:05:14.350> it's<00:05:14.590> going<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:14.860> be<00:05:14.950> a

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
to decide whether it's going to be a

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.420 
to decide whether it's going to be a
warm<00:05:15.430> white<00:05:15.700> or<00:05:16.630> a<00:05:16.690> cool<00:05:17.050> white<00:05:17.320> to<00:05:18.100> make<00:05:18.280> it

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
warm white or a cool white to make it

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.150 
warm white or a cool white to make it
warm<00:05:18.669> a<00:05:18.910> little<00:05:19.510> yellow<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:20.140> a<00:05:20.800> coarse<00:05:21.010> to

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
warm a little yellow and a coarse to

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.390 
warm a little yellow and a coarse to
cool<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.520> down<00:05:21.840> add<00:05:22.840> some<00:05:23.200> blue<00:05:23.380> pretty<00:05:24.160> basic

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
cool it down add some blue pretty basic

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.900 
cool it down add some blue pretty basic
huh<00:05:25.410> now<00:05:26.410> because<00:05:26.800> I'm<00:05:26.980> painting<00:05:27.400> highlights

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
huh now because I'm painting highlights

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.480 
huh now because I'm painting highlights
on<00:05:28.150> the<00:05:28.300> water<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:29.680> are<00:05:29.800> reflecting<00:05:30.460> the

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
on the water that are reflecting the

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.740 
on the water that are reflecting the
clouds<00:05:31.450> in<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.750> sky<00:05:33.000> this<00:05:34.000> shade<00:05:34.360> of<00:05:34.390> white

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
clouds in the sky this shade of white

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.380 
clouds in the sky this shade of white
needs<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.290> be<00:05:37.380> warm<00:05:38.380> so<00:05:39.250> I've<00:05:39.310> added<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.880> touch

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
needs to be warm so I've added a touch

needs to be warm so I've added a touch
of<00:05:40.600> yellow<00:05:40.950> and<00:05:41.950> a<00:05:42.070> faint<00:05:42.460> touch<00:05:42.960> of<00:05:43.960> the

of yellow and a faint touch of the
crimson<00:05:46.150> here

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.840 

same<00:05:53.410> as<00:05:53.560> adding<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:53.860> dark<00:05:54.160> lows<00:05:54.490> these

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850
