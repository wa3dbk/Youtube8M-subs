00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:10.080
 welcome your followers 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.309
 no on my channel and so in this video 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.960
 there will be a mop marker 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:20.850
 that is, molotov 711 em seems you can 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.240
 on the site share that is the widest 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.460
 Markovits all rulers in general which are 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.570
 it goes 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.309
 feather 60 millimeters i.e. six 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.590
 centimeters 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:38.000
 bought it empty refilled ink 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.000
 hammers cocktail 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.469
 what else is he now the flask marker itself goes 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.000
 ordinary as we will allow 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:52.250
 set nari or generally on any marker 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 hammers that pump system 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.960
 as it is a mop after the pump does not go 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.120
 spacer such as sponge 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.810
 directly goes to 3 open need 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.909
 carefully because that is if 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.420
 open sharply very rod 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.070
 crashes 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:20.340
 I donâ€™t always know what the problem is 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:22.700
 there are two such sticks that is 2 times 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.640
 there is this there is a latch which holds this 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:31.610
 cover from the cover is also written more precisely 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:37.680
 even engraving hammers and so here she is 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:42.150
 stupid 60 millimeters for comparison 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:47.260
 take the usual hammer hammer 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.770
 one and a half 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:54.950
 It looks so that's the difference I must say 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.869
 marker to the amateur as very 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.780
 uncomfortable to wear and because of this very 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.320
 round cover which I don't know why not 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.770
 made a direct income let's say they did 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.610
 round i.e. always sticking out of pocket 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.610
 somehow interferes 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.920
 so again I say the marker to 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.760
 amateur 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.900
 about how he writes 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.090
 say well, not really but you can play it 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.730
 there is on smooth surfaces quite 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.230
 go I think for this marker more 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.160
 would suit ink grog young precisely or 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.720
 a flop that is more fluid than a cocktail 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.220
 because when you write such a feeling 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.000
 as if 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.130
 ink does not pass through the pen well 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.420
 writes like that 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:53.720
 small spaces 8 middle yes so in 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:57.290
 In general, a good marker from hammers what else 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:03.130
 say we have in the city is worth 150 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.560
 rubles like this so you can buy 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.820
 try to fill flow pn 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.170
 I think it will not make anyone worse 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.910
 again I say a marker for an amateur and 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.829
 rather 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.930
 so clean come out in the evening remove the cover not 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.239
 close the lid walk play all 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.870
 endure because of course open 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.190
 close 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.200
 the rod fly out is not very comfortable in 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.959
 pocket is not particularly inconvenient to store 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:36.820
 dragging yourself subscribe to the channel 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.820
