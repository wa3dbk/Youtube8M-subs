we<00:00:09.990> have<00:00:10.230> on-site<00:00:10.950> tracks<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.759> we<00:00:12.120> rent

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
we have on-site tracks and we rent

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.660 
we have on-site tracks and we rent
tracks<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.780> North<00:00:12.929> America<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:14.460> there's

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
tracks in North America but there's

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:38.540 
tracks in North America but there's
nothing<00:00:14.940> quite<00:00:15.059> like<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.509> Nurburgring
