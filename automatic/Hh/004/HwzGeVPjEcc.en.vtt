out<00:01:32.250> how<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.460> shift<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:33.600> trying<00:01:33.960> not

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
out how to shift and you know trying not

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.660 
out how to shift and you know trying not
to<00:01:34.259> stall<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.950> extra<00:01:35.490> pressure

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
to stall and all that extra pressure

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.760 
to stall and all that extra pressure
just<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.570> an<00:01:36.659> automatic<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.590> learn<00:01:37.740> how

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
just get an automatic and just learn how

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.679 
just get an automatic and just learn how
to<00:01:37.920> drive<00:01:38.340> well<00:01:38.790> without<00:01:39.119> him<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.390> worry<00:01:39.570> about

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
to drive well without him to worry about

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
to drive well without him to worry about
shifting<00:01:40.140> first<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:41.130> add<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.549> manual

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
shifting first and then add on manual

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.609 
shifting first and then add on manual
transmission<00:01:42.390> lady<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.750> always<00:01:42.990> change<00:01:43.229> cars

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
transmission lady can always change cars

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.660 
transmission lady can always change cars
you<00:01:43.799> don't<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> same<00:01:44.399> car<00:01:44.640> for

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
you don't have to have the same car for

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.700 
you don't have to have the same car for
your<00:01:44.939> entire<00:01:45.119> life<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.500> always

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
your entire life so it's you can always

control<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.470> recommend<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> lot<00:01:53.369> of

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
control is that I recommend for a lot of

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.499 
control is that I recommend for a lot of
people<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.060> something<00:01:54.299> either

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
people to get something either

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.969 
people to get something either
front-wheel<00:01:54.960> drive<00:01:55.290> or<00:01:55.560> even<00:01:55.770> better

front-wheel drive or even better
all-wheel<00:01:56.610> drive<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.119> their<00:01:57.240> first<00:01:57.450> car<00:01:57.780> and

all-wheel drive for their first car and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.810 
all-wheel drive for their first car and
that's<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.860> simply<00:01:59.070> because<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.670> in

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
that's just simply because you know in

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.910 
that's just simply because you know in

so you know in the snow you're not as

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.250 
so you know in the snow you're not as

and<00:05:59.650> while<00:05:59.770> we're<00:05:59.949> on<00:06:00.009> 34<00:06:00.430> these<00:06:00.550> days

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
and while we're on 34 these days

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.159 
and while we're on 34 these days
actually<00:06:00.970> I'll<00:06:01.210> just<00:06:01.240> mention<00:06:01.539> those<00:06:01.840> as<00:06:02.050> well

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
actually I'll just mention those as well

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.659 
actually I'll just mention those as well
because<00:06:02.380> a<00:06:02.409> lot<00:06:02.590> of<00:06:02.620> people<00:06:02.740> look<00:06:03.340> at<00:06:03.490> those

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
because a lot of people look at those

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:04.980 
because a lot of people look at those
four<00:06:03.970> first<00:06:04.150> cars<00:06:04.449> because<00:06:04.659> they're<00:06:04.780> pretty

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
four first cars because they're pretty

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.960 
four first cars because they're pretty
cheap<00:06:05.020> now<00:06:05.409> at<00:06:05.560> this<00:06:05.710> point<00:06:05.919> and<00:06:06.190> that's<00:06:06.610> a<00:06:06.729> car

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
cheap now at this point and that's a car

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.480 
cheap now at this point and that's a car
that<00:06:07.270> I'm<00:06:07.449> in<00:06:07.659> the<00:06:07.930> wet<00:06:08.139> and<00:06:08.409> in<00:06:08.680> the<00:06:08.800> snow<00:06:09.070> it's

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
that I'm in the wet and in the snow it's

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.060 
that I'm in the wet and in the snow it's
very<00:06:10.060> tricky<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.259> handle<00:06:11.289> and<00:06:11.740> even<00:06:11.889> in<00:06:11.979> the

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
very tricky to handle and even in the

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.330 
very tricky to handle and even in the
dry<00:06:12.340> they're<00:06:13.210> a<00:06:13.240> pretty<00:06:13.960> oversteer<00:06:14.650> happy<00:06:15.099> and

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
dry they're a pretty oversteer happy and

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.860 
dry they're a pretty oversteer happy and
they<00:06:15.699> can<00:06:15.820> be<00:06:15.849> a<00:06:15.909> little<00:06:16.060> bit<00:06:16.210> snappy<00:06:16.690> at<00:06:16.780> the

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
they can be a little bit snappy at the

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.110 
they can be a little bit snappy at the
limit<00:06:17.169> and<00:06:17.289> kind<00:06:17.500> of<00:06:17.530> break<00:06:17.800> on<00:06:17.979> you<00:06:18.159> the<00:06:18.970> other

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
limit and kind of break on you the other

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.399 
limit and kind of break on you the other
thing<00:06:19.300> like<00:06:19.419> the<00:06:19.509> beer<00:06:19.690> is<00:06:19.810> eating<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.110> FRS

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
thing like the beer is eating the FRS

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:21.990 
thing like the beer is eating the FRS
their<00:06:20.650> tail<00:06:20.919> happy<00:06:21.250> as<00:06:21.340> well<00:06:21.580> but<00:06:21.759> it's<00:06:21.849> very

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
their tail happy as well but it's very

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.810 
their tail happy as well but it's very
progressive<00:06:22.300> and<00:06:22.960> easy<00:06:23.380> to<00:06:23.710> manage<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.550> slide

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
progressive and easy to manage the slide

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.570 
progressive and easy to manage the slide
whereas<00:06:25.449> cars<00:06:25.659> like<00:06:25.840> 350z<00:06:26.229> or<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.919> s2000<00:06:27.520> if

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
whereas cars like 350z or the s2000 if

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.070 
whereas cars like 350z or the s2000 if
they<00:06:27.669> step<00:06:27.880> out<00:06:28.090> on<00:06:28.240> you<00:06:28.360> it<00:06:28.509> can<00:06:28.659> be<00:06:28.750> kind<00:06:28.960> of

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
they step out on you it can be kind of

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.960 
they step out on you it can be kind of
hard<00:06:29.320> to<00:06:29.440> regain<00:06:29.650> control<00:06:30.009> and<00:06:30.430> so<00:06:30.520> that's<00:06:30.699> the

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
hard to regain control and so that's the

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.330 
hard to regain control and so that's the
difference<00:06:31.210> it's<00:06:31.599> a<00:06:31.750> matter<00:06:32.380> of<00:06:32.530> balance<00:06:33.099> and

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
difference it's a matter of balance and

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.459 
difference it's a matter of balance and
so<00:06:34.120> you<00:06:34.539> know<00:06:34.570> those<00:06:34.750> kind<00:06:34.960> of<00:06:34.990> cars<00:06:35.200> they<00:06:35.260> have

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:35.469 
so you know those kind of cars they have

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:37.140 
so you know those kind of cars they have
good<00:06:35.650> balance<00:06:35.860> but<00:06:36.250> they<00:06:36.340> can<00:06:36.490> be<00:06:36.520> very<00:06:36.880> tricky

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
good balance but they can be very tricky

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.870 
good balance but they can be very tricky
at<00:06:37.360> the<00:06:37.450> limits

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
at the limits

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.210 
at the limits
so<00:06:38.000> for<00:06:38.870> a<00:06:38.900> first<00:06:39.110> time<00:06:39.290> driver<00:06:39.470> I<00:06:39.770> you<00:06:40.130> know

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
so for a first time driver I you know

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.440 
so for a first time driver I you know
say<00:06:40.370> for<00:06:40.490> something<00:06:40.730> more<00:06:40.850> conservative<00:06:41.420> more

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
say for something more conservative more

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.750 
say for something more conservative more
predictable<00:06:42.260> more<00:06:42.530> easy<00:06:42.800> to<00:06:43.100> control<00:06:43.460> and

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
predictable more easy to control and

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.190 
predictable more easy to control and
that's<00:06:44.210> why<00:06:44.330> I<00:06:44.390> suggest<00:06:44.750> the<00:06:44.810> front<00:06:45.080> wheel

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
that's why I suggest the front wheel

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.900 
that's why I suggest the front wheel

questions as far as what kind of car
they<00:07:12.860> should<00:07:13.010> buy<00:07:13.130> it's<00:07:13.430> really<00:07:13.880> hard<00:07:14.090> you

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180 
they should buy it's really hard you

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.150 
they should buy it's really hard you
know<00:07:14.210> it<00:07:14.330> always<00:07:14.480> depends<00:07:14.870> my<00:07:15.290> blanket<00:07:16.010> answer

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 
know it always depends my blanket answer

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.010 
know it always depends my blanket answer
is<00:07:16.460> it<00:07:16.580> depends<00:07:16.910> on<00:07:17.150> so<00:07:17.390> many<00:07:17.480> factors<00:07:17.930> you

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
is it depends on so many factors you

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.300 
is it depends on so many factors you
know<00:07:18.140> so<00:07:18.320> many<00:07:18.410> people<00:07:18.830> want<00:07:19.100> different

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310 
know so many people want different

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.280

things<00:07:19.550> in<00:07:19.850> different<00:07:19.910> cars<00:07:20.390> so<00:07:20.960> it<00:07:21.020> depends

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.290 
things in different cars so it depends

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.560 
things in different cars so it depends
on<00:07:21.380> you<00:07:21.500> know<00:07:21.620> how<00:07:22.100> much<00:07:22.250> power<00:07:22.520> you<00:07:22.700> want<00:07:23.060> you

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:23.570
