00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.010 
max that have appeared and am both these
trailers<00:00:34.190> will<00:00:34.879> play<00:00:35.090> a<00:00:35.120> huge<00:00:35.420> role<00:00:35.600> in<00:00:35.750> the

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
historians in the gameplay it is sort of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.590 
historians in the gameplay it is sort of
reminiscent<00:00:39.710> of<00:00:40.070> mullets<00:00:40.579> of<00:00:40.790> previous<00:00:41.329> games

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
games but I believe since they may not

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.180 
games but I believe since they may not
have<00:00:49.730> rights<00:00:50.030> these<00:00:50.329> IPS<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:51.590> game<00:00:51.800> might<00:00:52.160> not

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
have rights these IPS the game might not

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.889 
have rights these IPS the game might not
have<00:00:52.579> a<00:00:52.610> doubt<00:00:52.850> this<00:00:53.210> new<00:00:53.480> game<00:00:53.630> might<00:00:53.870> not

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
have a doubt this new game might not

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.400 
have a doubt this new game might not
have<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.200> direct<00:00:54.380> link<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:55.070> these<00:00:55.309> past<00:00:55.730> titles

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.110 

now<00:01:00.410> it's<00:01:00.680> particularly<00:01:01.070> interesting<00:01:01.820> the

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
now it's particularly interesting the

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.270 
now it's particularly interesting the
trailer<00:01:02.420> seems<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:03.050> emphasize<00:01:03.680> what<00:01:04.009> looks

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
trailer seems to emphasize what looks

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.149 
trailer seems to emphasize what looks
like<00:01:04.399> a<00:01:04.729> countdown<00:01:05.180> at<00:01:05.479> first<00:01:05.780> on<00:01:06.159> closer

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
like a countdown at first on closer

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.459 
like a countdown at first on closer
inspection<00:01:07.340> we<00:01:08.090> can<00:01:08.299> see<00:01:08.539> that<00:01:08.719> this<00:01:08.899> is<00:01:09.139> a

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
inspection we can see that this is a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.539 
inspection we can see that this is a
percentage<00:01:10.249> that<00:01:10.909> is<00:01:10.969> decreasing<00:01:12.189> it's<00:01:13.189> hard

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
percentage that is decreasing it's hard

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.669 
percentage that is decreasing it's hard
to<00:01:13.759> say<00:01:13.969> what<00:01:14.209> this<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.569> for<00:01:14.929> is<00:01:15.259> it<00:01:15.439> referring

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
to say what this is for is it referring

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.699 
to say what this is for is it referring
to<00:01:16.340> an<00:01:16.459> impending<00:01:16.819> disaster<00:01:17.539> or<00:01:17.810> indicating

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709 
to an impending disaster or indicating

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.980 
to an impending disaster or indicating
that<00:01:18.889> the<00:01:19.100> resource<00:01:19.639> and<00:01:19.909> supplies<00:01:20.299> are

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
that the resource and supplies are

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.709 
that the resource and supplies are
decreasing<00:01:21.560> for<00:01:21.889> the<00:01:21.979> city<00:01:22.569> can<00:01:23.569> only

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
decreasing for the city can only

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.709 
decreasing for the city can only
speculate<00:01:24.170> at<00:01:24.499> this<00:01:24.529> point<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:26.119> scale<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.450> the

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
speculate at this point the scale of the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.959 
speculate at this point the scale of the
game<00:01:26.869> is<00:01:27.020> also<00:01:27.200> incredible<00:01:27.829> for<00:01:28.189> both<00:01:28.549> city

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
game is also incredible for both city

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.440 
game is also incredible for both city
environments<00:01:29.719> and<00:01:29.869> do<00:01:30.170> wild<00:01:30.799> areas<00:01:31.209> we<00:01:32.209> also

environments and do wild areas we also

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.209 
environments and do wild areas we also
get<00:01:32.749> a<00:01:32.779> glimpse<00:01:33.109> of<00:01:33.259> different<00:01:33.709> weapons<00:01:34.099> that

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
get a glimpse of different weapons that

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.699 
get a glimpse of different weapons that
will<00:01:34.399> be<00:01:34.579> in<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.789> game<00:01:34.999> we<00:01:35.420> previously<00:01:36.020> sought

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
will be in the game we previously sought

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.440 
will be in the game we previously sought
what<00:01:37.219> will<00:01:37.520> look<00:01:37.729> like<00:01:37.969> the<00:01:38.240> main<00:01:38.420> character

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
what will look like the main character

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.660 
what will look like the main character
having<00:01:39.170> what<00:01:39.679> looks<00:01:39.920> like<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.099> two-handed
