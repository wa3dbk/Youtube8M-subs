00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello children today I will teach you how 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.779
 make a hot chocolate the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.309
 ingredients are milk I'm using 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.290
 almond milk but can use 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.320
 any type of milk 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.290
 a batter or grinder as they call it 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.960
 in Colombia and obviously the chocolate in 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.880
 pill can also be made 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.190
 instantaneous but in my video we're going to 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.320
 do it with pills we will use 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.370
 also a pot or chocolate maker if the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.500
 they have and we're going to put four or five 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.839
 cups of milk 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.120
 this is the granny chocolate that is 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:38.550
 which is achieved in the USA but can 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.739
 obviously use any brand this 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.230
 it comes like this and what we're going to do is 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.870
 split it into squares that are coming 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.469
 they already divided 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.210
 and put them in the milk as they were going 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.040
 saying they can use any brand 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.290
 of milk and any brand of chocolate 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.890
 only that I do not drink normal milk 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.850
 then I only use the almond milk and 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.829
 this chocolate is the almost unique one that 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.940
 get here in the USA and I think it's a 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.740
 challenge the next thing we're going to do is 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.990
 turn on our stove we will put it 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.770
 in the middle so that we do not leave 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.210
 burn the chocolate and stir all the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.410
 time we have to be stirring 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.250
 so that our 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.440
 chocolate then how do you see here if you 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.200
 I like espesito like I like they have 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.390
 to begin to beat it quickly to 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.789
 that are made as little bubbles that is 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.979
 personal choice if they like it as well as 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.370
 me with fed up bubble or just what 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.300
 they can stir 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.300
 usually 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.680
 the next thing I'm going to do with my 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.260
 chocolate is to put a little bit of 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.960
 cinnamon I like cinnamon then 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.100
 this step that personal option I use 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.110
 this type of cinnamon 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.520
 it's badia and it's cinnamon powder here is 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.009
 a little bit difficult to get the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.430
 claritos then why he applied a 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.430
 bit 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.080
 This is the result of my chocolate 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.720
 I hope you liked it if you like it 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.230
 like it and see you in a next 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.530
 chance 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.530
 bye
