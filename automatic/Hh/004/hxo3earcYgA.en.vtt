that uh same weird

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.659 
that uh same weird
it<00:04:49.690> never<00:04:49.870> catered<00:04:50.139> to<00:04:50.380> me<00:04:50.530> that<00:04:51.250> may<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.490> may

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
it never catered to me that may I may

not<00:04:51.849> be<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.000> demographic<00:04:52.630> though<00:04:53.639> it<00:04:54.639> from

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
not be the demographic though it from

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.820 
not be the demographic though it from
for<00:04:55.690> my<00:04:55.810> taste<00:04:56.110> it's<00:04:56.289> a<00:04:56.349> little<00:04:56.530> too

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
for my taste it's a little too

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.140 
for my taste it's a little too
over-the-top<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.639> think<00:04:57.880> it<00:04:57.970> would've<00:04:58.120> been

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
over-the-top I think it would've been

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.760 
over-the-top I think it would've been
better<00:04:58.360> if<00:04:58.539> they<00:04:58.659> tried<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.020> play<00:04:59.289> it<00:04:59.500> a<00:04:59.530> bit

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
better if they tried to play it a bit

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.370 
better if they tried to play it a bit
more<00:04:59.949> realistically<00:05:00.610> again<00:05:01.270> it's<00:05:01.990> involving

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
more realistically again it's involving

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.930 
more realistically again it's involving
a<00:05:02.409> definite<00:05:02.889> a<00:05:02.919> notebook<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.460> kills<00:05:03.849> people

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
a definite a notebook that kills people

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.629 
a definite a notebook that kills people
but<00:05:04.620> there<00:05:05.620> are<00:05:05.740> points<00:05:05.949> where<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.370> just<00:05:06.520> gets

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
but there are points where it just gets

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.520 
but there are points where it just gets
a<00:05:06.909> little<00:05:07.090> too<00:05:07.240> ridiculous<00:05:08.050> than<00:05:08.169> it<00:05:08.260> kind<00:05:08.470> of

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
a little too ridiculous than it kind of

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.820 
a little too ridiculous than it kind of
makes<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:08.800> laugh<00:05:09.010> at<00:05:09.280> it

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
makes a laugh at it
