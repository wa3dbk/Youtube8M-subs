00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.680
 an essential that is never missing in my 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.270
 makeup is the first of eyes since 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.430
 makes both the shadows and the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.590
 eyeliner I stay fixed throughout the 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.610
 day and remember to always apply it with 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.610
 finger that has less strength 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.079
 this is a form that I am using 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:38.909
 practically every day is the 173 here 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.010
 and apply it all over the 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:42.960
 eyelid mobile but I leave the first part 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.040
 the one that is closest to the lacrimal without 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.350
 make up because then we will put back 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.120
 and I'm going to do exactly the same but 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.570
 in the lower eyelid just below 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.570
 tabs 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.000
 now or we know the eyeliner is the black 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.010
 mac crack in this look I'm going to use 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.530
 to frame the eye and I do not want to be 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.449
 protagonist so once applied the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.400
 eyeliner we will place a shadow a 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.619
 little bit darker to go 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.930
 marking the basin is the industrial 9 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.940
 from kiko that is a tone in a kind of 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.040
 anthracite gray I apply it at the end of 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.070
 eyelid mobile and I blur it towards 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.140
 half also marking the basin this 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.479
 palette will already sound you is the 15 ping 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.369
 planner de jos de la garza I use it for 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.020
 illuminate the lacrimal and also the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.810
 first part of both the eyelid mobile 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.820
 like the inferior 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.710
 last and also from Jorge de la 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.570
 heron a mascara system that 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.610
 I love the effect that a 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.799
 Narrow knife and silicone that 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.119
 lengthen lashes many you have 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.520
 asked where to find these 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.170
 products are bought in hairdressers and 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.350
 I think your website also better 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.970
 online the bottom of benefit I love 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.070
 I use it a lot but when I already have a 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.020
 little bit of color like now what I do 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.549
 is to use it to give and luminosity to the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.659
 face edge of some sparkles very 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.340
 pretty 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.929
 the night before I arrived home late 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.240
 so I could not wash my hair what 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.039
 have to do this morning and like every 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.350
 tomorrow I have picked it up with forks 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.239
 to be able to make up and the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.519
 releasing it has stayed with me so it's 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.180
 bulky without super complicated form of 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.370
 mold 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.530
 so what I do in these cases is 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.719
 pick me up a little bit since you see me 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.969
 pick up a part that I have longer and 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.680
 the rest tried to undo me a bit and 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.719
 I move it sideways so that more or 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.579
 less I was burned as I want is a 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.600
 a little more complicated and take longer 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:33.080
 first at the end so it takes shape 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.080
 ah 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.030
 and now we go with the out exposed both 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.819
 in summer as in spring and everything is 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.930
 brandy and the shoes are andres and the 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.930
 breastplate is salt 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.140
 do not 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.910
 It is a very cool breastplate very easy to 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.490
 carry and have a super nice fabric 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.380
 there are many ways you can combine this 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.570
 The white one would also be a very 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.980
 good option but I think the grace of 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.230
 this garment is that it has on the back 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.820
 discovered why I chose this 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.420
 brandy shirt that also has a 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.420
 back like this 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.480
 It is a garment that results in us 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.980
 place my cheeks add-ons well 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.590
 Do not hesitate to put a porsche 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.440
 striking a handkerchief on a label a 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.030
 even more collar necklace we could 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.310
 play with the different levels and 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.990
 place and study short a long necklace 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.780
 a Moyan necklace since it's a little 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.490
 more striking and chose this jacket 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.680
 that I bought it last year in the 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.810
 3 barcelona shop that is a color 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.709
 Super nice salmon that gives you a lot 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.709
 color to this look 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.840
 we forget about the colony I never know 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.840
 I spent only kidnapping 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.030
 click on the screen and woke up 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.870

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.870
