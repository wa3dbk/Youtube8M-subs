helicopters in this beginners guide we
will<00:00:29.949> talk<00:00:30.279> about<00:00:30.429> the<00:00:30.759> types<00:00:31.029> of<00:00:31.179> the

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
will talk about the types of the

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.720 
will talk about the types of the
helicopters<00:00:31.899> and<00:00:32.079> some<00:00:32.290> brands<00:00:32.680> when<00:00:33.640> it

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
helicopters and some brands when it

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.639 
helicopters and some brands when it
comes<00:00:33.969> to<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.239> types<00:00:34.480> of<00:00:34.690> RC<00:00:35.050> helicopters

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
comes to the types of RC helicopters

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.200 
comes to the types of RC helicopters
there<00:00:35.920> are<00:00:36.070> two<00:00:36.250> things<00:00:36.430> we<00:00:36.670> want<00:00:36.699> to<00:00:36.909> remember

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
there are two things we want to remember

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.380 
there are two things we want to remember
fixed<00:00:37.899> pitch<00:00:38.079> and<00:00:38.350> collective<00:00:39.309> pitch<00:00:39.489> as<00:00:39.729> in

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
fixed pitch and collective pitch as in

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.149 
fixed pitch and collective pitch as in
the<00:00:40.479> previous<00:00:40.809> video<00:00:40.960> I<00:00:41.110> have<00:00:41.320> described<00:00:41.769> how

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
the previous video I have described how

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.430 
the previous video I have described how
the<00:00:42.220> helicopters<00:00:43.030> fly<00:00:43.390> so<00:00:43.960> you<00:00:44.019> should<00:00:44.260> have<00:00:44.409> a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
the helicopters fly so you should have a

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.920 
the helicopters fly so you should have a
good<00:00:44.649> idea<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:45.280> collective<00:00:45.940> pitch<00:00:46.120> or<00:00:46.360> what<00:00:46.720> is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
good idea of collective pitch or what is

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.780 
good idea of collective pitch or what is
a<00:00:46.960> collective<00:00:47.559> pitch<00:00:47.680> so<00:00:48.129> this<00:00:48.339> time<00:00:48.550> we<00:00:48.670> will

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
a collective pitch so this time we will

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.090 
a collective pitch so this time we will
begin<00:00:48.940> with<00:00:49.180> a<00:00:49.449> fixed<00:00:50.050> pitch<00:00:50.290> what<00:00:50.559> is<00:00:50.680> fixed

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100

let's<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:37.980> how<00:01:38.220> fixed-pitch<00:01:38.970> helicopters

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
let's see how fixed-pitch helicopters

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.990 
let's see how fixed-pitch helicopters
fly<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.620> fixed<00:01:40.920> pitch<00:01:41.130> helicopters<00:01:41.790> as

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
fly on the fixed pitch helicopters as

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.780 
fly on the fixed pitch helicopters as
you<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.330> see<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.810> main<00:01:43.110> blades<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.980> a<00:01:44.010> fixed

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
you can see the main blades have a fixed

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.200 
you can see the main blades have a fixed
pitch<00:01:45.150> all<00:01:46.020> right<00:01:46.260> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.160> see<00:01:47.460> they<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
pitch all right you can see they have a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.260 
pitch all right you can see they have a
fixed<00:01:48.600> pitch<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.440> how<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.950> helicopter<00:01:50.670> ascent

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
fixed pitch so how the helicopter ascent

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.670 
fixed pitch so how the helicopter ascent
or<00:01:51.480> descent<00:01:52.070> depends<00:01:53.070> all<00:01:53.370> upon<00:01:54.090> how<00:01:54.750> fast<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
or descent depends all upon how fast the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.210 
or descent depends all upon how fast the
main<00:01:55.950> rotors<00:01:56.550> will<00:01:56.940> spin<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:58.200> more<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.890> speed

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
main rotors will spin the more the speed

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.180 
main rotors will spin the more the speed
the<00:01:59.580> more<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.030> throttle<00:02:00.480> the<00:02:01.200> more<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:01.860> lift

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
the more the throttle the more the lift

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.130 
the more the throttle the more the lift
will<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.460> generated<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.840> fixed

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
will be generated because of the fixed

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.560 
will be generated because of the fixed
pitch<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.950> less<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.430> throttle<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.150> less<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
pitch the less the throttle the less the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.570 
pitch the less the throttle the less the
rotation<00:02:07.050> speed<00:02:07.230> and<00:02:07.500> helicopter<00:02:08.429> will

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
rotation speed and helicopter will

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.630 
rotation speed and helicopter will
descend<00:02:09.090> now<00:02:09.630> on<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> single<00:02:10.470> rotor<00:02:10.649> fixed

single rotor fixed pitch main blades and
there<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.780> tail<00:02:18.780> blade<00:02:19.200> also<00:02:19.860> which

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
there is a tail blade also which

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.390 
there is a tail blade also which
commonly<00:02:21.030> could<00:02:21.420> be<00:02:21.630> fixed<00:02:22.350> pitch<00:02:22.770> as<00:02:23.040> well

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
because they cannot change the pitch so

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.009 
because they cannot change the pitch so
they<00:03:19.860> will<00:03:20.010> tilt<00:03:20.400> around<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.180> while<00:03:21.750> they

video where we see how helicopters fly
you<00:04:46.510> could<00:04:46.690> see<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.110> same<00:04:47.350> swash<00:04:47.770> plate<00:04:48.070> is

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
you could see the same swash plate is

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.270 
you could see the same swash plate is
actually<00:04:48.970> used<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.750> mix<00:04:50.050> collective<00:04:51.040> and

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
actually used to mix collective and

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.400 
actually used to mix collective and
cyclic<00:04:51.820> together<00:04:52.390> that<00:04:52.900> is<00:04:53.050> why<00:04:53.200> they<00:04:53.380> are

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
cyclic together that is why they are

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.210 
cyclic together that is why they are
