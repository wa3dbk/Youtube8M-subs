00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
marathon which really was my event later

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.110 
marathon which really was my event later
on<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:48.770> at<00:00:48.920> that<00:00:48.950> stage<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.700> half<00:00:49.879> marathon

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
on but at that stage the half marathon

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.810 
on but at that stage the half marathon
was<00:00:50.420> my<00:00:50.570> event<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:51.289> was<00:00:51.440> such<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:52.340> fun<00:00:52.460> event

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
was my event and it was such a fun event

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.029 
was my event and it was such a fun event
and<00:00:53.420> just<00:00:53.690> something<00:00:53.989> that<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:54.320> really<00:00:54.710> love

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
and just something that I really love

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.979 
and just something that I really love
but<00:00:55.309> it<00:00:55.399> gave<00:00:55.610> me<00:00:55.789> my<00:00:55.940> first<00:00:56.090> real<00:00:56.420> title<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:56.930> I

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
but it gave me my first real title and I

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.600 
but it gave me my first real title and I
think<00:00:57.199> that<00:00:57.410> probably<00:00:57.649> then<00:00:57.949> gave<00:00:58.399> me<00:00:58.520> the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
think that probably then gave me the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.880 
think that probably then gave me the
confidence<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:59.300> go<00:00:59.539> on<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.870> get<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.230> world

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
the local runners definitely I mean if I

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.630 
the local runners definitely I mean if I

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
think back to my second world half

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.630 
think back to my second world half
marathon<00:01:25.670> title<00:01:26.330> in<00:01:26.540> Bristol<00:01:27.049> in<00:01:27.259> 2001<00:01:27.950> the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
marathon title in Bristol in 2001 the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.780 
marathon title in Bristol in 2001 the
fact<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:29.600> was<00:01:29.780> in<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.500> UK<00:01:30.890> on<00:01:31.250> home

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
fact that it was in the UK on home

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.600 
fact that it was in the UK on home
ground<00:01:32.409> with<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.619> support<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:34.220> that<00:01:34.400> meant

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
ground with the support that that meant

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.039 
ground with the support that that meant
but<00:01:34.759> just<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.060> fact<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.299> it<00:01:35.479> was<00:01:35.570> in<00:01:35.750> my<00:01:35.869> home

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
but just the fact that it was in my home

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.359 
but just the fact that it was in my home
country<00:01:36.079> made<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:36.799> that<00:01:36.979> much<00:01:37.009> more<00:01:37.159> special

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
country made it that much more special

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.640 
country made it that much more special
and<00:01:37.970> I<00:01:38.090> think<00:01:38.299> it<00:01:38.479> will<00:01:38.600> be<00:01:38.659> especially<00:01:39.259> in

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
and I think it will be especially in

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.020 
and I think it will be especially in
both<00:01:39.860> ways<00:01:40.070> for<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.369> runners<00:01:40.549> because<00:01:40.880> they

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
both ways for the runners because they

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.670 
both ways for the runners because they
want<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.390> perform<00:01:41.689> on<00:01:41.930> home<00:01:42.110> ground<00:01:42.140> but

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
want to perform on home ground but

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.350 
want to perform on home ground but
they'll<00:01:42.799> also<00:01:42.979> have<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.310> lot<00:01:43.549> more<00:01:43.670> support<00:01:44.119> and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
they'll also have a lot more support and

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.870 
they'll also have a lot more support and
almost<00:01:44.780> home<00:01:45.229> advantage<00:01:45.560> for<00:01:45.920> them<00:01:46.009> excellent

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
almost home advantage for them excellent

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.789 
almost home advantage for them excellent
and<00:01:47.180> Cardiff<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.960> course<00:01:48.229> actually<00:01:48.470> is

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
and Cardiff the course actually is

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.859 
and Cardiff the course actually is
obviously<00:01:49.100> very<00:01:49.189> flat<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.729> it's<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.509> beautiful

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
obviously very flat and it's a beautiful

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.810 
obviously very flat and it's a beautiful
scenic<00:01:51.110> course<00:01:51.500> but<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:52.070> think<00:01:52.310> it's<00:01:52.399> very<00:01:52.460> fast

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
scenic course but I think it's very fast

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.460 
scenic course but I think it's very fast
so<00:01:53.149> what<00:01:53.750> do<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:53.899> think<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.170> mean<00:01:54.320> is<00:01:54.439> it

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
so what do you think I mean is it

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.780 
so what do you think I mean is it
possible<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.159> could<00:01:55.280> be<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.430> world<00:01:55.640> record

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
possible that it could be a world record

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.060 
possible that it could be a world record
there<00:01:56.119> I<00:01:56.360> think<00:01:56.960> it's<00:01:57.079> possible<00:01:57.259> yes<00:01:57.680> like<00:01:57.979> you

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
there I think it's possible yes like you

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.310 
there I think it's possible yes like you
say<00:01:58.220> Cardiff<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:58.820> it's<00:01:59.240> it's<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.750> flat<00:01:59.990> course

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
say Cardiff is it's it's a flat course

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.310 
say Cardiff is it's it's a flat course
it's<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.340> beautiful<00:02:01.729> city<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.240> it's<00:02:02.540> motivating

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
it's a beautiful city so it's motivating

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.590 
it's a beautiful city so it's motivating
scenery<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.130> surroundings<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.969> run<00:02:05.479> around

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
scenery and surroundings to run around

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.359 
scenery and surroundings to run around
I'm<00:02:05.899> sure<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.590> city<00:02:06.770> will<00:02:06.920> really<00:02:07.250> get

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
I'm sure that the city will really get

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.249 
I'm sure that the city will really get
behind<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.850> event<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.329> there'll<00:02:08.479> be<00:02:08.509> lots<00:02:09.049> of

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
behind the event and there'll be lots of

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.710 
behind the event and there'll be lots of
support<00:02:09.649> out<00:02:10.070> on<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.519> streets<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
support out on the streets and the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.990 
support out on the streets and the
weather<00:02:11.989> that<00:02:12.290> time<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.739> year<00:02:12.769> march<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.849> the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
weather that time of year march in the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.790 
weather that time of year march in the
UK<00:02:14.360> can<00:02:14.870> actually<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.230> mean<00:02:15.410> people<00:02:15.560> will<00:02:15.739> think

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
UK can actually I mean people will think

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.809 
UK can actually I mean people will think
oh<00:02:15.980> it's<00:02:16.099> not<00:02:16.280> great<00:02:16.459> where<00:02:16.610> they've<00:02:16.730> been

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
oh it's not great where they've been

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.530 
oh it's not great where they've been
marching<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.780> UK<00:02:18.080> but<00:02:18.140> from

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
marching the UK but from

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.839 
marching the UK but from
it's<00:02:19.170> probably<00:02:19.319> ideal<00:02:19.950> especially<00:02:20.670> for

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
it's probably ideal especially for

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.849 
it's probably ideal especially for
trying<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.329> run<00:02:21.480> first<00:02:21.689> times<00:02:21.989> over<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.680> half

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
trying to run first times over the half

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.679 
trying to run first times over the half
marathon<00:02:23.099> distance<00:02:23.430> what<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.510> think

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
marathon distance what do you think

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.619 
marathon distance what do you think
about<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:25.019> concept<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:26.209> 20,000<00:02:27.209> amateur

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
about this concept of 20,000 amateur

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.209 
about this concept of 20,000 amateur
runners<00:02:27.810> signing<00:02:28.349> up<00:02:28.439> to<00:02:28.620> be<00:02:28.709> able<00:02:28.859> to<00:02:28.950> run<00:02:29.099> in

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
runners signing up to be able to run in

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.890 
runners signing up to be able to run in
the<00:02:29.280> footsteps<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.090> champions<00:02:30.629> of<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
the footsteps of the champions of the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.630 
the footsteps of the champions of the
elite<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.379> mean<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.709> great<00:02:31.829> idea<00:02:31.920> isn't<00:02:32.400> it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
elite I mean it's a great idea isn't it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.369 
elite I mean it's a great idea isn't it
is<00:02:32.849> it's<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.120> really<00:02:33.299> special<00:02:33.599> idea<00:02:33.959> i<00:02:34.019> think<00:02:34.079> it

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
is it's a really special idea i think it

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.800 
is it's a really special idea i think it
unites<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.730> mass<00:02:35.909> runners<00:02:36.359> with<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
unites the the mass runners with the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.080 
unites the the mass runners with the
elite<00:02:37.170> runners<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:38.189> if<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.579> think<00:02:38.609> about<00:02:38.909> it

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
elite runners and if you think about it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.360 
elite runners and if you think about it
running<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.140> road<00:02:40.590> running<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:40.980> probably<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
running and road running is probably the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.030 
running and road running is probably the
only<00:02:41.540> sport<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.870> were<00:02:43.319> we<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.650> do<00:02:43.829> that

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
only sport that were we can do that

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.349 
only sport that were we can do that

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.580 
if a world record is set all the people
are<00:03:00.599> going<00:03:00.689> to<00:03:00.780> be<00:03:00.840> able<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.049> say<00:03:01.139> well<00:03:01.260> we<00:03:01.409> ran

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
are going to be able to say well we ran

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.470 
are going to be able to say well we ran
in<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.829> race<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.159> day<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.060> really

in the race that day and that really

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.270 
in the race that day and that really
means<00:03:03.659> something<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.139> I<00:03:04.169> think<00:03:04.319> it's<00:03:04.919> a<00:03:05.040> really

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280

means something so I think it's a really
good<00:03:05.400> concept<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.120> sort<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.599> spread<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.560> the
