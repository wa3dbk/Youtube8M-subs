00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.479
 Culture is the food of the soul but 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.119
 we could also summarize it in one 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.970
 phrase is the key to getting in harmony 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.270

 of our life but what truly 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.069
 relevant is that there are those who 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.010
 dedicate to create it to spread it to give them 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.340
 its real dimension thanks to them and their 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.860
 inspiration is that we sing we dance 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.370
 we dream and we gather around her 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.530
 as on this occasion where we will recognize 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.530
 the trajectory of the authors and 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.500
 composers who thanks to their talent and 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.890

 the talent of its own competitors 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.930
 where we all surrender to talent 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.780
 where we find the seed of 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.930
