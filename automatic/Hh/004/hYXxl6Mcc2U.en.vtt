of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> things<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.850> rarely<00:01:36.240> see<00:01:36.750> Jennifer<00:01:37.320> do

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
of the things I rarely see Jennifer do

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.289 
of the things I rarely see Jennifer do
is<00:01:38.390> leave<00:01:39.390> her<00:01:39.630> roots<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.369> feel<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.670> even<00:01:41.939> when

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
is leave her roots I feel like even when

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.539 
is leave her roots I feel like even when
you<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.810> she<00:01:43.049> has<00:01:43.229> roots<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.159> really

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
you think she has roots it's not really

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.780 
you think she has roots it's not really
roots<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.210> maybe<00:01:45.899> her<00:01:46.860> little<00:01:47.189> transition

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
roots it's maybe her little transition

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.330 
roots it's maybe her little transition
into<00:01:48.299> toning<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> down<00:01:48.899> from<00:01:49.500> very<00:01:49.710> blonde<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
into toning it down from very blonde to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.929 
into toning it down from very blonde to
brown

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
brown

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.719 
brown
I<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.600> think<00:01:51.810> Jennifer<00:01:52.369> maintains<00:01:53.369> her<00:01:53.520> hair

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
I just think Jennifer maintains her hair

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.319 
I just think Jennifer maintains her hair
color<00:01:53.970> very<00:01:54.509> very<00:01:54.810> often<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.759> when<00:01:56.759> clients

just always maintain it something I

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.710

Aniston

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.600 
Aniston
and<00:02:10.360> in<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.900> bathroom<00:02:11.080> doing<00:02:11.890> her<00:02:12.160> own<00:02:12.310> color

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
and in the bathroom doing her own color

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.840 
and in the bathroom doing her own color
so<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.480> have<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:14.200> say<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.550> definitely

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
so I have to say that this is definitely

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.510 
so I have to say that this is definitely
a<00:02:16.270> look<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:17.350> gets<00:02:17.650> done<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.130> hair<00:02:18.340> salon

I<00:02:18.970> actually<00:02:20.070> don't<00:02:21.070> even<00:02:21.280> think<00:02:21.760> that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
I actually don't even think that

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.940 
I actually don't even think that
