00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
from the ground in the roots you can see

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.650 
from the ground in the roots you can see
there<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.410> different<00:01:24.070> types<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.430> leaves<00:01:24.660> this

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
is a sweet salad mix here and the leaves

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.890 
is a sweet salad mix here and the leaves
come<00:01:29.680> up<00:01:29.800> from<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.159> roots<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.900> basically

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
come up from the roots and basically

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.240 
come up from the roots and basically
when<00:01:32.320> we're<00:01:32.440> going<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.590> harvest<00:01:32.950> this<00:01:33.040> we're

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
when we're going to harvest this we're

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.760 
when we're going to harvest this we're
just<00:01:33.400> going<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.580> snip<00:01:33.790> it<00:01:33.940> off<00:01:34.110> about<00:01:35.110> three

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
just going to snip it off about three

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.380 
just going to snip it off about three
inches<00:01:36.070> from<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.430> bottom<00:01:36.610> from<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.120> ground

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
inches from the bottom from the ground

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.770 
inches from the bottom from the ground
and<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.400> we're<00:01:40.060> just<00:01:40.120> going<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.330> eat<00:01:40.480> it<00:01:40.600> that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
and and we're just going to eat it that

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.690 
and and we're just going to eat it that
way<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.830> then<00:01:41.920> what<00:01:42.100> happens<00:01:42.400> is<00:01:42.550> is<00:01:42.670> that

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
way and then what happens is is that

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.399 
way and then what happens is is that
this<00:01:43.000> this<00:01:43.300> type<00:01:43.510> of<00:01:43.540> lettuce<00:01:43.750> will<00:01:43.960> regrow

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
this this type of lettuce will regrow

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.730 
this this type of lettuce will regrow
and<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:46.630> can<00:01:46.810> have<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:46.960> long<00:01:47.229> long<00:01:47.500> harvest

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
and so you can have a long long harvest

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.270 
and so you can have a long long harvest
with<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.280> until<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:49.360> bolts<00:01:49.750> which<00:01:50.409> basically

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
with it until it bolts which basically

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.790 
with it until it bolts which basically
the<00:01:51.790> plant<00:01:52.000> goes<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.420> seed<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.870> at<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:53.560> point

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
the plant goes to seed and at that point

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.070 
the plant goes to seed and at that point
it<00:01:53.890> becomes<00:01:54.100> very<00:01:54.430> bitter<00:01:54.930> alright<00:01:55.930> guys

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
it becomes very bitter alright guys

stalk here when you cut it if the plant
has<00:02:16.239> bolted<00:02:16.599> or<00:02:16.810> not<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.549> if<00:02:18.549> when<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.150> kind

of squeeze the tip and you'll see a

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.830 
of squeeze the tip and you'll see a
little<00:02:21.459> bit<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.760> juice<00:02:21.999> or<00:02:22.180> liquid<00:02:22.480> come<00:02:22.659> out

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
little bit of juice or liquid come out

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.979 
little bit of juice or liquid come out
that'll<00:02:23.829> be<00:02:23.950> that'll<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.549> clear<00:02:24.999> if<00:02:25.180> it's<00:02:25.629> if

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
that'll be that'll be clear if it's if

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:26.930 
that'll be that'll be clear if it's if
it's<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.260> good<00:02:26.439> plan

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
it's a good plan

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.390 
it's a good plan
that<00:02:27.270> hasn't<00:02:27.450> bolted<00:02:27.900> yet<00:02:28.080> if<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.710> has<00:02:28.860> bolted

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
that hasn't bolted yet if it has bolted

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.120 
that hasn't bolted yet if it has bolted
it<00:02:29.790> will<00:02:30.030> be<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.270> creamy<00:02:30.720> or<00:02:30.960> a<00:02:31.020> milk<00:02:31.290> color<00:02:31.650> and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
it will be a creamy or a milk color and

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.430 
it will be a creamy or a milk color and
that<00:02:32.880> plant<00:02:33.180> probably<00:02:33.510> tastes<00:02:33.960> pretty<00:02:34.110> bitter

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
that plant probably tastes pretty bitter

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.660 
that plant probably tastes pretty bitter
there's<00:02:34.680> nothing<00:02:34.980> worse<00:02:35.160> than<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.370> bitter

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
there's nothing worse than a bitter

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.650 
there's nothing worse than a bitter
lettuce<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:38.280> that's<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.210> leaf<00:02:39.420> lettuce

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.080 
cut it at the bottom of the plant
basically<00:03:18.600> at<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.200> at<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.160> soil<00:03:20.400> line<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
basically at the at the soil line the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.730 
basically at the at the soil line the
best<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.480> can<00:03:21.690> sometimes<00:03:22.440> it's<00:03:22.620> pretty

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
best you can sometimes it's pretty

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.120 
best you can sometimes it's pretty
difficult<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:24.000> I'm<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.270> going<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.920> cut<00:03:25.920> this

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
difficult so I'm just going to cut this

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.380 
difficult so I'm just going to cut this
one<00:03:26.340> here<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:28.410> as<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.130> see<00:03:29.190> all<00:03:29.850> the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
one here and as you can see all the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.160 
one here and as you can see all the
leaves<00:03:30.570> kind<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:30.959> come<00:03:31.110> up<00:03:31.230> with<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.470> stem<00:03:31.739> and

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
leaves kind of come up with the stem and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.280 
leaves kind of come up with the stem and
basically<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.350> same<00:03:34.530> rule<00:03:34.770> applies<00:03:35.100> here<00:03:35.610> is

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
basically the same rule applies here is

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.900 
basically the same rule applies here is
if<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:38.390> take<00:03:39.390> one<00:03:39.570> of<00:03:39.600> these<00:03:39.720> leaves<00:03:40.050> off<00:03:40.320> and

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
if you take one of these leaves off and

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.260 
if you take one of these leaves off and
squeeze<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.090> end<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.390> stem<00:03:42.690> here<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:44.270> you

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
squeeze the end of the stem here and you

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.300 
squeeze the end of the stem here and you
can<00:03:45.390> kind<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.630> see<00:03:45.870> that

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
can kind of see that

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.430 
can kind of see that
squeeze<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.180> stem<00:03:48.420> look<00:03:48.660> at<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> liquid<00:03:51.440> that

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
squeeze the stem look at the liquid that
