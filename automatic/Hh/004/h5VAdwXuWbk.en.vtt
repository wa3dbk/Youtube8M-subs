00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.699
 adventures and I was doing my first 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.190
 adventure map with commands with 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.380
 story with end and with 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.720
 and all that whatever 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.060
 I was saying that I was finishing what I 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.860
 it has taken two weeks three weeks not 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.960
 I'm me they take me around three 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.240
 weeks but well you see all the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.310
 work at work all that filled with 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.110
 commands all this was already commands all 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.400
 of blocks is almost finished 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.220
 missing the final touches and missing a 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.230
 last test to see if something is missing and 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.479
 There is something left and something must be put 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.280
 You have to remove something if everything goes well if 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.780
 it does not come out at all well I'll put map to 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.780

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.150
 and two days but I do not know whether to do 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.320
 you can leave me in the comments if 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.090
 you want a trailer or trailer in your media 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.890
 They disgust me whatever it is I do not care 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.590
 You have to know that I do not have a bitch 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.540
 Command idea is worth all commands 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.580
 so special and super mega rare that you 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.170
 you say ostia what a face that everything has been 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.170
 thanks to the videos of wanting to grow 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.560
 the story itself is set 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.730
 the future is futuristic has things 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.890
 future have many future things 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.350
 has futuristic things have things of the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.350
 future or non-machines sounds 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.840
 the result also I have edited it 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.430
 they change the textures I used a 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.600
 I hope I changed a few things out there 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.810
 I added I added sounds but for 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.390
 example you see all this is a let's say a 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.330
 dining like that to make it better let's say 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.520
 that is the future are not futuristic rooms 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.800
 and super super mega cool pictures 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.770
 I have also changed them 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.150
 directory space or two oxygen better 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.650
 let's get out of here I 'm going to 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.650
 teach a few sounds 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.420
 you have seen 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.840
 hello a lot of other sound that I'm going to 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.920
 show you is this right here this 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.150
 from here that's when you're in the 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.150
 elevator and this sounds 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.150
 this is my perfect floor I get here 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.200
 that more united then for example I that 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.190
 I know we are going to put 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.190
 let's put here 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.849
 they are sounds that I have put to invent 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.420

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.420

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.569
 and 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.210
 I do not know why I put that in this 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.470
 and finally I have to tell you that 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.230
 I also noticed a little bit in the 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.800
 portal is not the same but it happens to me 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.840
 little bit in the idea of â€‹â€‹a miracle for 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.050
 never talk to a machine 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.970
 and interact with the efe machines and more 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.709
 things and this will be your leave me in the 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.690
