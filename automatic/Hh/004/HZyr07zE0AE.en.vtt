00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello welcome daylight 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.059
 and new is so strange I would say 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.710
 so here's the addition for the bazaar chorus 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.920
 it means a little video about what is there 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.960
 You can profit by buying it by buying either 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.680
 if you are the lucky owner of the season 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.430
 pass from it 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.740
 a freebie given there seems sort of like 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.289
 and passing it again I repeat 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.660
 strange job you get receipts 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.210
 where they attacked the whole in cars 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.190
 Milo carts let's see what's here 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.079
 for the receipt of music so what we get there 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:45.480
 the storekeeper 10 things gathered here is great 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.930
 match this kukri junk checked and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.730
 junk accounts 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.600
 next we have a deadly fire ax 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:00.620
 junk 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:02.910
 there in general he is just on the details 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.479
 absolute scrap metal well though dme 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.720
 I don't know any yellow 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.720
 golden and 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:19.979
 deadly fire ax chu still kukri 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.530
 and the last shish in general but if so 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.460
 In the details see this is my 700 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.850
 damage 800 damage but it's still thousands here 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.600
 also ax khovansky 800 deadly 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.950
 fireman 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:39.329
 in general, the absolute junk but how are we 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.579
 might notice means here it is suggested 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.290
 after you pass this here 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:50.369
 task you are given drawings drawings somehow 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.460
 even strange I would have noted bow 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.950
 music want to shoot your head so that 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.619
 this was not heard throughout the city 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.469
 thanks to the bow, the base to your broads will 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.780
 replaced by melons 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.549
 produce one thing and so here are needed 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.459
 metal parts for tapes nails 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.790
 bichik is a unique drawing it is issued 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.640
 only in addition means you get 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.760
 this one is an automaton well, plus you need more 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.200
 craft arrows for me for now only 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.060
 arrows but 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.680
 it means giving to see how this bow 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.700
 Looks like a whole place with polenta 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.930
 what to do here and so 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.780
 here this bow can throw it away 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.630
 I don't know if you have any add-ons or 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:45.060
 no can a man raise it mean 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.950
 I would like to all subscribers on 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.050
 Kravchenko says as junk 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.120
 Nemer and if you do not have this 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.060
 additions 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.130
 then as they say I'm not a greedy share and 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.440
 will you have a bow base how to become it 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.549
 somehow you can improve 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:06.060
 it means we can take 360 into it 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:10.440
 embed some two things two lines 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.260
 it does not break and what the developers mean 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.220
 If you improve 2 some of these well, I 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.380
 probably king tsun 1 well there is another 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.569
 the king to raise firepower 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.310
 and now how many became up to approve 400 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.799
 but not so much let's see 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.579
 How will he go? Where is he? 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.459
 I threw up so much so right sight 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.070
 mouse button clamping 1 cable 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:43.530
 bowstring and well, so pretty far shoots 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.579
 there are arrows you can pick up like this where 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.010
 immediately and 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:51.870
 hotbed of victims we aim to catch not catch 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.230
 by the way they 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.440
 no matter how we are 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.810
 earth probably hi people 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.570
 weather 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.930
 flying arrow all through not in 1 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:16.600
 year 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:19.590
 only but the whole crowd if the mind 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.590
 it is clear kill immediately 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:32.670
 stuck together expected sticks this arrow 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.670
 can blow both mother and you 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.729
 ready 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:51.040
 how about these big guys 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.040
 Well, it will be a long time probably 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:04.280
 have such a bow absolutely silent 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.470
 here it is necessary here to adjust another 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.700
 distance and so understands all the same not 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:13.390
 can get there so can the angle x 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.390
 nailed 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:24.919
 at the target and where the arrows stick out 

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:24.919
 plus but the air and well, great 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:42.649
 arrows that stick out of the air on so 

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:45.569
 the arrows are gone yes you can take a 

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:48.589
 how do they look 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.589
 arrow like arrow 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.390
 there seems to be no more here 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.970
 I think this can be such a small 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.370
 reviewer 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.600
 let's say so the buns that you 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:12.120
 get after going through this 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:16.360
 strange and repeat addition 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:19.180
 get here a bow drawing on a bunch of arrows 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.970
 receipts and would like to note that 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.550
 principle you have skills like agility so 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.960
 in my opinion and strength seriously enough about 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:32.380
 swing because there 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:35.020
 utter confusion in the mess 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.390
 mess and with that I don't even know what 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.870
 doing this little video is not 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.730
 What happened to walk and bow 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.010
 join my little company 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.170
 Good luck everyone, thank you for 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.380
 view bye bye see you in new 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.380
 series
