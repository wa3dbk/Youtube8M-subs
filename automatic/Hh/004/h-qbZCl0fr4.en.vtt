00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.760
 great desire for all the guys I am 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.350
 black wolf and I'm here today on this 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.080
 channel to deepen with you one 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.240
 thematic a kind a style not for 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.710
 strength tied to the world of video games but 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.509
 which represented the main theme 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.390
 of a rockstar house game that everyone 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.950
 we know is she noir 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.800
 mind that I will not only talk about this 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.329
 title or better not exclusively and her 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.340
 noir represents the launch base for 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.380
 a theme that transcends this title and 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.850
 that touches many other games 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.460
 but of course this is the one 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.870
 which best expresses this genre 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.090
 purpose of all this and make it stand out 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.220
 those elements typical of a game with 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.810
 atmospheres or noir features that 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.430
 may be of interest to everyone 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.080
 those gamers who appreciate a lot 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:04.970
 the police theme set in the first ones 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:06.229
 from the 900 and where but in america it is obvious but 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.939
 what is noir 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.860
 if you are very knowledgeable on the subject e 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.659
 you are aware of all those factors that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.759
 characterize this genre I apologize in 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.470
 advance but myself until recently 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.200
 ago I was very fast about it 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.060
 the topic I'm dealing with the number 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.520
 then represents in the artistic sphere 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.650
 literary film and yes too 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.200
 videogame as I see it 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.210
 a variant of the detective genre it 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.920
 it is set between about 20 and 40 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.229
 even if it turns out we have them in decades 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.659
 subsequent and is invested in atmospheres 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.350
 gloomy sad with desaturated colors or in 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.030
 black and white 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.570
 the subjects are most often 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.640
 investigators or factual or situational 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.620
 cops and gangsters and directing more 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.659
 the whole generally revolves around a 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.900
 case to solve a robbery to send 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.900
 to sign 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.360
 perhaps it will seem strange but of titles 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.640
 There are some based on this genre 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.950
 multiple and these in my opinion 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.470
 recreate an atmosphere in a sense 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.920
 unique that leaves you something you remember 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.000
 thanks to the typical elements 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.950
 genuardi draw up a long list of 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.650
 games that treat this genre as i 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.069
 two mafia deja vu killer7 hotel dusk 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.050
 shadowrun or green fandango yes I said 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.760
 that in fandango under certain aspects that 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.819
 game embodies many typical elements of the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.840
 The theme of this video is what I most like 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.209
 like these games 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.130
 in addition to the gray and gloomy themes and the 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.810
 reduction of all problems to simple 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.970
 mysteries that can be solved 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.010
 through research and collection of 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.200
 mostly clues when we're from 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.090
 part of the good and I mean good yesterday 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.890
 those cops not corrupt by the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.140
 organized crime that there was in the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.530
 first half of the twentieth century a little like the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.880
 disorder that is put back in order 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.769
 otherwise, when we are 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.600
 to impersonate the malavitoso 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.730
 disorder is the main objective of the 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.130
 our movements but the latter comes 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.600
 researched with cunning ingenuity through 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.940
 a complicated ascent of the class 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.400
 criminal until you get to the role 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.620
 scope like the boss or better yet the 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.120
 godfather is here that the pursuits and the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.890
 shootings began on 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.340
 arms trafficking wars among the various 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.040
 families 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.600
 I've seen gangster squad and lately 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.130
 let's say that it was this film that I went to 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.410
 the input to resume these issues 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.519
 that had always fascinated me but 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.150
 which I had never decided to 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.610
 elaborate on 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.790
 maybe laziness or unwanted for me 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.410
 all this because of the 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.840
 end this video what transmits 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.730
 perhaps the ibl is so much better than gameplay 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.840
 i noir talking about chases 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.970
 shootings etc. 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.560
 honestly I don't know but I like it 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.450
 the idea of ​​recalling a genre and of 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.310
 exalt it hoping that someone might 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.890
 can take back old titles 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.510
 with these elements or why not look for them 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.920
 and play them just because this 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.370
 comments that he unleashed in him a 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.420
 interest in the genus noir gentlemen 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.680
 I thank you 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.180
 I thank the staff of magna for 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.370
 opportunity and availability 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.660
 dedicated his wolf number and of there 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.660
 I hear you soon
