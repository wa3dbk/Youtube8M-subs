 to push the shop counter 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.730
 There are still enough older titles 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.090
 which deserves a refresher more than 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.010
 had 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.199
 because the outdated technology many players 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.220
 it still holds him from one today 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.590
 chance to give 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.689
 we have a purely subjective list 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.710
 proposals for the publisher there 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.710

 high 90s rating a technical 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.769
 blatantly playful innovative and yet 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.809
 is an economic failure mdk 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.339
 one of the examples of that good 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.530
 game design is not necessarily too 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.239
 financial success leads unfortunately 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.579
 the player slips off his skin

 save from an alien invasion 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.040
 should be next to the crazy design and 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.060
 whimsical humor provided these days 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.910

 Hardly another game ends in years 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.759
 2 appeared in 2000 and offered 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.409
 also a lot of fun 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.569
 but also the turn of the millennium lies 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.840
 long back and the graphics in spite of all 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.610

 the 2000 published no one lives 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.270

 metacritic value of 91 which clarifies 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.630
 also how well it when critics like 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.580
 players worldwide 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.140
 all the more surprising that it 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.030
 is rarely mentioned 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.310
 when it comes to the spontaneous naming of

 colorful way the spirit of the 60s 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.569
 Unfortunately, this is also reflected 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.370
 great titles today despite the 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.280
 fun gameplay elements art 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.930
 Dusty time for a hd remake like this 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.880
 that even younger generation will experience

 best games for the nintendo 64 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.410
 The game quickly became critical

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.160
 This decision was the right one

 violence sexual issues swear words 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.150
 fecal humor and parodies of 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.549
 Hollywood movies showed clearly 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.690
 as a game for adults out though 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.829
 not only around it makes him

 swear words are exercised themselves 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.889
 Nintendo was a lot more relaxed with the original

 row is like for its flair 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.660
 still popular graphic contrast, is the 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.010
 No more about it in the course of 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.020
 time also some graphics mod 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.729
 but they did not bring out all of them 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.960
 the nextgen Augenschmaus one of them the 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.210
 close to f5 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.220

 andreas now soon a hd overhaul 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.919
 we ask the same of course 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.919
 also for vice city 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.389
 next to lara croft twisted especially 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.610
 many players at the end of the 90s 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.319
 years head in the action game break 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.330
 the red-winged heroes fought one 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:06.090
 medieval fantasy world against 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.379
 gloomy talks do not only lay the 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.449
 villages of the inhabitants in ruins 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:12.210

 soul with the dragon airlock the ford 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:27.300
 fighting on your side and even as 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:28.710
 Fire breather must be technical 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.490
 and playfully, dragon did not do anything 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.560
 really new 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.240
 There was a lot of humor sympathetic for that 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.330
 characters and above all an extreme 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.490
 dense atmosphere sometimes even came 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.949
 little openworld feeling on though that 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.710
 The game was completely linear at the time 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.330
 current today very old light engine 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.849
 However, the game pleasure ruined 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.379
 also hard-boiled retro friends too 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.419
 with less exquisite but still 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:54.539
 good follower dragon aviation gate 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.819
 from the year 2002 we plead for 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.529
 a new edition with aufgemotzter graphic 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:00.090
 so that they still play today 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:02.539
 be enchanted by rinn and eric 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.539
 can 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:20.020
 some diehard tim shepherd fan 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.310
 thinks with cycles the cult would have 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.469
 developer of games like day of the 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.629
 tentacle or grim fandango is not 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:27.729
 in financial but creative 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:30.009

 Skills you dive into the mix 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.259
 adventure and jump'n run literally in 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:37.389
 The brains are different 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.009
 characters from what I am also off 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:42.180
 completely different 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.180
 expressed levels 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.350
 can you explain bad you have to 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.870
 but have played in a timely manner 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:57.730
 optik records has a refresher more 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.730
 earned as most other games

 through the re-release 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.430
 georgi dot com she is back in the 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.040
 focus is probably the best 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.229
 space simulation of the 90s as 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.790
 trailer of the empire remained partly 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.080
 cheerful and other imperial ships 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.820
 row after row rebels from the 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.410

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.120
 certain special missions even in

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:27.550
 Would not that be so 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.810
 challenging and varied

 And that was already our list 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.830
 to play like a hd-remake more than
