00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Everything is fine Sorry that we knocked out yet 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.710
 one sword per thousand meteorites so 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.769
 called 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:17.809
 you cho ohrenel private poison hope 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.809
 they have not taken out the hour of my house 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.700
 in principle, we can now punish 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.860
 say specifically here this bitch we 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:32.500
 the first currency but this bitch we cook 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.820
 the second one is this task guy yes tell 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.510
 me about my great return 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.650
 so she went for her things yes yes yes 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 yes yes go to hell 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.059
 the problem is that they are admins and 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.800
 they can break whatever they want 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:51.340
 so therefore I don't know what they have 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.500
 they access or not I don't know why 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.500
 admin kills players 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:03.970
 and why does he break all my so here 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.170
 my left what are you doing and guys I 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.020
 understand why these 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.130
 govnari broke my house at all yes I think 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:17.890
 you too follow them like this command window want 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:21.490
 okay i think you noticed too 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.040
 as far as I am wildly tupanul they in general 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.110
 could easily break because damn i 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.060
 Expand did not I stupidly brought 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.640
 the chest turns out it's good I was lucky 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.220
 if to peck yl above or below, and then 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.900
 left without any things at all here 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.900
 of course today that's the honest glyph 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.520
 that is, I do not get out because 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.970
 gray is too tense too hard 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.440
 train resist because admin 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.360
 thousandths here just lose going on 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.130
 so I'm not doing anything without a cutout 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.860
 then the boring moments of course disappear 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.710
 But the samadhi action itself I leave 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.700
 This is understandable therefore we do xfan 10 about 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.030
 g10 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:05.350
 town and of course 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:08.350
 rg orders cupid 1 alkaline cupid one 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.160
 all left 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:17.080
 about what is necessary for my soul that's left 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.580
 just under the finish of the house of course with 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.220
 primates wildly stupid but you understand 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.780
 I was in a hurry , especially as I 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.610
 talked about the fact that I did not 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.430
 forget to turn because of this apparently i 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.170
 not a habit and I feel here 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.820
 generally know protected we would be ready 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.980
 run right there and show them bye 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.510

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.360

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.010

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.960
 call them assholes then run away in 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.470
 after entering the house and there is no private chat nina 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:52.650

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:57.480

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.230

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.640
 enough damn well run and sharply 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:58.840

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.550

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.940
 locked a piece of the house so do not need 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.500
