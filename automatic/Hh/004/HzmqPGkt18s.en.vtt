together like this over winter so they

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.190 
together like this over winter so they
get<00:02:01.680> used<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.369> each<00:02:02.549> other<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.079> know

sometimes<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:11.039> winter<00:02:11.310> period<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
sometimes so the winter period of the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.360 
sometimes so the winter period of the
three<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.420> them<00:02:12.480> together<00:02:12.720> like

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
three of them together like

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.619 
three of them together like
they<00:02:13.610> should<00:02:13.849> be<00:02:13.970> well<00:02:14.120> settled<00:02:14.390> down

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
they should be well settled down

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.180 
they should be well settled down
hopefully<00:02:14.959> we<00:02:15.260> can<00:02:15.440> get<00:02:15.590> some<00:02:15.800> nice<00:02:16.010> mules<00:02:18.190> and

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
hopefully we can get some nice mules and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.540 
hopefully we can get some nice mules and
then<00:02:19.640> we're<00:02:19.790> just<00:02:19.819> gonna<00:02:20.120> go<00:02:20.420> with<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:22.280> pair

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
then we're just gonna go with the pair

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.600 
then we're just gonna go with the pair
at<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.849> end<00:02:23.000> that's<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.629> bird

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
at the end that's the bird

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.210 
at the end that's the bird
hopefully<00:02:25.989> but<00:02:26.989> it<00:02:27.440> sounded<00:02:27.830> a<00:02:27.890> bit<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.069> a

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
hopefully but it sounded a bit like a

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.270 
hopefully but it sounded a bit like a
hint<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.670> me<00:02:28.819> but<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.060> bought<00:02:29.300> him<00:02:29.480> as<00:02:29.599> a<00:02:30.280> so

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
hint to me but I bought him as a so

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.410 
hint to me but I bought him as a so

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
we'll see

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.470 
we'll see

and the hen is sitting down down there I

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.570 
and the hen is sitting down down there I
mean<00:02:38.989> these<00:02:39.170> these<00:02:39.500> lizards<00:02:40.010> are<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.220> little

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580
