00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.060
 became a real focus of the 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:07.950
 criticism is about 'sonic boom' that 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.950
 title that is about to come 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.320
 and by the way also to nintendo 3ds in 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.180
 a different version a title in the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.460
 that the truth is that they changed us for 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.980
 complete the characters but eye 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.810
 because we are going to have more news about 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.670
 of this game the developers of 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.330
 sonic boom prepare announcements about the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.250
 game for this next e3 that event of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.520
 videogames to be held in the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.079
 angels that will take place from 10 to 12 of 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.519
 June that by the way here on the channel 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.379
 we are very aware because we are going to 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.699
 give all the dates of all the 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.800
 follow-ups of each of the 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.409
 conferences that are going to take place in that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.749
 next e3 it's a matter of weeks 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.670
 the title was presented 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.920
 april earlier this year 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.530
 but since then there has not been 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.269
 many news about this title 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.609
 stephen frost the producer of the game has 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.159
 explained that this is due to the campaign 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.589
 of communication designed for the game to 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.359
 that during this time the study has 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.850
 been completely focused on the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.619
 development process 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.869
 eye to the words that have left us 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.119
 they say there were several key reasons for 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.330
 announce sonic boom when we did it is 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.759
 what Mr. Frost explained as well 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.950
 that ojito because he also said in addition 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.440
 of that there are multiple partners involved 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.470
 in sonic boom so we have to be 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.570
 careful with their agents and requirements 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.270
 in each field is not just a matter of 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.979
 a title is a joint effort like that 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.200
 than any information announcement that 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.690
 is publicly shared should be 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.149
 planned and organized way 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.850
 very careful way the announcements about 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.670
 that nikun will occur around this 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.130
 next e3 a lot of attention because we 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.280
 they say that we will know more things in that 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.960
 moment in June but not all in addition the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.630
 presentation of new materials and 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.299
 information should be more frequent 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.520
 from e3 so we'll see more 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.960
 trailers more than much more 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.960
 about this sonic boom
