match<00:00:50.850> right<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.539> bots<00:00:51.840> these<00:00:52.260> aren't

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
match right here with bots these aren't

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.910 
match right here with bots these aren't
humans<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.039> do<00:00:53.329> they<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.390> offer<00:00:54.719> matches<00:00:55.710> with

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.049 
humans I do they do offer matches with
bots<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.579> i<00:00:56.850> believe<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.960> less<00:00:58.379> than

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
bots but i believe is this less than

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.779 
bots but i believe is this less than
four<00:01:00.059> or<00:01:00.480> eight<00:01:00.960> humans<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:02.250> they<00:01:02.520> don't

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
four or eight humans then they don't

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.570 
four or eight humans then they don't
count<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> stats<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.170> match<00:01:04.580> but

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
count the stats for that match but

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.030 
count the stats for that match but
that's<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> least<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.110> problems<00:01:07.409> with

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that's the least of the problems with

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.780 
that's the least of the problems with
this<00:01:08.189> game<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.970> game<00:01:09.229> takes<00:01:10.229> things<00:01:11.130> from
