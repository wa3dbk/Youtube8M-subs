00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
can and figure out ways to place these

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.710 
can and figure out ways to place these
tiles<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> most<00:01:51.299> advantage

tiles so that you get the most advantage

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.770 
tiles so that you get the most advantage
out<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.960> them<00:01:52.110> while<00:01:53.070> your<00:01:53.250> opponent's<00:01:53.780> get

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
out of them while your opponent's get

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.310 
out of them while your opponent's get
worse<00:01:54.990> tiles<00:01:55.320> um<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.630> there's<00:01:57.869> all<00:01:58.020> sorts<00:01:58.259> of

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.270 
one two or three so if you randomly get
rid<00:02:49.330> of<00:02:49.360> their<00:02:49.690> one<00:02:50.110> it's<00:02:50.620> not<00:02:50.800> as<00:02:50.950> big<00:02:51.100> of<00:02:51.160> a

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
rid of their one it's not as big of a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.620 
rid of their one it's not as big of a
deal<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.610> if<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.820> randomly<00:02:52.030> get<00:02:52.330> rid<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.480> their

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
deal is if you randomly get rid of their

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.240 
deal is if you randomly get rid of their
three<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.440> there's<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.650> little<00:02:53.770> bit<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:54.070> a

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
three so there's a little bit of a

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.580 
three so there's a little bit of a
chance<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:54.940> luck<00:02:55.090> there<00:02:55.330> in<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.600> there's

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
like you're replacing it for the first

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.930 
like you're replacing it for the first

time also any time you place a tile the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.780 
time also any time you place a tile the
only<00:03:31.239> rule<00:03:31.450> for<00:03:31.660> placing<00:03:32.019> them<00:03:32.170> is<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:33.640> make

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
only rule for placing them is to make

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.060 
only rule for placing them is to make
sure<00:03:34.030> that<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.330> arrows<00:03:34.660> don't<00:03:34.930> point<00:03:35.650> back<00:03:35.890> at

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
sure that the arrows don't point back at

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.740 
sure that the arrows don't point back at
each<00:03:36.130> other<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.000> can<00:03:37.120> place<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.300> tile<00:03:37.570> like

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
each other so you can place a tile like

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.420 
each other so you can place a tile like
this<00:03:37.959> you<00:03:38.530> just<00:03:38.560> not<00:03:38.830> allowed<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.070> place<00:03:39.250> any

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430

this you just not allowed to place any
like<00:03:39.640> that<00:03:39.850> so<00:03:40.620> just<00:03:41.620> make<00:03:41.800> sure<00:03:41.830> you're

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
like that so just make sure you're

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
a player to move on to this tile so you

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.090 
a player to move on to this tile so you
don't<00:03:55.900> necessarily<00:03:55.959> have<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.380> put<00:03:56.620> towels<00:03:56.830> for

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
don't necessarily have to put towels for

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.860 
don't necessarily have to put towels for
you<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.340> move<00:03:57.430> on<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:58.269> can<00:03:58.420> put<00:03:58.510> tiles<00:03:58.810> that

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
you to move on to you can put tiles that

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.120 
you to move on to you can put tiles that
are<00:03:58.959> forcing<00:03:59.410> your<00:03:59.500> opponent<00:03:59.890> to<00:03:59.980> go<00:04:00.100> a

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
are forcing your opponent to go a

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.220 
are forcing your opponent to go a
specific<00:04:00.580> direction<00:04:01.030> maybe<00:04:01.630> they<00:04:01.810> set<00:04:02.050> up<00:04:02.140> a

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
specific direction maybe they set up a

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.990 
specific direction maybe they set up a
good<00:04:02.380> engine<00:04:02.860> to<00:04:03.310> get<00:04:03.459> gold<00:04:03.640> for<00:04:03.850> themselves

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
good engine to get gold for themselves

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.030 
good engine to get gold for themselves
and<00:04:04.420> now<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:04.930> just<00:04:05.140> screwed<00:04:05.380> up<00:04:05.530> by<00:04:05.680> forcing

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
and now you just screwed up by forcing

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.740 
and now you just screwed up by forcing
them<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.190> go<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.370> different<00:04:06.550> direction<00:04:06.750> the

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
them to go a different direction the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.280 
them to go a different direction the
game<00:04:07.959> comes<00:04:08.260> with<00:04:08.500> player<00:04:09.630> cheats<00:04:10.630> that<00:04:11.019> show
