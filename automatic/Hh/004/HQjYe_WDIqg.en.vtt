00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Patch 2.1.0 Changes 

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.698
 Hello, welcome to Nepal Lem 2.1.0 patch 

00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:25.794
 I'm brandy camel. I call it balis. 

00:00:25.794 --> 00:00:29.336
 Diablo 3's community manager will guide you today 

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:32.792
 In this video, we will discuss the first large-scale content patch 

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:35.828
 I'll try to find out. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 season 

00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:43.060
 The biggest feature is the competitive system of the season 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.672
 The season is similar to Diablo II's ladder 

00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:50.193
 Give heroes a chance to grow new characters from level 1 

00:00:50.193 --> 00:00:53.549
 The season is a separate game mode 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.489
 Thus, the season characters will have separate lockers, 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.765
 Use artisan level, gold coin, conquistador level 

00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:03.822
 You can create season characters in normal and hardcore mode 

00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:06.294
 Let's find out about season rewards. 

00:01:06.294 --> 00:01:10.712
 Several new legendary items will be added each season 

00:01:10.712 --> 00:01:13.873
 Season characters can get this item for the first time 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.766
 Do not worry if your season does not fit. 

00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:19.548
 After the season ends, even in non-season games 

00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:21.497
 I can get those items. 

00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:25.243
 Each season, participants will have a new set of season- 

00:01:25.243 --> 00:01:27.821
 Receive one 

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:31.119
 You can get one for each season. 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.956
 Come join us and show off your style! 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.865
 It is a season-only achievement that presents many challenges. 

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:41.976
 Eliminating Maltese in Step 6, 

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:45.189
 To complete the entire campaign in an hour. 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.784
 Both normal and hardcore characters can challenge conquest. 

00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:52.087
 Enjoy in your favorite game mode 

00:01:52.087 --> 00:01:55.836
 When you complete the conquest, you will be awarded an achievement score, which will be reflected in the season total 

00:01:55.836 --> 00:02:00.135
 In addition, they are registered in first place on the leader board 

00:02:00.135 --> 00:02:03.379
 The name of the first player to complete the conquest is 

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:05.118
 It remains forever in that season's leaderboard 

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:09.201
 At the end of the season, the season character 

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:12.508
 Switch to non-season hardcore mode or normal mode hero 

00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:18.114
 Items, gold coins, artisan recipe, conqueror experience, achievements, etc. 

00:02:18.114 --> 00:02:22.010
 All rewards earned during the season are transferred. 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.492
 Items in season-specific lockers will be mailed 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.000
 Big crack 

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:32.948
 Great cracks are added with the season 

00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:37.304
 There's a time limit to adding a competitive element to a dimensional crack. 

00:02:37.304 --> 00:02:40.628
 Within fifteen minutes, the defender must be summoned and killed. 

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:43.168
 The sooner you finish, the bigger the compensation. 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.520
 To get into the big crack first 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.222
 After obtaining the greatest crack of the test from the general crack guard 

00:02:48.222 --> 00:02:51.889
 You have to go to the village of Nepal Lem Steep and enter the area of ​​test 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.736
 The area of ​​the test is the 

00:02:55.736 --> 00:02:57.447
 It's a place to evaluate your skills. 

00:02:57.447 --> 00:02:59.610
 When you complete this test 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.874
 You will be given a large crack of moderate difficulty 

00:03:01.874 --> 00:03:03.720
 To open the original cracked car text 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.161
 Take the Great Fissure Stone and go to the Nepalem spire of the village 

00:03:10.187 --> 00:03:12.085
 There is a progress bar in the big crack 

00:03:12.085 --> 00:03:15.333
 Shows the number of monsters treated for the time remaining 

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:19.115
 The extent to which the bar is filled depends on the vitality and difficulty of the monster. 

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.261
 Attacking elite and warriors 

00:03:21.261 --> 00:03:23.384
 Crack faster than normal monsters. 

00:03:23.384 --> 00:03:26.112
 The monsters of the crack do not drop the booty 

00:03:26.112 --> 00:03:28.891
 The last crack protector 

00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:31.056
 Reduce rewards at once 

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:36.090
 Large cracks are much trickier and need to be strategically addressed 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.422
 What you should keep in mind when trying to crack 

00:03:39.422 --> 00:03:42.495
 Resurrection and transit are restricted. 

00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:45.959
 It is not possible to change equipment or technology within a major crack 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.823
 So plan carefully when you enter the big crack 

00:03:48.823 --> 00:03:54.453
 If you defeat the Great Defender, you will encounter a new NPC named Urushi 

00:03:54.453 --> 00:03:57.522
 Once the big crack is completed within the time limit 

00:03:57.522 --> 00:03:59.652
 You can choose between two rewards 

00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:02.812
 Opportunity to increase the rank of the legendary jewelry 

00:04:02.812 --> 00:04:06.237
 One of the higher levels of crack seats. 

00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:08.995
 When the critical crack timeout is reached 

00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:11.401
 Crack protector appears 

00:04:13.814 --> 00:04:16.090
 After killing the defender 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.287
 I can not continue crack exploration 

00:04:18.287 --> 00:04:21.419
 Legendary jewelry upgrade opportunities are given 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.650
 If the level of cracking is high, multiple grades may be climbed at a time 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.795
 Set goals high and reward yourself 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 standing 

00:04:32.575 --> 00:04:37.118
 We've added a leaderboard for each system to support the season and the big break 

00:04:37.118 --> 00:04:39.864
 In the leaderboard, 

00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:44.514
 You can see the progress of the crack, the score of the season achievement, and the progress of the season 

00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:47.158
 Through a leaderboard that provides detailed information 

00:04:47.158 --> 00:04:51.038
 Local players, friends, clan members 

00:04:51.038 --> 00:04:52.986
 You can compare the progress. 

00:04:52.986 --> 00:04:56.128
 Each leaderboard displays information in a slightly different way 

00:04:56.128 --> 00:05:01.367
 The leaderboards are not only hardcore and general heroes, 

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:04.319
 Show season and non-season hero rankings 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.554
 For each occupation, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. 

00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:14.160
 You can also sort the information according to your party configuration 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.509
 The total number of squads and season achievements is season-specific content. 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.356
 This leaderboard only tracks the season character's information 

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:25.142
 Scatter and achievement scores are common to your account. 

00:05:25.142 --> 00:05:28.556
 Although some achievements can only be achieved in certain modes 

00:05:28.556 --> 00:05:31.863
 No need to sort the general and hardcore information separately 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.000
 Item-related changes 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.210
 In 2.1.0 there were changes to several items 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.666
 I want to take a look at a few things. 

00:05:41.666 --> 00:05:46.622
 First of all, the base damage of both hands increased overall 

00:05:46.622 --> 00:05:50.792
 This content is retrospective, so you already have both hands 

00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:52.884
 It will update automatically 

00:05:52.884 --> 00:05:56.654
 Also added some special powers to some legacy items 

00:05:56.654 --> 00:06:00.925
 This is not retroactive to existing items. 

00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:03.344
 You do not need to keep any items you've acquired before 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 New environment 

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:11.887
 Treasure Goblin Do you wonder what is on the other side of the door? 

00:06:11.887 --> 00:06:13.422
 Now you do not have to! 

00:06:13.422 --> 00:06:16.412
 In the 2.1.0 patch, every time you drop a Treasure Goblin 

00:06:16.412 --> 00:06:19.296
 There is a low probability of the original car going to the 'treasure house'. 

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:23.079
 In this mysterious space, new and dangerous enemies and imaginative gold are full of treasures 

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:26.172
 Never miss a goblin next time! 

00:06:26.172 --> 00:06:29.876
 We also added a new environment to the dimensional cracks in Nepal Lem 

00:06:29.876 --> 00:06:31.012
 It's a gutter. 

00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:34.651
 The gutter was originally planned as a wastewater from West Wenjing 

00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:38.088
 It failed to put it into Act 5 as soon as the soul reaper was released 

00:06:38.088 --> 00:06:41.564
 Now, this rotting wet environment 

00:06:41.564 --> 00:06:44.189
 Can be explored in large cracks or general dimensional cracks 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.674
 This is a quick look at the 2.1.0 patch 

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:51.104
 I've told you a couple of big details. 

00:06:51.104 --> 00:06:54.607
 See the patch notes for details! 

00:06:54.607 --> 00:06:57.490
 Also, please post your comments on this patch to the Diablo III forums. 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.590
 I look forward to being ready for the first season with you. 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.546
 Thank you for watching. See you at the castle.
