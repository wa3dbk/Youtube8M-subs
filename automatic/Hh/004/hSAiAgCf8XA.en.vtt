get<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:42.689> at<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.869> hardware<00:01:43.110> store<00:01:43.579> maybe<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
get one at a hardware store maybe you

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.340 
get one at a hardware store maybe you
have<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:44.970> laying<00:01:45.119> around<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> house<00:01:45.659> but

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
have one laying around the house but

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.960 
have one laying around the house but
make<00:01:46.530> sure<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> right<00:01:47.189> size<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.880> I'll

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
make sure it's the right size and I'll

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.830 
make sure it's the right size and I'll
show<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.180> how<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.329> do<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.600> little<00:01:48.750> bit

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
show you how to do that a little bit

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.030 
show you how to do that a little bit
later<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:51.110> last<00:01:52.110> little<00:01:52.350> requisite<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.009> a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
later and the last little requisite is a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.789 
later and the last little requisite is a
tweezers<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.820> set<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.270> tweezers<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.930> mean<00:01:55.710> this

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
tweezers a set of tweezers I mean this

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.740 
tweezers a set of tweezers I mean this
is<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.009> necessarily<00:01:56.579> required<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.540> I'm

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
is not necessarily required but I'm

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.179 
is not necessarily required but I'm
going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.899> use<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.200> anyway<00:01:58.290> make<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> thing<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
going to use it anyway make the thing a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.179 
going to use it anyway make the thing a
little<00:01:59.280> bit<00:01:59.490> easier<00:02:00.649> so<00:02:01.649> first<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:02.009> we're

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
little bit easier so first up we're

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.380 
little bit easier so first up we're
going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> lay<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.610> thing<00:02:02.670> face<00:02:03.000> down<00:02:03.210> we're

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
going to lay this thing face down we're

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.539 
going to lay this thing face down we're
going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.540> bring<00:02:03.780> over<00:02:03.930> our<00:02:04.259> nice<00:02:05.009> soft<00:02:05.310> cloth

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
going to bring over our nice soft cloth

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.010 
going to bring over our nice soft cloth
so<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.030> lay<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.270> face<00:02:06.390> down<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:06.960> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
so we can lay it face down and I have to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.990 
so we can lay it face down and I have to
worry<00:02:07.200> about<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.500> screen<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.910> then<00:02:08.910> we're

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
worry about the screen and then we're

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.750 
worry about the screen and then we're
going<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.149> yank<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.780> back<00:02:10.020> cover<00:02:10.289> off

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.910 

and<00:02:13.150> when<00:02:13.510> we<00:02:13.599> do<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.930> you'll<00:02:14.620> notice<00:02:14.860> right

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
and when we do that you'll notice right

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.030 
and when we do that you'll notice right
here<00:02:15.659> right<00:02:16.659> where<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.989> charging<00:02:17.830> door

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
here right where the charging door

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.520 
here right where the charging door
connects<00:02:18.549> there's<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.420> little<00:02:20.110> Phillips<00:02:20.379> head

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
connects there's a little Phillips head

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.890 
connects there's a little Phillips head
screw<00:02:20.860> let's<00:02:21.700> see<00:02:21.849> if<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.030> can<00:02:22.209> zoom<00:02:22.239> in<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.599> that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
screw let's see if I can zoom in on that

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.190 
screw let's see if I can zoom in on that
for<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.349> so<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.040> can<00:02:24.099> get<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.280> better<00:02:24.400> picture

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
for you so you can get a better picture

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.070 
for you so you can get a better picture
this<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.590> guy<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:26.980> question<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:28.080> he's

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
this is the guy in question and he's

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.170 
this is the guy in question and he's
right<00:02:29.349> underneath<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:30.370> little<00:02:30.640> flat<00:02:30.849> where

these this charging port cover connects

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.430 
these this charging port cover connects
you'll<00:02:34.120> notice<00:02:34.330> around<00:02:34.420> him<00:02:34.870> there's<00:02:35.349> a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
you'll notice around him there's a

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.490 
you'll notice around him there's a
little<00:02:35.739> plastic<00:02:36.370> square<00:02:37.140> just<00:02:38.140> holding<00:02:38.470> that

little plastic square just holding that

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.800 
little plastic square just holding that
down<00:02:38.980> we're<00:02:39.819> going<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.000> take<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.360> off

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
down we're going to take this off

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.839 
down we're going to take this off
lift<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:41.170> plastic<00:02:41.650> square<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.190> then

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
your Phillips head screwdriver you want

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.449 
your Phillips head screwdriver you want
to<00:02:49.870> make<00:02:50.290> sure<00:02:50.319> you<00:02:50.709> got<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.250> slot

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
to make sure you got it in the slot

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.339 
to make sure you got it in the slot
properly<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.299> then<00:02:52.750> when<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:52.930> do<00:02:53.049> have<00:02:53.079> it<00:02:53.260> in

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
the slot kind of give it a tiny little

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.390 
the slot kind of give it a tiny little
finger<00:02:55.660> twist<00:02:55.930> not<00:02:56.590> much<00:02:56.829> pressure<00:02:57.069> at<00:02:57.310> all

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
finger twist not much pressure at all

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.339 
finger twist not much pressure at all
you<00:02:57.670> just<00:02:57.819> want<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.030> feel<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.750> make<00:02:58.930> sure<00:02:59.079> it's

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
you just want to feel to make sure it's

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.220 
you just want to feel to make sure it's
locking<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.849> plus<00:03:01.120> symbol<00:03:01.569> on<00:03:01.690> top<00:03:01.930> of

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
locking in to that plus symbol on top of

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.740 
locking in to that plus symbol on top of
that<00:03:02.290> Phillips<00:03:02.590> head<00:03:02.769> screw<00:03:03.549> if<00:03:03.940> it's<00:03:04.629> not

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
that Phillips head screw if it's not

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.240 
that Phillips head screw if it's not
doing<00:03:05.019> that<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.410> probably<00:03:05.890> need<00:03:06.069> a<00:03:06.099> different

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
doing that you probably need a different

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.449 
doing that you probably need a different
size<00:03:06.549> Phillips<00:03:07.480> head<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:09.280> probably

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
size Phillips head and you probably

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.410 
size Phillips head and you probably
shouldn't<00:03:09.760> proceed<00:03:10.090> because<00:03:10.209> you'll

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
shouldn't proceed because you'll

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.089 
shouldn't proceed because you'll
probably<00:03:10.599> strip<00:03:10.959> out<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.349> head<00:03:11.620> right<00:03:11.859> there

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
probably strip out that head right there

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.080 
probably strip out that head right there
and<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.280> don't<00:03:12.370> want<00:03:12.579> to<00:03:12.640> do<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:12.819> because

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
and you don't want to do that because

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.910 
and you don't want to do that because
again<00:03:13.209> when<00:03:14.019> you<00:03:14.109> turn<00:03:14.319> your<00:03:14.440> back<00:03:14.500> into<00:03:14.829> the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
again when you turn your back into the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.770 
again when you turn your back into the
factory<00:03:15.370> they're<00:03:15.970> going<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.180> say<00:03:16.329> well<00:03:16.569> why'd

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
factory they're going to say well why'd

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.920 
factory they're going to say well why'd
you<00:03:16.810> screw<00:03:17.260> up<00:03:17.349> that<00:03:17.380> screw<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.880> make<00:03:19.660> sure<00:03:19.810> you

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
you screw up that screw so make sure you
