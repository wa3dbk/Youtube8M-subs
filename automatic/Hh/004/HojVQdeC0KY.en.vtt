00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
great because i think the Usos are the

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.339 
great because i think the Usos are the
strongest<00:04:11.069> tag-team<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.639> w<00:04:12.030> right<00:04:12.180> now<00:04:12.359> we

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
strongest tag-team and w right now we

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.839
