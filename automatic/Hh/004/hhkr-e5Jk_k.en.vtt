00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
now me hopefully a little oven

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.580 
now me hopefully a little oven
underneath<00:02:00.570> when<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> money<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> buy

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.859 
underneath when we get the money to buy
that<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.520> it'll<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> cooktop<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.600> an<00:02:03.719> oven

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
that so it'll be a cooktop with an oven

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.150 
that so it'll be a cooktop with an oven
underneath<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:05.009> then<00:02:05.159> behind<00:02:05.340> will<00:02:06.240> be

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
underneath and then behind will be

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.249 
underneath and then behind will be
another<00:02:08.160> island<00:02:08.819> which<00:02:09.660> would<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:10.080> more

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
another island which would be for more

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.790 
another island which would be for more
food<00:02:10.560> preparation

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
food preparation

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.590 
food preparation
because<00:02:12.610> we<00:02:12.760> need<00:02:12.910> lots<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.210> cupboard<00:02:13.570> space

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
because we need lots of cupboard space

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.940

that's where all the pipes will go to

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.510 
that's where all the pipes will go to

connect to the solar water heating when
we<00:03:18.640> have<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.030> time<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.450> manage<00:03:19.720> put<00:03:19.930> that

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
we have the time and the manage put that

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.040 
we have the time and the manage put that
in<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.730> then<00:03:21.730> over<00:03:22.150> here<00:03:24.239> now<00:03:25.239> instead<00:03:25.750> of

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
in and then over here now instead of

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.210 
in and then over here now instead of
having<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.620> refrigerator<00:03:28.650> no<00:03:29.650> refrigerator

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
having a refrigerator no refrigerator

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.660 
having a refrigerator no refrigerator
cost<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.550> lot<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.760> money<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.590> think<00:03:32.950> that<00:03:33.640> I

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
cost a lot of money so I think that I

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.510 
cost a lot of money so I think that I
can<00:03:34.000> build<00:03:34.180> Lorraine<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.959> six<00:03:35.290> by<00:03:35.470> six<00:03:35.830> walk<00:03:36.280> in

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
can build Lorraine a six by six walk in

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.729 
can build Lorraine a six by six walk in
for<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.480> same<00:03:37.690> price<00:03:37.959> as<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.230> fancy

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
for the same price as a fancy

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.920 
for the same price as a fancy
refrigerator<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:40.360> that's<00:03:40.570> what<00:03:40.750> she's

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
refrigerator so that's what she's

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.020 
refrigerator so that's what she's
getting<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:42.070> it'll<00:03:42.250> be<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.370> walk-in<00:03:42.670> with<00:03:42.970> a

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
getting so it'll be a walk-in with a

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.960 
getting so it'll be a walk-in with a
refrigerator<00:03:43.330> door<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.520> then<00:03:45.520> in<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.760> back

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
refrigerator door and then in the back

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.600 
refrigerator door and then in the back

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
here on the outside wall we'll put the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.990 
here on the outside wall we'll put the
refrigerator<00:03:49.380> refrigeration<00:03:50.380> unit<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:51.640> cool

because we can we will hopefully be

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.460 
because we can we will hopefully be
generating<00:04:29.300> electricity<00:04:29.630> one<00:04:30.020> day<00:04:30.260> with

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.740 
generating electricity one day with
solar<00:04:30.740> power<00:04:31.010> so<00:04:31.970> rather<00:04:32.180> than<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.449> put<00:04:32.600> in

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
solar power so rather than you put in

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.210 
solar power so rather than you put in
gas<00:04:33.520> we'll<00:04:34.520> put<00:04:35.000> in<00:04:35.120> electric<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.800> that<00:04:36.979> we<00:04:37.070> can

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
gas we'll put in electric so that we can

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.689 
gas we'll put in electric so that we can
actually<00:04:37.690> provide<00:04:38.690> our<00:04:38.870> own<00:04:38.900> power<00:04:39.229> one<00:04:39.470> day

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
actually provide our own power one day

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.980 
actually provide our own power one day
then<00:04:40.699> there'll<00:04:40.850> be<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:40.970> wall<00:04:41.240> here<00:04:41.270> if<00:04:41.600> I<00:04:41.720> jump

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
then there'll be a wall here if I jump

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.300 
then there'll be a wall here if I jump
through<00:04:42.229> the<00:04:42.380> wall<00:04:42.729> this<00:04:43.729> is<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.000> study<00:04:45.310> so

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
through the wall this is the study so

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.370 
through the wall this is the study so
here<00:04:47.090> we<00:04:47.270> have<00:04:47.479> we'll<00:04:47.900> have<00:04:47.930> internet

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
here we have we'll have internet

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.550 
here we have we'll have internet
connections<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:49.190> office<00:04:49.699> a<00:04:50.000> spare<00:04:50.780> bed<00:04:51.290> or

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
connections and office a spare bed or

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.290 
connections and office a spare bed or
sofa<00:04:51.740> bed<00:04:52.100> something<00:04:52.729> like<00:04:52.850> that

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
sofa bed something like that

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.200 
sofa bed something like that
for<00:04:53.510> guests<00:04:54.110> if<00:04:54.320> they<00:04:54.470> come<00:04:54.880> which<00:04:55.880> I<00:04:56.000> think

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
for guests if they come which I think

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.689 
for guests if they come which I think
there'll<00:04:56.360> be<00:04:56.389> a<00:04:56.479> few<00:04:57.010> and<00:04:58.010> well<00:04:58.190> buff<00:04:58.400> here

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
there'll be a few and well buff here

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.879 
there'll be a few and well buff here
will<00:04:58.910> be<00:04:59.060> a<00:04:59.270> loft<00:04:59.690> which<00:05:00.440> would<00:05:00.590> be<00:05:00.710> for

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
will be a loft which would be for

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.650 
will be a loft which would be for
storage<00:05:01.280> I<00:05:01.430> think<00:05:01.639> we've<00:05:01.760> got<00:05:01.880> no<00:05:02.030> roof<00:05:02.330> space

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
storage I think we've got no roof space

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.110 
storage I think we've got no roof space
so<00:05:03.020> we<00:05:03.710> actually<00:05:03.860> need<00:05:04.100> storage<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:04.850> so

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
so we actually need storage and so

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.510 
so we actually need storage and so
there's<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.840> huge<00:05:06.050> loft<00:05:06.410> space<00:05:06.710> above<00:05:07.280> here

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
there's a huge loft space above here

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.060 
there's a huge loft space above here
this<00:05:07.729> will<00:05:07.850> have<00:05:08.000> eight<00:05:08.150> foot<00:05:08.389> ceilings<00:05:09.070> to

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
this will have eight foot ceilings to

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.980 
this will have eight foot ceilings to
store<00:05:10.340> stuff<00:05:10.550> up<00:05:10.729> the<00:05:10.850> top<00:05:11.060> and<00:05:11.270> even<00:05:11.690> throw<00:05:11.900> a

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
store stuff up the top and even throw a

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.300 
store stuff up the top and even throw a
few<00:05:12.199> visitors<00:05:12.590> up<00:05:13.090> if<00:05:14.090> we<00:05:14.300> need<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:15.039> and<00:05:16.039> then

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
few visitors up if we need to and then

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:24.850

own bedroom as you can see there's lots

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.879 
own bedroom as you can see there's lots
of<00:05:48.380> opportunity<00:05:49.220> for<00:05:49.250> a<00:05:49.520> glass<00:05:50.650> these<00:05:51.650> will

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
of opportunity for a glass these will

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.800 
of opportunity for a glass these will
have<00:05:52.070> large<00:05:52.729> 8x8<00:05:53.660> sliding<00:05:54.169> doors<00:05:54.410> and<00:05:55.810> even

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
have large 8x8 sliding doors and even

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.960 
have large 8x8 sliding doors and even
windows<00:05:57.620> above<00:05:57.979> so<00:05:58.310> there'd<00:05:58.580> be<00:05:58.610> a<00:05:58.669> lot<00:05:58.910> of

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
windows above so there'd be a lot of

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.750 
windows above so there'd be a lot of
light<00:05:59.300> coming<00:05:59.330> in<00:05:59.840> here<00:06:00.169> and<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:01.370> cupola

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
light coming in here and the cupola

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.740 
light coming in here and the cupola
right<00:06:01.970> above<00:06:02.830> the<00:06:03.830> rain<00:06:03.979> stove<00:06:04.400> was<00:06:05.240> it's<00:06:05.510> four

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
right above the rain stove was it's four

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.450 
right above the rain stove was it's four
foot<00:06:05.990> diameter<00:06:06.139> and<00:06:06.710> that<00:06:06.860> would<00:06:07.039> be<00:06:07.160> one<00:06:07.430> big

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
foot diameter and that would be one big

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.659 
foot diameter and that would be one big
skylight<00:06:08.410> so<00:06:09.410> that's<00:06:09.560> pretty<00:06:09.740> much<00:06:09.830> it<00:06:09.979> it's<00:06:10.520> a

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
skylight so that's pretty much it it's a

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.300 
skylight so that's pretty much it it's a
big<00:06:10.849> kitchen<00:06:11.030> and<00:06:11.900> some<00:06:12.410> relatively<00:06:13.070> small

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
big kitchen and some relatively small

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.150 
big kitchen and some relatively small
bed<00:06:13.610> bedrooms
