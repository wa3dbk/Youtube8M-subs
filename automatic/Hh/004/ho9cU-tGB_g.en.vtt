 dynamic phase 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.550
 as a special form of core positions 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.820

 This video can be divided conditionally on 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.820
 two groups to the first group include 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.720
 sick which primary 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.210
 internal programs are considered to be 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.720
 for the rehabilitation of these patients 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.790
 harder and harder is the recovery process

 grammatical sulfonation 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:08.300
 in this case, the rehabilitation process 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.560
 pass much easier as it is 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.330

 sayings are also noted in 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.260
 complexity to solving logical problems and 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.470
 on it we 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.230
 figuratively, well, that is 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.239
 the deeper meaning of the word suffers when

 function to restore richie thinking 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.549
 sick dynamic water and determined 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.530
 a range of tasks so with a loud degree 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.750
 gravity is recommended to overcome

 self storytelling understand 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.609
 prevent the difficulty of understanding bows 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.909
 both romantic on turns and the decision 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.790
 logic tasks with a mild degree 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.400
 gravity you need to activate the span 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.349
 this phrase yuri form overcome

 we invert in the design will touch and 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.720
 solving complex logical problems 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.460
 way we looked at the syndrome 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.760
 dynamic aphasia identified 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.180
