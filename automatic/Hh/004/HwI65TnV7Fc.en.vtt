00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.250
 hi girls so to go with 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.970
 my braid hooks indeed I 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.500
 decided to wear colored eyebrows 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.570
 so I did not find a pencil to 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.369
 eyebrows or red color so 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.919
 I use a lip pencil this is 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.559
 here of the clan of chanac with which I 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:36.180
 come define the form of the same source he 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:40.210
 so starting from the bottom 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.789
 and then by tracing two-thirds or duet 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.399
 to avoid having too hard a side 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.100
 to draw too much I leave the inner edge 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.809
 ibrox then with small 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.600
 movements and the same pencil I come 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.739
 fill in the holes and then color everything 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.739
 my eyebrows simply 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:07.060
 after that with an anti concealer concealer 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:09.220
 so of color between 45 mixed with 46 42 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.509
 to have a slightly lighter color 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.180
 that my skin tone 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.939
 I 'm coming to clean the edge of my 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.250
 eyebrows I just define this with a 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.530
 lighter color to have a 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.600
 opening at the level of the gaze to have 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:29.290
 a dimension well faded anyway 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.369
 to avoid having a side not here you go 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.079
 here we fade correctly I 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.420
 found that the color is a little hard 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.119
 so that I decided to use a brown 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.090
 red on top with a flat brush 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.140
 beveled just to balance the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.100
 color so that they are more 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.960
 close to the color of my locks that 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 also allows us to fade the 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.799
 pencil at the same time then I resume 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.140
 my dark circles this time just in 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.570
 below 45 match my skin tone 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.360
 and to avoid the demarcations of 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.000
 color we do not put dark circles anymore 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.030
 clear under the seal of the eyebrow well 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.170
 dimmed it's super important 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.200
 again to avoid 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.060
 demarcations and finally you have your 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.780
 colorful eyebrows and you're ready to 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.090
 strutting 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.920
 we'll meet again very soon for 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.569
 new videos meanwhile remember 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.569
 not to be beautiful and chatty girls
