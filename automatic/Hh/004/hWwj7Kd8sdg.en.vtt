we've<00:02:25.370> ever<00:02:25.550> had<00:02:25.760> good<00:02:26.030> strikers<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:26.840> Ireland

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
we've ever had good strikers in Ireland

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.059 
we've ever had good strikers in Ireland
never<00:02:27.530> really<00:02:27.980> had<00:02:29.110> people<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.650> caliber

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
never really had people of the caliber

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.240 
never really had people of the caliber
of<00:02:31.100> Giles<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.640> kina<00:02:31.880> Brady<00:02:32.239> playing<00:02:33.250> strikers

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
of Giles and kina Brady playing strikers

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.850 
of Giles and kina Brady playing strikers
but<00:02:34.520> I<00:02:34.730> think<00:02:35.330> five<00:02:35.480> table<00:02:35.900> was<00:02:36.080> best<00:02:36.350> striker

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
but I think five table was best striker

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.540 
but I think five table was best striker
we've<00:02:37.130> ever<00:02:37.310> had<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.290> Kevin<00:02:39.290> Doyle<00:02:39.500> now<00:02:40.190> that

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
we've ever had and Kevin Doyle now that

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.520 
we've ever had and Kevin Doyle now that
might<00:02:40.760> surprise<00:02:40.910> surprise<00:02:41.750> some<00:02:42.050> people<00:02:42.080> but

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
might surprise surprise some people but

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.680 
might surprise surprise some people but
I<00:02:42.739> think<00:02:43.670> Kevin<00:02:43.880> Doyle<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.360> going<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.600> be<00:02:44.660> a

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690

I think Kevin Doyle is going to be a
great<00:02:44.810> player<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.320> think<00:02:45.530> he<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:45.709> now<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.660> on

the robbie keane didn't go well I me

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.090 
the robbie keane didn't go well I me
like<00:03:26.540> he<00:03:26.660> isn't<00:03:26.930> he's<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.140> record<00:03:27.530> goals<00:03:27.769> queen

like he isn't he's a record goals queen
yeah<00:03:28.430> like<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:28.850> think<00:03:29.150> is<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.390> entirely<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.350> but

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
yeah like I think is it entirely and but

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.600 
yeah like I think is it entirely and but
I<00:03:31.220> just<00:03:31.549> felt<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.709> Doyle<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:34.900> have<00:03:35.900> just<00:03:36.290> a

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
I just felt that Doyle and have just a

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.400 
I just felt that Doyle and have just a
heads<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:38.239> well<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.660> edge<00:03:38.780> in<00:03:39.019> terms<00:03:39.049> of

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
heads and well the edge in terms of

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.960 
heads and well the edge in terms of
potential<00:03:39.769> I<00:03:40.010> think<00:03:40.250> he's<00:03:40.400> an<00:03:40.549> on<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.820> right

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
potential I think he's an on the right

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.039 
potential I think he's an on the right

out<00:05:06.660> of<00:05:06.690> football<00:05:06.900> Shay<00:05:07.710> Given<00:05:07.919> obviously<00:05:08.520> and

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
out of football Shay Given obviously and

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.180 
out of football Shay Given obviously and
we<00:05:09.690> can<00:05:09.900> we<00:05:10.080> have<00:05:10.259> my<00:05:10.410> best<00:05:10.710> with<00:05:10.919> great
