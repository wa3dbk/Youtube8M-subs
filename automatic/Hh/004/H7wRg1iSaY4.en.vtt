mess and liposuction where this drug can
also<00:00:56.850> aid<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.360> making<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> fat<00:00:58.620> more<00:00:59.010> firm<00:00:59.370> it

also aid in making the fat more firm it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.569 
also aid in making the fat more firm it
causes<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.750> extend<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.100> therefore

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
causes it to extend and then therefore
