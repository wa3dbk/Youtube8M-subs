00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.520 

giving<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.530> little<00:01:12.740> bit<00:01:13.420> deeper<00:01:14.420> which<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.350> lot

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
giving a little bit deeper which a lot

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.820 
giving a little bit deeper which a lot
of<00:01:15.620> people<00:01:15.860> don't<00:01:15.950> do<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:18.320> canine<00:01:18.770> ear<00:01:19.100> canal

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
of people don't do the canine ear canal

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.080 
of people don't do the canine ear canal
goes<00:01:22.480> down<00:01:23.480> like<00:01:23.720> this<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.610> then<00:01:25.610> in<00:01:25.850> like

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
goes down like this and then in like

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.500 
goes down like this and then in like
that<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:27.020> there's<00:01:27.200> an<00:01:27.350> L<00:01:27.940> which<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.180> only<00:01:29.330> way

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
that so there's an L which the only way

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.060 
that so there's an L which the only way
to<00:01:29.570> really<00:01:29.810> straighten<00:01:30.260> it<00:01:30.350> out<00:01:30.440> is<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:30.920> do

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
to really straighten it out is to do

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.310 
to really straighten it out is to do
that<00:01:31.450> will<00:01:32.450> really<00:01:32.750> really<00:01:32.870> talk

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
that will really really talk

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.810 
that will really really talk
well<00:01:33.440> don't<00:01:33.650> pull<00:01:33.920> really<00:01:34.070> really<00:01:34.400> taut<00:01:34.580> when

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
you're doing this so basically just flip

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.700

you're done bathing them run a quat
cotton<00:03:21.870> swab<00:03:22.549> once<00:03:23.549> like<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:24.239> hopefully

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
cotton swab once like that and hopefully

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.390 
cotton swab once like that and hopefully
they'll<00:03:25.470> come<00:03:25.590> out<00:03:25.709> clean<00:03:25.980> won't<00:03:26.250> happen

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
they'll come out clean won't happen

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.530 
they'll come out clean won't happen
there's<00:03:27.650> just<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.739> make<00:03:28.890> sure<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.540> water

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
there's just to make sure that water

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.460
