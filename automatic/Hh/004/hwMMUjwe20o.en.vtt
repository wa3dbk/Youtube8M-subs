00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
and go upwards into the ceiling

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.710 
and go upwards into the ceiling
and<00:01:10.370> then<00:01:10.730> you<00:01:11.540> charge<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:14.210> then<00:01:14.420> should<00:01:14.690> be

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
and then you charge and then should be

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.500 
and then you charge and then should be
walking<00:01:15.110> on<00:01:15.440> air<00:01:15.620> or<00:01:15.860> something

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
walking on air or something

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.660 
walking on air or something
but<00:01:18.140> then<00:01:18.380> eventually<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:18.980> fall<00:01:19.220> down<00:01:19.400> like

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
but then eventually you fall down like

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.720 
but then eventually you fall down like
if<00:01:19.940> you<00:01:20.060> go<00:01:20.240> out<00:01:20.450> of<00:01:20.480> the<00:01:20.810> I<00:01:21.230> think<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.340> area<00:01:22.520> of

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
if you go out of the I think the area of

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:30.700 
if you go out of the I think the area of
the<00:01:22.910> temple

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.130 

the<00:01:31.370> next<00:01:31.670> one<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:32.620> just<00:01:33.620> found<00:01:34.150> randomly

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
the next one I just found randomly

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.100 
the next one I just found randomly
so<00:01:36.800> I<00:01:36.950> ran<00:01:37.420> just<00:01:38.420> go<00:01:38.690> just<00:01:39.410> like<00:01:40.660> flyicus<00:01:41.660> then

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
so I ran just go just like flyicus then

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.770 
so I ran just go just like flyicus then
in<00:01:42.350> charge<00:01:42.680> should<00:01:43.400> go<00:01:43.580> slightly<00:01:44.120> forward<00:01:44.570> so

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
in charge should go slightly forward so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.250 
in charge should go slightly forward so
you<00:01:45.200> can<00:01:45.440> go<00:01:45.590> past<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.250> eye<00:01:47.020> one<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.050> the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
you can go past the eye one of the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.820 
you can go past the eye one of the
invisible<00:01:49.190> light<00:01:49.640> barriers<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.900> then<00:01:51.110> just

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
invisible light barriers and then just

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.310 
invisible light barriers and then just
go<00:01:52.010> up<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.400> can<00:01:52.550> fly<00:01:52.850> through<00:01:53.320> the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
go up and you can fly through the

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.040 
go up and you can fly through the
hourglass<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:56.090> next<00:01:56.420> one's<00:01:56.600> kind<00:01:56.960> of
