start it off
I<00:00:21.060> recently<00:00:21.960> purchased<00:00:23.269> aluminum<00:00:24.269> shocks

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
I recently purchased aluminum shocks

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.429 
I recently purchased aluminum shocks
right<00:00:24.930> there<00:00:25.140> there's<00:00:25.470> two<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> back<00:00:26.010> and

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
right there there's two in the back and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.679 
right there there's two in the back and
there's<00:00:28.439> two<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> front<00:00:29.220> right<00:00:29.340> there

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
there's two in the front right there

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.820 
there's two in the front right there
they're<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:30.720> really<00:00:31.199> much<00:00:31.500> different

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
they're not really much different

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.440 
they're not really much different
they're<00:00:31.920> stronger<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.640> they<00:00:32.730> won't<00:00:32.880> snap<00:00:33.239> off

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
they're stronger so they won't snap off

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.810 
they're stronger so they won't snap off
and<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.140> there's<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.190> call<00:00:35.489> up<00:00:35.640> nice

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and you can there's this call up nice

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.130 
and you can there's this call up nice
too<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.480> more<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:36.960> they<00:00:37.020> look

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
too it was more just because they look

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.440 
too it was more just because they look
nice<00:00:38.090> also<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.350> back<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
nice also in the back you can see the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.150 
nice also in the back you can see the
metal<00:00:42.450> dog<00:00:42.719> bones<00:00:42.989> they<00:00:43.739> were<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:43.980> cuz<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
metal dog bones they were just cuz the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.080 
metal dog bones they were just cuz the
other<00:00:44.250> ones<00:00:44.399> were<00:00:44.489> getting<00:00:44.550> cheap<00:00:44.879> and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
other ones were getting cheap and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.639 
other ones were getting cheap and
starting<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> flex<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.110> didn't<00:00:46.500> like

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
starting to flex and I just didn't like

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.369 
starting to flex and I just didn't like
it<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.120> eight<00:00:48.750> dollars<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
it so I just for like eight dollars it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.160 
it so I just for like eight dollars it
was<00:00:49.469> worth<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.950> by<00:00:50.160> far<00:00:50.420> by<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> way<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
was worth it by far by the way the the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.799 
was worth it by far by the way the the
shocks<00:00:52.410> were<00:00:52.620> about<00:00:53.100> ten<00:00:53.850> my<00:00:54.090> believes<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
shocks were about ten my believes and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.610 
shocks were about ten my believes and
then<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.120> few<00:00:57.930> more<00:00:58.050> things<00:00:58.260> under<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
then I have a few more things under the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:08.020 
then I have a few more things under the
hood<00:01:00.920> said<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> get<00:01:02.100> off<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> locks<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.730> body

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.420 

alright<00:01:09.560> now<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.070> right<00:01:11.189> that's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
alright now as you can see right that's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.490 
alright now as you can see right that's
why<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> first<00:01:11.850> thing<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.119> notice<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.960> heat

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
why the first thing you notice the heat

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
why the first thing you notice the heat
sinks<00:01:13.950> which<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.340> basically<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.760> because

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
sinks which is basically just because

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.320 
sinks which is basically just because
the<00:01:15.689> 180<00:01:15.990> motors<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.650> very<00:01:16.950> hot<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.180> guys

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
the 180 motors get very hot and you guys

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.390 
the 180 motors get very hot and you guys
already<00:01:18.479> know<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.689> do<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> 180<00:01:19.680> motor<00:01:19.890> it's

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
already know I do have a 180 motor it's

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.100 
already know I do have a 180 motor it's
in<00:01:20.610> some<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.150> my<00:01:21.210> previous<00:01:21.330> videos<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.960> talked

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
in some of my previous videos I talked

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.469 
in some of my previous videos I talked
about<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.670> but<00:01:23.670> basically<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.270> because

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
about that but basically this is because

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.240 
about that but basically this is because
these<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:25.020> hot<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.470> buy<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> heat<00:01:25.950> sink

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
these get very hot you buy a heat sink

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.609 
these get very hot you buy a heat sink
and<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.520> does<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:26.909> metal<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.470> just

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and what does it's metal and it's just

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.319 
and what does it's metal and it's just
kind<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.860> these<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.280> rings<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.759> allows<00:01:30.030> air

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
kind of these little rings it allows air

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.539 
kind of these little rings it allows air
flow<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.140> because<00:01:32.009> metal<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.369> good

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
flow and because metal is a good

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.789 
flow and because metal is a good
conductor<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> heat<00:01:33.270> what<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> does<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.079> it

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
conductor of heat what it does is it

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.460 
conductor of heat what it does is it
takes<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.939> heat<00:01:36.150> off<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.750> motor<00:01:37.049> puts<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
takes the heat off of the motor puts the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.499 
takes the heat off of the motor puts the
end<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> metal<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.880> stays<00:01:39.119> hot

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
end of the metal so this stays hot

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.870 
end of the metal so this stays hot
cooler<00:01:40.040> keeping<00:01:41.040> everything<00:01:41.250> else<00:01:41.400> nice<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
cooler keeping everything else nice and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.719 
cooler keeping everything else nice and
cool<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.360> basically<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:44.009> has<00:01:44.070> helps<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:44.549> car

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
cool and basically it has helps your car

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.800 
cool and basically it has helps your car
not<00:01:44.939> blow<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.920> yeah<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.640> then<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.329> few<00:01:48.689> more

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
not blow up so yeah and then a few more

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.010 
not blow up so yeah and then a few more
things<00:01:49.049> are<00:01:49.549> bullion<00:01:50.549> inside<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
things are bullion inside the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.410 
things are bullion inside the
transmission<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.710> did<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> positraction

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
transmission I did have a positraction
