00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
camera was not so good on the eyes and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.800 
camera was not so good on the eyes and
it<00:03:13.200> was<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:15.090> audio<00:03:15.360> quality<00:03:15.510> was

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.800 
it was the the audio quality was
horrible<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.500> was<00:03:16.590> absolutely<00:03:17.040> dreadful

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
horrible it was absolutely dreadful

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.830 
horrible it was absolutely dreadful
maybe<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.989> was<00:03:19.079> just<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.349> bad<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:20.030> bad<00:03:21.030> model<00:03:21.569> that

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
maybe it was just a bad a bad model that

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.690 
maybe it was just a bad a bad model that
I<00:03:21.870> got<00:03:22.170> or<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.560> bad<00:03:23.190> unit

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
I got or a bad unit

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.050

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
it was the JVC GC fm1 and I think I've

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.550 
it was the JVC GC fm1 and I think I've
done<00:03:27.180> an<00:03:27.299> unboxing<00:03:27.540> video<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.290> taking

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
done an unboxing video of it and taking

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.690 
done an unboxing video of it and taking
it<00:03:28.650> off<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:28.950> my<00:03:29.069> account<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.370> don't<00:03:29.430> know<00:03:29.549> why
