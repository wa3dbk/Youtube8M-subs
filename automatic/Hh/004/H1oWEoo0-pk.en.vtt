right now so yeah first everyone knows

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.150 
right now so yeah first everyone knows
the<00:00:39.510> v-cube<00:00:39.840> how<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> mod<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.649> for

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the v-cube how you have to mod it for

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.600 
the v-cube how you have to mod it for
god<00:00:41.910> knows<00:00:42.090> how<00:00:42.149> long<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.780> make<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:44.629> usable<00:00:45.629> and

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
god knows how long to make it usable and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.610 
god knows how long to make it usable and
then<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.969> shank<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.420> rather<00:00:48.750> box<00:00:49.230> felt

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
then the shank out rather box felt

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.979 
then the shank out rather box felt
really<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.129> great<00:00:50.629> there<00:00:51.629> was<00:00:51.780> already

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
really really great there was already

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.930 
really really great there was already
some<00:00:52.230> lube<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.710> there<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.460> i<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> do

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
some lube in there so all i have to do

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420 
some lube in there so all i have to do
is<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.780> reapply<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:55.680> bit<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.129> diff

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
is just reapply a little bit of a diff

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.270 
is just reapply a little bit of a diff
oil<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:58.230> works<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.530> fine<00:00:58.890> now

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
oil in here and it works just fine now

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.119 
oil in here and it works just fine now
and<00:00:59.520> I<00:01:00.359> retention<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> little<00:01:01.440> bit<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.829> opened

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
and I retention it a little bit I opened

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.460 
and I retention it a little bit I opened
up<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> see<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.489> mechanism<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:04.140> based

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
up to see the mechanism and it's based

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.670 
up to see the mechanism and it's based
on<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.820> X<00:01:05.820> cubed<00:01:06.270> mechanisms<00:01:06.900> misalignment

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
on the X cubed mechanisms misalignment

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.410 
on the X cubed mechanisms misalignment
system<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.880> don't<00:01:09.030> know<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.299> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
system so if you don't know what that is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.050 
system so if you don't know what that is
then<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.979> look<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:11.850> come

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
then you go look that up and then come

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.670 
then you go look that up and then come
back<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.330> video<00:01:12.510> fully<00:01:13.170> adjustable

doesn't<00:01:14.610> miss<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> line<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.720> very<00:01:15.960> very

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
doesn't miss a line it's a very very

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.260 
doesn't miss a line it's a very very
good<00:01:16.380> cube<00:01:16.710> very<00:01:17.040> fast<00:01:17.520> I'm<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.210> do

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
good cube very fast I'm not going to do

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.820 
good cube very fast I'm not going to do
any<00:01:18.390> corner<00:01:18.750> cutting<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.619> you're

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
any corner cutting on it because you're

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.050 
any corner cutting on it because you're
neither<00:01:19.979> cares<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.400> corner<00:01:20.729> cutting<00:01:20.909> on

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
neither cares about corner cutting on

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.859 
neither cares about corner cutting on
bigger<00:01:21.299> cubes<00:01:22.310> well<00:01:23.310> some<00:01:23.490> people<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.330> um

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
bigger cubes well some people it's um

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.010 
bigger cubes well some people it's um
very<00:01:25.640> smooth<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.880> very<00:01:27.180> fast<00:01:27.450> cube<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> inner

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
very smooth you very fast cube the inner

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.340 
very smooth you very fast cube the inner
layers<00:01:28.290> turn<00:01:28.820> just<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:29.939> well<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:34.200> outer

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
layers turn just as well as the outer

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.550 
layers turn just as well as the outer
layers<00:01:34.680> which<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.159> very<00:01:35.400> very<00:01:35.810> nice<00:01:36.810> heaven

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
layers which is very very nice heaven

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.350 
layers which is very very nice heaven
I'm<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.250> use<00:01:38.430> two<00:01:38.640> cubes<00:01:39.000> ghosts

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
I'm not really that use two cubes ghosts

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.710 
I'm not really that use two cubes ghosts
yet

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:52.620

cube<00:02:46.329> and<00:02:46.690> i<00:02:47.170> guess<00:02:47.320> i'll<00:02:47.500> go<00:02:47.799> ahead<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:48.040> do<00:02:48.250> an

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
cube and i guess i'll go ahead and do an

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.520 
cube and i guess i'll go ahead and do an
example<00:02:48.790> call<00:02:49.120> video<00:02:49.359> with<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.840> highly

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
example call video with it highly
