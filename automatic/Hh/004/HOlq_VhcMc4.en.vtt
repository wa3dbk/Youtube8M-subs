know basically come about with you know

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.140 
know basically come about with you know
flexibility<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.429> know<00:00:08.519> get<00:00:08.790> questions

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
flexibility and you know get questions

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.749 
flexibility and you know get questions
on<00:00:09.300> do<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.260> stretch<00:00:10.559> before<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.400> stretch

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
on do I stretch before do I stretch

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.520 
on do I stretch before do I stretch
after<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.509> know<00:00:12.599> what<00:00:12.900> are<00:00:13.019> all<00:00:13.049> those<00:00:13.259> things

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
after you know what are all those things

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.780 
after you know what are all those things
you<00:00:13.889> know<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.190> think<00:00:14.309> basically

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
you know and I think basically

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.340 
you know and I think basically
stretching<00:00:15.330> before<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.809> after<00:00:16.080> are<00:00:16.170> very

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
stretching before and after are very

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.080 
stretching before and after are very
important<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.070> think<00:00:17.190> what<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.760> know<00:00:17.850> key

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
important but I think what you know key

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.060 
important but I think what you know key
component<00:00:18.570> we<00:00:18.660> want<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> talk<00:00:18.990> about<00:00:19.140> today<00:00:19.529> is

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
component we want to talk about today is

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.310 
component we want to talk about today is
some<00:00:20.369> clothes<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.820> run<00:00:20.939> flexibility<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.900> I

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
some clothes to run flexibility and I

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.109 
some clothes to run flexibility and I
think<00:00:22.470> postpartum<00:00:22.830> flexibility<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.609> hugely

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
think postpartum flexibility is hugely

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.670 
think postpartum flexibility is hugely
important<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:24.660> distance<00:00:25.080> runners<00:00:25.350> because

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
important for distance runners because

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.019 
important for distance runners because
when<00:00:25.859> we're<00:00:26.010> out<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:26.310> running<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.730> log<00:00:26.880> in

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
when we're out there running in log in

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.970 
when we're out there running in log in
the<00:00:27.119> miles<00:00:27.330> these<00:00:27.990> muscles<00:00:28.439> get<00:00:28.680> short

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the miles these muscles get short

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
the miles these muscles get short
typically<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> distance<00:00:30.119> runner<00:00:30.269> calves

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
typically as a distance runner calves

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.560 
typically as a distance runner calves
get<00:00:31.230> tight<00:00:31.529> quads<00:00:31.859> get<00:00:32.340> tight<00:00:32.610> hips<00:00:33.120> get<00:00:33.360> tight

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
get tight quads get tight hips get tight

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.750 
get tight quads get tight hips get tight
particular<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.380> women<00:00:34.739> let's<00:00:34.950> say<00:00:35.100> hips<00:00:35.579> are

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
particular with women let's say hips are

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.400 
particular with women let's say hips are
a<00:00:35.790> big<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.239> come<00:00:36.510> into<00:00:36.660> play<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.170> know

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
ankles the knees and the hips when that

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.039 
ankles the knees and the hips when that
foot<00:01:05.189> hits<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> ground<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:06.510> know<00:01:06.869> with

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
foot hits the ground and I do know with

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.960 
foot hits the ground and I do know with
Ryan<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.619> his<00:01:07.770> particular<00:01:08.280> issues<00:01:08.580> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
Ryan one of his particular issues is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
Ryan one of his particular issues is
that<00:01:09.180> when<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.479> knee<00:01:09.659> hits<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> ground<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that when that knee hits the ground it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.109 
that when that knee hits the ground it
kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.799> rolls<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.610> bit<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.000> know

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
kind of rolls in a little bit you know

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.539 
kind of rolls in a little bit you know
and<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.619> distance<00:01:13.950> running<00:01:14.159> when<00:01:14.369> we're

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
and so with distance running when we're

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.539 
and so with distance running when we're
evaluating<00:01:15.360> form<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> flexibility<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:17.310> talk

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
evaluating form and flexibility we talk

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.670 
evaluating form and flexibility we talk
about<00:01:17.700> things<00:01:18.030> called<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.479> cue<00:01:18.810> angle<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
about things called a cue angle and the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.620 
about things called a cue angle and the
cue<00:01:19.920> angle<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.150> don't<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.479> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
cue angle you know if you don't know is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.690 
cue angle you know if you don't know is
basically<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.229> line<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.220> draw<00:01:23.430> from

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
basically the line you can draw from

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.670 
basically the line you can draw from
your<00:01:23.759> hip<00:01:24.060> bone<00:01:24.299> down<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.110> middle<00:01:25.350> ear<00:01:25.470> in

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
your hip bone down to the middle ear in

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
your hip bone down to the middle ear in
need<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.939> women<00:01:27.180> particularly

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
need and and with women particularly

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.359 
need and and with women particularly
this<00:01:27.900> issue<00:01:28.080> becomes<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.710> big<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.070> because

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
this issue becomes a big one because

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.460 
this issue becomes a big one because
they<00:01:29.490> tend<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.850> wider<00:01:30.119> hips<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:31.020> that

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
they tend to have wider hips that that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.039 
they tend to have wider hips that that
angle<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.490> greater<00:01:32.850> angle<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.780> greater

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
angle is a greater angle and the greater

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
angle is a greater angle and the greater
the<00:01:34.259> angle<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.070> more<00:01:35.340> stress<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.880> knee

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the angle the more stress on that knee

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840 
the angle the more stress on that knee
and<00:01:36.420> would<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> lot<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.079> ACL<00:01:37.860> MCL<00:01:38.130> injuries

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
and would get a lot of ACL MCL injuries

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.340 
and would get a lot of ACL MCL injuries
from<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.509> that's<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.960> big<00:01:40.140> one

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
from that and that's a big one

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.140 
from that and that's a big one
you<00:01:40.560> know<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.100> know<00:01:41.159> with<00:01:41.369> Ryan<00:01:41.610> he<00:01:41.759> has<00:01:41.939> had

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
you know and I know with Ryan he has had

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.370 
you know and I know with Ryan he has had
some<00:01:42.329> little<00:01:42.450> knee<00:01:42.659> hiccups<00:01:43.049> here<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.259> there

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
some little knee hiccups here and there

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.749 
some little knee hiccups here and there
so<00:01:43.680> we've<00:01:43.979> had<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> kind<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.399> work<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.729> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
so we've had to kind of work on a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 
so we've had to kind of work on a
routine<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.899> get<00:01:46.229> those<00:01:46.439> tight<00:01:46.680> hips

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
routine I know you get those tight hips

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.679 
routine I know you get those tight hips
as<00:01:47.100> well<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.210> maybe<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:48.659> be

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
as well so I think it maybe would be

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.969 
as well so I think it maybe would be
really<00:01:49.140> good<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.380> us<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.590> kind<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> talk<00:01:49.950> about

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
really good for us to kind of talk about

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.460 
really good for us to kind of talk about
that<00:01:50.430> show<00:01:51.240> kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> two<00:01:51.720> stretches<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.320> work

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that show kind of two stretches to work

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.350 
that show kind of two stretches to work
both<00:01:52.710> those<00:01:52.950> internal<00:01:53.490> hip<00:01:53.700> rotators<00:01:54.060> which

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
both those internal hip rotators which

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.969 
both those internal hip rotators which
are<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.570> ones<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.810> get<00:01:55.049> tight<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.500> then

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
are the ones that get tight and then

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.620 
are the ones that get tight and then
those<00:01:56.159> glutes<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:57.030> kind<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.509> get

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
those glutes that kind of just get

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.240 
those glutes that kind of just get
cinched<00:01:58.049> down<00:01:58.110> because<00:01:58.680> those<00:01:58.860> hips<00:01:59.070> get

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
cinched down because those hips get

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.640 
cinched down because those hips get
tight

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
tight

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.470 
tight
that<00:02:00.340> sounds<00:02:00.610> good<00:02:00.730> mine<00:02:00.970> are<00:02:01.120> pretty<00:02:01.300> tight

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
that sounds good mine are pretty tight

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.090 
that sounds good mine are pretty tight
right<00:02:01.660> now<00:02:01.810> alright<00:02:02.140> let's<00:02:02.350> give<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.680> go<00:02:02.860> so

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
right now alright let's give it a go so

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.500 
right now alright let's give it a go so
let's<00:02:03.280> come<00:02:03.430> around<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.760> back<00:02:03.880> of<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.150> table

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
let's come around the back of the table

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.180 
let's come around the back of the table
and<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:05.050> first<00:02:05.200> thing<00:02:05.440> we're<00:02:05.560> gonna<00:02:05.680> do<00:02:05.950> is

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
and the first thing we're gonna do is

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.590 
and the first thing we're gonna do is
show<00:02:06.820> basically<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:08.009> external<00:02:09.009> stretch<00:02:09.940> to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
show basically a external stretch to

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.600 
show basically a external stretch to
basically<00:02:11.290> open<00:02:11.800> those<00:02:11.950> internal<00:02:12.370> hip

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
basically open those internal hip

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.400 
basically open those internal hip
rotators<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.630> you're<00:02:13.840> gonna<00:02:13.930> put<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.350> right

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
rotators so you're gonna put that right

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.200 
rotators so you're gonna put that right
leg<00:02:14.860> up<00:02:15.070> on<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.310> front<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.790> table

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
leg up on the front of the table

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.600 
leg up on the front of the table
now<00:02:16.750> good<00:02:17.050> form<00:02:17.410> would<00:02:17.590> have<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.280> we<00:02:18.430> try

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
now good form would have it that we try

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.190 
now good form would have it that we try
to<00:02:18.670> keep<00:02:18.880> this<00:02:19.090> right<00:02:19.360> knee<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:19.780> line<00:02:19.990> with

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
to keep this right knee in line with

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.590 
to keep this right knee in line with
this<00:02:20.380> shoulder<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:21.280> looking<00:02:22.090> pretty<00:02:22.330> solid

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
this shoulder so looking pretty solid

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.060 
this shoulder so looking pretty solid
maybe<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.170> got<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.380> go<00:02:23.470> over<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.680> little<00:02:23.800> bit

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
maybe you got to go over a little bit

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.760 
maybe you got to go over a little bit
great<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.880> back<00:02:25.150> leg<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.720> gonna<00:02:26.020> stay<00:02:26.350> in<00:02:26.380> line

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
great the back leg is gonna stay in line

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.740 
great the back leg is gonna stay in line
with<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.190> table<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:27.790> then<00:02:28.300> what<00:02:28.510> we're<00:02:28.660> gonna

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
with the table and then what we're gonna

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.660 
with the table and then what we're gonna
do<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:29.080> kind<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.350> first<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.800> off<00:02:29.920> just<00:02:30.220> analyze

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
do is kind of first of off just analyze

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.070 
do is kind of first of off just analyze
hey<00:02:30.910> how<00:02:31.120> high<00:02:31.330> is<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.630> off<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.930> table

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
hey how high is that off the table

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.230 
hey how high is that off the table
because<00:02:32.500> ideally<00:02:32.950> we'd<00:02:33.490> like<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.760> get<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.060> a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
because ideally we'd like to get it a

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.120 
because ideally we'd like to get it a
little<00:02:34.360> bit<00:02:34.510> lower<00:02:34.810> but<00:02:35.380> if<00:02:35.500> we're<00:02:35.680> tied<00:02:35.920> up

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
little bit lower but if we're tied up

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.490 
little bit lower but if we're tied up
here<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.490> that<00:02:36.610> TfL<00:02:37.180> area<00:02:37.540> that's<00:02:38.050> gonna<00:02:38.320> get

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
here in that TfL area that's gonna get

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.590 
here in that TfL area that's gonna get
tight<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:39.310> let's<00:02:39.820> see<00:02:40.030> what<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.270> other<00:02:40.390> leg

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
tight so let's see what the other leg

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.330 
tight so let's see what the other leg
looks<00:02:40.810> like<00:02:40.990> because<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.709> lot<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.070> what<00:02:42.190> we're

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
looks like because a lot of what we're

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.040 
looks like because a lot of what we're
talking<00:02:42.370> about<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:43.090> balance<00:02:43.630> because<00:02:43.810> if<00:02:43.930> we

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
talking about is balance because if we

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.470 
talking about is balance because if we
stay<00:02:44.290> balanced<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.970> the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
stay balanced and and the the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.390 
stay balanced and and the the
flexibility<00:02:47.140> is<00:02:47.230> even<00:02:47.560> from<00:02:47.740> one<00:02:47.920> side<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.190> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
flexibility is even from one side to the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.720 
flexibility is even from one side to the
other

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
other

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.030 
other
then<00:02:49.600> we're<00:02:49.750> gonna<00:02:49.870> stay<00:02:50.110> healthy<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.950> is

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
then we're gonna stay healthy so it is

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.530 
then we're gonna stay healthy so it is
interesting<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.670> left<00:02:51.850> leg<00:02:52.060> actually<00:02:52.300> a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
interesting the left leg actually a

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.449 
interesting the left leg actually a
little<00:02:52.720> bit<00:02:52.900> lower<00:02:53.110> than<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.470> right<00:02:53.590> leg<00:02:53.830> see

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
little bit lower than the right leg see

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.699 
little bit lower than the right leg see
how<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.760> stretches<00:02:55.090> for<00:02:55.540> this<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:56.110> know<00:02:56.230> just

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
how it stretches for this you know just

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.530 
how it stretches for this you know just

start to let it to settle down what
happens<00:04:45.270> is<00:04:45.360> these<00:04:45.510> muscles<00:04:45.900> just<00:04:46.110> get<00:04:46.260> locked

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
happens is these muscles just get locked

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.130 
happens is these muscles just get locked
in<00:04:46.800> this<00:04:46.950> short<00:04:47.160> position<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:48.030> we're<00:04:48.840> trying

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
in this short position and we're trying

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.910 
in this short position and we're trying
to<00:04:49.200> get<00:04:49.320> them<00:04:49.470> out<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.650> it

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
do that fascial stretching which is

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.630 
do that fascial stretching which is
really<00:04:58.170> good<00:04:58.350> at<00:04:58.440> just<00:04:58.590> getting<00:04:59.190> all<00:04:59.400> that

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
really good at just getting all that

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.220 
really good at just getting all that
connective<00:05:00.210> tissue<00:05:00.480> that<00:05:00.750> wraps<00:05:01.050> around

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
connective tissue that wraps around

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.560 
connective tissue that wraps around
these<00:05:01.650> muscles<00:05:02.100> to<00:05:02.580> really<00:05:02.850> start<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.360> like

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
these muscles to really start to like

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.770 
these muscles to really start to like
just<00:05:03.870> D<00:05:04.320> Tana<00:05:04.620> fie<00:05:04.920> and<00:05:04.950> let<00:05:05.280> go<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.490> little<00:05:05.780> so

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
just D Tana fie and let go a little so

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.630 
just D Tana fie and let go a little so
again<00:05:07.020> you're<00:05:07.170> not<00:05:07.260> going<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.770> know<00:05:07.890> do

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
again you're not going to you know do

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.340 
again you're not going to you know do
the<00:05:08.790> world<00:05:09.030> of<00:05:09.210> change<00:05:09.480> in<00:05:09.660> one<00:05:09.810> session<00:05:10.170> but<00:05:10.320> I

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
the world of change in one session but I

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.440 
the world of change in one session but I
think<00:05:10.530> it's<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.710> great<00:05:10.920> thing<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:11.550> do<00:05:11.760> after

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
think it's a great thing to do after

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.880 
think it's a great thing to do after
every<00:05:12.690> run<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:13.230> start<00:05:13.470> to<00:05:13.560> see<00:05:13.710> some

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
every run to start to see some

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.620 
every run to start to see some
improvement<00:05:14.430> so<00:05:14.850> that's<00:05:15.030> really<00:05:15.240> good<00:05:15.450> one

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
improvement so that's really good one

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.600 
improvement so that's really good one
that<00:05:15.750> help<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.110> get<00:05:16.230> those<00:05:16.380> hip<00:05:16.560> rotators<00:05:16.920> so

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
that help and get those hip rotators so

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.210 
that help and get those hip rotators so
now<00:05:17.790> the<00:05:17.850> next<00:05:18.180> big<00:05:18.360> muscle<00:05:18.690> and<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.860> thing

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
now the next big muscle and the thing

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.830 
now the next big muscle and the thing
with<00:05:20.370> these<00:05:20.550> muscles<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.120> glutes<00:05:21.390> are<00:05:21.660> they

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
with these muscles the glutes are they

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.330 
with these muscles the glutes are they
getting<00:05:22.020> locked<00:05:22.290> down<00:05:22.560> when<00:05:22.800> those<00:05:22.950> hips<00:05:23.160> get

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
getting locked down when those hips get

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.890 
getting locked down when those hips get
tight<00:05:23.580> and<00:05:23.790> then<00:05:23.880> they<00:05:23.970> kind<00:05:24.150> of<00:05:24.180> get<00:05:24.270> inactive

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
tight and then they kind of get inactive

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.660 
tight and then they kind of get inactive
and<00:05:25.080> inactivity<00:05:25.590> with<00:05:25.890> those<00:05:26.070> glutes<00:05:26.310> we<00:05:26.490> lose

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
and inactivity with those glutes we lose

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.790 
and inactivity with those glutes we lose
a<00:05:26.820> lot<00:05:26.940> of<00:05:27.000> power<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.450> speed<00:05:27.600> and<00:05:27.990> then<00:05:28.650> we're

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
a lot of power and speed and then we're

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.590 
a lot of power and speed and then we're
gonna<00:05:28.890> lose<00:05:29.070> a<00:05:29.130> lot<00:05:29.340> of<00:05:29.400> endurance<00:05:29.820> so<00:05:30.420> let's

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
gonna lose a lot of endurance so let's

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.430 
gonna lose a lot of endurance so let's
see<00:05:30.750> what<00:05:30.870> that<00:05:30.900> looks<00:05:31.050> like

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
see what that looks like

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.010 
see what that looks like
so<00:05:32.130> starting<00:05:32.940> in<00:05:33.030> that<00:05:33.120> same<00:05:33.390> position<00:05:33.570> as

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
so starting in that same position as

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.800 
so starting in that same position as
that<00:05:34.080> hip<00:05:34.650> rotators<00:05:35.100> stretch<00:05:35.490> we're<00:05:36.390> now<00:05:36.540> all

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
that hip rotators stretch we're now all

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.870 
that hip rotators stretch we're now all
we're<00:05:37.020> going<00:05:37.140> to<00:05:37.200> do<00:05:37.380> is<00:05:37.950> keep<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:38.400> back<00:05:38.610> nice

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
we're going to do is keep the back nice

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.030 
we're going to do is keep the back nice
and<00:05:38.940> straight<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:39.630> then<00:05:40.050> bend<00:05:40.380> forward<00:05:40.740> so

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
and straight and then bend forward so

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.620 
and straight and then bend forward so
you<00:05:41.100> try<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.430> bring<00:05:41.640> the<00:05:41.760> chest<00:05:41.970> down<00:05:42.120> to<00:05:42.510> the

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
you try to bring the chest down to the

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.320 
you try to bring the chest down to the
knee<00:05:42.860> how's<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.010> feeling<00:05:44.280> there<00:05:44.610> that<00:05:45.060> feels

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
knee how's that feeling there that feels

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.210 
knee how's that feeling there that feels
pretty<00:05:45.510> tight<00:05:45.660> pretty<00:05:46.020> tight<00:05:46.260> right<00:05:46.650> so<00:05:47.040> what

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
pretty tight pretty tight right so what

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.500 
pretty tight pretty tight right so what
happens<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.700> that<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:47.970> first<00:05:48.210> stretch<00:05:48.480> is

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
happens is that the first stretch is

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.540 
happens is that the first stretch is
gonna<00:05:48.780> be<00:05:49.020> predominantly<00:05:49.680> up<00:05:49.920> in<00:05:50.130> that<00:05:50.250> hip

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
gonna be predominantly up in that hip

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.580 
gonna be predominantly up in that hip
and<00:05:50.700> those<00:05:50.850> keep<00:05:51.060> rotators<00:05:51.630> as<00:05:52.020> she<00:05:52.380> bends

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
and those keep rotators as she bends

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.170 
and those keep rotators as she bends
forward<00:05:52.950> the<00:05:53.460> stretch<00:05:53.700> is<00:05:53.850> going<00:05:53.910> to<00:05:54.060> go

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
forward the stretch is going to go

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.600 
forward the stretch is going to go
deeper<00:05:54.690> down<00:05:54.930> into<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.560> glute<00:05:55.800> muscle<00:05:56.250> all

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
deeper down into the glute muscle all

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.490 
deeper down into the glute muscle all
the<00:05:56.880> way<00:05:57.000> down<00:05:57.210> to<00:05:57.420> that<00:05:57.450> insertion<00:05:58.020> point

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
the way down to that insertion point

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.990 
the way down to that insertion point
down<00:05:58.980> into<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.430> near<00:05:59.610> that<00:05:59.760> where<00:05:59.880> the

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
down into the near that where the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
down into the near that where the
hamstrings<00:06:00.420> are<00:06:00.660> feeling<00:06:01.320> a<00:06:01.380> good<00:06:01.530> stretch

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
hamstrings are feeling a good stretch

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.630 
hamstrings are feeling a good stretch
into<00:06:03.380> it<00:06:03.500> gradually<00:06:03.890> you<00:06:04.100> don't<00:06:04.250> want<00:06:04.400> to<00:06:04.490> try

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
into it gradually you don't want to try

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.340 
into it gradually you don't want to try
to<00:06:04.670> force<00:06:05.090> yourself<00:06:05.270> down<00:06:05.780> all<00:06:06.020> at<00:06:06.140> once

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
to force yourself down all at once

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.810 
to force yourself down all at once
without<00:06:06.800> a<00:06:06.830> doubt<00:06:07.100> and<00:06:07.310> so<00:06:07.460> there's<00:06:07.640> a<00:06:07.730> variety

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
without a doubt and so there's a variety

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.760 
without a doubt and so there's a variety
of<00:06:08.150> ways<00:06:08.240> to<00:06:08.360> do<00:06:08.690> this<00:06:08.840> right<00:06:09.320> now<00:06:09.500> you're

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
of ways to do this right now you're

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.110 
of ways to do this right now you're
doing<00:06:10.010> what<00:06:10.130> we<00:06:10.220> would<00:06:10.370> call<00:06:10.490> a<00:06:10.550> passive

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
doing what we would call a passive

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.540 
doing what we would call a passive
stretch<00:06:11.390> really<00:06:12.050> good<00:06:12.380> to<00:06:12.500> do<00:06:12.650> post<00:06:13.010> run<00:06:13.340> just

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
stretch really good to do post run just

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.430 
stretch really good to do post run just
to<00:06:13.700> kind<00:06:13.910> of<00:06:13.970> chill<00:06:14.180> everything<00:06:14.630> out<00:06:14.810> you<00:06:15.110> know

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
to kind of chill everything out you know

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.380 
to kind of chill everything out you know
if<00:06:16.040> you're<00:06:16.340> trying<00:06:16.520> to<00:06:16.670> do<00:06:16.790> a<00:06:16.820> tree<00:06:17.150> you<00:06:17.300> would

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
if you're trying to do a tree you would

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.450 
if you're trying to do a tree you would
do<00:06:17.540> it<00:06:17.660> a<00:06:17.720> little<00:06:17.870> more<00:06:18.020> active<00:06:18.500> but<00:06:19.190> again

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
do it a little more active but again

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.280 
do it a little more active but again
great<00:06:20.030> stretch<00:06:20.330> to<00:06:20.570> kind<00:06:20.750> of<00:06:20.780> work<00:06:21.050> that

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
great stretch to kind of work that

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.870 
great stretch to kind of work that
glutes<00:06:21.650> nice<00:06:22.220> job

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
glutes nice job

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:30.800 
glutes nice job
let's<00:06:23.630> see<00:06:23.750> what<00:06:23.870> that<00:06:23.900> other<00:06:24.140> side

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.700 

good<00:06:31.680> so<00:06:32.070> again<00:06:32.340> back<00:06:32.670> staying<00:06:33.060> straight

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
good so again back staying straight

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.990 
good so again back staying straight
torso<00:06:34.710> nice<00:06:34.920> and<00:06:35.130> strong<00:06:35.400> and<00:06:35.460> you're<00:06:35.820> just

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
torso nice and strong and you're just

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.120 
torso nice and strong and you're just
kind<00:06:36.210> of<00:06:36.300> dropping<00:06:36.630> in<00:06:37.020> and<00:06:37.230> rotating<00:06:37.860> through

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
kind of dropping in and rotating through

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.120 
kind of dropping in and rotating through
those<00:06:38.370> hips<00:06:38.730> to<00:06:39.000> kind<00:06:39.660> of<00:06:39.720> take<00:06:39.900> that<00:06:40.130> anterior

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
those hips to kind of take that anterior

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.070 
those hips to kind of take that anterior
rotation<00:06:41.880> of<00:06:42.000> the<00:06:42.090> hips<00:06:42.270> that<00:06:42.450> goes<00:06:42.660> on<00:06:42.870> with

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
rotation of the hips that goes on with

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.560 
rotation of the hips that goes on with
distance<00:06:43.500> right<00:06:43.820> feeling<00:06:44.820> that<00:06:44.970> one<00:06:45.120> for<00:06:45.540> sure

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
distance right feeling that one for sure

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.390 
distance right feeling that one for sure
yeah<00:06:45.990> so<00:06:46.169> again<00:06:46.410> probably<00:06:46.710> a<00:06:46.950> little<00:06:47.190> bit

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
yeah so again probably a little bit

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.000 
yeah so again probably a little bit
tighter<00:06:47.639> than<00:06:47.760> the<00:06:48.000> left<00:06:48.180> side

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
tighter than the left side

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.140 
tighter than the left side
but<00:06:50.010> again<00:06:50.250> similar<00:06:50.669> to<00:06:50.700> those<00:06:50.940> other

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
but again similar to those other

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.540 
but again similar to those other
routines<00:06:51.630> either<00:06:52.200> a<00:06:52.320> 30-second<00:06:53.070> hold<00:06:53.310> or

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
routines either a 30-second hold or

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.610 
routines either a 30-second hold or
eight<00:06:54.150> to<00:06:54.419> twelve<00:06:54.660> reps<00:06:54.930> of<00:06:55.139> one<00:06:55.350> to<00:06:55.470> two

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
eight to twelve reps of one to two

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.010 
eight to twelve reps of one to two
second<00:06:56.010> hold<00:06:56.220> is<00:06:56.400> going<00:06:56.669> to<00:06:56.730> be<00:06:56.880> plenty<00:06:57.510> for

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
second hold is going to be plenty for

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.450 
second hold is going to be plenty for
that<00:06:58.230> day<00:06:58.440> just<00:06:58.710> to<00:06:58.800> get<00:06:58.950> it<00:06:59.070> done

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
that day just to get it done

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.730 
that day just to get it done
it<00:06:59.790> really<00:07:00.030> rehydrates<00:07:00.900> that<00:07:01.080> area<00:07:01.380> brings<00:07:01.620> a

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
it really rehydrates that area brings a

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.260 
it really rehydrates that area brings a
lot<00:07:01.860> of<00:07:01.919> fresh<00:07:02.220> blood<00:07:02.460> and<00:07:02.520> nutrients<00:07:03.150> and

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
lot of fresh blood and nutrients and

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.060 
lot of fresh blood and nutrients and
oxygen<00:07:03.390> in<00:07:03.870> there<00:07:04.050> so<00:07:04.530> that<00:07:04.560> when<00:07:04.830> we're

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
oxygen in there so that when we're

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.770 
oxygen in there so that when we're
running<00:07:05.220> we<00:07:05.820> can<00:07:06.000> get<00:07:06.210> back<00:07:06.390> into<00:07:06.630> the

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
running we can get back into the

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.600 
running we can get back into the
position<00:07:06.930> where<00:07:07.290> that<00:07:07.320> me<00:07:07.860> and<00:07:08.070> that<00:07:08.190> hip<00:07:08.430> and

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
position where that me and that hip and

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.730 
position where that me and that hip and
that<00:07:08.669> ankle<00:07:09.030> are<00:07:09.270> all<00:07:09.510> going<00:07:09.810> to<00:07:09.870> line<00:07:10.050> up<00:07:10.080> so

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 
that ankle are all going to line up so

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.260 
that ankle are all going to line up so
that<00:07:10.890> when<00:07:11.040> you're<00:07:11.190> going<00:07:11.490> forward<00:07:11.760> we're<00:07:12.090> not

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
that when you're going forward we're not

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.760 
that when you're going forward we're not
going<00:07:12.570> to<00:07:12.600> have<00:07:12.840> a<00:07:12.870> lot<00:07:13.080> of<00:07:13.230> stress<00:07:13.530> on<00:07:13.710> that

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
going to have a lot of stress on that

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.920 
going to have a lot of stress on that
knee<00:07:14.100> which<00:07:14.669> you<00:07:14.880> know<00:07:14.970> isn't<00:07:15.240> supposed<00:07:15.690> to<00:07:15.810> do

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
knee which you know isn't supposed to do

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.540 
knee which you know isn't supposed to do
the<00:07:16.080> job<00:07:16.290> of<00:07:16.320> what<00:07:16.620> those<00:07:16.800> feet<00:07:17.070> in<00:07:17.190> those<00:07:17.310> hips

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
the job of what those feet in those hips

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.880 
the job of what those feet in those hips
do<00:07:17.700> right<00:07:18.240> how<00:07:18.600> does<00:07:18.720> that<00:07:18.810> feel<00:07:19.020> good<00:07:19.530> yeah

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:19.890 
do right how does that feel good yeah

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.590 
do right how does that feel good yeah
I've<00:07:20.010> noticed<00:07:20.220> with<00:07:20.580> myself<00:07:20.790> it<00:07:21.150> really<00:07:21.210> helps

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 
I've noticed with myself it really helps

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.540 
I've noticed with myself it really helps
my<00:07:21.720> hamstrings<00:07:22.229> too<00:07:22.470> to<00:07:22.590> loosen<00:07:22.919> up<00:07:23.010> my<00:07:23.070> glutes

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
my hamstrings too to loosen up my glutes

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.180 
my hamstrings too to loosen up my glutes
and<00:07:24.020> especially<00:07:25.020> keeping<00:07:25.470> my<00:07:25.620> stride<00:07:25.950> nice

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.190 
and especially keeping my stride nice

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.840 
and especially keeping my stride nice
and<00:07:26.400> open

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:26.850 
and open

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.070 
and open
without<00:07:27.120> a<00:07:27.180> doubt<00:07:27.390> yeah<00:07:27.660> because<00:07:27.780> if<00:07:27.960> those

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 
without a doubt yeah because if those

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.540 
without a doubt yeah because if those
glutes<00:07:28.440> get<00:07:28.680> locked<00:07:28.889> down<00:07:29.010> those<00:07:29.310> are<00:07:29.460> our

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550 
glutes get locked down those are our

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.700
