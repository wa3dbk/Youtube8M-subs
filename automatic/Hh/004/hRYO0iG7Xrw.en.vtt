sober next to wedge and I know you know

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.180 
sober next to wedge and I know you know
it's<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.480> bad<00:02:22.630> kind<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.170> reference<00:02:23.350> because<00:02:23.770> a

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
it's a bad kind of reference because a

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.770

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
bad way to reference it because this

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.080 
bad way to reference it because this
one's<00:02:25.990> so<00:02:26.200> used<00:02:26.440> up<00:02:26.650> but<00:02:26.950> they<00:02:27.100> are<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.880> same

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
one's so used up but they are the same

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.600 
one's so used up but they are the same
tones<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.800> why<00:02:29.950> just<00:02:30.190> something<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.520> I've

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
