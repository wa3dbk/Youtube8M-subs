00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.380
 Cape quartet may the team worked 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.600
 rather well and they were still 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.060

 even there have been some conflicts with 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.180
 avengers must say that pietro avoids 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.220
 frustrated or a patient everything will slow down 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:07.040
 with his power then suddenly salty 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.140
 snickered on Thursday he calmed down a bit 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.210
 getting married with christ 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.950
 which is an inhuman the inhuman 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.540
 are people with powers who lives 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.370
 on the moon we will talk about it again 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.340
 and they had a girl both 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.620
 that they are called luna coincidence I 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.720
 do not think and he learned after that 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.080
 are very fast and magneto that made him 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:34.510
 a shock 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:36.070
 but a shock is then kind and after he 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.310
 fucked up the brothel in humans 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.790
 normal so his power to run very 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.430
 very quickly 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.860
 at the beginning they point to 281 km 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.000
 then his powers grew and after 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.660
 he had 1280 km hour and then he has 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.300
 been exposed to the normal isotope of blow 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.100
 he points to match 5 the guys from the 6000 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.780
 115 kilometers per hour even when what 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.370
 for a while he could make it vibrate 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.630
 the molecules of his body what he 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.340
 allowed to travel in time 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.480
 more precisely in the future he 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.310
 could go up to twelve days 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.910
 maximum in the future he remained 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.590
 a few hours 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.180
 and then go back to his starting point 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.670
 because after a while it's 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.650
 fatigue and the ticket so we 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.019
 found in ultimate version and I 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.730
 love them a lot of an ultimatum that 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.799
 was a deluxe marvel 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.480

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.370
