toe joint the most typical type of a
bunion<00:02:16.200> occurs<00:02:17.200> at<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:18.280> metatarsal<00:02:19.239> fail

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
bunion occurs at this metatarsal fail

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.839 
bunion occurs at this metatarsal fail
and<00:02:19.659> you'll<00:02:19.810> joint<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.530> foot<00:02:20.860> same<00:02:21.489> joint

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
and you'll joint in the foot same joint

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.449 
and you'll joint in the foot same joint
we<00:02:22.030> have<00:02:22.180> on<00:02:22.299> our<00:02:22.390> thumb<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.799> happens<00:02:24.189> when

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
we have on our thumb and it happens when

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.940 
we have on our thumb and it happens when
the<00:02:24.610> bone<00:02:24.819> starts<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.989> slip<00:02:26.290> out<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.859> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
the bone starts to slip out of the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.949 
the bone starts to slip out of the
socket<00:02:27.489> big<00:02:27.970> toe<00:02:28.209> goes<00:02:28.390> over<00:02:28.689> toward<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
socket big toe goes over toward the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.500 
socket big toe goes over toward the
second<00:02:29.439> toe<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.519> knuckle<00:02:31.000> starts<00:02:31.359> to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
second toe and this knuckle starts to

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.899 
second toe and this knuckle starts to
project<00:02:32.079> because<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.159> ligaments<00:02:33.670> on<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
project because the ligaments on the

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.330 
project because the ligaments on the
side<00:02:34.120> are<00:02:34.480> no<00:02:34.659> longer<00:02:34.959> holding<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.069> in<00:02:36.189> place

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
side are no longer holding it in place

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.970 
side are no longer holding it in place
so<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.540> ligaments<00:02:37.959> on<00:02:38.079> the<00:02:38.230> side<00:02:38.439> start<00:02:38.799> to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
so the ligaments on the side start to

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.210 
so the ligaments on the side start to
stretch<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:40.450> joint<00:02:40.750> starts<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.319> buckle<00:02:41.739> and

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
stretch the joint starts to buckle and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.690 
stretch the joint starts to buckle and
starts<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.909> pop<00:02:43.120> out<00:02:43.389> of<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:43.690> joint<00:02:44.230> over<00:02:45.069> a

period of time is this bone is being

it'll<00:02:52.239> start<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.540> wear<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.260> cartilage<00:02:53.709> and

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
it'll start to wear on the cartilage and

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.460 
it'll start to wear on the cartilage and
damage<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.459> cartilage<00:02:54.879> in<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.180> joint<00:02:55.470> in

Kissel and his team cut and repositioned
Wanda's<00:03:27.220> metatarsal<00:03:28.000> bone<00:03:28.209> then<00:03:28.930> they<00:03:29.470> rotate

the damaged cartilage before applying to
microscopic<00:03:33.040> screws<00:03:33.699> into<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.419> bone<00:03:34.599> so

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
microscopic screws into the bone so

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.490 
microscopic screws into the bone so
these<00:03:35.650> little<00:03:35.980> screws<00:03:37.049> hold<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.319> bone

these little screws hold the bone

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.490 
these little screws hold the bone
together<00:03:38.889> really<00:03:39.310> tight<00:03:40.079> so<00:03:41.079> there's<00:03:41.260> no

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
together really tight so there's no

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.349 
together really tight so there's no
wiggling<00:03:41.799> that<00:03:42.400> prevents<00:03:42.909> a<00:03:42.970> lot<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.269> the

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
wiggling that prevents a lot of the

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.050 
wiggling that prevents a lot of the
swelling<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:44.079> we<00:03:44.229> used<00:03:44.409> to<00:03:44.590> see<00:03:44.859> and<00:03:45.220> mix<00:03:45.879> the

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
swelling that we used to see and mix the

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.390 
swelling that we used to see and mix the
bone<00:03:46.269> heal<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.599> bit<00:03:46.870> quicker<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:48.280> we've

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
bone heal a bit quicker so we've

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.729 
bone heal a bit quicker so we've
accomplished<00:03:49.000> what<00:03:49.180> we<00:03:49.209> want<00:03:49.629> we're<00:03:50.319> sure<00:03:50.590> of

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
accomplished what we want we're sure of

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.309 
accomplished what we want we're sure of
it<00:03:50.889> is<00:03:51.069> this<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.310> before<00:03:51.729> and<00:03:51.849> after<00:03:51.970> uh-huh<00:03:52.569> and

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
it is this a before and after uh-huh and

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.309 
it is this a before and after uh-huh and
in<00:03:53.680> this<00:03:54.419> picture<00:03:55.419> we've<00:03:55.599> pushed<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.169> bone

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
in this picture we've pushed the bone

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.719 
in this picture we've pushed the bone
over<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:57.609> we've<00:03:57.819> twisted<00:03:58.709> this<00:03:59.709> piece<00:04:00.159> you

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
over and we've twisted this piece you

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:02.189 
over and we've twisted this piece you
can<00:04:00.909> see<00:04:01.060> how<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.269> sticks<00:04:01.540> out<00:04:01.750> over<00:04:01.810> here

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
can see how it sticks out over here

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.960 
can see how it sticks out over here
because<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.590> twisting<00:04:03.190> so

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
because of the twisting so

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.510 
because of the twisting so
