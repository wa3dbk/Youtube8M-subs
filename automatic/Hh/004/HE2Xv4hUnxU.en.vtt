00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.990
 very good today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.790
 delicious lemon cream that is going to 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.309
 serve to fill biscuits 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.369
 tarts and a lot of other things 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.250
 the recipe is very simple and we are only going to 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.890
 need 2 large eggs 4 yolks 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.160
 large egg 120 grams of juice 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.189
 freshly squeezed lemon 150 grams of 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.439
 white granulated sugar 115 grams of 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.169
 butter without salt softened and the 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.119
 zest of the skin of 2 lemons in addition 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.400
 let's use a bottom pot 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.920
 thick so the cream does not stick if 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.280
 you do not have a pot of this type you can 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.910
 make the cream in a bain-marie we put in 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.980
 the pot the eggs 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.980
 the yolks and beat 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.519
 We add the sugar and we mix it 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.479
 and we toss the lemon juice we mix a 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.479
 little more 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.430
 and heat over medium low heat without 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.010
 stop stirring until the cream 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.830
 thicken 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.830
 this will take us from 10 to 14 minutes 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.890
 when it has thickened we remove it from 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.570
 fire and we went through a colander to 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.570
 avoid possible lumps 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.900
 we add the lemon zest 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.450
 and the chopped butter 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.910
 we mix until the butter is 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.870
 undo completely and we have one 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.870
 bright cream 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.270
 we cover with film pressing the plastic 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.650
 about the cream so it did not create a 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.650
 bark on the surface 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.960
 This type of cream should be stored in 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.330
 the refrigerator until the moment of 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.510
 serve it and at most you can 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.670
 Keep for 2 days 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.860
 once the cream is already cold 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.950
 we can use it in whatever we want 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.480
 here you can see a recipe in which I have 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.480
