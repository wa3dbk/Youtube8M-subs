00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.540
 car care tutorial air conditioners 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.070
 disinfection 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 why do you need your air conditioning 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.260
 disinfect it becomes relatively easy 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.789
 often used in summer and in winter 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.500
 rather not but accumulates 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.840
 moisture due to this moisture 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 can make bacteria mold and germs 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.750
 arise 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 they are unhealthy so you should 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.190
 Do a regular cleaning there 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.489
 It's easy and how do I show 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.229
 you 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.539
 We want the air conditioning 

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:44.280
 disinfect it is important for that 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:46.459
 We start the engine first 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.079
 turn on the air conditioner 

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:50.750
 They are the ventilation for full performance 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.240
 put 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.240
 and activate recirculation mode 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.910
 Next we take out our box 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.210
 the packaging finally packaging 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.210
 again 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.930
 and remove the perforation shake 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.510
 The can neatly last 30 seconds 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.670
 so really the blowing agent 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:23.440
 is distributed 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:28.750
 After that we take a cloth to put that 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.810
 on the doormat our cardboard acts as 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.480
 support and there we put the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.360
 air conditioning disinfection into and 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.630
 activate the dose and leave now 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.630
 of the vehicle close the doors 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.729
 dose now activates and sprays that 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.729
 disinfectant with the 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.290
 recirculation mode in the air conditioning and we 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.820
 Just wait for the dose to be heard 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.290
 spray it and then we can 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.290
 ventilate the vehicle and re-enter 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.300
 the tin stopped spraying 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.360
 We opened the doors for a moment 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.160
 and now we can do the can again 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.170
 remove and still the drops here in the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.080
 take up the interior 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.709
 that happened quickly and ours 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.600
 Air conditioning is disinfected so the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.400
 Dare is freshly disinfected and he 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.620
