00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.440 

then<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.349> take<00:02:13.650> these<00:02:13.920> are<00:02:14.069> African

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.280 

okay<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.069> orbits<00:02:26.489> might<00:02:26.730> can<00:02:27.390> sometimes<00:02:27.989> tend

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
okay the orbits might can sometimes tend

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.040 
okay the orbits might can sometimes tend
to<00:02:28.410> give<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.680> list<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:30.030> take<00:02:30.569> them<00:02:30.690> all<00:02:30.900> so

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
to give you a list so take them all so

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.400 
to give you a list so take them all so
you<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.230> understand<00:02:31.680> me<00:02:32.720> they<00:02:33.720> say<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.290> you

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
you can understand me they say that you

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.050 
you can understand me they say that you
can<00:02:34.560> also<00:02:34.650> use<00:02:34.980> dental<00:02:35.459> gum

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
can also use dental gum

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.100 
can also use dental gum
I<00:02:36.090> mean<00:02:36.360> dental<00:02:36.660> wax<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:38.010> play<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.250> between<00:02:39.110> and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
find they really helped out that much

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.360 
find they really helped out that much
well<00:02:44.040> suppose<00:02:44.340> they<00:02:44.790> come<00:02:45.090> with<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.720> little<00:02:46.170> a

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.270 

little<00:02:50.370> hook<00:02:51.349> so<00:02:52.349> if<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.040> have<00:02:53.130> trouble

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
little hook so if you have trouble

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.820 
little hook so if you have trouble

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
getting them off you can use this and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.080 
getting them off you can use this and
then<00:02:56.549> they<00:02:56.750> or<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> bands<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.410> tend<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.799> hurt<00:02:59.090> so

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
then they or a bands do tend to hurt so

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.080
