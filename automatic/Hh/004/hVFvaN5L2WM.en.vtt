probably<00:03:26.120> putting<00:03:26.300> your<00:03:26.450> Springs<00:03:26.810> on<00:03:27.080> check

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
probably putting your Springs on check

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.970 
probably putting your Springs on check
the<00:03:28.250> size<00:03:28.580> of<00:03:28.850> your<00:03:28.880> Springs<00:03:29.590> because<00:03:30.590> if<00:03:30.890> you

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
the size of your Springs because if you

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.280 
the size of your Springs because if you
got<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.310> wrong<00:03:31.490> side<00:03:31.880> springs<00:03:32.360> they<00:03:32.630> will<00:03:32.930> not

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
got the wrong side springs they will not

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.440 
got the wrong side springs they will not
fit<00:03:33.620> in<00:03:33.740> your<00:03:33.890> part<00:03:34.190> man<00:03:34.460> and<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:35.240> would<00:03:35.360> be

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
fit in your part man and it would be

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.450 
fit in your part man and it would be
much<00:03:35.630> much<00:03:35.870> harder<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.320> put<00:03:36.470> them<00:03:36.590> on<00:03:36.740> because
