00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.710
 a greeting to all friends of 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.110
 androidworld.it welcome to boxing 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.389
 of asus cellphone two yes you don't have 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.790
 misunderstood we are respecting asus 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.590
 cellphone two is not the same version 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:23.050
 which we have already seen because it is that 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.370
 with less ram less powerful processor e 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.780
 so for someone more interesting 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.090
 also because it costs 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.380
 if I'm not mistaken a hundred euros or 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.140
 less than the version we have 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:38.980
 already we had already tried is the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:40.510
 z550 ml version abbreviation cost 249 euros 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.930
 we go fast because so much in reality 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.150
 since the version is always 5 inches 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.070
 and half the smartphone more or less 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.280
 aesthetically you should already know it 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:56.950
 because you should have already seen ours 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:00.579
 review we have the micro usb usb cable 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:04.000
 headphones in ear with all the various domains 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:10.240
 earphones for various sizes and this 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.470
 one amp power supply and 35 that 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.510
 we put away the packaging we carry 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.650
 inside the smartphone here it is then 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.500
 the back is rubberized no longer plastic 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.690
 slightly brushed the profile remains 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.850
 but for the rest it is completely identical or 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.070
 less while we turn it on wiel here 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:36.760
 some specification the processor is a 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:41.710
 intel atom quad core z35 60 of 1.8 ghz 2 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.750
 gb wifi bluetooth 4.0 gb then for 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.090
 the rest very similar and also this a 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.340
 we have now expandable and the two slots 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.750
 so for sims it is still one 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.130
 dual sim smartphone 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.770
 as I told you, it's sold on the site 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.360
 asus for 249 euros 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.580

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.220
 this smartphone and we will answer 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.900
 obviously to all 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.730
 questions in the final ignition vi 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.320
 advance immediately a reply yes we will do 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.810
 also a comparison with the 551 ml that 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.390
 we still have and therefore we can do a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.560
 comparison between the two models for this 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.590
