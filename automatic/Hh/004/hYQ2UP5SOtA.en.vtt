what we're sort of trying to do is

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.810 
what we're sort of trying to do is
create<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:23.770> really<00:01:24.370> really<00:01:24.580> natural

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
create this really really natural

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.640 
create this really really natural
natural<00:01:25.210> texture<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:25.960> almost<00:01:26.260> feels<00:01:26.530> like

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
natural texture that almost feels like

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.200 
natural texture that almost feels like
there's<00:01:26.980> no<00:01:27.160> product<00:01:27.580> in<00:01:27.730> the<00:01:27.820> hair<00:01:27.970> at<00:01:28.060> all

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
there's no product in the hair at all

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.420 
there's no product in the hair at all
it's<00:01:28.720> just<00:01:28.900> naturally<00:01:29.560> like<00:01:29.590> that<00:01:29.800> when<00:01:30.310> they

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
it's just naturally like that when they

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.400 
it's just naturally like that when they
wake<00:01:30.610> up<00:01:30.820> after<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.300> couple<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.600> days<00:01:31.750> of<00:01:31.960> having

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
wake up after a couple of days of having

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
wake up after a couple of days of having
it<00:01:32.620> shampooed

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
it shampooed

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.580 
it shampooed
so<00:01:33.760> we're<00:01:33.910> basically<00:01:34.060> adding<00:01:34.840> in<00:01:35.020> like<00:01:35.200> a

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
so we're basically adding in like a

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.230 
so we're basically adding in like a
detangling<00:01:36.280> spray<00:01:36.340> that's<00:01:36.760> got<00:01:36.910> a<00:01:36.940> little<00:01:37.030> bit

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
detangling spray that's got a little bit

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.790 
detangling spray that's got a little bit
of<00:01:37.300> oil<00:01:37.660> in<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.140> gives<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.440> hair<00:01:38.590> like<00:01:38.710> a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
of oil in so it gives the hair like a

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.820 
of oil in so it gives the hair like a
natural<00:01:39.280> Sheen<00:01:39.550> and<00:01:39.850> then<00:01:40.510> we're<00:01:40.750> just

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
natural Sheen and then we're just

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.900 
natural Sheen and then we're just
diffusing<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.860> hair<00:01:42.130> dry<00:01:42.430> with<00:01:42.760> like<00:01:42.880> a

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
diffusing the hair dry with like a

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.050 
diffusing the hair dry with like a
slightly<00:01:43.600> off-centre<00:01:44.350> side<00:01:44.620> parting<00:01:45.130> and

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
slightly off-centre side parting and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.610 
slightly off-centre side parting and
then<00:01:46.270> letting<00:01:46.450> their<00:01:46.690> natural<00:01:47.080> texture<00:01:47.440> come

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
then letting their natural texture come

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.960 
then letting their natural texture come
through<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.190> then<00:01:48.400> we're<00:01:48.520> going<00:01:48.760> through

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
through and then we're going through

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.700 
through and then we're going through
with<00:01:49.210> like<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.420> little<00:01:49.750> bit<00:01:49.840> of<00:01:49.930> texture<00:01:50.320> spray

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
with like a little bit of texture spray

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.980 
with like a little bit of texture spray
so<00:01:51.250> that<00:01:51.520> gives<00:01:51.760> it<00:01:51.910> like<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.090> slight<00:01:52.600> sort<00:01:52.900> of

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
so that gives it like a slight sort of

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.770 
so that gives it like a slight sort of
bit<00:01:53.500> of<00:01:53.620> a<00:01:53.710> matte<00:01:54.100> texture<00:01:54.610> mixed<00:01:55.390> in<00:01:55.509> with<00:01:55.630> the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
bit of a matte texture mixed in with the

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.270 
bit of a matte texture mixed in with the
