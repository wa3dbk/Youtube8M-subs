00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
so it's really cool I thought it was two

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.180 
so it's really cool I thought it was two
pieces<00:01:27.660> that<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> handle<00:01:28.470> attaches<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:28.980> the

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
pieces that the handle attaches to the

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.560 
pieces that the handle attaches to the
head<00:01:29.550> of<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.670> hammer<00:01:29.910> but<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.420> actually

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
head of the hammer but it is actually

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.460 
head of the hammer but it is actually
all<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.200> piece<00:01:31.470> um<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.930> it<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.110> looks

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
all one piece um and it just looks

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.800 
all one piece um and it just looks
really<00:01:34.860> nice<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:35.880> he<00:01:36.420> does<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
really nice right there he does have a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.590 
really nice right there he does have a
double<00:01:37.050> sided<00:01:37.410> face<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.340> Mary<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.450> this

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
double sided face so Mary I like this

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.120 
double sided face so Mary I like this
face<00:01:39.840> more<00:01:40.110> because<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.620> looks<00:01:40.860> more

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
face more because it looks more

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.760 
face more because it looks more
realistic<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:42.870> is<00:01:43.050> angry

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
realistic and then this one is angry

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
realistic and then this one is angry
face<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> storm<00:01:46.980> you<00:01:47.910> can<00:01:48.030> only<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.360> this

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
face so that storm you can only get this

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.050 
face so that storm you can only get this
guy<00:01:48.750> before<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.280> Hulk's<00:01:50.670> Helicarrier

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
guy before in the Hulk's Helicarrier

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.060 
guy before in the Hulk's Helicarrier
break<00:01:51.660> out<00:01:51.870> which<00:01:52.110> was<00:01:52.260> a<00:01:52.290> fifty-dollar<00:01:52.830> sent

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
break out which was a fifty-dollar sent

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.680 
break out which was a fifty-dollar sent
where<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.220> Quinjet<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:53.790> seventy<00:01:54.210> dollars<00:01:54.480> set

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
where the Quinjet a seventy dollars set

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.530 
where the Quinjet a seventy dollars set
so<00:01:55.320> he<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.890> rare<00:01:56.070> figure<00:01:56.430> until<00:01:56.580> this<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
so he was a rare figure until this and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.590 
so he was a rare figure until this and
then<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:57.870> we<00:01:57.900> have<00:01:58.020> some<00:01:58.350> rocks<00:01:59.330> ana<00:02:00.330> paula

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
then here we have some rocks ana paula

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.290 
then here we have some rocks ana paula
and<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.870> Cosmic<00:02:01.230> Cube<00:02:01.350> right<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.580> the

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
and the Cosmic Cube right here so the

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.610 
and the Cosmic Cube right here so the
this<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.840> basically<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.230> a<00:02:04.409> Play<00:02:04.590> feature

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
this is basically just a Play feature

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.509 
this is basically just a Play feature
and<00:02:05.600> basically<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.530> set<00:02:07.980> it<00:02:08.069> down<00:02:08.159> like<00:02:08.369> that

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
and basically you set it down like that

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.580 
and basically you set it down like that
and<00:02:08.849> then<00:02:09.060> Thor<00:02:09.330> would<00:02:09.479> come<00:02:09.690> by<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:09.869> then<00:02:10.170> hit

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
and then Thor would come by and then hit

it hit this black piece with his hammer

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
and that wouldn't turn launched the rock

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.309 
and that wouldn't turn launched the rock
that<00:02:17.610> way<00:02:17.790> I'll<00:02:18.269> show<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.629> again<00:02:18.780> cuz<00:02:19.230> I

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
that way I'll show you that again cuz I

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.380 
that way I'll show you that again cuz I
was<00:02:19.440> kind<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.680> bad<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.099> it's<00:02:20.819> actually<00:02:21.000> kind

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
was kind of bad but it's actually kind

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.830 
was kind of bad but it's actually kind
of<00:02:21.420> cool<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:24.090> isn't<00:02:24.420> really<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.689> main

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
of cool and this isn't really the main

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.020 
of cool and this isn't really the main
reason<00:02:25.170> why<00:02:25.260> you're<00:02:25.439> buying<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.769> set<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.030> it

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
reason why you're buying this set so it

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.550 
reason why you're buying this set so it
is<00:02:27.239> still<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> nice<00:02:27.780> feature<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.200> you'd<00:02:28.349> have

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
is still a nice feature so you'd have

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.110 
is still a nice feature so you'd have
the<00:02:28.680> Cosmic<00:02:29.040> Cube<00:02:29.189> right<00:02:29.370> here

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the Cosmic Cube right here

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.110 
the Cosmic Cube right here
then<00:02:30.269> you<00:02:30.680> swing<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.709> out<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.909> flying

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
then you swing that out I just flying

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.420 
then you swing that out I just flying
that<00:02:33.330> way<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.470> that's<00:02:34.799> pretty<00:02:35.040> cool<00:02:35.129> feature

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
that way so that's pretty cool feature

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.180 
that way so that's pretty cool feature
and<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.849> think<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.269> pretty<00:02:36.930> cool<00:02:37.200> I

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
and I think it's pretty cool I

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.800 
and I think it's pretty cool I
definitely<00:02:38.670> recommend<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.450> set<00:02:39.629> especially

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
definitely recommend this set especially

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.259 
definitely recommend this set especially
for<00:02:40.230> Thor<00:02:40.500> here<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.250> value<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.849> him<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.150> the

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
for Thor here the value of him on the

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.300 
for Thor here the value of him on the
brick<00:02:42.930> link<00:02:43.140> or<00:02:43.290> ebay<00:02:43.560> has<00:02:43.739> gone<00:02:44.040> down

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
brick link or ebay has gone down

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.070 
brick link or ebay has gone down
dramatically<00:02:45.060> since<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.540> set<00:02:45.750> came<00:02:45.930> out

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
dramatically since this set came out

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.809 
dramatically since this set came out
because<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:46.950> much<00:02:47.099> easier<00:02:47.129> way<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.579> get

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
because it's a much easier way to get

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.430 
because it's a much easier way to get
him<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.510> definitely<00:02:48.690> recommend<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.290> it's

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
him so I definitely recommend it it's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.380 
him so I definitely recommend it it's
actually<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:50.040> has<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.220> great<00:02:50.579> piece<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.180> your

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
actually it has a great piece to your

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.050 
actually it has a great piece to your
Avengers<00:02:51.900> collection<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:53.549> actually<00:02:53.700> need
