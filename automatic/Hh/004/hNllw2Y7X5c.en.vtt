and<00:01:42.829> we're<00:01:42.950> trying<00:01:43.189> to<00:01:43.280> go<00:01:44.560> forward<00:01:45.560> okay<00:01:46.520> so

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
and we're trying to go forward okay so

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.639 
and we're trying to go forward okay so
we<00:01:46.789> want<00:01:46.939> everything<00:01:47.240> going<00:01:47.749> forward<00:01:48.109> all

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
we want everything going forward all

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.130 
we want everything going forward all
right<00:01:48.859> first<00:01:49.549> 10<00:01:49.789> yards<00:01:50.179> of<00:01:50.390> your<00:01:50.929> sprint

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
right first 10 yards of your sprint

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.419 
right first 10 yards of your sprint
you're<00:01:51.229> going<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.409> have<00:01:51.499> about<00:01:51.619> roughly<00:01:52.100> five

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
you're going to have about roughly five

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.999 
you're going to have about roughly five
strides<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.079> goal<00:01:54.289> is<00:01:54.319> to<00:01:54.649> turn<00:01:54.799> those

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
strides so the goal is to turn those

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.770 
strides so the goal is to turn those
strides<00:01:55.340> over<00:01:55.520> as<00:01:55.759> fast<00:01:55.969> as<00:01:56.179> you<00:01:56.270> possibly<00:01:56.299> can

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
strides over as fast as you possibly can

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.209 
strides over as fast as you possibly can
you<00:01:57.200> don't<00:01:57.319> want<00:01:57.439> to<00:01:57.499> like<00:01:57.619> me<00:01:57.740> thats<00:01:57.890> try<00:01:58.069> it's

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
you don't want to like me thats try it's

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.590 
you don't want to like me thats try it's
too<00:01:58.369> much<00:01:58.549> because<00:01:58.700> then<00:01:58.999> what<00:01:59.119> happens<00:01:59.479> is

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
too much because then what happens is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.539 
too much because then what happens is
then<00:02:00.229> you're<00:02:00.350> in<00:02:00.439> flight<00:02:00.679> when<00:02:01.340> you're<00:02:01.460> in

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
then you're in flight when you're in

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.029 
then you're in flight when you're in
flight<00:02:01.759> what<00:02:01.909> happens<00:02:02.350> lose<00:02:03.350> power<00:02:03.619> lose

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
flight what happens lose power lose

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.249 
flight what happens lose power lose
speed<00:02:04.369> okay<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.539> goal<00:02:05.689> is<00:02:05.719> to<00:02:05.899> turn<00:02:06.109> them

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
speed okay so the goal is to turn them

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.080 
speed okay so the goal is to turn them
over<00:02:06.350> as<00:02:06.590> fast<00:02:06.740> as<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:06.950> can<00:02:07.189> driving<00:02:07.999> that

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
over as fast as you can driving that

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.059 
over as fast as you can driving that
right<00:02:08.300> knee<00:02:08.509> out<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.899> pulling<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.830> turf

right knee out and pulling the turf
underneath<00:02:10.520> of<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.729> call<00:02:10.940> those<00:02:11.030> power

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
underneath of you call those power

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.390 
underneath of you call those power

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
basic formula for speed guys is stride

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.520 
basic formula for speed guys is stride
like<00:02:17.519> I'm<00:02:17.909> stride<00:02:18.239> frequency<00:02:18.420> okay<00:02:19.290> we<00:02:19.439> were

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
like I'm stride frequency okay we were

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.630 
like I'm stride frequency okay we were
touching<00:02:19.709> on<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.069> little<00:02:20.189> bit<00:02:20.280> earlier

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
touching on that a little bit earlier

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.119 
touching on that a little bit earlier
now<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.049> lengthen<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.500> try<00:02:22.769> but<00:02:22.980> if<00:02:23.069> you

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
now you can lengthen this try but if you

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.380 
now you can lengthen this try but if you
lengthen<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.489> too<00:02:23.609> much<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:23.939> talked<00:02:24.150> about

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
lengthen it too much we talked about

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.839 
lengthen it too much we talked about
that<00:02:24.659> now<00:02:25.079> you're<00:02:25.319> actually<00:02:25.500> leaping<00:02:26.099> okay<00:02:26.609> or

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
that now you're actually leaping okay or

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.970 
that now you're actually leaping okay or
bounding<00:02:27.390> down<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.599> track<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.290> lose<00:02:28.500> you

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
bounding down the track so you lose you

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.270 
bounding down the track so you lose you
lose<00:02:29.010> power<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.120> speed<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.650> frequency<00:02:31.950> part

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
lose power and speed the frequency part

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.500 
lose power and speed the frequency part
of<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.579> can<00:02:32.670> turn<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:32.969> over<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.359> if<00:02:33.420> you

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
of it you can turn it over but if you

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.759 
of it you can turn it over but if you
turn<00:02:33.629> over<00:02:33.810> two<00:02:34.049> months<00:02:34.230> now<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:34.680> these

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
turn over two months now you have these

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.080 
turn over two months now you have these
short<00:02:35.010> little<00:02:35.040> Fred<00:02:35.370> Flintstone<00:02:35.790> strides

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
short little Fred Flintstone strides

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.849 
short little Fred Flintstone strides
okay<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:36.629> have<00:02:36.719> to<00:02:36.810> find<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:37.019> common<00:02:37.439> balance

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
okay so we have to find a common balance

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.759 
okay so we have to find a common balance
a<00:02:38.040> balance<00:02:38.579> between<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.180> two<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.719> great<00:02:40.590> thing

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
a balance between the two a great thing

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.069 
a balance between the two a great thing
about<00:02:40.889> the<00:02:41.069> spark<00:02:41.340> launcher<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.969> that<00:02:42.810> it

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
about the spark launcher is that it

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.379 
about the spark launcher is that it
helps<00:02:43.230> develop<00:02:43.739> power<00:02:43.950> out<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.819> 40<00:02:45.120> stance

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
helps develop power out of the 40 stance

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.099 
helps develop power out of the 40 stance
what's<00:02:46.200> even<00:02:46.500> more<00:02:46.530> critical<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.459> most

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
what's even more critical is that most

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.699 
what's even more critical is that most
most<00:02:49.109> resistance<00:02:49.739> based<00:02:50.220> sprinting<00:02:51.030> devices

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
most resistance based sprinting devices

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.559 
most resistance based sprinting devices
make<00:02:52.709> me<00:02:52.889> athlete<00:02:53.310> use<00:02:53.669> a<00:02:54.000> different<00:02:54.419> type<00:02:54.540> of

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
make me athlete use a different type of

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.390 
make me athlete use a different type of
mechanic<00:02:55.169> throughout<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.799> whole<00:02:56.010> sprint

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
mechanic throughout the whole sprint

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.920 
mechanic throughout the whole sprint
which<00:02:56.849> is<00:02:57.000> something<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.299> I've<00:02:57.810> always

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
which is something that I've always

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.780 
which is something that I've always
stayed<00:02:58.290> away<00:02:58.500> from<00:02:58.560> because<00:02:59.370> it's<00:02:59.549> not<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
stayed away from because it's not the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.129 
stayed away from because it's not the

print when you have it resistance based
if<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.209> think<00:03:03.419> of<00:03:03.540> most<00:03:03.719> towing<00:03:04.019> devices<00:03:04.769> the

if you think of most towing devices the

if you think of most towing devices the
athlete<00:03:05.700> has<00:03:05.849> to<00:03:06.030> lean<00:03:06.239> very<00:03:06.959> forward<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.650> dig

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889

through<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.579> sprint<00:03:09.349> those<00:03:10.349> are<00:03:10.500> not<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
through the sprint those are not the

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:11.750 
through the sprint those are not the
mechanics<00:03:11.189> that<00:03:11.219> the<00:03:11.370> athlete<00:03:11.669> would

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
mechanics that the athlete would

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.399 
mechanics that the athlete would
normally<00:03:12.090> be<00:03:12.180> doing<00:03:12.209> without<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.870> resistance

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409

great<00:03:14.189> thing<00:03:14.340> about<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.639> launcher<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.150> allows

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:15.719 
great thing about the launcher is allows

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.990 
great thing about the launcher is allows
the<00:03:15.900> athlete<00:03:16.169> to<00:03:16.260> work<00:03:16.409> on<00:03:16.560> power<00:03:16.799> but<00:03:17.430> then<00:03:17.609> be

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
the athlete to work on power but then be

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.089 
the athlete to work on power but then be
launched<00:03:18.450> into<00:03:18.629> their<00:03:18.870> own<00:03:19.019> mechanics<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:19.919> get

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
launched into their own mechanics so get

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.559 
launched into their own mechanics so get
back<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.489> national<00:03:20.849> mechanics<00:03:21.239> through

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
back to the national mechanics through

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.180 
back to the national mechanics through
the<00:03:21.659> rest<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:22.019> them<00:03:22.139> so<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:22.409> uses<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.769> best<00:03:23.040> of

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
the rest of them so it uses the best of

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.909 
the rest of them so it uses the best of
both<00:03:23.370> worlds<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.629> resistance<00:03:25.199> as<00:03:25.319> well<00:03:25.769> as

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
both worlds the resistance as well as

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.680 
both worlds the resistance as well as
their<00:03:26.099> own<00:03:26.250> speed<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:26.790> mechanics<00:03:27.239> as<00:03:27.419> you

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
their own speed and mechanics as you

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.939 
their own speed and mechanics as you
come<00:03:27.870> out<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:27.989> your<00:03:28.109> stance<00:03:28.379> you<00:03:28.560> have<00:03:28.769> no

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
come out of your stance you have no

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.339 
come out of your stance you have no
choice<00:03:29.310> but<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:29.970> drive<00:03:30.239> those<00:03:30.479> knees<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:31.049> an

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
choice but to drive those knees in an

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.740 
choice but to drive those knees in an
effort<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.680> propel<00:03:32.099> yourself<00:03:32.190> forward

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
effort to propel yourself forward

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.879 
effort to propel yourself forward
depending<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.989> person<00:03:34.349> using<00:03:34.739> will

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
depending on the person using will

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.770 
depending on the person using will
launch<00:03:35.040> on<00:03:35.189> the<00:03:35.340> skill<00:03:35.609> of<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.760> person<00:03:36.150> using

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
launch on the skill of the person using

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.449 
launch on the skill of the person using
the<00:03:36.810> launcher<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:37.709> actually<00:03:37.859> maximize

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
the launcher you can actually maximize

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.520 
the launcher you can actually maximize
that<00:03:38.879> so<00:03:39.419> there's<00:03:39.599> a<00:03:39.689> lot<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:39.870> resistance<00:03:40.260> at

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
that so there's a lot of resistance at

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.379 
that so there's a lot of resistance at
the<00:03:40.560> beginning<00:03:40.979> and<00:03:41.250> you're<00:03:41.430> slowly<00:03:41.819> taking

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
the beginning and you're slowly taking

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.240 
the beginning and you're slowly taking
away<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:42.840> resistance<00:03:43.379> to<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.889> point<00:03:44.099> where

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
away the resistance to the point where

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.500 
away the resistance to the point where
you're<00:03:44.370> actually<00:03:44.430> pulling<00:03:44.879> a<00:03:45.090> launcher

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
you're actually pulling a launcher

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.300 
you're actually pulling a launcher
getting<00:03:46.019> back<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.319> those<00:03:46.439> natural<00:03:46.620> mechanics

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
getting back to those natural mechanics

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.129 
getting back to those natural mechanics
but<00:03:47.729> if<00:03:47.819> you<00:03:47.939> see<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.299> athlete<00:03:48.689> driving<00:03:49.049> in

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
but if you see the athlete driving in

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.319 
but if you see the athlete driving in
that<00:03:49.229> first<00:03:49.500> 10<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.799> 15<00:03:50.159> yards<00:03:50.609> it's<00:03:51.120> very

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
that first 10 to 15 yards it's very

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.460 
that first 10 to 15 yards it's very
critical<00:03:51.540> not<00:03:51.900> only<00:03:51.930> their<00:03:52.259> knees<00:03:52.439> are

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
critical not only their knees are

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.319 
critical not only their knees are
driving<00:03:53.040> but<00:03:53.489> their<00:03:53.609> arms<00:03:53.879> are<00:03:53.909> driving<00:03:54.269> in

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
driving but their arms are driving in

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.420 
driving but their arms are driving in
sync<00:03:54.689> with<00:03:54.989> their<00:03:55.199> knees<00:03:55.439> which<00:03:55.979> is<00:03:56.129> another

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
sync with their knees which is another

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.580 
sync with their knees which is another
part<00:03:56.699> of<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.879> 40<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.449> lot<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.989> sprinters<00:03:58.319> don't

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
part of the 40 a lot of sprinters don't

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.249 
part of the 40 a lot of sprinters don't
take<00:03:58.829> very<00:03:59.069> seriously<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.659> arm<00:04:00.659> drive<00:04:00.989> is

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:01.259 
take very seriously the arm drive is

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:02.719 
take very seriously the arm drive is
just<00:04:01.590> as<00:04:01.680> important<00:04:02.129> as<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.340> knee<00:04:02.489> drive

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
just as important as the knee drive

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.849 
just as important as the knee drive
because<00:04:03.299> as<00:04:03.540> your<00:04:03.720> left<00:04:03.930> knee<00:04:04.109> moves<00:04:04.439> forward

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
because as your left knee moves forward

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.949 
because as your left knee moves forward
so<00:04:05.340> does<00:04:05.549> your<00:04:05.729> right<00:04:05.909> arm<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.389> vice<00:04:06.659> versa

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
so does your right arm and vice versa

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.289 
so does your right arm and vice versa
the<00:04:07.439> whole<00:04:07.680> way<00:04:07.799> down<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:08.129> track<00:04:08.299> ultimately

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
the whole way down the track ultimately

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.749 
the whole way down the track ultimately
making<00:04:09.509> this<00:04:09.689> device<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.290> very<00:04:10.680> great<00:04:11.189> piece<00:04:11.519> to

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:11.759 
making this device a very great piece to

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:21.490 
making this device a very great piece to
optimize<00:04:12.299> your<00:04:12.329> 40-yard<00:04:12.930> performance

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500
