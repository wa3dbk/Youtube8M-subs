when to use a straight cymbal stand
versus<00:00:17.449> a<00:00:17.480> boom<00:00:17.779> cymbal<00:00:18.199> stand<00:00:18.410> what<00:00:19.070> the

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
versus a boom cymbal stand what the

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.999 
versus a boom cymbal stand what the
basic<00:00:19.669> difference<00:00:20.029> is<00:00:20.179> between<00:00:20.359> the<00:00:20.689> two<00:00:21.009> this

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.009 
basic difference is between the two this

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.980 
basic difference is between the two this
little<00:00:22.460> extension<00:00:22.880> rod<00:00:23.330> here<00:00:23.509> that<00:00:23.660> you<00:00:23.749> see

coming<00:00:24.259> off<00:00:24.410> of<00:00:24.470> this<00:00:24.769> stand<00:00:25.189> is<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.939> boom

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
coming off of this stand is the boom

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.359 
coming off of this stand is the boom
part<00:00:26.630> of<00:00:26.839> the<00:00:26.960> cymbal<00:00:27.259> stand<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.009> this<00:00:28.159> here

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
part of the cymbal stand so this here

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.189 
part of the cymbal stand so this here
would<00:00:28.460> be<00:00:28.519> your<00:00:28.820> your<00:00:29.029> boom<00:00:29.329> cymbal<00:00:29.720> stand<00:00:29.929> and

would be your your boom cymbal stand and
if<00:00:30.589> you<00:00:30.679> look<00:00:30.829> over<00:00:30.949> here<00:00:31.070> this<00:00:31.310> crash<00:00:31.609> cymbal

the way it's mounted you can see there's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.710 
the way it's mounted you can see there's
just<00:00:33.800> a<00:00:33.890> straight<00:00:34.340> part<00:00:34.850> it<00:00:35.090> just<00:00:35.240> goes<00:00:35.390> up<00:00:35.540> and

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
just a straight part it just goes up and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.570 
just a straight part it just goes up and
down<00:00:35.750> this<00:00:36.500> would<00:00:36.710> be<00:00:36.830> kind<00:00:37.100> of<00:00:37.130> your<00:00:37.310> normal

this is only acceptable to use a
straight<00:00:43.460> stand<00:00:43.730> when<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.060> know<00:00:44.240> that<00:00:44.690> your

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
straight stand when you know that your

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.360 
straight stand when you know that your
the<00:00:45.170> rest<00:00:45.380> of<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.620> base<00:00:45.770> of<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.040> stand<00:00:46.220> is

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
the rest of the base of the stand is

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.910 
the rest of the base of the stand is
exactly<00:00:46.910> where<00:00:47.240> you<00:00:47.360> want<00:00:47.630> it<00:00:47.720> to<00:00:47.870> be<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.320> so

the cymbal in other words doesn't have a
lot<00:00:50.900> of<00:00:51.100> variables<00:00:52.100> with<00:00:52.340> where<00:00:52.520> you<00:00:52.640> can<00:00:52.790> move

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
lot of variables with where you can move

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.640 
lot of variables with where you can move
it<00:00:53.090> can<00:00:53.420> just<00:00:53.540> be<00:00:53.600> raised<00:00:53.900> up<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.470> down

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
it can just be raised up and down

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.640 
it can just be raised up and down
lowered<00:00:55.490> and<00:00:55.670> hired<00:00:55.880> okay<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:56.930> this<00:00:57.140> is<00:00:57.290> a<00:00:57.320> boom

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
with the ability to rotate it like this

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.910 
with the ability to rotate it like this
or<00:01:24.039> to<00:01:25.039> angle<00:01:25.399> the<00:01:25.579> actual<00:01:26.770> placement<00:01:27.770> of<00:01:27.829> the

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
symbol itself you can see that pretty

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.550 
symbol itself you can see that pretty
much<00:01:31.210> there's<00:01:32.210> no<00:01:32.420> limitation<00:01:33.049> on<00:01:33.170> where<00:01:33.439> you

want to place the symbol so I recommend
boom<00:01:36.020> stands<00:01:36.530> there<00:01:37.219> great<00:01:37.549> however<00:01:38.179> if<00:01:38.929> you

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
boom stands there great however if you

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:40.629 
boom stands there great however if you
know<00:01:39.229> exactly<00:01:39.679> where<00:01:39.829> you<00:01:39.920> want<00:01:40.069> to<00:01:40.159> put<00:01:40.310> your

know exactly where you want to put your

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:42.309 
know exactly where you want to put your
cymbal<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:41.630> know<00:01:41.719> it's<00:01:41.840> gonna<00:01:41.960> work<00:01:42.170> with

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
cymbal and you know it's gonna work with

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.020 
cymbal and you know it's gonna work with
a<00:01:42.350> straight<00:01:42.619> stand<00:01:42.859> they're<00:01:43.340> more<00:01:43.579> affordable

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
a straight stand they're more affordable

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.399 
a straight stand they're more affordable
so<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.359> can<00:01:44.509> be<00:01:44.539> a<00:01:44.659> good<00:01:44.810> option<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:45.200> have<00:01:45.289> a
