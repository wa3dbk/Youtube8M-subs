qualms and cool friend today for the
most<00:00:18.330> part<00:00:18.539> I've<00:00:19.050> kind<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.760> gravitated

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
most part I've kind of gravitated

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.150 
most part I've kind of gravitated
towards<00:00:21.150> park<00:00:21.510> riding<00:00:21.779> but<00:00:22.199> um<00:00:22.439> where<00:00:23.130> I

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
towards park riding but um where I

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.550 
towards park riding but um where I
started<00:00:23.490> out<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:23.789> dirt<00:00:24.180> definitely<00:00:24.990> racing

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
started out with dirt definitely racing

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560 
started out with dirt definitely racing
entrails<00:00:25.890> was<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.430> big<00:00:26.789> part<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.150> me<00:00:27.300> starting

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
entrails was a big part of me starting

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.600 
entrails was a big part of me starting
in<00:00:27.779> BMX<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.640> just<00:00:29.720> think<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.130> gravitate<00:00:32.130> towards

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
in BMX I just think I gravitate towards

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.970 
in BMX I just think I gravitate towards
park<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.059> there<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.600> much<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.559> like

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
park is there so much to do with like

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.220 
park is there so much to do with like
then<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.640> could<00:00:35.760> have<00:00:35.850> two<00:00:36.059> guys<00:00:36.270> ride<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
then you could have two guys ride the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.410 
then you could have two guys ride the
same<00:00:37.440> park<00:00:37.739> completely<00:00:38.340> different<00:00:38.760> it's

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
same park completely different it's

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.030 
same park completely different it's
basically<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.140> an<00:00:40.290> art<00:00:40.500> form<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.950> way

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
basically like an art form the way

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.369 
basically like an art form the way
people<00:00:41.190> fine<00:00:41.489> lines<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.000> parks<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:43.230> got

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
people fine lines and parks and you got

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.119 
people fine lines and parks and you got
a<00:00:43.410> good<00:00:43.590> park<00:00:43.910> nothing's<00:00:44.910> better<00:00:45.120> than<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.450> I

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
a good park nothing's better than that I

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.130 
a good park nothing's better than that I
have<00:00:47.129> fun<00:00:47.370> riding<00:00:47.579> contest<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.360> when<00:00:49.020> it

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
have fun riding contest but when it

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.510 
have fun riding contest but when it
comes<00:00:49.379> down<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.039> don't<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.250> there's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
comes down to it I don't think there's

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.400 
comes down to it I don't think there's
anything<00:00:50.760> better<00:00:51.000> than<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:52.079> having<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
anything better than just having a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.380 
anything better than just having a
couple<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.800> friends<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.789> at<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> park

high school till junior when he quit and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.910 
high school till junior when he quit and
I<00:02:10.000> just<00:02:10.420> kept<00:02:10.840> pushing<00:02:11.049> it<00:02:11.290> just<00:02:11.560> had<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:11.799> much

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
I just kept pushing it just had so much

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.770 
I just kept pushing it just had so much
fun<00:02:12.099> with<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.580> loved<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.209> so<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.450> could<00:02:13.540> get

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
fun with it I loved it so I could get

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.380 
fun with it I loved it so I could get
away<00:02:13.959> from<00:02:14.019> it<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.470> think<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.430> trail<00:02:16.120> riding

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
away from it I think that trail riding

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.470 
away from it I think that trail riding
has<00:02:16.980> definitely<00:02:17.980> been<00:02:18.549> influenced<00:02:19.060> by<00:02:19.090> park

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
has definitely been influenced by park

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.710 
has definitely been influenced by park
and<00:02:19.750> influence<00:02:20.620> park<00:02:20.890> because<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:22.330> look<00:02:22.540> at

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and influence park because you look at

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.449 
and influence park because you look at
some<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.230> trails<00:02:23.560> now<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.190> there's

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
some of the trails now and there's

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.600 
some of the trails now and there's
spines<00:02:25.360> wall<00:02:26.319> rides<00:02:26.620> all<00:02:27.010> kinds<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.400> stuff

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
spines wall rides all kinds of stuff

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.069 
spines wall rides all kinds of stuff
that<00:02:27.849> you<00:02:28.120> never<00:02:28.360> thought<00:02:28.660> you'd<00:02:28.870> see<00:02:28.900> in

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
that you never thought you'd see in
