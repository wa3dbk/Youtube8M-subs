00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:07.779
I am going to talk about Nadi Astrology.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:20.530
Nadi Astrology is a special type of Vedic
Astrology, it’s not of human origin.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:31.859
Some sages, divinely inspired, and who gathered
special insight to know about the future of

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.350
certain Souls, put this astrology together.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.219
How does it work?

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:56.379
You just go to this astrologer who has a bunch
of palm leaves, thousands of years old.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.700
You don’t tell him anything.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.950
If you are a male, he looks at your right
thumb.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:12.830
Or if you are female, he looks at your left
thumb.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:28.049
Based on the imprints he goes inside his library
and brings several bundles of leaves, and

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.950
he keeps on asking questions, saying, “Are
you John?

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.280
Are you Peter? are you Linda?

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.280
Is this your father’s name?

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.009
Is this your mother’s name?”

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:58.069
It takes, the process takes half-hour sometimes
even fifteen minutes, sometimes even one hour.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:08.680
Then he will find a [Nadi] Leaf which all
the details correspond about you like, your

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.810
father’s name, mother’s name, wife’s
name, number of siblings, the job you are

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.870
doing — all these things are there.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.390
Then you will say, “Yes” to him.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.129
How did this person know all the details about
you?

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.700
And he doesn’t even say anything.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.530
He is simply reading from the Palm Leaf.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:43.650
If you can read Tamil in which the palm leaves
are written, he will even show it to you.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.370
“Look can you read it”?

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.720
Then you can see your name written, your father’s
name written and your mother’s name written.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:09.069
So Nadi Astrology proves that there is reincarnation
but whatever happens has been predestined.

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:17.790
The most beautiful thing about Nadi Astrology
is it tells you why you have difficulty in

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.640
your, with your finances.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:31.730
What did you do in your previous life to deserve
a bad finance, or what did you do bad to have

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:40.150
a bad relationship, or what did you do to
deserve this good life.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:51.420
Not only that it tells you how you can change
your destiny, by during certain remedies,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.749
by visiting certain temple vortexes which
can clean up your energy and then give you

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:01.709
a new life.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:10.299
If you go to the Google dot com, [search]
check under the Nadi Astrology, NADI Astrology.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:21.489
The Discovery Channel from time to time has
interviewed these Nadi Astrologers.

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:31.030
For the past 25 years I have seen them doing
interviews on them.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:44.110
So this is a proven science, and I have also
someone in my Ashram in India who does this

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.700
Nadi Astrology.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:54.220
This is a very, very special form of Astrology
that is of Divine origin.
