00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.309
 know now what to watch in the sky this 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 week the naked eye 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.050
 in the early evening Jupiter shines 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.539
 north in the constellation of twins 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.800
 it is visible until one-thirty 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.589
 dawn at 9 o'clock in the east 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.769
 planet mars in the constellation of virgin 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.739
 a little later at 22 and 30 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.840
 saturn in the pound constellation of 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.390
 dawn to the Venus planet can be 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.540
 seen from the east from 3 am on 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.970
 constellation of Sagittarius and before 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.730
 sunrise the planet mercury can be 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.700
 observed near the eastern horizon in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.330
 constellation of aquarium from 4 and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.330
 mail 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.390
 the year 1969 became famous for the four 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.180
 first astronauts to step on the moon but 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.159
 the ambitious apollo program planned 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.740
 eight more manned missions 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.920
 during the early years of the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.509
 1970 that began with some of the moments 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.360
 more dramatic 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.330
 the apollo 13 mission took off on 11 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.080
 April 1970 with three astronauts at 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.470
 board 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.929
 james lovell fred haise and a sievert 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.570
 mission's target was the region of 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.509
 framingham auro full of mountains and 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.619
 material ejected during the formation of 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.649
 rainy sea 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.560
 launch injection in the orbit translar 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.140
 occurred as planned but after 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.720
 56 hours of flying during a reading 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.020
 of tank levels. 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.869
 hydrogen and oxygen something happened one 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.360
 loud noise was followed by variations 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.369
 electrical power and the drive 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.800
 engine automatic 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.989
 the astronauts initially thought that the 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.830
 ship had collided with a small 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.170
 asteroid 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.440
 but what really happened was a 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.900
 explosion in one of the oxygen tanks in the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.920
 service module caused by a short 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.890
 circuit 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.440
 the explosion compromised the entire stock of 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.700
 module oxygen and the operation of the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.700
 fuel cells 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.890
 the astronauts to more than 320 thousand 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.069
 kilometers of land 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.930
 they needed to make a drastic decision 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.930
 completely evacuate a 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.540
 command and take refuge in the uncomfortable 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.310
 lunar module a situation that already had 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.920
 been trained the lunar landing was 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.840
 canceled and the only concern was 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.300
 back home safe 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.010
 on earth the scientists calculated the 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.110
 possibilities of return 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.780
 the command in rivers tone preferred a 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.660
 longer and more time-consuming but more 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.120
 sure that he used the gravity of the moon to 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.370
 to help in the trajectory two maneuvers of 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.909
 course correction were performed with 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.099
 perfection by placing apollo 13 on the way 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.989
 of salvation 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.980
 all efforts will focus on 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.129
 minimize 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.810
 the consumption of energy water and oxygen 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.690
 communications with the earth were 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.569
 cut to just the essentials and 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.909
 reduced onboard temperature to 4 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.959
 degrees celsius to keep the air 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.090
 breathable 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.030
 the astronauts had to improvise a 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.610
 adapter to use the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.280
 carbon dioxide from the control module in the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.950
 lunar module in the final stage of the trip to 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.340
 crew returned to the command module 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.379
 for re-entry for long six 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.799
 minutes could not be communicated 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.170
 with the astronauts for the seizure of 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.359
 millions of people who accompanied the 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.579
 tv drama 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.560
 fortunately the entry was successful and 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.660
 the astronauts landed on the ocean 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.160
 pacific without complications 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.859
 closing one of the most 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.680
 of the man's adventure in the 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.250
 space until next week and their 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.250
 books to all
