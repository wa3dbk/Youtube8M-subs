00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:02.353
Here we go, guys!

00:00:02.353 --> 00:00:03.793
Come on, Janis! Come on!

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.040
Put it in! 

00:00:05.307 --> 00:00:07.307
They're under pressure! They're under pressure! 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.220
Cleared off the line!

00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:28.631
We're really strong and we shouldn't have any problems with our opponents at the back.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.540
We've got a lot of pace in our team and that's to our advantage.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.700
And we've already scouted the other team - we're clearly the better side!

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.820
That's on the money! That's on the money! 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.646
That's super, that's super! 

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:45.397
What? He saved it?

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.960
Yes, I've chosen a lot of legends, because they're players I don't have in my regular Ultimate Team.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.740
And yeah I just wanted to see what they're all about.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.960
Time, time, time!

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.180
That's how you do it!

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.120
If I take a look at our opponents, I don't see anything much which could pose us a threat.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.280
I think everybody will see, that we're the two Nationalmannschaft players - simple as that!

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.960
Yeeeeeaaahahahaha! There's the goal! 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.620
Yes, we've tweaked our line-up. Now, we've got Manuel Neuer in goal, he's simply the best keeper in the world!

00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:28.034
So far they're just talking a big game, but we'll see if they've got anything to back it up!

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.900
We've got enough quality to win! 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.960
Neuer is up front, Neuer is up front! 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.280
Why is he up front? 

00:01:37.574 --> 00:01:39.574
Finaaaaaal! Heheheeee!

00:01:39.574 --> 00:01:40.894
Congratulations!

00:01:50.232 --> 00:01:52.232
Yeeees! There it is!

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.700
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot! 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.980
What a goal!

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.260
Yeeeeeeeees! 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.101
How did that go in, eh?

00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:28.741
What's going on there? 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.060
3-0 - come on, pull the plug! 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.680
Yes man, that's how you do it. Now we're going, now we're going - Pele!

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.920
Bring it!

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.980
Yeeeees! The perfect response! 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.940
Haha, right before half time! What's wrong Juli - Juli! 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.540
Yeeeaahh! Thank you! Thanks a lot! Thanks for coming! 

00:03:02.403 --> 00:03:05.260
You have to admit that the final was put to bed early! 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.120
We got stuck into them quickly, and didn't have to deal with too much. 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.960
We have to say we were a bit disappointed with Kruse / Kramer in the final.
