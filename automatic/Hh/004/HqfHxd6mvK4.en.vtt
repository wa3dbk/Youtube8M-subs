00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
I discovered this the not so fun way

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.200 
I discovered this the not so fun way
this<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:26.899> a<00:01:26.930> downloadable<00:01:27.649> ps2<00:01:28.430> title<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.119> it

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
this is a downloadable ps2 title and it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.260 
this is a downloadable ps2 title and it
has<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.479> virtual<00:01:30.170> memory<00:01:30.380> card<00:01:30.799> tied<00:01:31.250> toy<00:01:31.610> that

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
has a virtual memory card tied toy that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.600 
has a virtual memory card tied toy that
you<00:01:32.450> can't<00:01:32.810> access<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.680> I<00:01:34.009> played<00:01:34.460> about

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
you can't access it I played about

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.920 
you can't access it I played about
halfway<00:01:34.970> through<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.390> game<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.600> then<00:01:35.840> I

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
halfway through the game and then I

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.330 
halfway through the game and then I
decided<00:01:36.289> to<00:01:36.470> try<00:01:36.710> one<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.159> other

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
decided to try one of the other

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.850 
decided to try one of the other
characters<00:01:37.939> gonna<00:01:38.210> save<00:01:38.539> over<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:39.170> so<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.649> can

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
characters gonna save over it so you can

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.670 
characters gonna save over it so you can
only<00:01:40.070> have<00:01:40.280> like<00:01:40.460> one<00:01:40.759> save<00:01:41.119> slot<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:42.470> do

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
only have like one save slot and I do

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.809 
only have like one save slot and I do
have<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.130> backwards<00:01:43.580> compatible<00:01:44.060> ps3<00:01:44.300> so<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:45.530> was

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
have a backwards compatible ps3 so I was

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.609 
have a backwards compatible ps3 so I was
hoping<00:01:46.819> that<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.119> could<00:01:47.240> just<00:01:47.569> juggle<00:01:48.170> virtual

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
hoping that I could just juggle virtual

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.950 
hoping that I could just juggle virtual
memory<00:01:48.830> cards<00:01:49.340> but<00:01:49.970> that<00:01:50.330> wasn't<00:01:50.690> an<00:01:50.780> option

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
memory cards but that wasn't an option

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.499 
memory cards but that wasn't an option
either<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:51.560> was<00:01:51.710> kind<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.399> sucky<00:01:52.789> so<00:01:53.119> my

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
either and I was kind of sucky so my

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.139 
either and I was kind of sucky so my
advice<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.170> play<00:01:54.890> through<00:01:55.280> as<00:01:55.520> beyond

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
advice to you is play through as beyond

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.969 
advice to you is play through as beyond
the<00:01:56.299> grave<00:01:56.539> and<00:01:56.929> then<00:01:57.140> play<00:01:57.409> if<00:01:57.470> there<00:01:57.709> is<00:01:57.799> the

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
the grave and then play if there is the

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.889 
the grave and then play if there is the
other<00:01:58.130> two<00:01:58.399> characters<00:01:58.850> now<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.360> other<00:01:59.600> two

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
other two characters now the other two

I<00:03:20.790> imagine<00:03:21.569> that<00:03:21.599> when<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:22.440> was<00:03:22.590> ported<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.220> the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
I imagine that when it was ported to the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.000 
I imagine that when it was ported to the
PSN<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.599> it<00:03:24.690> was<00:03:24.780> catched<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.590> look<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.860> little

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
PSN that it was catched to look a little

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.970 
PSN that it was catched to look a little
bit<00:03:26.280> nicer<00:03:27.120> on<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.659> ps3<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.680> was<00:03:28.950> very

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
bit nicer on the ps3 so I was very

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.339 
bit nicer on the ps3 so I was very
pleased<00:03:29.700> with<00:03:29.909> that<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.629> took<00:03:30.780> me<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.959> minute<00:03:31.170> to

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
pleased with that it took me a minute to

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.020 
pleased with that it took me a minute to
get<00:03:31.590> used<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.220> camera<00:03:32.610> controls

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
get used to the camera controls

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.910 
get used to the camera controls
basically<00:03:33.540> it's<00:03:33.750> just<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:34.019> chase<00:03:34.290> camera<00:03:34.739> the

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
basically it's just a chase camera the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.649 
basically it's just a chase camera the
right<00:03:35.190> analog<00:03:35.459> stick<00:03:35.640> does<00:03:36.239> allow<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.569> to

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
right analog stick does allow you to

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.440 
right analog stick does allow you to
move<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.930> camera<00:03:37.019> applied<00:03:37.620> just<00:03:38.430> don't<00:03:38.730> screw

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
move the camera applied just don't screw

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.470 
move the camera applied just don't screw
again<00:03:39.629> I<00:03:40.049> try<00:03:40.409> to<00:03:40.470> keep<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.519> action<00:03:42.030> on-screen

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
again I try to keep the action on-screen

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.960 
again I try to keep the action on-screen
with<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.349> right<00:03:43.530> analog<00:03:43.860> stick<00:03:44.159> and<00:03:44.819> that

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
with the right analog stick and that

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.619 
with the right analog stick and that
just<00:03:45.209> it's<00:03:45.959> not<00:03:46.200> happening<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:47.610> what<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.360> stop

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
just it's not happening so what you stop

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.839 
just it's not happening so what you stop
moving<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.170> camera<00:03:49.440> centers<00:03:50.099> and<00:03:50.400> you'll<00:03:50.730> be

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
moving the camera centers and you'll be

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.490 
moving the camera centers and you'll be
fine<00:03:51.120> that's<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.629> only<00:03:51.750> thing<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.200> really

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
fine that's the only thing that really

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.369 
fine that's the only thing that really
gave<00:03:53.040> me<00:03:53.310> an<00:03:53.430> issue<00:03:53.730> when<00:03:54.420> I<00:03:54.450> first<00:03:54.870> picked<00:03:55.200> it

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
gave me an issue when I first picked it

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.559 
gave me an issue when I first picked it
up<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.709> made<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.190> feel<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.640> touch<00:03:56.940> dated

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
up it made it feel just a touch dated

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.860 
up it made it feel just a touch dated
but<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:57.900> really<00:03:58.440> not<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.650> problem<00:03:58.769> the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
but it's really not a problem the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.729 
but it's really not a problem the
graphical<00:04:00.870> style<00:04:01.349> is<00:04:02.450> not<00:04:03.450> quite<00:04:03.840> cel<00:04:04.170> shaded
