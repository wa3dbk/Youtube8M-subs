well<00:00:02.840> we're<00:00:03.840> just<00:00:03.870> learning<00:00:04.470> we're<00:00:05.069> just

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
well we're just learning we're just

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.270 
well we're just learning we're just
learning<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.790> Tegra<00:00:06.540> 2<00:00:06.859> was<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.980> world's

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
learning and Tegra 2 was the world's

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
was the world's first quad-core and we

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.200 
was the world's first quad-core and we
invented<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.280> idea<00:00:14.519> called<00:00:15.059> an

invented this idea called an

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.429 
invented this idea called an

energy-saving core the observation was G
CPUs<00:00:20.160> were<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.580> abundant<00:00:20.880> why<00:00:21.330> don't<00:00:21.570> we

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
CPUs were so abundant why don't we

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.540 
CPUs were so abundant why don't we
create<00:00:21.960> four<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.279> are<00:00:23.340> for

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
create four that are for

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.910 
create four that are for
high-performance<00:00:23.730> but<00:00:24.480> create<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.500> is

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
high-performance but create one that is

going to use this type of architecture
we<00:00:35.399> invented<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.630> have<00:00:36.809> very

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
we invented it so that you can have very

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.260 
we invented it so that you can have very
little<00:00:37.680> power<00:00:37.800> when<00:00:38.100> you're<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.579> using<00:00:39.090> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
little power when you're just using it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450

and<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.869> introduced<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> second<00:01:19.770> idea<00:01:20.390> called

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and we introduced the second idea called

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.950 
and we introduced the second idea called

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
effects like for example you you don't

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.569 
effects like for example you you don't
have<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> take<00:01:42.540> two<00:01:42.750> shots<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.290> create<00:01:43.530> HDR<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
have to take two shots to create HDR you

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.149 
have to take two shots to create HDR you
create<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.329> instantaneous<00:01:46.259> shot<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.890> create

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
create one instantaneous shot to create

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.060 
create one instantaneous shot to create
HDR<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:48.630> example<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.170> could<00:01:49.290> track<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:49.770> face

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070

they<00:01:50.970> contract<00:01:51.450> an<00:01:51.600> object<00:01:52.049> while<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:53.009> object

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
they contract an object while the object

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.480 
they contract an object while the object
is<00:01:53.790> still<00:01:54.000> moving<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.950> ever<00:01:56.100> try<00:01:56.430> to

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
is still moving so if you ever try to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.719 
is still moving so if you ever try to
take<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> picture<00:01:56.969> of

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
of a kid you're constantly refocusing

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.859

now<00:02:02.469> you<00:02:02.530> don't<00:02:02.770> have<00:02:02.829> to<00:02:02.950> do<00:02:03.070> that<00:02:03.219> you<00:02:03.789> simply

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
now you don't have to do that you simply

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.580 
now you don't have to do that you simply
touch<00:02:04.869> it<00:02:05.640> tracks<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.969> now<00:02:07.600> as<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.200> object

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.040 
touch it tracks and now as the object

that is made possible by our

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.580 
that is made possible by our
computational<00:02:20.440> camera<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.110> question<00:02:23.470> is

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
what do you do next

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.080 
what do you do next
you've<00:02:25.840> done<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.380> much<00:02:26.560> what<00:02:27.190> do<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.340> do<00:02:27.519> next

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
you've done so much what do you do next

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.110

not having to push for just frequency we

happened back in
days<00:05:49.749> when<00:05:50.529> the<00:05:50.830> PC<00:05:51.159> industry<00:05:51.309> came<00:05:51.819> along<00:05:52.089> the

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:52.839 
days when the PC industry came along the

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.659 
days when the PC industry came along the
rate<00:05:53.169> of<00:05:53.379> innovation<00:05:53.559> in<00:05:54.039> the<00:05:54.069> beginning<00:05:54.520> was

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
rate of innovation in the beginning was

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.209

and<00:06:34.599> so<00:06:35.259> so<00:06:35.680> the<00:06:35.979> guys<00:06:36.189> went<00:06:36.520> off<00:06:36.699> and<00:06:36.819> they

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
and so so the guys went off and they

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:38.129 
and so so the guys went off and they
said<00:06:37.089> you<00:06:37.180> know<00:06:37.300> Jenson<00:06:37.749> you<00:06:37.809> want<00:06:37.930> to<00:06:38.020> see

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
said you know Jenson you want to see
