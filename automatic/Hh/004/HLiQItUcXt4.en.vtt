00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.879
 Dr 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.519
 Dr 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.749
 more 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.800
 São Paulo we want these viewers today 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.989
 make something completely different again and that 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.499
 authenticity 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.649
 this is Altona's machining program 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.609
 I'd like to make stereo recordings, so I'd like to say that 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.539
 Stereo recordings because here I am mostly mono microphone they become a whole 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:37.920
 simple mono 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.510
 Microphone that naturally only records one track 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.630
 but with cars we can do that now 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.479
 Semih 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.970
 stereo recordings 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.190
 I want to show you how it works 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.210
 we cite the following Paul 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.210
 take up a text 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.139
 this is my dear friends the tests 

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:59.129
 the referee had 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.010
 here lives still euro rather should 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.030
 we will become 2 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.270
 Minute 0 2 0 2 7 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.330
 a right one 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.440
 mix this water 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.440
 that's our trump card 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.330
 Doing this soundtrack first episode would have to be first mistry fast way 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
 let's say four mark those with control 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.080
 we protest those with control CG 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.240
 we set a new trail Rheine 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.320
 a new monochrome 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.670
 and add 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.270
 the same song again 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.430
 if we play that sitting we still hear no stereo effect 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.430
 that my dear friends will become a text 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.070
 you just have to belong 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.890
 the mono tone on the left and on the right lane 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.790
 Now we are working with a little trick 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.120
 on Dr 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.130
 a soundtrack 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.450
 which we want to listen to Monuments for now, namely worth a visit 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.730
 determine 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.800
 Also, I wish you the right or left 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.810
 that my dear friends will 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.050
 that my dear friends i listen to 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.529
 on both sides 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.529
 I say you are my right lane now 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.409
 and you down there 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.769
 one the left lane 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.589
 important here is that there 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:27.260
 in the settings, the panorama setting for both channels 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.029
 from the percentage 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.659
 Number equals 4 50% left 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.589
 and here 50% right 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.589
 we've already achieved something with that 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.759
 a small 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.619
 Mono no small place over effect 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:46.579
 we play Skat again 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.959
 that my dear friends will 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.859
 many have not made it yet but now very exciting 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.529
 how zoom in now 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.309
 Neckline deep 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.309
 Beijing a bit bigger 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.999
 and will be here now 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:06.329
 with the 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.389
 two so noticed Lück with the move tool 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.439
 this track 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.680
 for a very small value 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.519
 move to the right 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.519
 «We have to enlarge again 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.099
 namely at about zero 1 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.999
 and now we feel it again 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.630
 this is my dear friends of the text 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.189
 "The mirror" 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.189
 one euro is to be played off 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.229
 Sounds quite reasonable 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.629
 They say now that fits again 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.329
 that my dear friends will be text 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.909
 "The mirror" 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.339
 one euro is to be played off 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:54.649
 is enough for us 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:56.419
 Thank you very much 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.659
 we're cutting the rest way 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.639
 I promised myself anyway 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.439
 and now we can do the whole story 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.439
 to merge these tracks 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:11.309
 we can track and merge 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:14.309
 now have a stereo track that sounds like that 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:19.379
 Moment MZ sda forward 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:22.010
 that my dear friends will be text 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.580
 "The mirror" 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.129
 is a euro from being played is 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:27.699
 to paint 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.490
 Title of constant 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.249
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.099
 now could save the file and use it for other things 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.099
 So see you next time maybe again 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:45.129
