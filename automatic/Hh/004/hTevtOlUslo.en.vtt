point defense on this Cruiser and did a
critical<00:01:40.560> hit<00:01:40.650> basically<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> had<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
critical hit basically so you had to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.389 
critical hit basically so you had to
damage<00:01:42.119> there<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.649> end<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.130> round

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
damage there so this is the end of round

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.090

damage luckily his shields were able to
reduce<00:03:33.799> it<00:03:33.919> from<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.099> critical<00:03:34.489> which<00:03:34.639> would

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
reduce it from a critical which would

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.300 
reduce it from a critical which would
have<00:03:35.000> killed<00:03:35.209> him<00:03:35.359> to<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.290> regular<00:03:36.769> which<00:03:37.010> did

have killed him to a regular which did

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.179 
have killed him to a regular which did
not<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.930> battleship<00:03:39.349> then<00:03:39.500> activated<00:03:39.919> and

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
not the battleship then activated and

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.759 
not the battleship then activated and
his<00:03:40.879> fire<00:03:41.180> raged<00:03:41.569> on<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.139> kill<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.409> crew<00:03:42.650> in

damage<00:03:44.540> out<00:03:44.720> of<00:03:44.810> eight<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.919> battleship

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
damage out of eight so the battleship

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.740 
damage out of eight so the battleship
commander<00:03:46.669> decided<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.150> best<00:03:47.180> thing<00:03:47.449> to<00:03:47.569> do

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
commander decided the best thing to do

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.420 
commander decided the best thing to do
in<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.019> situation<00:03:48.319> is<00:03:48.739> a<00:03:48.769> tactical

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
in this situation is a tactical

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.490 
in this situation is a tactical
withdrawal<00:03:49.669> so<00:03:50.329> he<00:03:50.449> put<00:03:50.689> a<00:03:50.720> shunt<00:03:50.989> token<00:03:51.379> on

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
withdrawal so he put a shunt token on

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.550 
withdrawal so he put a shunt token on
him<00:03:51.620> so<00:03:52.519> that<00:03:52.549> he<00:03:52.879> will<00:03:52.970> basically<00:03:53.689> hyperspace

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
him so that he will basically hyperspace

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.640 
him so that he will basically hyperspace
away<00:03:54.859> next<00:03:55.250> turn<00:03:55.609> if<00:03:56.150> he<00:03:57.079> gets<00:03:57.229> to<00:03:57.319> activate

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
away next turn if he gets to activate

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.920 
away next turn if he gets to activate
before<00:03:57.919> me<00:03:58.129> and<00:03:58.370> that<00:03:59.359> will<00:03:59.509> only<00:03:59.659> give<00:03:59.900> me

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
before me and that will only give me

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.770 
before me and that will only give me
half<00:04:00.290> victory<00:04:00.709> points<00:04:01.069> for<00:04:01.909> the<00:04:02.269> shunted

going<00:05:31.760> to<00:05:31.820> count<00:05:32.030> up<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.180> victory<00:05:32.479> points<00:05:32.870> to

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
going to count up the victory points to

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:40.090 
going to count up the victory points to
see<00:05:33.400> who<00:05:34.400> won<00:05:34.610> and<00:05:34.900> how<00:05:35.900> much<00:05:36.020> they<00:05:36.200> won<00:05:36.320> by<00:05:39.100> so

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.310 
see who won and how much they won by so
we've<00:05:40.190> counted<00:05:40.370> up<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.640> points<00:05:41.030> and<00:05:41.810> I<00:05:42.169> got<00:05:42.290> a

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
we've counted up the points and I got a

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.190 
we've counted up the points and I got a
total<00:05:42.530> of<00:05:42.680> 495<00:05:43.550> points<00:05:43.850> and<00:05:44.240> Mike<00:05:44.630> got<00:05:44.810> a<00:05:44.840> total

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
of three hundred and eighty which means

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.930 
of three hundred and eighty which means
I<00:05:47.360> beat<00:05:47.510> him<00:05:47.600> by<00:05:47.750> thirty<00:05:48.200> percent<00:05:48.700> which<00:05:49.700> makes

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
I beat him by thirty percent which makes

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.640 
I beat him by thirty percent which makes
it<00:05:50.060> a<00:05:50.150> minor<00:05:50.390> victory<00:05:50.840> fifty<00:05:51.290> percent<00:05:51.500> is

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
it a minor victory fifty percent is

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.380 
it a minor victory fifty percent is
major<00:05:51.830> thirty<00:05:52.280> percent<00:05:52.550> minor<00:05:52.790> ten<00:05:53.090> percent

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
major thirty percent minor ten percent

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.700 
major thirty percent minor ten percent
marginal<00:05:53.840> and<00:05:54.050> anything<00:05:54.290> less<00:05:54.320> than<00:05:54.470> that<00:05:54.560> as

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
marginal and anything less than that as

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.070 
marginal and anything less than that as
a<00:05:54.740> draw<00:05:54.979> so<00:05:55.729> it<00:05:55.790> was<00:05:55.880> a<00:05:55.910> pretty<00:05:55.940> brutal<00:05:56.690> game<00:05:56.930> on

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
a draw so it was a pretty brutal game on

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.390 
a draw so it was a pretty brutal game on
both<00:05:57.229> ends<00:05:57.440> i<00:05:57.530> think<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.770> only<00:05:57.890> reason<00:05:58.070> i<00:05:58.220> got

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
both ends i think the only reason i got

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.860 
both ends i think the only reason i got
a<00:05:58.430> minor<00:05:58.790> victory<00:05:59.120> not<00:05:59.270> a<00:05:59.300> marginal<00:05:59.780> is

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
a minor victory not a marginal is

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.540 
a minor victory not a marginal is
because<00:06:00.169> the<00:06:00.410> only<00:06:00.680> ship<00:06:00.800> i<00:06:00.919> left<00:06:01.160> was<00:06:01.340> the<00:06:01.430> one

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
because the only ship i left was the one

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.640 
because the only ship i left was the one
that<00:06:01.640> was<00:06:01.700> worth<00:06:01.880> more<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:02.360> most<00:06:02.540> points<00:06:02.960> and

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
that was worth more the most points and

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.710 
that was worth more the most points and
whereas<00:06:03.979> everything<00:06:04.340> else<00:06:04.490> was<00:06:05.120> anything<00:06:05.600> he

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
whereas everything else was anything he

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.450 
whereas everything else was anything he
captured<00:06:06.110> was<00:06:06.229> just<00:06:06.410> the<00:06:06.500> friggin<00:06:06.650> so<00:06:07.040> i<00:06:07.280> think

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
captured was just the friggin so i think

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.650 
captured was just the friggin so i think
that's<00:06:07.640> the<00:06:07.700> only<00:06:07.760> reason<00:06:08.060> i<00:06:08.210> squeezed<00:06:08.540> out

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
that's the only reason i squeezed out

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.240 
that's the only reason i squeezed out
more<00:06:08.900> than<00:06:09.080> a<00:06:09.110> marginal<00:06:09.500> success<00:06:09.620> other<00:06:10.040> than

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
more than a marginal success other than

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.670 
more than a marginal success other than
that<00:06:10.370> it<00:06:10.520> was<00:06:10.550> pretty<00:06:10.970> darn<00:06:11.210> close<00:06:11.479> and<00:06:11.900> the

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
that it was pretty darn close and the

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.350 
that it was pretty darn close and the
game<00:06:12.860> so<00:06:13.070> is<00:06:13.190> a<00:06:13.400> lot<00:06:13.580> of<00:06:13.669> fun<00:06:13.820> i<00:06:13.970> hope<00:06:14.120> that<00:06:14.330> you

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
game so is a lot of fun i hope that you

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.940 
game so is a lot of fun i hope that you

i<00:06:16.790> hope<00:06:16.820> that<00:06:17.060> we<00:06:17.330> will<00:06:17.510> learn<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:18.169> rules<00:06:18.440> good

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
i hope that we will learn the rules good

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.620 
i hope that we will learn the rules good
enough<00:06:18.950> so<00:06:19.070> we<00:06:19.190> can<00:06:19.310> play<00:06:19.490> larger<00:06:20.030> games<00:06:20.240> a<00:06:20.540> lot

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
enough so we can play larger games a lot

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.120 
enough so we can play larger games a lot
faster<00:06:21.290> as<00:06:21.410> we've<00:06:21.530> spent<00:06:21.710> about<00:06:21.860> two<00:06:22.010> and<00:06:22.070> a

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
faster as we've spent about two and a

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.580 
faster as we've spent about two and a
half<00:06:22.160> hours<00:06:22.580> on<00:06:22.760> that<00:06:23.330> one<00:06:23.570> game<00:06:23.840> so<00:06:24.350> as<00:06:24.470> we

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
half hours on that one game so as we

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.110 
half hours on that one game so as we
learn<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:24.890> rules<00:06:25.040> more<00:06:25.340> and<00:06:25.520> get<00:06:25.610> our<00:06:25.700> tactics

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
learn the rules more and get our tactics

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.940 
learn the rules more and get our tactics
