00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.570
 my name is maximum i am 18 years old 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.580
 old when german junior champion and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.990
 there are four rooms left 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.500
 Bavarian master and now I am 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.869
 a new member of the chores so teams 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.859
 My name was as a teenager in finder 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.980
 the ksv fly decker and also one 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.960
 the founder of the kiosk discover gmbh from 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.629
 what's the special about the zebra 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.219
 Patterns like that are easy 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.500
 our patterns can be recognized 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.039
 very strongly on the pattern of a topic 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.890
 and it has just the basic already 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.410
 was long suspected that zebras in the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.570
 run the evolution of this particular 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.940
 have chosen out patterns around themselves 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.440
 as effective as possible before braking 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.110
 mosquitoes like the tc 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.750
 fly protect lara transmits so 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.280
 we figured it would have to 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.950
 just for flying cover particularly 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.479
 Event, of course, the arguing must 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.070
 have or can have exactly this pattern 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.850
 they are thicker or thinner 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.290
 yes, that's what we asked ourselves and we 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.090
 To be honest, just have several 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.820
 Cover made several prototypes 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.460
 with different patterns and then are 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.289
 it came to that that the pattern that you 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.970
 here you see the most effective is the 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.970
 narrow strips are the more effective 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.369
 protects this pattern we declare ourselves 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.259
 The so that the spring in the 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.390
 sensitive parts like just about the 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.940
 around eyes also have this time as 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.250
 pattern as for example here in the belly area so 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.050
 maxi now apart from pattern what 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.729
 are the special for you at the ceiling 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.409
 as a horse owner and on 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.869
 of course very interesting for one 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.819
 Tournament rider that the ceiling in three 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.960
 Parts can be said to say that 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.550
 front part can decrease 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.990
 And it takes time to lose weight 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.850
 but now quickly from the truck to 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.440
 can hold practice area you are just 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.119
 just the main cover just quickly 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.289
 The horse can not throw over 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.239
 insects is harassed 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.940
 and if you have the blanket for your home 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.009
 I can then take everything back to it 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.810
 mount and then you can drive to 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.209
 turn off the box and that's great 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.400
 has been protected but I think if 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.660
 It had to protect so well from insects 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.319
 one has several others 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.640
 advantages 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.500
 of course, we also believe that simply 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.970
 the purchase under ceiling of financial 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.550
 a great incentive for everyone 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.520
 should be rider 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.260
 you just save a lot 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.880
 insecticides you do not have so much 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.760
 play because not have to feel 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.600
 and so the purchase price is amortized 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.860
 definitely 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.600
 It has become so meanwhile 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.860
 exposed that permethrin to 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.290
 example what many other manufacturers 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.720
 use as a spray or somehow 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.180
 as impregnation for the ceiling that the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.670
 often to allergic reactions such as 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.780
 Skin irritation therefore leads thinking 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.920
 it just is not the right one 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.380
 gone is the future 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.260
 a main reason why I discover 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.210
 managed so spritz costs so fast 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.360
 yes , always a heap monument 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.730
 one sold safely five cans 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.070
 already the blanket in it again what me 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.110
 noticed that the lids are great 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.970
 is and will be breathable 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.520
 do not sweat precisely that is 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.020
 Of course, it's important because it's easy 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.730
 even in the summer there are shivers 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.530
 it needs a little rain shower 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.040
 horse dry quickly too 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.830
 become 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.310
 and even if the romp in the pasture 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.660
 Yes, if the horse sweats easy 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.040
 the fabric permeable permeable to air 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.720
 be quasi it is very dry 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.340
 will be interesting too 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.080
 Tear resistance from the ceiling 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.250
 You can see exactly here because set 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.330
 I have any cheap quality 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.550
 has been used 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.170
 there is nothing and the whole strap on 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.880
 are super processed 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.489
 That was especially important to us, of course 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.180
 because if you know price for the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.469
 blanket but should be like him once 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.569
 long time simply bring joy and 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.040
 not torn after three weeks 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.290
 if it is on the meadow or something 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.569
 There is a lot of romp there and we have it there 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.280
 looked at it naturally before the 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.930
 cover to go out with us, we look 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.819
 also every single blanket 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.629
 after the stop everything just fits in 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.670
 our quality here is perfect as 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.069
 i can only cover this one to everyone 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.109
 Riders and horse owners recommend this 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.359
 of course super protection is against 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.889
 insects and also from the price 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.780
 not very expensive 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.370
 if you fly more about the cross 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.070
 want to know blanket just visit
