well<00:00:00.359> I<00:00:00.390> think<00:00:00.480> two<00:00:00.750> things<00:00:00.780> are<00:00:01.110> going<00:00:01.260> on

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
well I think two things are going on

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.519 
well I think two things are going on
with<00:00:01.860> with<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.429> business<00:00:03.020> firstly<00:00:04.020> we<00:00:04.259> have

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
with with the business firstly we have

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.010 
with with the business firstly we have
had<00:00:04.830> unprecedented<00:00:05.730> rates<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.390> technology

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
had unprecedented rates of technology

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.530 
had unprecedented rates of technology
innovation<00:00:07.890> governed<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.610> large<00:00:08.880> part<00:00:09.240> by

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
innovation governed in large part by

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.830 
innovation governed in large part by
much<00:00:09.990> fun<00:00:10.320> much<00:00:10.769> faster<00:00:11.370> internet<00:00:12.330> speeds

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
much fun much faster internet speeds

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.570 
much fun much faster internet speeds
which<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.410> allowing<00:00:13.740> us<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> use<00:00:14.099> things<00:00:14.519> like

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
which is allowing us to use things like

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.340 
which is allowing us to use things like
video<00:00:14.790> which<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.269> just<00:00:15.420> couldn't<00:00:15.719> do<00:00:15.900> until

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
video which we just couldn't do until

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.460 
video which we just couldn't do until
very<00:00:16.710> recently<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.789> other<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.840> we're

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
very recently the other is that we're

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.620 
very recently the other is that we're
starting<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.039> see<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.369> fundamental<00:00:21.240> shift

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
starting to see this fundamental shift

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.830 
starting to see this fundamental shift
in<00:00:21.810> how<00:00:22.350> consumers<00:00:23.189> are<00:00:23.430> engaging<00:00:23.910> with<00:00:24.269> media

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
in how consumers are engaging with media

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.540 
in how consumers are engaging with media
and<00:00:25.080> spending<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.800> lot<00:00:25.980> more<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.250> their<00:00:26.519> time

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
and spending a lot more of their time

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.120 
and spending a lot more of their time
away<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:27.539> traditional<00:00:27.930> television<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.010> as

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
away from traditional television and as

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.400 
away from traditional television and as
a<00:00:29.160> result<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.840> not<00:00:31.170> only<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
a result of that we have not only the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.260 
a result of that we have not only the
technology<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.070> makes<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.520> possible<00:00:32.759> but

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
technology that makes it possible but

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.060 
technology that makes it possible but
we're<00:00:33.390> also<00:00:33.570> starting<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.410> real

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
we're also starting to see real

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.580 
we're also starting to see real
advertiser<00:00:35.850> demand<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.290> think<00:00:37.320> that

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
advertiser demand and so we think that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.170 
advertiser demand and so we think that
when<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:37.920> talk<00:00:38.070> about<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.430> Golden<00:00:38.790> Age<00:00:39.000> of

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
when we talk about the Golden Age of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.049 
when we talk about the Golden Age of
display<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.930> lot<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.129> because<00:00:41.430> display

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
display a lot of that is because display

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.930 
display a lot of that is because display
advertising<00:00:42.629> online<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.590> becoming<00:00:44.520> either<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
advertising online is becoming either a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.639 
advertising online is becoming either a
compelling<00:00:45.539> supplement<00:00:46.170> or<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.440> some<00:00:46.590> cases

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
compelling supplement or in some cases

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.310 
compelling supplement or in some cases
of<00:00:47.100> compelling<00:00:47.399> substitute<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.750> television

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
of compelling substitute to television

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
of compelling substitute to television
advertising<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.730> that'll<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
advertising and I think that'll be the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.760 
advertising and I think that'll be the
real<00:00:51.480> driver<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> growth<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.530> when<00:00:52.680> we

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
real driver of the growth and when we

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.740 
real driver of the growth and when we
talk<00:00:53.010> about<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.430> fifty<00:00:54.059> billion<00:00:54.360> dollar

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
talk about a fifty billion dollar

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.369 
talk about a fifty billion dollar
industry<00:00:55.110> by<00:00:56.100> 2015<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.930> will<00:00:58.140> come

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
industry by 2015 a lot of that will come

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.740 
industry by 2015 a lot of that will come
from<00:00:58.559> transitioning<00:00:59.070> television<00:00:59.879> dollars<00:01:00.270> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
from transitioning television dollars to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.889

multiples we still see relatively little

multiples we still see relatively little
rich<00:01:12.479> media<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.590> number<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.010> use<00:01:14.369> with

six percent of ads over the last year
the<00:01:17.369> reason<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> primary<00:01:18.780> reason

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the reason for that the primary reason

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.810 
the reason for that the primary reason
for<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:20.100> incredibly

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
for that is that it's incredibly

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.490 
for that is that it's incredibly
difficult<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:22.610> deliver<00:01:23.610> or<00:01:24.210> serve<00:01:24.689> rich<00:01:25.140> media

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
ads on to websites so we have

ads on to websites so we have
advertisers<00:01:27.930> spend<00:01:28.350> an<00:01:28.409> awful<00:01:28.500> lot<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.829> money

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
advertisers spend an awful lot of money

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.069

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
two large websites what Google's really

two large websites what Google's really
focused<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.720> trying<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.200> bring<00:01:37.500> down<00:01:37.530> the

now<00:02:04.090> let's<00:02:04.270> talk<00:02:04.450> about<00:02:04.510> video<00:02:05.200> as<00:02:05.590> display

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
now let's talk about video as display

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.160 
now let's talk about video as display
ads<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:07.000> of<00:02:07.090> course<00:02:07.299> there's<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.659> lot<00:02:07.869> of<00:02:07.900> that

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
ads and of course there's a lot of that

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.130 
ads and of course there's a lot of that
we<00:02:08.500> see<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.740> lot<00:02:08.920> for<00:02:09.190> trailers<00:02:09.700> for<00:02:10.000> movies<00:02:10.140> how

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
we see a lot for trailers for movies how

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.500 
we see a lot for trailers for movies how
might<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.440> develop<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.730> know<00:02:12.819> I<00:02:12.880> think<00:02:13.180> in<00:02:13.330> a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
might that develop you know I think in a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.960 
might that develop you know I think in a
lot<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.840> ways<00:02:14.170> it's<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.650> same<00:02:14.970> principles

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
lot of ways it's the same principles

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.120 
lot of ways it's the same principles
that<00:02:16.239> made<00:02:16.510> television<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.350> engaging<00:02:17.620> medium

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
that made television and engaging medium

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.520 
that made television and engaging medium
so<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.940> first<00:02:19.180> thing<00:02:19.300> about<00:02:19.420> video<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.260> that

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
so the first thing about video is that

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.610 
so the first thing about video is that
it<00:02:20.709> allows<00:02:21.160> advertisers<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.870> start<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.350> create

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
it allows advertisers to start to create

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.740 
it allows advertisers to start to create
an<00:02:23.770> emotional<00:02:24.040> bond<00:02:24.520> with<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.790> consumer<00:02:25.450> just

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
an emotional bond with a consumer just

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.270 
an emotional bond with a consumer just
like<00:02:25.930> they<00:02:26.080> do<00:02:26.140> on<00:02:26.260> television<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.160> it's

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
like they do on television and it's

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.580 
like they do on television and it's
because<00:02:27.610> video<00:02:27.940> brings<00:02:28.270> with<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.569> full<00:02:29.200> sight

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
because video brings with it full sight

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.460 
because video brings with it full sight
sound<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.220> motion<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.989> think<00:02:32.110> it's<00:02:32.350> an

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
sound and motion so I think it's an

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.890 
sound and motion so I think it's an
industry<00:02:32.920> we<00:02:33.130> always<00:02:33.430> knew<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.700> video<00:02:34.300> as<00:02:34.630> a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
industry we always knew that video as a

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.590 
industry we always knew that video as a
medium<00:02:35.319> was<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.920> highly<00:02:36.610> compelling<00:02:37.030> way<00:02:37.300> for

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
medium was a highly compelling way for

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.070 
medium was a highly compelling way for
advertisers<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.440> get<00:02:38.620> their<00:02:39.010> message<00:02:39.610> across

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
advertisers to get their message across

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.559 
advertisers to get their message across
but<00:02:41.080> with<00:02:41.350> slow<00:02:41.920> access<00:02:42.489> speeds<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:43.120> we<00:02:43.300> had

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
but with slow access speeds that we had

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.410 
but with slow access speeds that we had
until<00:02:44.019> relatively<00:02:44.890> recently<00:02:45.209> video<00:02:46.209> was

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
until relatively recently video was

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.240 
until relatively recently video was
limited<00:02:46.840> online<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.470> in<00:02:47.560> fact<00:02:47.709> I<00:02:47.860> just<00:02:47.890> read<00:02:48.190> a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
limited online and in fact I just read a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.190 
limited online and in fact I just read a
statistic<00:02:48.430> recently<00:02:49.239> which<00:02:49.750> said<00:02:49.780> that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
statistic recently which said that

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.650 
statistic recently which said that
within<00:02:50.709> 10<00:02:51.100> years<00:02:51.340> we'll<00:02:51.880> be<00:02:51.910> connecting<00:02:52.360> to

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
within 10 years we'll be connecting to

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.949 
within 10 years we'll be connecting to
the<00:02:52.750> internet<00:02:52.780> at<00:02:53.319> speeds<00:02:54.069> 500<00:02:54.850> times<00:02:55.209> faster

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
the internet at speeds 500 times faster

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.559 
the internet at speeds 500 times faster
than<00:02:55.989> today<00:02:56.980> five<00:02:57.370> hundred<00:02:57.819> times<00:02:58.030> faster<00:02:58.180> in

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
than today five hundred times faster in

the<00:02:58.600> United<00:02:58.989> States<00:02:59.019> than<00:02:59.769> what<00:02:59.950> we<00:03:00.100> do<00:03:00.250> today

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
the United States than what we do today

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.820 
the United States than what we do today
and<00:03:00.730> an<00:03:01.180> environment<00:03:01.780> like<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:02.440> would

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
and an environment like that I would

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.890 
and an environment like that I would
imagine<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:03.519> every<00:03:03.880> kind<00:03:04.150> of<00:03:04.269> ad<00:03:04.450> format

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
imagine that every kind of ad format

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.240 
imagine that every kind of ad format
becomes<00:03:05.319> a<00:03:05.440> video<00:03:05.680> format<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:08.170> think<00:03:08.980> for<00:03:09.220> a

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
becomes a video format so think for a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.160 
becomes a video format so think for a
minute<00:03:09.430> about<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:10.120> mobile<00:03:10.480> device<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:11.140> your

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
minute about that mobile device in your

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.130 
minute about that mobile device in your
pocket<00:03:11.320> right<00:03:11.920> it's<00:03:12.850> not<00:03:13.090> just<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.570> problem<00:03:13.720> in

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
pocket right it's not just a problem in

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.130 
pocket right it's not just a problem in
fact<00:03:14.590> as<00:03:14.950> many<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.579> you<00:03:15.670> know<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.450> a<00:03:16.570> super

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
fact as many of you know it is a super

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.710 
fact as many of you know it is a super
powerful<00:03:17.530> computer<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.519> we<00:03:19.000> think<00:03:19.209> of<00:03:19.359> it<00:03:19.540> as

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
powerful computer and we think of it as

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.530 
powerful computer and we think of it as
