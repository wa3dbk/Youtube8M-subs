this but you just have to add the veg
stock<00:01:14.020> nice<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:14.530> slowly<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:15.159> mean<00:01:15.700> you<00:01:15.820> don't

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
stock nice and slowly I mean you don't

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.340 
stock nice and slowly I mean you don't
want<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.179> drown<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.689> obviously<00:01:17.049> you<00:01:17.170> like

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
want to drown it obviously you like

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.929 
want to drown it obviously you like
putting<00:01:17.649> too<00:01:17.829> much<00:01:17.950> stock<00:01:18.280> in<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:18.549> small

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
putting too much stock in it small

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.179 
putting too much stock in it small
quantity<00:01:19.590> bringing<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.649> out<00:01:20.740> nice<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:20.979> slow

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
quantity bringing it out nice and slow

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.359 
quantity bringing it out nice and slow
so<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.609> grain<00:01:21.850> can<00:01:21.880> all<00:01:22.149> work<00:01:22.299> together<00:01:23.310> add<00:01:24.310> a

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
so the grain can all work together add a

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.830 
so the grain can all work together add a
little<00:01:24.640> bit<00:01:24.759> of<00:01:24.789> stock<00:01:25.060> when<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.299> starts<00:01:25.659> to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
little bit of stock when it starts to

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.989 
little bit of stock when it starts to
evaporate<00:01:26.770> or<00:01:27.549> reduce<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.460> I'm<00:01:30.700> just<00:01:30.850> gonna

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
evaporate or reduce so I'm just gonna

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:32.849 
evaporate or reduce so I'm just gonna
leave<00:01:31.659> this<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.990> cook<00:01:32.139> out<00:01:32.319> nice<00:01:32.499> and<00:01:32.530> slowly

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
leave this to cook out nice and slowly

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.709

liquor<00:01:35.219> and<00:01:36.219> open<00:01:36.639> for<00:01:36.789> next<00:01:36.999> 12<00:01:37.240> minutes<00:01:37.630> you

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
liquor and open for next 12 minutes you

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:38.910 
liquor and open for next 12 minutes you
just<00:01:37.840> need<00:01:38.139> to<00:01:38.259> look<00:01:38.439> after<00:01:38.560> it

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
just need to look after it

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.889

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
enough that when you get to the grain

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.690 
enough that when you get to the grain
eased<00:01:41.079> earlier<00:01:41.380> there<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:41.829> then<00:01:42.340> we<00:01:42.429> can<00:01:42.460> go

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
eased earlier there and then we can go

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.209 
eased earlier there and then we can go
into<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.999> next<00:01:43.030> step

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219
