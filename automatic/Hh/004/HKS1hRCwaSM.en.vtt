facing a Protoss player on a two parter
map<00:00:31.859> I'm<00:00:32.099> primarily<00:00:32.940> worried<00:00:33.510> about<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
map I'm primarily worried about the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.799 
map I'm primarily worried about the
fence<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> start<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:35.430> i<00:00:35.489> go<00:00:35.790> from<00:00:35.969> my<00:00:36.180> ten

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
fence at the start so i go from my ten

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.250 
fence at the start so i go from my ten
drone<00:00:37.140> spawning<00:00:37.739> pool<00:00:38.809> to<00:00:39.809> try<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
drone spawning pool to try and get a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380 
drone spawning pool to try and get a
queen<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> maybe<00:00:41.340> some<00:00:41.579> spine<00:00:41.850> crawlers<00:00:42.210> out

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
queen and maybe some spine crawlers out

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.869 
queen and maybe some spine crawlers out
early<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:44.000> I'm<00:00:45.000> sending<00:00:45.510> my<00:00:45.539> Overlord<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.879> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
early and I'm sending my Overlord out to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.910 
early and I'm sending my Overlord out to
the<00:00:48.059> Protoss<00:00:48.450> space<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.050> that's

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the Protoss space because that's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.880 
the Protoss space because that's
typically<00:00:50.340> where<00:00:50.730> overlords<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> safest

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
typically where overlords are the safest

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.119 
typically where overlords are the safest
vs<00:00:52.890> terran<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:54.120> other<00:00:54.360> zerg<00:00:54.660> because<00:00:55.129> karen

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
vs terran or other zerg because karen

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.959 
vs terran or other zerg because karen
obviously<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.699> Marines<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.210> early<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.969> zerg

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
obviously get Marines out early and zerg

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.860 
obviously get Marines out early and zerg
have<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.480> Queen's<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.280> attack<00:01:02.550> air<00:01:02.870> so

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
have the Queen's that can attack air so

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.060 
have the Queen's that can attack air so
if<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.080> ever<00:01:04.170> overload<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> little

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
if you ever overload there a little

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.890 
if you ever overload there a little
probably<00:01:05.220> die<00:01:05.460> pretty<00:01:05.790> quick<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.810> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
probably die pretty quick now at this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.770 
probably die pretty quick now at this
point<00:01:07.460> he<00:01:08.460> sent<00:01:08.790> his<00:01:08.909> probe<00:01:09.150> out<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.540> see

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
point he sent his probe out and I see

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.270 
point he sent his probe out and I see

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
do is he going to build a pylon or

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.749 
do is he going to build a pylon or
something<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.500> him<00:01:16.590> leave<00:01:16.799> into<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
something and I see him leave into the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.370 
something and I see him leave into the
corner<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> my<00:01:18.180> base<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.689> I'm<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.900> okay<00:01:19.110> he's

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
corner of my base so I'm like okay he's

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.620 
corner of my base so I'm like okay he's
probably<00:01:19.619> building<00:01:20.040> something<00:01:20.189> over<00:01:20.430> there

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
probably building something over there

probably building something over there
so<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.720> building<00:01:21.990> an<00:01:22.049> overlord<00:01:22.500> said<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
so I'm building an overlord said you

you<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.810> what<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.020> means<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.159> start

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
you know what that means you just start

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.649 
you know what that means you just start
building<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> bunch<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.850> towers<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.360> enemy

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
building a bunch of towers in the enemy

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.870 
building a bunch of towers in the enemy
base<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:47.930> basically<00:01:48.930> use<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
base and basically use that as a as I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 
base and basically use that as a as I
kind<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.299> base<00:01:51.540> where<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.350> send<00:01:52.799> you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
kind of a base where you can send you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.340 
kind of a base where you can send you
units<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> slowly<00:01:54.390> encroach<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> enemy

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
units and slowly encroach on the enemy

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.429

base<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:56.430> building<00:01:56.759> towers<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.140> stop

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
base just building towers so to stop

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.230 
base just building towers so to stop
that<00:01:58.619> encroachment<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.340> start<00:01:59.610> building<00:01:59.909> spine

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
that encroachment I start building spine

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.170 
that encroachment I start building spine
crawlers<00:02:00.600> near<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> edge<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.170> my<00:02:01.229> creep<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:02.909> he

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
crawlers near the edge of my creep so he

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.570 
crawlers near the edge of my creep so he
will<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:04.110> any<00:02:04.350> closer<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:06.829> yeah<00:02:07.829> finally<00:02:08.429> get

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
will get any closer and yeah finally get

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.160 
will get any closer and yeah finally get
my<00:02:08.670> queen<00:02:08.970> out<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.599> keep<00:02:09.840> building<00:02:10.050> more

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
my queen out and I keep building more

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.840 
my queen out and I keep building more
spine<00:02:10.530> crawlers

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
spine crawlers

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.120 
spine crawlers
and<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.810> Bella<00:02:13.020> roached<00:02:13.320> in<00:02:13.620> our<00:02:13.890> Roche

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
and that Bella roached in our Roche

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.260 
and that Bella roached in our Roche
Warren<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.650> he<00:02:16.830> builds<00:02:17.160> over<00:02:17.340> here<00:02:17.700> attack

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
Warren and he builds over here attack

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.060 
Warren and he builds over here attack
his<00:02:18.450> pro<00:02:18.660> first<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.560> started<00:02:19.830> attacking

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
his pro first and I started attacking

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.270 
his pro first and I started attacking
his<00:02:20.490> pile<00:02:21.270> on<00:02:21.710> now<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.740> wouldn't<00:02:23.100> have<00:02:23.190> been

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
his pile on now I wouldn't have been

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.970 
his pile on now I wouldn't have been
able<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.580> dps<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.210> down<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:25.320> he<00:02:25.470> canceled<00:02:25.890> it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
able to dps that down but he canceled it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.980 
able to dps that down but he canceled it
anyway<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.640> guess<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.330> got<00:02:27.540> lucky<00:02:27.690> on<00:02:27.870> that

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
anyway so I guess I got lucky on that

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
anyway so I guess I got lucky on that
heart<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:28.980> uh<00:02:29.780> yeah<00:02:30.780> he<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.500> he<00:02:31.620> builds<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
heart but uh yeah he and he builds a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.940 
heart but uh yeah he and he builds a
gateway<00:02:33.170> strangely<00:02:34.170> enough<00:02:34.350> he<00:02:34.410> never

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
gateway strangely enough he never

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.790 
gateway strangely enough he never
actually<00:02:35.190> uses<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:36.390> game<00:02:36.740> not<00:02:37.740> really

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
actually uses it in this game not really

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.060 
actually uses it in this game not really
sure<00:02:38.220> why<00:02:38.660> if<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.780> were<00:02:39.930> him<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.110> would<00:02:40.380> have<00:02:40.500> you

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
sure why if I were him I would have you

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.270 
sure why if I were him I would have you
know<00:02:41.100> maybe<00:02:41.580> pump<00:02:41.880> some<00:02:42.150> zealots<00:02:42.420> out<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
know maybe pump some zealots out and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.350 
know maybe pump some zealots out and
attacked<00:02:44.280> my<00:02:44.490> spine<00:02:44.790> crawlers<00:02:45.150> because<00:02:45.180> I

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
attacked my spine crawlers because I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.410 
attacked my spine crawlers because I
don't<00:02:45.870> even<00:02:46.020> know<00:02:46.230> if<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.440> had<00:02:46.590> enough<00:02:46.860> to

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
don't even know if I had enough to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.540 
don't even know if I had enough to
counter<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.540> at<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.810> point<00:02:49.050> but<00:02:49.520> okay<00:02:50.520> I

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
counter that at this point but okay I

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.790 
counter that at this point but okay I
get<00:02:50.760> my<00:02:50.850> Overlord<00:02:51.270> in<00:02:51.330> his<00:02:51.480> base<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.110> he<00:02:52.770> has

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
get my Overlord in his base and he has

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.000 
get my Overlord in his base and he has
nothing<00:02:54.320> nothing<00:02:55.320> but<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.530> forge<00:02:57.710> so<00:02:58.710> it's<00:02:58.860> very

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
nothing nothing but a forge so it's very

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.900 
nothing nothing but a forge so it's very
vulnerable<00:02:59.630> so<00:03:00.630> my<00:03:00.900> thinking<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.440> okay<00:03:01.950> I'm

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
vulnerable so my thinking is okay I'm

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.480 
vulnerable so my thinking is okay I'm
gonna<00:03:03.150> pump<00:03:03.450> out<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> bunch<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:04.020> roaches<00:03:04.430> get<00:03:05.430> a

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
gonna pump out a bunch of roaches get a

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.990 
gonna pump out a bunch of roaches get a
nidus<00:03:05.790> network<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.680> basically<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:08.550> drop<00:03:08.850> it

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
nidus network and basically just drop it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.730 
nidus network and basically just drop it
in<00:03:09.090> his<00:03:09.240> base<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:10.050> know<00:03:10.170> take<00:03:10.440> out<00:03:10.650> his

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
in his base and you know take out his

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.310 
in his base and you know take out his
main<00:03:10.950> base<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:11.880> all<00:03:12.030> i<00:03:12.060> have<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.630> his<00:03:12.870> cannons

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
main base so all i have is his cannons

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.780 
main base so all i have is his cannons
left<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.810> that's<00:03:15.990> my<00:03:16.140> thinking<00:03:16.350> at<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.620> point

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
left so that's my thinking at this point

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.660 
left so that's my thinking at this point
um<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.990> figured<00:03:18.990> he<00:03:19.140> might<00:03:19.320> be<00:03:19.560> may<00:03:20.070> be<00:03:20.130> taking

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
um I figured he might be may be taking

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.390 
um I figured he might be may be taking
to<00:03:20.820> air<00:03:21.260> which<00:03:22.260> turns<00:03:23.160> out<00:03:23.370> is<00:03:23.430> what<00:03:23.700> he<00:03:23.820> does

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
to air which turns out is what he does

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.940 
to air which turns out is what he does
yeah<00:03:26.400> he<00:03:26.700> builds<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.200> cannon<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.290> his<00:03:28.440> base<00:03:28.650> and

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
yeah he builds a cannon in his base and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.160 
yeah he builds a cannon in his base and
I<00:03:29.250> wasn't<00:03:29.970> paying<00:03:30.090> attention<00:03:30.210> so<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.720> lose<00:03:31.050> my

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
I wasn't paying attention so I lose my

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.050 
I wasn't paying attention so I lose my
Overlord<00:03:31.620> kind<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.280> pisses<00:03:32.550> me<00:03:32.670> off<00:03:32.700> but<00:03:32.970> oh

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
Overlord kind of pisses me off but oh

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.850 
Overlord kind of pisses me off but oh
well<00:03:35.270> so<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:36.300> got<00:03:36.630> more<00:03:36.900> spine<00:03:37.260> crawlers<00:03:37.680> up

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
well so I got more spine crawlers up

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.040 
well so I got more spine crawlers up
he's<00:03:38.580> still<00:03:38.910> not<00:03:39.060> using<00:03:39.270> gateway<00:03:39.630> he<00:03:39.930> actually

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
he's still not using gateway he actually

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.350 
he's still not using gateway he actually
doesn't<00:03:40.440> have<00:03:40.770> that<00:03:40.980> many<00:03:41.220> cannon<00:03:41.760> only<00:03:42.120> four

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
doesn't have that many cannon only four

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.900 
doesn't have that many cannon only four
cannons<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:42.900> probably<00:03:43.170> could<00:03:43.440> have<00:03:43.470> just<00:03:43.910> built

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
cannons I probably could have just built

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.940 
cannons I probably could have just built
a<00:03:45.090> bunch<00:03:45.270> of<00:03:45.390> roaches<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.960> taken<00:03:46.290> him<00:03:46.380> out<00:03:46.590> but

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
a bunch of roaches and taken him out but

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.040 
a bunch of roaches and taken him out but
I<00:03:47.190> didn't<00:03:47.940> really<00:03:48.060> want<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.330> risk<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:48.900> one

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
I didn't really want to risk it this one

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.230 
I didn't really want to risk it this one
I<00:03:49.080> couldn't<00:03:49.380> see<00:03:49.590> how<00:03:49.740> many<00:03:49.890> cans<00:03:50.190> he<00:03:50.460> had<00:03:50.670> and

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
I couldn't see how many cans he had and

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.720 
I couldn't see how many cans he had and
I<00:03:51.960> didn't<00:03:52.200> really<00:03:52.350> want<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.740> you<00:03:53.070> know<00:03:53.190> go<00:03:53.430> find

I didn't really want to you know go find

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:02.500 
I didn't really want to you know go find

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
let's see this point I'm just building

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.640 
let's see this point I'm just building
inside<00:04:17.670> my<00:04:17.850> base<00:04:18.060> i'm<00:04:18.330> building<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.380> bunch<00:04:19.530> of

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
inside my base i'm building a bunch of

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
inside my base i'm building a bunch of
roaches<00:04:20.960> and<00:04:21.960> then<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:23.010> send<00:04:23.370> my

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
roaches and then I send my

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.420 
roaches and then I send my
Overlord<00:04:24.090> up<00:04:24.360> here<00:04:24.930> because<00:04:25.920> I'm<00:04:26.220> going<00:04:26.370> to

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
Overlord up here because I'm going to

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.180 
Overlord up here because I'm going to
build<00:04:26.820> mine<00:04:27.060> itís<00:04:27.720> network<00:04:28.110> around<00:04:28.650> here

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
build mine itís network around here

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.260 
build mine itís network around here
behind<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.670> grass<00:04:29.940> because<00:04:30.930> this<00:04:31.380> grass

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
behind the grass because this grass

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.390 
behind the grass because this grass
basically<00:04:33.270> blocks<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.290> field<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:34.890> vision<00:04:35.070> or

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
basically blocks the field of vision or

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.480 
basically blocks the field of vision or
you<00:04:36.060> know<00:04:36.180> causes<00:04:36.600> fog<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:37.020> war<00:04:37.050> even<00:04:37.800> if<00:04:37.950> like

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
you know causes fog of war even if like

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.580 
you know causes fog of war even if like
you<00:04:38.760> have<00:04:38.910> units<00:04:39.240> over<00:04:39.420> here<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:40.290> won't<00:04:40.440> be

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
you have units over here you won't be

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.680 
you have units over here you won't be
able<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.860> see<00:04:40.980> you<00:04:41.130> in<00:04:41.190> this<00:04:41.250> over<00:04:41.520> here<00:04:41.760> so

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
able to see you in this over here so

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.080 
able to see you in this over here so
that's<00:04:42.840> kind<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.110> useful<00:04:44.360> but<00:04:46.220> so<00:04:47.220> yeah<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:47.370> end

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
that's kind of useful but so yeah I end

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.090 
that's kind of useful but so yeah I end
up<00:04:48.150> building<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.960> nidus<00:04:49.290> network<00:04:49.620> over<00:04:49.890> here

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
up building the nidus network over here

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.010 
up building the nidus network over here
and<00:04:50.190> just<00:04:50.460> pop<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.000> bunch<00:04:51.300> of<00:04:51.450> roaches<00:04:51.600> out

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
and just pop a bunch of roaches out

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.540 
and just pop a bunch of roaches out
there<00:04:52.920> it<00:04:53.040> goes<00:04:53.220> there<00:04:54.200> go<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.320> roaches<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:56.040> I

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
there it goes there go the roaches and I

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.970 
there it goes there go the roaches and I
sent<00:04:56.820> him<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:57.060> his<00:04:57.240> main<00:04:57.540> base<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:58.470> he's

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
sent him to his main base and he's

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.980 
sent him to his main base and he's
building<00:04:59.370> an<00:04:59.580> expansion<00:05:00.150> here<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.480> I<00:05:00.540> see<00:05:00.870> it

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
building an expansion here and I see it

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.530 
building an expansion here and I see it
as<00:05:01.170> I'm<00:05:01.350> going<00:05:01.710> by<00:05:01.890> I'm<00:05:02.610> not<00:05:02.790> too<00:05:03.270> concerned

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
as I'm going by I'm not too concerned

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.600 
as I'm going by I'm not too concerned
that<00:05:04.110> i<00:05:04.140> want<00:05:04.410> to<00:05:04.470> take<00:05:04.650> out<00:05:04.800> his<00:05:04.860> main<00:05:05.130> bases

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
that i want to take out his main bases

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.080 
that i want to take out his main bases
main<00:05:05.820> source<00:05:06.090> of<00:05:06.240> income<00:05:06.390> first<00:05:07.640> when<00:05:08.640> I<00:05:08.760> get

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
main source of income first when I get

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.570 
main source of income first when I get
here<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.600> see<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.590> stargates<00:05:11.130> one<00:05:11.370> of<00:05:11.490> them

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
here I see the to stargates one of them

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.880 
here I see the to stargates one of them
building<00:05:11.970> in<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.180> my<00:05:12.330> house<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:13.050> don't

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
building in the my house I don't

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.740 
building in the my house I don't
have<00:05:14.010> any<00:05:14.190> anti<00:05:14.520> air<00:05:14.700> at<00:05:14.910> this<00:05:15.090> point<00:05:15.390> all<00:05:15.690> I

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
have any anti air at this point all I

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.750 
have any anti air at this point all I
have<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:15.990> my<00:05:16.020> roaches<00:05:16.350> but<00:05:17.280> i<00:05:17.340> figure<00:05:17.640> i<00:05:17.670> can

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
have is my roaches but i figure i can

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.660 
have is my roaches but i figure i can
take<00:05:18.090> out<00:05:18.240> his<00:05:18.330> next<00:05:18.540> use<00:05:19.160> before<00:05:20.160> we<00:05:20.400> can<00:05:20.520> do

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
take out his next use before we can do

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.510 
take out his next use before we can do
anything<00:05:20.700> and<00:05:21.450> any<00:05:22.410> pops<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.830> void<00:05:23.040> where<00:05:23.250> our

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
anything and any pops the void where our

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.300 
anything and any pops the void where our
void<00:05:24.150> ray<00:05:24.360> out<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:24.750> runs<00:05:25.740> all<00:05:25.890> those<00:05:26.010> probes

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
void ray out and runs all those probes

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.360 
void ray out and runs all those probes
down<00:05:26.910> to<00:05:27.150> his<00:05:27.300> new<00:05:27.540> expansion<00:05:28.170> so<00:05:29.100> I<00:05:29.130> just

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
down to his new expansion so I just

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.030 
down to his new expansion so I just
focus<00:05:29.760> down<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.090> next<00:05:30.300> use<00:05:30.680> nothing<00:05:31.680> I<00:05:31.770> can<00:05:31.950> do

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
focus down the next use nothing I can do

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.780 
focus down the next use nothing I can do
about<00:05:32.070> the<00:05:32.340> void<00:05:32.520> ray<00:05:34.370> get<00:05:35.370> that<00:05:35.550> down

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
about the void ray get that down

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.540 
about the void ray get that down
and<00:05:37.300> then<00:05:38.050> I<00:05:38.470> figure<00:05:38.860> okay<00:05:38.890> i'll<00:05:39.190> just<00:05:39.430> go

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
and then I figure okay i'll just go

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.770 
and then I figure okay i'll just go
attack<00:05:39.820> his<00:05:40.000> extension<00:05:40.360> now<00:05:41.160> and<00:05:42.750> lucky<00:05:43.750> for

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
attack his extension now and lucky for

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.140 
attack his extension now and lucky for
me<00:05:44.140> the<00:05:44.440> passing<00:05:44.950> I<00:05:45.160> don't<00:05:45.880> know<00:05:45.970> what

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
me the passing I don't know what

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.760 
me the passing I don't know what
happened<00:05:46.180> but<00:05:46.660> all<00:05:46.720> his<00:05:46.990> like<00:05:47.440> half<00:05:47.620> his

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
happened but all his like half his

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.710 
happened but all his like half his
probes<00:05:48.100> went<00:05:48.340> right<00:05:48.700> into<00:05:48.850> my<00:05:49.060> roaches<00:05:49.300> so<00:05:49.690> I

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
probes went right into my roaches so I

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.460 
probes went right into my roaches so I
just<00:05:49.960> decimated<00:05:50.740> them<00:05:51.330> he's<00:05:52.330> still<00:05:52.570> you<00:05:53.410> know

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
just decimated them he's still you know

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.410 
just decimated them he's still you know
bothering<00:05:54.010> me<00:05:54.130> with<00:05:54.160> his<00:05:54.400> void<00:05:54.610> ray<00:05:54.850> and<00:05:55.120> I

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
bothering me with his void ray and I

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.300 
bothering me with his void ray and I
start<00:05:55.810> focusing<00:05:55.990> guys<00:05:56.380> Nexus<00:05:56.890> but<00:05:56.920> I<00:05:57.130> don't

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
start focusing guys Nexus but I don't

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.110 
start focusing guys Nexus but I don't
have<00:05:57.430> enough<00:05:57.670> roaches<00:05:59.400> to<00:06:00.400> get<00:06:00.550> it<00:06:00.670> down<00:06:00.820> all

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
have enough roaches to get it down all

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.990 
have enough roaches to get it down all
the<00:06:01.150> way<00:06:01.270> before<00:06:01.540> his<00:06:01.780> void<00:06:01.990> ray<00:06:02.230> oh<00:06:02.730> yes<00:06:03.730> to

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
the way before his void ray oh yes to

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.290 
the way before his void ray oh yes to
now<00:06:04.150> before<00:06:04.570> the<00:06:04.660> void<00:06:04.810> rays<00:06:05.020> kill<00:06:05.290> me<00:06:05.850> so<00:06:06.850> i

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
now before the void rays kill me so i

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.570 
now before the void rays kill me so i
built<00:06:07.510> a<00:06:07.900> hydro<00:06:08.230> stand<00:06:08.620> back<00:06:08.830> in<00:06:08.980> my<00:06:09.070> base<00:06:09.250> to

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
built a hydro stand back in my base to

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.210 
built a hydro stand back in my base to
counter<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:10.180> void<00:06:10.360> rays<00:06:10.600> and<00:06:11.260> i<00:06:11.710> have<00:06:11.860> the

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.150 
counter the void rays and i have the
spore<00:06:12.550> crawler<00:06:12.880> i<00:06:13.240> only<00:06:14.110> have<00:06:14.200> one<00:06:14.470> up<00:06:14.740> you

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
spore crawler i only have one up you

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.880 
spore crawler i only have one up you
need<00:06:15.340> an<00:06:15.490> evolution<00:06:16.330> chamber<00:06:16.510> to<00:06:16.810> get<00:06:16.960> spore

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
need an evolution chamber to get spore
college<00:06:18.280> by<00:06:18.430> the<00:06:18.490> way<00:06:19.290> um<00:06:20.490> he's<00:06:21.490> not<00:06:21.550> going<00:06:21.820> to

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
college by the way um he's not going to

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.620 
college by the way um he's not going to
see<00:06:22.060> my<00:06:22.210> nydus<00:06:22.570> worm<00:06:23.340> so<00:06:24.340> i<00:06:24.370> sent<00:06:24.820> two<00:06:25.420> more

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
see my nydus worm so i sent two more

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.590 
see my nydus worm so i sent two more
roaches<00:06:26.280> to<00:06:27.280> go<00:06:27.430> arrest<00:06:27.700> expansion<00:06:28.360> but<00:06:28.450> he's

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
roaches to go arrest expansion but he's

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.450 
roaches to go arrest expansion but he's
now<00:06:28.720> void<00:06:28.960> rays<00:06:29.200> they're<00:06:29.550> waiting<00:06:30.550> for<00:06:30.760> me<00:06:32.460> so

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
now void rays they're waiting for me so

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.010 
now void rays they're waiting for me so
this<00:06:33.610> point<00:06:33.820> i<00:06:33.910> start<00:06:34.120> pumping<00:06:34.450> out<00:06:34.570> hydrol

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
this point i start pumping out hydrol

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:43.050 
this point i start pumping out hydrol
escs<00:06:36.330> and<00:06:39.510> yeah<00:06:40.510> he<00:06:41.020> I<00:06:41.550> don't<00:06:42.550> know<00:06:42.640> if<00:06:42.700> you<00:06:42.790> saw

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
escs and yeah he I don't know if you saw

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.280 
escs and yeah he I don't know if you saw
but<00:06:43.120> he<00:06:43.900> attacks<00:06:44.530> some<00:06:44.740> of<00:06:44.860> my<00:06:45.040> overlords<00:06:46.290> with

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
but he attacks some of my overlords with

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.320 
but he attacks some of my overlords with
Phoenix's<00:06:48.040> because<00:06:48.280> he<00:06:48.370> has<00:06:48.490> a<00:06:48.520> few<00:06:48.790> Phoenix's

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
Phoenix's because he has a few Phoenix's

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.270 
Phoenix's because he has a few Phoenix's
out<00:06:49.480> yeah<00:06:49.630> there<00:06:49.840> they<00:06:49.870> are<00:06:50.050> they<00:06:50.890> took<00:06:51.130> out

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
out yeah there they are they took out

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.880 
out yeah there they are they took out
some<00:06:51.460> of<00:06:51.610> my<00:06:52.410> overlords<00:06:53.410> to<00:06:53.500> have<00:06:53.590> to<00:06:53.710> build

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
some of my overlords to have to build

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.490 
some of my overlords to have to build
some<00:06:54.070> more<00:06:54.450> but<00:06:55.450> then<00:06:55.570> yeah<00:06:55.750> I<00:06:55.840> get<00:06:56.230> for

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
some more but then yeah I get for

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.320 
some more but then yeah I get for
hydralisk<00:06:56.980> so<00:06:57.220> when<00:06:57.430> he<00:06:57.580> attacks<00:06:57.880> my<00:06:58.090> base

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
hydralisk so when he attacks my base

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.990 
hydralisk so when he attacks my base
with<00:06:58.540> his<00:06:58.660> three<00:06:58.900> void<00:06:59.110> rays<00:06:59.580> men<00:07:00.580> should<00:07:00.850> take

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
with his three void rays men should take

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.430 
with his three void rays men should take
one<00:07:01.030> out

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.050 

there<00:07:04.100> it<00:07:04.190> goes<00:07:06.280> so<00:07:07.280> now<00:07:07.430> this<00:07:07.640> point<00:07:07.910> he's

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
there it goes so now this point he's

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.140 
there it goes so now this point he's
kind<00:07:08.270> of<00:07:08.300> like<00:07:08.450> too<00:07:08.630> afraid<00:07:08.900> to<00:07:09.790> try<00:07:10.790> to<00:07:10.850> attack

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
kind of like too afraid to try to attack

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.810 
kind of like too afraid to try to attack
my<00:07:11.360> base<00:07:12.040> which<00:07:13.040> is<00:07:13.220> probably<00:07:13.430> good<00:07:13.580> thing

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:13.820 
my base which is probably good thing

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.420 
my base which is probably good thing
because<00:07:13.910> he<00:07:14.060> would<00:07:14.180> have<00:07:14.210> lost<00:07:14.450> and<00:07:14.900> I<00:07:15.370> sent<00:07:16.370> my

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
because he would have lost and I sent my

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.070 
because he would have lost and I sent my
hide<00:07:16.610> risks<00:07:17.000> out<00:07:17.120> now<00:07:17.360> to<00:07:17.420> attack<00:07:17.900> his

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
hide risks out now to attack his

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.120 
hide risks out now to attack his
expansion<00:07:19.300> as<00:07:20.300> I<00:07:20.420> figure<00:07:20.690> he<00:07:20.960> only<00:07:21.110> has<00:07:21.320> air<00:07:21.680> at

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.130 
expansion as I figure he only has air at

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.490 
expansion as I figure he only has air at
this<00:07:22.460> point<00:07:22.790> and<00:07:23.030> I<00:07:23.210> could<00:07:23.960> probably<00:07:24.170> take<00:07:24.350> out

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
this point and I could probably take out

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.200 
this point and I could probably take out
void<00:07:24.740> rays<00:07:24.980> pretty<00:07:25.250> easily<00:07:25.430> if<00:07:25.640> my<00:07:25.850> Hydra

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.210 
void rays pretty easily if my Hydra

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.160 
void rays pretty easily if my Hydra
discs<00:07:26.510> and<00:07:27.970> phoenixes<00:07:28.970> can<00:07:29.390> attack<00:07:29.750> ground

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.170 
discs and phoenixes can attack ground

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.700 
discs and phoenixes can attack ground
air<00:07:30.380> unless<00:07:30.530> they<00:07:30.830> use<00:07:31.040> their<00:07:31.400> graviton<00:07:32.210> beam

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.710 
air unless they use their graviton beam

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.900 
air unless they use their graviton beam
and<00:07:33.710> even<00:07:33.950> then<00:07:34.070> it<00:07:34.220> doesn't<00:07:34.400> do<00:07:34.610> a<00:07:34.640> whole<00:07:34.760> lot

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:34.910 
and even then it doesn't do a whole lot

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.720 
and even then it doesn't do a whole lot
of<00:07:35.060> damage<00:07:35.300> yeah<00:07:36.200> he<00:07:36.620> has<00:07:36.740> his<00:07:36.770> damaged<00:07:37.280> or<00:07:37.610> his

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:37.730 
of damage yeah he has his damaged or his

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.550 
of damage yeah he has his damaged or his
nexus<00:07:38.060> is<00:07:38.240> damaged<00:07:38.570> so<00:07:38.720> I<00:07:38.750> take<00:07:38.990> that<00:07:39.200> out<00:07:39.350> real

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 
nexus is damaged so I take that out real

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.500 
nexus is damaged so I take that out real
quick<00:07:39.830> and<00:07:40.550> this<00:07:40.670> one<00:07:40.850> he<00:07:40.910> has<00:07:41.000> no<00:07:41.150> source<00:07:41.420> of

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:41.510 
quick and this one he has no source of

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.120 
quick and this one he has no source of
income<00:07:41.690> because<00:07:42.110> he's<00:07:42.530> still<00:07:42.770> building<00:07:43.010> his

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.130 
income because he's still building his

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.270 
income because he's still building his
other<00:07:43.310> Nexus<00:07:44.230> selfish<00:07:45.230> not<00:07:45.500> much<00:07:45.710> he<00:07:45.920> can<00:07:45.950> do<00:07:46.250> I

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.280 
other Nexus selfish not much he can do I

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.490 
other Nexus selfish not much he can do I
don't<00:07:47.020> probably<00:07:48.020> doesn't<00:07:48.200> have<00:07:48.290> too<00:07:48.470> many

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:48.500 
don't probably doesn't have too many

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.300 
don't probably doesn't have too many
minerals<00:07:48.920> either<00:07:50.650> and<00:07:51.650> he<00:07:51.830> lost<00:07:52.040> all<00:07:52.250> his

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:52.310 
minerals either and he lost all his

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.300 
minerals either and he lost all his
probe<00:07:52.670> so<00:07:53.030> he<00:07:54.020> pretty<00:07:54.200> much<00:07:54.350> just<00:07:54.740> quits<00:07:55.100> at

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.310 
probe so he pretty much just quits at

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:00.880 
probe so he pretty much just quits at
that<00:07:55.490> point<00:07:55.760> and<00:07:56.860> there<00:07:57.860> he<00:07:58.010> goes<00:07:58.960> dead<00:07:59.960> that's

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:00.890 
that point and there he goes dead that's

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.240 
that point and there he goes dead that's
why<00:08:01.070> you<00:08:01.130> don't<00:08:01.310> cannon<00:08:01.730> rush<00:08:01.910> folks
