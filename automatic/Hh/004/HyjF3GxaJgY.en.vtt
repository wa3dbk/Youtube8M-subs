00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.109
 but 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.740
 With you the company auto forward. 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.140
 today we will look at how 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.010
 turn right on 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.500
 crossroads modern times are very 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.720
 many cars on the roadway 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.440
 which means our task is necessary 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.730
 determine the center of the intersection select 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.970
 possible variant 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.070
 and perform these actions the only thing we 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.180
 must remember reversing 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.059
 prohibited 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.520
 and there is also the center of the intersection there 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.000
 double solid markup 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:03.290
 you must make a turn with the center 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.290
 and so we ourselves perform a reversal maneuver 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.940
 U-turns at intersection driver 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.920
 approaching the crossing territory 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.390
 roadway must evaluate 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.930
 setting to choose the center of the intersection 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.280
 determine is regulated or not 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.580
 intersection 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.789
 Priority signs lime equivalent 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.170
 intersection with respect to the center we are with 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:34.560
 you are turning around the center and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.500
 to center on priority signs 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.959
 we can move behind center by skipping 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.619
 all cars on the main road to 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:47.369
 equivalent we can also move for 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.530
 center and us if intersection 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.349
 regulated traffic light means 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.560
 relative to the center we move small 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.280
 radius so that we are not cut as well 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.220
 missed 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:05.160
 cars on the left is very important 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:09.569
 select the best range for turning 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:13.620
 not to drive on the curb 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:17.340
 reversing is already prohibited with you 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.880
 company auto forward.
