you the sea serpent first and this is
the<00:03:32.760> main<00:03:33.260> thing<00:03:34.260> that's<00:03:34.620> correct<00:03:34.920> with<00:03:35.160> this

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
the main thing that's correct with this

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.090 
the main thing that's correct with this
mod<00:03:35.489> can<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.790> comes<00:03:35.940> with<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:37.380> believe<00:03:37.890> it's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
mod can it comes with and I believe it's

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.920 
mod can it comes with and I believe it's
a<00:03:38.190> rare<00:03:38.400> spawn<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.180> we're<00:03:39.420> just<00:03:39.450> gonna<00:03:39.630> place

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
a rare spawn so we're just gonna place

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.990 
a rare spawn so we're just gonna place
it<00:03:39.959> down<00:03:40.230> here<00:03:40.440> basically<00:03:40.859> this<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.640> sea

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
it down here basically this is a sea

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.530 
it down here basically this is a sea
serpent<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.840> has<00:03:43.290> 30<00:03:43.829> health<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.540> apparently

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
serpent it has 30 health and apparently

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.090 
serpent it has 30 health and apparently
whether<00:03:46.049> they<00:03:46.170> go<00:03:46.290> there<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:47.480> its<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:49.680> hunts

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
whether they go there is its it hunts
