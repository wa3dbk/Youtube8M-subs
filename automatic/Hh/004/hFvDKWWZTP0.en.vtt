00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.020
 causes satisfaction and motivates 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.070

 hygienic factors 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.990
 paramount attention should be given 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.289
 human dissatisfaction reasons 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.220

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.150
 do it only with the help 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.310
