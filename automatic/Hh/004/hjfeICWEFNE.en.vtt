side<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.680> that's<00:00:52.829> where<00:00:53.070> your<00:00:53.219> insulated

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
side and that's where your insulated

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.990 
side and that's where your insulated
wires<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:55.640> you're<00:00:56.640> gonna<00:00:56.789> make

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
wires are going to go you're gonna make

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
wires are going to go you're gonna make
a<00:00:57.030> solder<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.660> them<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.590> clear

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
a solder to them and then that clear

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.650 
a solder to them and then that clear
tube<00:00:59.250> sleeve<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.820> what<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.090> gonna<00:01:00.210> slip<00:01:00.480> up

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
tube sleeve is what you're gonna slip up

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.959 
tube sleeve is what you're gonna slip up
over<00:01:00.930> everything<00:01:01.579> after<00:01:02.579> you've<00:01:02.730> soldered

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
over everything after you've soldered

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.280 
over everything after you've soldered
that's<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> keep<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.840> from<00:01:03.960> touching

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that's going to keep it from touching

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.990 
that's going to keep it from touching

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
know what I'm talking about there then

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.710 
know what I'm talking about there then
you<00:04:12.280> would<00:04:12.400> take<00:04:12.609> and<00:04:12.819> in<00:04:13.000> my<00:04:13.180> case<00:04:13.239> he<00:04:13.599> would

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
you would take and in my case he would

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.909 
you would take and in my case he would
take<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.989> white<00:04:14.169> wire<00:04:14.380> and<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.590> would<00:04:14.739> just

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
take the white wire and that would just

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.129 
take the white wire and that would just
represent<00:04:15.400> your<00:04:15.519> left<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.780> then<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:17.019> would

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
represent your left and then you would

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.050 
represent your left and then you would
solder<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.709> that<00:04:17.859> other<00:04:18.039> ear<00:04:18.400> lug<00:04:18.700> that

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
solder it to that other ear lug that

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.290 
solder it to that other ear lug that
sticks<00:04:19.660> off<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:20.169> main<00:04:20.380> body<00:04:20.680> of<00:04:21.099> that<00:04:22.030> and

sticks off the main body of that and

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.360

when<00:04:22.510> you<00:04:22.630> solder<00:04:22.900> them<00:04:23.200> make<00:04:24.010> sure<00:04:24.039> no

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
when you solder them make sure no

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.310 
when you solder them make sure no
