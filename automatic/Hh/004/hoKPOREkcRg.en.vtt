in addition to being able to create

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.820 
in addition to being able to create
settings<00:00:03.090> for<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.780> particular<00:00:04.529> time<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.250> day

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
settings for a particular time of day

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.520 
settings for a particular time of day
you<00:00:07.830> can<00:00:08.010> save<00:00:08.849> settings<00:00:09.179> for<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> range<00:00:10.110> of

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
you can save settings for a range of

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.580 
you can save settings for a range of
times<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.730> under<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.269> solo<00:00:12.690> Studies<00:00:13.139> single

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
times so under the solo Studies single

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.400 
times so under the solo Studies single
day<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.730> give<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> beginning<00:00:15.660> time<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.320> an

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
day you can give a beginning time and an

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.680 
day you can give a beginning time and an
end<00:00:16.619> time<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.789> can<00:00:17.970> specify<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
end time and you can specify the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.529 
end time and you can specify the
interval<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.279> case<00:00:20.580> 15-minute

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
interval so in this case 15-minute

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.960 
interval so in this case 15-minute
intervals<00:00:22.020> you'll<00:00:22.680> be<00:00:22.830> seeing<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.250> shadow<00:00:23.550> as

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
intervals you'll be seeing the shadow as

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.779 
intervals you'll be seeing the shadow as
the<00:00:24.150> effect<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> same<00:00:25.160> and<00:00:26.160> now<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.550> means

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
the effect the same and now this means

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.550 
the effect the same and now this means
that<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.150> apply<00:00:27.390> those<00:00:27.660> views<00:00:28.080> through

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
that you can apply those views through

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.009 
that you can apply those views through
the<00:00:28.680> individual<00:00:29.310> those<00:00:30.150> settings<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.929> an

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
the individual those settings to an

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.100 
the individual those settings to an
individual<00:00:31.650> view<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> way<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.930> do

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
individual view and the way that you do

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.680 
individual view and the way that you do
that<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.649> save<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.100> name<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.239> settings

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
that is to save the name of the settings

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.139 
that is to save the name of the settings
and<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> particular<00:00:38.129> view<00:00:38.700> tally

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
and then for a particular view tally

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.830 
and then for a particular view tally
which<00:00:40.370> solo<00:00:41.370> study<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.969> applied<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> view

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
which solo study is applied to the view

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.049 
which solo study is applied to the view
itself<00:00:43.170> now<00:00:44.070> I've<00:00:44.280> used<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.700> naming

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
itself now I've used the naming

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.450 
itself now I've used the naming
convention<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.750> saying<00:00:46.110> winter<00:00:46.649> solstice<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
convention of saying winter solstice and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.660 
convention of saying winter solstice and
Louie<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.149> fact<00:00:48.530> it's<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.860> location<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
Louie but in fact it's the location of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.779 
Louie but in fact it's the location of
the<00:00:50.789> project<00:00:51.390> that's<00:00:51.570> always<00:00:51.840> used<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the project that's always used so I

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.150 
the project that's always used so I
really<00:00:54.420> don't<00:00:54.690> need<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.140> put<00:00:55.410> some<00:00:55.739> Louie<00:00:55.949> in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
really don't need to put some Louie in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.599 
really don't need to put some Louie in
there<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.610> was<00:00:56.789> simply<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> naming<00:00:57.629> convention

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
there it was simply a naming convention

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.029 
there it was simply a naming convention
so<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.840> particular<00:01:01.140> project<00:01:01.559> I'm

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
so that for that particular project I'm

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.520 
so that for that particular project I'm
reminding<00:01:02.609> myself<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.449> instantly<00:01:04.019> but

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
reminding myself that it's instantly but

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.980 
reminding myself that it's instantly but
if<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.920> were<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.339> say<00:01:06.060> go<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.479> change<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
if I were to say go and change the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.370 
if I were to say go and change the
location<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.530> San<00:01:08.100> Francisco<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.810> not

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
location to San Francisco this is not

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.840 
location to San Francisco this is not
going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> update<00:01:11.100> from<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> naming

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
going to update from the naming

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.300 
going to update from the naming
convention<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.570> already<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.409> you've

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
convention it's already there so you've

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.940 
convention it's already there so you've
only<00:01:14.490> got<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:14.820> project<00:01:15.360> location<00:01:16.049> active<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
only got one project location active and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.700 
only got one project location active and
you<00:01:17.040> can't<00:01:17.310> save<00:01:17.750> different<00:01:18.750> locations<00:01:19.290> when

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
you can't save different locations when

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.390 
you can't save different locations when
you<00:01:19.830> save<00:01:20.130> settings<00:01:20.720> for<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> specific<00:01:22.200> day<00:01:25.400> so

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
you save settings for a specific day so

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.100 
you save settings for a specific day so
the<00:01:26.490> point<00:01:26.759> here<00:01:26.850> would<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.570> once<00:01:27.840> you've

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the point here would be that once you've

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.679 
the point here would be that once you've
created<00:01:28.740> those<00:01:29.189> animations<00:01:29.700> settings<00:01:30.509> you're

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
created those animations settings you're

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.749 
created those animations settings you're
able<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.960> apply<00:01:31.229> them<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> particular<00:01:32.430> view

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
able to apply them to a particular view

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.359 
able to apply them to a particular view
to<00:01:32.970> help<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.329> visualize<00:01:33.650> and<00:01:34.650> those<00:01:34.920> could<00:01:35.159> be

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
to help you visualize and those could be

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.160 
to help you visualize and those could be
say<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> winter<00:01:36.090> solstice<00:01:36.360> or<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> summer

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
say the winter solstice or the summer

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.190 
say the winter solstice or the summer
solstice<00:01:37.579> or<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.820> spring<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.270> fall<00:01:39.540> solstice

for<00:03:10.150> example<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:11.140> was<00:03:12.099> interested<00:03:12.459> in<00:03:13.019> the

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
for example I was interested in the

9 o'clock and 3 o'clock in the afternoon
right<00:03:26.320> so<00:03:26.560> normally<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.549> kind<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.820> look<00:03:28.030> at

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
right so normally you kind of look at

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.030 
right so normally you kind of look at
those<00:03:28.359> hours<00:03:28.600> I'm<00:03:29.140> gonna<00:03:29.290> set<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.859> 9

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
afternoon and then I've got the option

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.460 
afternoon and then I've got the option
of<00:03:37.560> setting<00:03:38.560> how<00:03:38.950> many<00:03:40.019> intervals<00:03:41.019> are<00:03:41.290> there

between those beginning and ending times

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.349 
between those beginning and ending times
I<00:03:44.019> can<00:03:44.230> set<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.620> 30<00:03:44.980> minutes<00:03:45.430> 45<00:03:45.970> minutes<00:03:46.269> an

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.009 
hour let's make it this the 15 minutes I
want<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.500> make<00:03:50.709> sure<00:03:50.739> again<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:52.660> shadows

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
want to make sure again that the shadows

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.509 
want to make sure again that the shadows
are<00:03:53.170> falling<00:03:53.440> on<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.680> terrain<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.220> not<00:03:54.370> the

are falling on the terrain and not the

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.569 
are falling on the terrain and not the
ground<00:03:54.760> plane<00:03:55.739> so<00:03:56.739> I've<00:03:56.829> actually<00:03:56.980> switched

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
ground plane so I've actually switched

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.670 
ground plane so I've actually switched
that<00:03:57.790> on<00:03:58.030> for<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.900> view<00:03:59.139> that<00:03:59.319> I'm<00:03:59.380> in<00:03:59.530> which

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
that on for the view that I'm in which

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.660 
that on for the view that I'm in which
is<00:03:59.709> my<00:04:00.010> 3d<00:04:00.340> view<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:02.049> let's<00:04:02.680> say<00:04:03.010> let's<00:04:03.040> rename

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
is my 3d view and let's say let's rename

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:11.099 
is my 3d view and let's say let's rename
that<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.329> and<00:04:04.690> call<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:06.480> animated<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.750> then

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
that and and call it animated and then

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.410 
that and and call it animated and then
if<00:04:11.350> I<00:04:11.500> turn<00:04:11.560> on<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:12.010> shadows<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:12.790> should<00:04:13.269> be

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
if I turn on the shadows I should be

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.770 
if I turn on the shadows I should be
seeing<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.230> shadows<00:04:14.650> on<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:14.889> on<00:04:15.280> this

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
seeing the shadows on the on this

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.900 
seeing the shadows on the on this
terrain<00:04:16.780> so<00:04:17.440> I'm<00:04:17.530> telling<00:04:17.769> them<00:04:17.979> on<00:04:18.220> scene<00:04:18.789> and

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
terrain so I'm telling them on scene and

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.779 
terrain so I'm telling them on scene and
on<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.180> terrain<00:04:19.479> but<00:04:20.289> my<00:04:20.440> next<00:04:20.769> step<00:04:21.010> is<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.609> go

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
on the terrain but my next step is to go

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.390 
on the terrain but my next step is to go
to<00:04:21.849> the<00:04:23.190> Sun

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400
