00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
surgery plans and then pretty much doubt

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.100 
surgery plans and then pretty much doubt
that<00:01:11.940> will<00:01:12.090> happen<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.690> we<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:12.960> really

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that will happen and we don't really

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.480

know<00:01:13.259> what's<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.619> happen<00:01:13.679> the<00:01:14.009> rest<00:01:14.220> but

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
know what's going to happen the rest but

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.550 
know what's going to happen the rest but
it<00:01:15.119> probably<00:01:15.360> might<00:01:15.600> change<00:01:15.959> we<00:01:16.200> don't<00:01:16.410> really

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
it probably might change we don't really

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.169 
it probably might change we don't really
know<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.459> never<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:17.819> what's<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.710 
know you never know what's going to
happen<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:20.030> possibly<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.390> Daniel

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
happen but some possibly for Daniel

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.740 
happen but some possibly for Daniel

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
Night of Champions for a match we don't

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.339 
Night of Champions for a match we don't
really<00:01:51.179> know<00:01:51.420> what's<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.840> happen<00:01:51.899> but

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
really know what's going to happen but

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:55.520 
really know what's going to happen but
yeah<00:01:52.920> that's<00:01:53.670> probably<00:01:54.000> gonna<00:01:54.869> happen<00:01:55.259> but

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
yeah that's probably gonna happen but

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.589 
yeah that's probably gonna happen but
likely<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.550> most<00:01:56.580> likely<00:01:57.149> thing<00:01:57.300> will<00:01:57.479> happen

00:01:57.589 --> 00:01:57.599 
likely the most likely thing will happen

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.770 
likely the most likely thing will happen
is<00:01:58.080> that<00:01:58.349> John<00:01:59.190> Cena<00:01:59.429> will<00:01:59.789> not<00:02:00.060> be<00:02:00.330> WWE

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
is that John Cena will not be WWE

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.260 
is that John Cena will not be WWE
Champion<00:02:01.140> after<00:02:01.739> SummerSlam<00:02:02.580> that'll<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
Champion after SummerSlam that'll be the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.930 
Champion after SummerSlam that'll be the
most<00:02:03.450> likely<00:02:03.929> thing<00:02:04.310> well<00:02:05.310> probably<00:02:05.520> there

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
most likely thing well probably there

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.479 
most likely thing well probably there
that<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.300> gonna<00:02:06.479> let<00:02:07.440> John<00:02:07.739> Cena<00:02:08.099> defeat

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
that is gonna let John Cena defeat

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.279 
that is gonna let John Cena defeat
Daniel<00:02:08.910> Bryan<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.450> then<00:02:09.629> run<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.050> wouldn't

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
Daniel Bryan and then run you wouldn't

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.500 
Daniel Bryan and then run you wouldn't
cash<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.580> Money<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.209> Bank<00:02:12.270> contract

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
cash in the Money in the Bank contract

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.589 
cash in the Money in the Bank contract
to<00:02:13.140> become<00:02:13.470> w/e<00:02:14.099> champion<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.819> then<00:02:15.060> probably

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
to become w/e champion and then probably

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.050 
to become w/e champion and then probably
Randy<00:02:16.050> Orton<00:02:16.379> to<00:02:19.040> defend<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.250> against<00:02:20.730> Daniel

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
Randy Orton to defend it against Daniel
