shows you how to use predator 64 as an
emulation<00:01:15.280> tool<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:16.000> if<00:01:16.719> you<00:01:16.869> haven't

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
emulation tool and if you haven't

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.630 
emulation tool and if you haven't
watched<00:01:17.500> that<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:17.829> don't<00:01:18.219> know<00:01:18.460> how<00:01:18.579> to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
watched that and don't know how to

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.209 
watched that and don't know how to
emulate<00:01:19.000> roms<00:01:19.990> yet<00:01:20.289> I<00:01:20.409> would<00:01:20.619> recommend<00:01:21.039> you

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
emulate roms yet I would recommend you

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.069 
emulate roms yet I would recommend you
go<00:01:21.340> look<00:01:21.549> at<00:01:21.789> that<00:01:21.820> previous<00:01:22.659> tutorial

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
go look at that previous tutorial

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.630 
go look at that previous tutorial
because<00:01:23.649> that<00:01:23.950> will<00:01:24.070> show<00:01:24.250> you<00:01:24.310> everything

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
because that will show you everything

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
because that will show you everything
that<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.149> not<00:01:25.479> explained<00:01:25.990> here<00:01:26.829> for<00:01:27.280> emulation

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that is not explained here for emulation

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.349 
that is not explained here for emulation
so<00:01:29.530> once<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.799> have<00:01:29.950> downloaded<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.640> high<00:01:31.210> res

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
so once you have downloaded a high res

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.330 
so once you have downloaded a high res
texture<00:01:31.659> pack<00:01:31.930> in<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.350> rice<00:01:32.500> video<00:01:32.890> plug-in

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
texture pack in the rice video plug-in

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.910 
texture pack in the rice video plug-in
and<00:01:33.549> you<00:01:33.579> have<00:01:34.359> projects<00:01:34.960> before<00:01:35.140> setup<00:01:35.679> I'm

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
and you have projects before setup I'm

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.770 
and you have projects before setup I'm
going<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.130> be<00:01:36.189> using<00:01:36.520> project<00:01:36.969> 64<00:01:37.420> for<00:01:37.659> this

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
going to be using project 64 for this

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.899 
going to be using project 64 for this
tutorial<00:01:37.929> because<00:01:38.859> that's<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.310> one<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:39.670> use

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
tutorial because that's the one I use

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.660 
tutorial because that's the one I use
for<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.179> last<00:01:40.359> tutorial<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.979> can<00:01:42.009> use<00:01:42.460> other

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
for the last tutorial you can use other

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.169 
for the last tutorial you can use other
like<00:01:43.179> I<00:01:43.299> said<00:01:43.560> 1964<00:01:44.560> also<00:01:45.340> works<00:01:45.609> and<00:01:45.939> other

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
like I said 1964 also works and other

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.590 
like I said 1964 also works and other
programs<00:01:46.960> do<00:01:47.259> work<00:01:47.530> too<00:01:47.829> but<00:01:48.460> project<00:01:48.880> 54<00:01:49.390> and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
programs do work too but project 54 and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.950 
programs do work too but project 54 and
1964<00:01:50.560> seem<00:01:50.829> to<00:01:50.979> be<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.189> most<00:01:51.600> compatible<00:01:52.600> with

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
1964 seem to be the most compatible with

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.109 
1964 seem to be the most compatible with
the<00:01:53.079> res<00:01:53.229> video<00:01:53.530> plugin

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the res video plugin

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.999 
the res video plugin
so<00:01:55.119> anyways<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:56.079> get<00:01:56.200> started<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.679> have<00:01:56.859> to

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
so anyways to get started you have to

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.830 
so anyways to get started you have to
install<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:57.520> rice<00:01:57.640> video<00:01:57.969> plugin<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:58.689> we'll

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
install the rice video plugin so we'll

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.929 
install the rice video plugin so we'll
just<00:01:58.960> go<00:01:59.079> ahead<00:01:59.109> and<00:01:59.380> do<00:01:59.469> that<00:01:59.499> now

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
just go ahead and do that now

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.399 
just go ahead and do that now
what<00:02:00.939> you<00:02:01.060> want<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.270> do<00:02:01.450> is<00:02:01.780> select<00:02:02.140> your

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
what you want to do is select your

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.520 
what you want to do is select your
project<00:02:03.100> for<00:02:03.579> install<00:02:03.939> directory<00:02:04.359> now<00:02:05.289> if

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
project for install directory now if

retro<00:03:59.500> folder<00:04:00.100> so<00:04:00.640> let's<00:04:00.820> just<00:04:00.970> go<00:04:01.090> look<00:04:01.269> in

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
retro folder so let's just go look in

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.949 
retro folder so let's just go look in
here<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:02.130> this<00:04:03.130> is<00:04:03.340> super<00:04:03.640> mario<00:04:03.760> 64<00:04:04.090> this<00:04:04.750> is

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
here and this is super mario 64 this is

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.500 
here and this is super mario 64 this is
the<00:04:05.080> internal<00:04:05.440> name<00:04:05.739> for<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.340> ROM<00:04:06.519> so<00:04:07.269> now<00:04:07.450> we

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
the internal name for the ROM so now we

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.660 
the internal name for the ROM so now we
just<00:04:07.660> have<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.080> copy<00:04:08.290> this<00:04:08.590> over<00:04:08.980> high<00:04:09.519> res

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
just have to copy this over high res

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.150 
just have to copy this over high res
texture<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.780> name<00:04:11.019> of<00:04:11.049> the<00:04:11.290> ROM<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.709> then

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
texture and the name of the ROM and then

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.460 
texture and the name of the ROM and then
here<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.400> can<00:04:12.519> see<00:04:12.670> of<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.269> folders<00:04:13.810> with<00:04:14.320> all

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
here you can see of the folders with all

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.650 
here you can see of the folders with all
the<00:04:14.620> different<00:04:14.829> graphics<00:04:15.370> now<00:04:16.150> it<00:04:16.329> can<00:04:16.450> pop

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
the different graphics now it can pop

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.719 
the different graphics now it can pop
out<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.260> we<00:04:17.829> can<00:04:17.979> go<00:04:18.070> ahead<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.370> close<00:04:18.489> that

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
out and we can go ahead and close that

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.490 
out and we can go ahead and close that
you<00:04:19.000> can<00:04:19.180> read<00:04:19.329> any<00:04:19.540> with<00:04:19.810> me<00:04:19.959> that<00:04:20.140> comes<00:04:20.320> with

you can read any with me that comes with

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.550 
you can read any with me that comes with
any<00:04:20.739> texture<00:04:21.609> pack<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:22.090> go<00:04:23.020> ahead<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.500> open

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
any texture pack and go ahead and open

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.840 
any texture pack and go ahead and open
up

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
up

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.600

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
go ahead and open the ROM again and

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.110 
go ahead and open the ROM again and
we're<00:04:28.770> gonna<00:04:28.860> open<00:04:29.070> up<00:04:29.280> Super<00:04:29.970> Mario<00:04:30.150> 64<00:04:32.120> you

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
we're gonna open up Super Mario 64 you

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.970 
we're gonna open up Super Mario 64 you
can<00:04:33.270> see<00:04:33.420> it<00:04:33.510> loaded<00:04:33.750> up<00:04:33.840> some<00:04:34.020> files<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.590> you

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
can see it loaded up some files and you

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.140 
can see it loaded up some files and you
can<00:04:35.130> see<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.430> looks<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.640> little<00:04:35.730> bit<00:04:35.970> different

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
can see it looks a little bit different

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.090 
can see it looks a little bit different
now<00:04:36.990> I<00:04:37.050> want<00:04:37.170> to<00:04:37.200> go<00:04:37.290> back<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.650> our<00:04:37.740> graphics

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
now I want to go back to our graphics

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.940 
now I want to go back to our graphics
plugin<00:04:38.520> go<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.060> our<00:04:39.390> general<00:04:39.990> let's<00:04:40.770> see<00:04:40.920> our

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
plugin go to our general let's see our

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.490 
plugin go to our general let's see our
texture<00:04:41.370> enhancement<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.080> make<00:04:43.080> sure<00:04:43.290> that

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
texture enhancement and make sure that

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.350 
texture enhancement and make sure that
dump<00:04:43.890> textures<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.640> files<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:45.180> unchecked

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
dump textures to files is unchecked

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.660 
dump textures to files is unchecked
style<00:04:48.360> we'll<00:04:48.600> just<00:04:48.720> let<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:48.990> start<00:04:49.560> up<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.040> as

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
style we'll just let it start up and as

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.490 
style we'll just let it start up and as
you<00:04:50.760> can<00:04:50.850> see<00:04:50.910> this<00:04:51.690> is<00:04:51.900> no<00:04:52.020> longer<00:04:52.260> the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
you can see this is no longer the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.060 
you can see this is no longer the
standard<00:04:53.040> textures<00:04:53.520> for<00:04:53.880> Super<00:04:54.180> Mario<00:04:54.390> 64<00:04:55.070> so

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
standard textures for Super Mario 64 so

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.550 
standard textures for Super Mario 64 so
there<00:04:56.250> you<00:04:56.340> can<00:04:56.490> see<00:04:56.730> we<00:04:57.420> are<00:04:57.510> using<00:04:57.750> the

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
there you can see we are using the

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.970 
there you can see we are using the
erecto<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.580> retro<00:04:59.940> texture<00:05:00.600> pack<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.080> as<00:05:01.890> you

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
erecto the retro texture pack and as you

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.830 
erecto the retro texture pack and as you
can<00:05:02.100> see<00:05:02.250> it<00:05:02.310> looks<00:05:02.400> quite<00:05:02.700> nice<00:05:02.910> there<00:05:03.810> are

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
can see it looks quite nice there are

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.930 
can see it looks quite nice there are
all<00:05:04.110> certain<00:05:04.530> other<00:05:04.770> enhancements<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.760> can

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
all certain other enhancements you can

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.840 
all certain other enhancements you can
use<00:05:06.180> that<00:05:06.900> are<00:05:07.170> just<00:05:07.470> software<00:05:07.890> graphically

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
use that are just software graphically

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.560 
use that are just software graphically
enhancing<00:05:09.330> such<00:05:09.780> as<00:05:09.990> sharpen<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:10.910> some<00:05:11.910> anti

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
enhancing such as sharpen and some anti

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.680 
enhancing such as sharpen and some anti
Anacin<00:05:13.430> options<00:05:14.430> that<00:05:14.790> are<00:05:14.940> in<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.330> plugins

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
Anacin options that are in the plugins

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.500 
Anacin options that are in the plugins
of<00:05:15.960> course<00:05:16.310> but<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.490> high<00:05:17.760> res<00:05:17.940> texture<00:05:18.300> packs

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
of course but the high res texture packs

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
of course but the high res texture packs
is<00:05:18.900> great<00:05:20.540> in<00:05:21.540> a<00:05:21.660> later<00:05:21.870> tutorial<00:05:21.960> I'll<00:05:22.500> show

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
is great in a later tutorial I'll show

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.740 
is great in a later tutorial I'll show
you<00:05:22.650> how<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.980> just<00:05:23.370> go<00:05:23.520> ahead<00:05:23.760> and<00:05:23.880> edit<00:05:24.030> some

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
you how to just go ahead and edit some

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.480 
you how to just go ahead and edit some
of<00:05:24.810> these<00:05:24.960> stock<00:05:25.260> textures<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:26.070> make<00:05:26.220> your<00:05:26.340> own

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
of these stock textures to make your own

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.140 
of these stock textures to make your own
high<00:05:26.910> res<00:05:27.150> textures<00:05:27.980> and<00:05:28.980> that<00:05:29.790> will<00:05:29.970> be

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
high res textures and that will be

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.250 
high res textures and that will be
probably<00:05:30.840> uploaded<00:05:31.410> next<00:05:31.920> after<00:05:32.250> this<00:05:32.430> one<00:05:33.260> so

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
probably uploaded next after this one so

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.480 
probably uploaded next after this one so
as<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.470> can<00:05:34.530> see<00:05:34.740> we<00:05:34.890> have<00:05:35.010> our<00:05:35.040> high<00:05:35.280> res

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
as you can see we have our high res

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.420 
as you can see we have our high res
texture<00:05:35.760> packs<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.800> you<00:05:37.800> can<00:05:37.950> do<00:05:38.040> this<00:05:38.220> for

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
texture packs and you can do this for

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.600 
texture packs and you can do this for
almost<00:05:38.820> any<00:05:39.120> realm<00:05:39.680> that<00:05:40.680> has<00:05:40.950> texture<00:05:41.340> packs

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
almost any realm that has texture packs

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.280 
almost any realm that has texture packs
or<00:05:41.910> you<00:05:42.000> can<00:05:42.180> make<00:05:42.300> your<00:05:42.450> own<00:05:42.570> high<00:05:43.080> res

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
or you can make your own high res

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.060 
or you can make your own high res
textures<00:05:44.060> for<00:05:45.060> any<00:05:45.570> game<00:05:46.140> you<00:05:46.170> want<00:05:46.320> and<00:05:46.980> I'll

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
textures for any game you want and I'll

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.530 
textures for any game you want and I'll
have<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.250> like<00:05:47.640> I<00:05:47.730> said<00:05:47.940> I'll<00:05:48.030> have<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.180> tutorial

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
have a like I said I'll have a tutorial

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.230 
have a like I said I'll have a tutorial
on<00:05:48.870> that<00:05:49.080> later<00:05:49.520> certain<00:05:50.520> ways<00:05:50.670> this<00:05:50.880> has<00:05:50.940> been
