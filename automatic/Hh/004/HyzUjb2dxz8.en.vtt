change<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.450> temperature<00:04:21.870> in<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.380> shower

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
change the temperature in the shower

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.100 
change the temperature in the shower
when<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.010> go<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.400> wet<00:04:23.550> my<00:04:23.729> hair<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:24.270> absolutely

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760 
whip my hair as I'm in the shower and
it's<00:04:32.910> like<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.450> water<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:33.810> super<00:04:33.960> hot<00:04:34.290> I<00:04:34.530> will

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
it's like the water is super hot I will

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.879 
it's like the water is super hot I will
wear<00:04:34.950> a<00:04:35.280> shower<00:04:35.520> cap<00:04:35.669> I<00:04:36.300> am<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:37.050> serious<00:04:37.350> about

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
wear a shower cap I am so serious about

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.460 
wear a shower cap I am so serious about
it<00:04:38.070> so<00:04:38.250> those<00:04:39.180> are<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.510> steps<00:04:39.750> for<00:04:39.960> ceiling<00:04:40.350> in

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
it so those are the steps for ceiling in

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.640 
it so those are the steps for ceiling in
the<00:04:40.590> moisture<00:04:40.770> I<00:04:41.400> hope<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.360> helps<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.110> I

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
the moisture I hope it helps you and I

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.040 
the moisture I hope it helps you and I
want<00:04:44.100> you<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.280> use<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.729> comments<00:04:45.240> area<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.870> do

want you to use the comments area to do

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.770 
want you to use the comments area to do
a<00:04:46.229> few<00:04:46.440> things<00:04:46.500> one<00:04:47.430> if<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.210> use<00:04:48.240> this<00:04:48.720> method

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
a few things one if you use this method

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.150 
a few things one if you use this method
and<00:04:49.350> it<00:04:49.440> works<00:04:49.620> for<00:04:49.919> you

the LOC lock method for ceiling in the
moisture<00:04:56.039> does<00:04:56.550> work<00:04:56.880> in<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.419> cosine<00:04:57.960> it<00:04:58.200> or

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
moisture does work in you cosine it or

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.500 
moisture does work in you cosine it or
two<00:04:59.130> if<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.400> do<00:04:59.789> something<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.330> works
