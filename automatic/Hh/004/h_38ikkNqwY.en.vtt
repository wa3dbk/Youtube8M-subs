backhoe loader in the caterpillar range

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.889 
backhoe loader in the caterpillar range
and<00:00:49.469> weighs<00:00:49.620> around<00:00:49.829> 11<00:00:50.309> tons<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:51.420> model<00:00:51.809> is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
and weighs around 11 tons this model is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.889 
and weighs around 11 tons this model is
in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> small<00:00:52.320> scale<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.770> 1<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:52.980> 87<00:00:53.699> and

in the small scale of 1 to 87 and
because<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.289> box<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.770> comes<00:00:55.949> in

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
because of that the box that it comes in

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.010 
because of that the box that it comes in
is<00:00:56.280> really<00:00:56.309> quite<00:00:56.699> small<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.809> caterpillar

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
is really quite small it's a caterpillar

is really quite small it's a caterpillar
branded<00:00:58.680> box<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> usual<00:00:59.699> style<00:01:00.000> there's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
branded box in the usual style there's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.000 
branded box in the usual style there's
no<00:01:00.989> information<00:01:01.230> about<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> real<00:01:01.980> machine

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
no information about the real machine

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.650 
no information about the real machine
but<00:01:02.489> there's<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> few<00:01:02.850> details<00:01:03.059> about<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
but there's a few details about the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149 
but there's a few details about the
model<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.170> back<00:01:04.379> although<00:01:04.739> they're<00:01:05.040> not

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
model on the back although they're not

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
model on the back although they're not
correct<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.119> says<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> model<00:01:06.720> has

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
correct because it says the model has

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500 
correct because it says the model has
front<00:01:07.350> steering<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> doesn't<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.729> we've

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
front steering and it doesn't as we've

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.000 
front steering and it doesn't as we've
all<00:01:09.630> norscot<00:01:10.020> models<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.500> expect<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.950> be

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
all norscot models you expect it to be

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.590 
all norscot models you expect it to be
tied<00:01:11.340> down<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.880> base<00:01:12.060> when<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.510> it

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
tied down to the base when you get it

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.210 
tied down to the base when you get it
out<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> box<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.070> no

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
out of the box and this one is no

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.190 
out of the box and this one is no
exception<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:15.000> fact<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.840> extraordinary

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
exception in fact it's extraordinary

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.289 
exception in fact it's extraordinary
because<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> tiny<00:01:17.340> lightweight<00:01:17.939> model

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
because this is a tiny lightweight model

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.230 
because this is a tiny lightweight model
and<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.750> attached<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.049> five<00:01:19.560> ties<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:21.180> you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and it's attached with five ties so you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.700 
and it's attached with five ties so you
can<00:01:21.450> only<00:01:21.570> assume<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.140> people<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.560> this

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
can only assume that the people do this

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.260 
can only assume that the people do this
for<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.920> living<00:01:23.040> must<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.759> their<00:01:24.000> job

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
for a living must really like their job

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390 
for a living must really like their job
anyway<00:01:25.049> after<00:01:25.320> fighting<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> packaging<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
anyway after fighting the packaging the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.930 
anyway after fighting the packaging the
model<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.700> complete<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> box

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.740 

starting<00:01:35.940> underneath<00:01:36.150> there<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.540> some

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
starting underneath there is some

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.300 
starting underneath there is some
chassis<00:01:37.110> detail<00:01:37.500> contained<00:01:37.920> within<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
chassis detail contained within the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
chassis detail contained within the
casting<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.600> rubber<00:01:39.780> tires<00:01:40.080> look<00:01:40.320> good

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
casting and the rubber tires look good

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.470 
casting and the rubber tires look good
even<00:01:41.310> though<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.730> wheels<00:01:41.910> are<00:01:42.090> very<00:01:42.210> small

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
even though the wheels are very small

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.910 
even though the wheels are very small
there<00:01:42.660> is<00:01:42.720> some<00:01:42.900> nice<00:01:43.050> detailing<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.830> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
there is some nice detailing with the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
there is some nice detailing with the
wheel<00:01:44.070> nuts<00:01:44.280> visible<00:01:44.760> most<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.600> backhoe

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
wheel nuts visible most of the backhoe

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.540 
wheel nuts visible most of the backhoe
is<00:01:46.110> okay<00:01:46.410> for<00:01:46.620> the<00:01:46.680> scale<00:01:46.950> although<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.520> of

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
is okay for the scale although one of

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.070 
is okay for the scale although one of
the<00:01:47.730> Pistons<00:01:48.150> was<00:01:48.330> bowing<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.720> bit<00:01:48.870> on<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
the Pistons was bowing a bit on the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.870 
the Pistons was bowing a bit on the
review<00:01:49.350> model<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> thing<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.550> really

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
review model but the thing that really

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.460 
review model but the thing that really
doesn't<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:51.480> is<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.840> silver<00:01:52.170> rivets

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
doesn't look right is the silver rivets

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.960 
doesn't look right is the silver rivets
that<00:01:52.620> have<00:01:52.710> been<00:01:52.890> used<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:53.580> they<00:01:53.730> really

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
that have been used and they really

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.780 
that have been used and they really
would<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.150> been<00:01:54.330> so<00:01:54.450> much<00:01:54.570> better<00:01:54.810> painted

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.130 

in<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.060> time<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.450> we'll<00:02:03.630> look<00:02:03.720> at<00:02:03.840> model

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
in this time out we'll look at model

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.440 
in this time out we'll look at model
scales<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.740> 187<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.550> a<00:02:05.580> small<00:02:05.880> scale<00:02:06.150> meaning

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
scales and 187 is a small scale meaning

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.480 
scales and 187 is a small scale meaning
that<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:06.930> unit<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.470> length<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.010> model<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
that one unit of length on the model is

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.460 
that one unit of length on the model is
equivalent<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.090> 87<00:02:09.720> units<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.290> real

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
equivalent to 87 units on the real

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.560 
equivalent to 87 units on the real
machine<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:11.460> a<00:02:11.640> common<00:02:11.940> scale<00:02:12.150> for<00:02:12.330> model

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570

issue on the review model was that the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.730 
issue on the review model was that the
bucket<00:03:38.240> wasn't<00:03:38.540> quite<00:03:38.750> horizontal<00:03:39.440> but<00:03:39.620> you'd

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
bucket wasn't quite horizontal but you'd

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.920 
bucket wasn't quite horizontal but you'd
hardly<00:03:39.890> noticed<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.550> and<00:03:40.850> moving<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.840> the

hardly noticed that and moving to the
back<00:03:42.050> end<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.530> backhoe<00:03:43.190> is<00:03:43.310> quite<00:03:43.520> good<00:03:43.700> also

a<00:04:05.000> nice<00:04:05.180> little<00:04:05.420> touch<00:04:05.720> in<00:04:05.990> that<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.410> pads<00:04:06.770> of

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
a nice little touch in that the pads of

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.760 
a nice little touch in that the pads of
both<00:04:07.280> pivoted<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.080> pads<00:04:09.290> can<00:04:09.470> always<00:04:09.650> be

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
both pivoted so the pads can always be

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.140 
both pivoted so the pads can always be
flat<00:04:10.010> on<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.220> ground<00:04:10.490> it<00:04:10.730> doesn't<00:04:11.000> matter

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
flat on the ground it doesn't matter

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.940 
flat on the ground it doesn't matter
what<00:04:11.360> angle<00:04:11.510> does<00:04:11.840> stabilizer<00:04:12.290> beams<00:04:12.560> are<00:04:12.830> at

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
what angle does stabilizer beams are at

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.250 
what angle does stabilizer beams are at
another<00:04:13.910> plus<00:04:14.210> point<00:04:14.450> is<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.780> cylinders

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
another plus point is that a cylinders

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.780 
another plus point is that a cylinders
on<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.470> stabilizers<00:04:16.130> are<00:04:16.280> stiff<00:04:16.549> enough<00:04:16.609> to

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
on the stabilizers are stiff enough to

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.400 
on the stabilizers are stiff enough to
be<00:04:17.030> able<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.330> hold<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.630> Machine<00:04:17.930> up<00:04:18.109> off<00:04:18.230> its

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
be able to hold the Machine up off its

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.289 
be able to hold the Machine up off its
wheels<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:18.920> it<00:04:19.040> can<00:04:19.070> produce<00:04:19.520> a<00:04:19.850> realistic

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
wheels so it can produce a realistic

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.620 
wheels so it can produce a realistic
pose<00:04:21.400> but<00:04:22.400> on<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.760> less<00:04:22.910> good<00:04:23.060> side<00:04:23.360> the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
pose but on the less good side the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.510 
pose but on the less good side the
stabilizers<00:04:24.380> don't<00:04:24.590> really<00:04:24.830> retract<00:04:25.220> fully

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
stabilizers don't really retract fully

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.610 
stabilizers don't really retract fully
so<00:04:26.450> when<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:26.750> fold<00:04:26.990> them<00:04:27.110> up<00:04:27.230> they<00:04:27.380> still

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
so when you fold them up they still

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.110 
so when you fold them up they still
stick<00:04:27.890> out<00:04:28.040> a<00:04:28.070> long<00:04:28.310> way<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:28.940> looks

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
stick out a long way and it looks

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.090 
stick out a long way and it looks
unrealistically<00:04:29.720> wide<00:04:30.260> compared<00:04:30.890> to<00:04:30.950> how<00:04:31.040> the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
unrealistically wide compared to how the

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.610 
unrealistically wide compared to how the
real<00:04:31.370> machine<00:04:31.670> would<00:04:31.850> be<00:04:31.880> in<00:04:32.380> some<00:04:33.380> way<00:04:33.500> this

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
real machine would be in some way this

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.380 
real machine would be in some way this
is<00:04:33.770> a<00:04:33.800> tiny<00:04:34.100> scale<00:04:34.430> model<00:04:34.790> so<00:04:34.910> inevitably

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
is a tiny scale model so inevitably

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.600 
is a tiny scale model so inevitably
there<00:04:35.630> are<00:04:35.780> some<00:04:35.960> compromises<00:04:36.310> but<00:04:37.310> it's<00:04:37.460> just

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
there are some compromises but it's just

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.400 
there are some compromises but it's just
a<00:04:37.730> pity<00:04:37.910> that<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.150> large<00:04:38.420> silver<00:04:38.750> rivet<00:04:39.110> so

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
a pity that the large silver rivet so

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.080 
a pity that the large silver rivet so
obviously<00:04:39.890> reduce<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.460> ability<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:40.970> the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
obviously reduce the ability of the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.450 
obviously reduce the ability of the
model<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.570> look<00:04:41.720> authentic<00:04:42.190> apart<00:04:43.190> from<00:04:43.310> that

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
model to look authentic apart from that

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.890 
model to look authentic apart from that
the<00:04:43.640> details<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.180> features<00:04:44.510> of<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:44.750> model

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
the details and features of the model

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.070 
the details and features of the model
are<00:04:45.200> quite<00:04:45.530> reasonable
