but<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:21.990> am<00:01:22.110> not<00:01:22.409> too<00:01:22.560> crazy<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.950> would<00:01:23.130> have

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
but I am not too crazy I would have

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.560 
but I am not too crazy I would have
liked<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> little<00:01:23.939> bit<00:01:24.090> more<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
liked to see a little bit more of the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
liked to see a little bit more of the
black<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.080> orange<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> front<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> go

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
black and the orange on the front to go

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.249 
black and the orange on the front to go
along<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> green<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.360> every<00:01:27.960> once<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
along with the green and every once in a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.170 
along with the green and every once in a
while<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.159> sort<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.520> lost<00:01:29.820> back

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
while they do just get sort of lost back

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.399 
while they do just get sort of lost back
there<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.930> thought<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.350> were

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
there I really thought that they were

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.560 
there I really thought that they were
just<00:01:31.590> built<00:01:31.829> into<00:01:32.009> his<00:01:32.220> arms<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> anime<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
just built into his arms in the anime it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.929 
just built into his arms in the anime it
was<00:01:33.720> only<00:01:33.869> once<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.200> built<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:35.280> mobile

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
was only once I built the this mobile

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.880 
was only once I built the this mobile
suit<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.420> plastic<00:01:36.810> model<00:01:37.079> form<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.860> I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
suit in plastic model form that I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.770 
suit in plastic model form that I
noticed<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.369> they<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.729> detachable<00:01:39.270> they

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
noticed that they are detachable they

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.690 
noticed that they are detachable they
are<00:01:39.990> poseable<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.740> again<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.280> much

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
are poseable just again not that much

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.149 
are poseable just again not that much
just<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.119> single<00:01:42.390> poly<00:01:42.630> cap<00:01:42.930> there<00:01:43.170> could<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
just a single poly cap there could be a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.980 
just a single poly cap there could be a
little<00:01:44.340> bit<00:01:44.549> better<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.420> seal<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
little bit better the seal for the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.210 
little bit better the seal for the
silver<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> great<00:01:47.040> thing

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
silver is going to be a great thing

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.350 
silver is going to be a great thing
except<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.729> fact<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.180> going

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
except for the fact that it's not going

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.300 
except for the fact that it's not going
to<00:01:48.450> fit<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:48.780> too<00:01:49.079> perfectly<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:50.189> are

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
to fit on there too perfectly you are

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.859 
to fit on there too perfectly you are
going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.610> getting<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> same<00:01:51.119> old<00:01:51.360> hand<00:01:51.600> so

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
there are going to be a lot of

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.139 
there are going to be a lot of
repetitive<00:01:53.100> elements<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.850> putting<00:01:54.060> these

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
repetitive elements for putting these

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.569 
repetitive elements for putting these
vagin<00:01:54.540> guys<00:01:54.720> together<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.740> head<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.490> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
vagin guys together the head is going to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.920 
vagin guys together the head is going to
be<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> little<00:01:56.909> bit<00:01:57.090> dull<00:01:57.299> compared<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
be a little bit dull compared to the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.420 
be a little bit dull compared to the
rest<00:01:58.110> at<00:01:58.380> first<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.040> thought<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> yellow

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
rest at first I thought the yellow

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.770 
rest at first I thought the yellow
wasn't<00:01:59.850> going<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.119> enough<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.509> bring<00:02:00.659> them

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
wasn't going to be enough to bring them

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.209 
wasn't going to be enough to bring them
alive<00:02:01.049> compared<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> advanced<00:02:01.950> grade

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
alive compared to the advanced grade

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.920 
alive compared to the advanced grade
when<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.939> see<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.360> there<00:02:03.509> though<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.810> is

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
when you do see it on there though it is

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.330 
when you do see it on there though it is
going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> draw<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.380> eyes<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.100> aren't

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
over on your shelf if you try to pose

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.009 
over on your shelf if you try to pose
them<00:03:28.370> because<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.239> tail<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.690> be<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> little

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
them because that tail can be a little

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.720 
them because that tail can be a little
bit<00:03:30.200> annoying<00:03:30.410> but<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.130> gonna<00:03:31.310> still<00:03:31.580> be<00:03:31.610> a

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
bit annoying but it is gonna still be a

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.370 
bit annoying but it is gonna still be a
solid<00:03:32.180> weapon<00:03:32.480> here<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.900> it's<00:03:33.019> not<00:03:33.170> gonna<00:03:33.290> be

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
solid weapon here and it's not gonna be

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.720 
solid weapon here and it's not gonna be
like<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.739> Zenoss<00:03:34.040> where<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.280> only<00:03:34.430> have<00:03:34.519> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
like the Zenoss where you only have the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.310 
like the Zenoss where you only have the
one<00:03:34.910> choice<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.450> they<00:03:35.510> argue<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.870> include<00:03:36.170> the

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
one choice and they argue to include the

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.380 
one choice and they argue to include the
beam<00:03:36.440> sabers<00:03:36.920> because<00:03:37.700> by<00:03:37.850> having<00:03:38.180> this<00:03:38.269> a

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
beam sabers because by having this a

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.880 
beam sabers because by having this a
door<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:38.600> gun<00:03:38.840> here<00:03:39.140> you're<00:03:39.290> just<00:03:39.320> gonna<00:03:39.650> double

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
door a gun here you're just gonna double

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.680 
door a gun here you're just gonna double
his<00:03:40.160> firepower<00:03:40.640> or<00:03:40.820> so<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.299> seems

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
his firepower or so it seems

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.600 
his firepower or so it seems
and<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:42.380> posing<00:03:42.709> possibilities<00:03:43.280> because

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
and the posing possibilities because

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.830 
and the posing possibilities because
then<00:03:43.760> you've<00:03:43.880> got<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.120> shooting<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.630> the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
then you've got the shooting and the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.420 
then you've got the shooting and the
slashing<00:03:45.320> I<00:03:45.440> think<00:03:45.920> they<00:03:46.040> look<00:03:46.220> fantastic

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
slashing I think they look fantastic

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.340 
slashing I think they look fantastic
together<00:03:47.000> because<00:03:47.480> you<00:03:47.570> can<00:03:47.690> do<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.049> many<00:03:48.230> of

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
together because you can do so many of

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.350 
together because you can do so many of
those<00:03:48.440> crouched<00:03:48.830> up<00:03:49.070> ball<00:03:49.340> type<00:03:49.640> attacks

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
those crouched up ball type attacks

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.759 
those crouched up ball type attacks
where<00:03:50.600> you<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:50.900> see<00:03:51.019> that<00:03:51.140> he's<00:03:51.260> ready<00:03:51.560> to

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
where you just see that he's ready to

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.979 
where you just see that he's ready to
spring<00:03:52.040> into<00:03:52.070> action<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.790> overall<00:03:53.660> even

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
spring into action and overall even

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.210 
spring into action and overall even
though<00:03:54.019> you<00:03:54.140> can't<00:03:54.410> move<00:03:54.590> those<00:03:54.769> wings<00:03:55.010> that

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
though you can't move those wings that

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.979 
though you can't move those wings that
much<00:03:55.459> they<00:03:56.030> are<00:03:56.180> gonna<00:03:56.329> provide<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:56.840> a

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
much they are gonna provide that a

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.360 
much they are gonna provide that a
little<00:03:57.230> bit<00:03:57.350> of<00:03:57.470> dynamicism

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
little bit of dynamicism

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.340 
little bit of dynamicism
and<00:03:58.489> overall<00:03:59.239> he's<00:03:59.450> gonna<00:03:59.630> look<00:03:59.780> great<00:04:00.019> so<00:04:00.290> you

and overall he's gonna look great so you
can<00:04:00.500> almost<00:04:00.650> imagine<00:04:00.890> that<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.370> would<00:04:01.489> be<00:04:01.610> nice

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
can almost imagine that it would be nice

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.220 
can almost imagine that it would be nice
to<00:04:02.060> be<00:04:02.150> getting<00:04:02.390> an<00:04:02.480> action<00:04:02.750> base<00:04:02.900> with<00:04:03.079> him

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
to be getting an action base with him

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.350 
to be getting an action base with him
similar<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.709> what<00:04:03.829> we<00:04:03.920> got<00:04:03.950> with<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.280> h2<00:04:04.730> but

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
similar to what we got with the h2 but

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.460 
similar to what we got with the h2 but
hopefully<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:05.810> can<00:04:05.840> pick<00:04:06.079> one<00:04:06.230> of<00:04:06.320> those<00:04:06.410> up

dazzle stuck around from the first
generation<00:05:22.780> on<00:05:22.900> I<00:05:23.170> just<00:05:23.740> think<00:05:23.920> that<00:05:24.010> we<00:05:24.130> may

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
generation on I just think that we may

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.890 
generation on I just think that we may
be<00:05:24.310> more<00:05:24.610> likely<00:05:24.850> to<00:05:24.970> be<00:05:25.240> getting<00:05:25.480> a<00:05:25.570> Master

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
be more likely to be getting a Master

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.510 
be more likely to be getting a Master
Grade<00:05:26.050> of<00:05:26.170> this<00:05:26.350> as<00:05:26.590> opposed<00:05:26.920> to<00:05:27.010> the<00:05:27.160> Zetas

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
Grade of this as opposed to the Zetas

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.370 
Grade of this as opposed to the Zetas
although<00:05:28.150> the<00:05:28.300> Zetas<00:05:28.570> now<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:28.900> has<00:05:29.050> three

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
although the Zetas now it has three

although the Zetas now it has three
color<00:05:29.650> variations<00:05:30.340> how<00:05:30.490> cool<00:05:30.700> would<00:05:30.790> it<00:05:30.880> be<00:05:30.940> if

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
color variations how cool would it be if

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.640 
color variations how cool would it be if
they<00:05:31.240> gave<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.540> a<00:05:31.570> plate<00:05:31.840> of<00:05:31.960> gray<00:05:32.200> red<00:05:32.500> and

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
they gave you a plate of gray red and

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.380 
they gave you a plate of gray red and
yellow<00:05:32.770> so<00:05:33.430> that<00:05:33.460> you<00:05:33.670> could<00:05:33.790> do<00:05:33.850> up<00:05:33.970> a<00:05:34.090> master

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
yellow so that you could do up a master

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.210 
yellow so that you could do up a master
grade<00:05:34.570> at<00:05:34.660> any<00:05:34.810> one<00:05:34.990> of<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.140> colors<00:05:35.470> it<00:05:36.040> would

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
grade at any one of the colors it would

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.530 
grade at any one of the colors it would
be<00:05:36.280> great<00:05:36.640> if<00:05:36.850> we<00:05:36.970> had<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.300> lead<00:05:37.510> a

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
be great if we had the lead a

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.480 
be great if we had the lead a
protagonist<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.530> antagonist<00:05:38.680> in<00:05:39.340> one

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
protagonist and antagonist in one

protagonist and antagonist in one
one-hundredth<00:05:40.000> form<00:05:40.240> model<00:05:40.780> not<00:05:40.930> just

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
one-hundredth form model not just

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.260 
one-hundredth form model not just
gauging<00:05:41.410> builders<00:05:41.890> next<00:05:42.160> to<00:05:42.250> each<00:05:42.340> other<00:05:42.490> but

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
gauging builders next to each other but

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.760 
gauging builders next to each other but
I<00:05:43.300> guess<00:05:43.540> if<00:05:43.750> we<00:05:43.810> see<00:05:44.110> this<00:05:44.260> guy<00:05:44.470> in<00:05:44.650> this

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
I guess if we see this guy in this

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.230 
I guess if we see this guy in this
Mobile<00:05:45.130> Suit<00:05:45.340> last<00:05:45.610> suit<00:05:45.820> of<00:05:45.970> the<00:05:46.060> third

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
Mobile Suit last suit of the third

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.390 
Mobile Suit last suit of the third
generation<00:05:46.419> I<00:05:47.050> certainly<00:05:47.680> think<00:05:47.890> we<00:05:48.010> will<00:05:48.310> be

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
generation I certainly think we will be

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.830 
generation I certainly think we will be
getting<00:05:48.550> a<00:05:48.669> Master<00:05:49.000> Grade<00:05:49.180> considering<00:05:49.750> that

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
getting a Master Grade considering that

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.900 
getting a Master Grade considering that
we<00:05:49.990> haven't<00:05:50.260> got<00:05:50.440> any<00:05:50.650> non<00:05:50.800> grades<00:05:51.100> but<00:05:51.760> then

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
we haven't got any non grades but then

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.220 
we haven't got any non grades but then
again<00:05:52.030> we'll<00:05:52.330> have<00:05:52.450> to<00:05:52.600> see<00:05:52.720> the<00:05:52.870> fate<00:05:53.050> of<00:05:53.080> the

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
again we'll have to see the fate of the

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.270 
again we'll have to see the fate of the
gaff<00:05:53.380> ride<00:05:53.650> and<00:05:53.800> Master<00:05:54.070> Grade<00:05:54.220> and

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
gaff ride and Master Grade and

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.130 
gaff ride and Master Grade and
everything<00:05:54.910> else<00:05:55.060> could<00:05:55.720> we<00:05:55.840> be<00:05:55.930> getting

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
everything else could we be getting

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.170 
everything else could we be getting
anything<00:05:56.350> besides<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.980> a<00:05:57.010> G<00:05:57.280> and<00:05:57.370> H<00:05:57.520> G<00:05:57.760> outside

of<00:05:58.270> a<00:05:58.330> Master<00:05:58.660> Grade<00:05:58.780> I<00:05:58.990> don't<00:05:59.230> think<00:05:59.440> so

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
of a Master Grade I don't think so

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.960 
of a Master Grade I don't think so
but<00:06:00.040> why<00:06:00.160> don't<00:06:00.220> you<00:06:00.370> let<00:06:00.520> me<00:06:00.669> know<00:06:00.790> with<00:06:00.940> a

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
but why don't you let me know with a

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.210 
but why don't you let me know with a

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
course we've got a lot of remould

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.540 
course we've got a lot of remould
possibilities<00:06:05.320> as<00:06:05.500> you<00:06:05.650> saw<00:06:05.860> from<00:06:06.070> the<00:06:06.190> plates

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
very cool addition to anybody shows what

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
the diff just enough changes in

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.640 
the diff just enough changes in
armaments<00:06:12.730> and<00:06:13.120> color<00:06:13.750> scheme<00:06:14.080> can<00:06:14.350> wait<00:06:14.530> to

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
armaments and color scheme can wait to
