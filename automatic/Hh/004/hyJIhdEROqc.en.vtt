low which is 300 lumens then you have a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.580 
low which is 300 lumens then you have a
pulsing<00:00:41.910> low<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.660> great<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.110> commuting

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
pulsing low this is great for commuting

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.549 
pulsing low this is great for commuting
as<00:00:43.800> well<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.790> flashing<00:00:45.059> low<00:00:45.660> which<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.110> 300

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559

great<00:00:48.210> community<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.829> cycles<00:00:50.190> again

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
great community and then it cycles again

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.430 
great community and then it cycles again
through<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.270> turn<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.600> off<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.170> hold<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
this for cycling or mountain biking at

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.810 
this for cycling or mountain biking at
night<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.829> don't<00:00:59.010> really<00:00:59.430> want<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.699> have

you<00:01:03.270> hold<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> power<00:01:03.840> button<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.289> a<00:01:04.470> couple

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
you hold the power button for a couple

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.170 
you hold the power button for a couple
of<00:01:04.830> seconds<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.399> turns<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.000> high

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
of seconds it turns on to high

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810 
of seconds it turns on to high
automatically<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.250> chop<00:01:08.490> just

automatically and then you can chop just
toggle<00:01:09.030> between<00:01:09.270> high<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.689> medium<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
toggle between high and medium back and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.500 
toggle between high and medium back and
forth<00:01:10.950> those<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:11.880> probably<00:01:12.119> all<00:01:12.360> you're

which<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:33.720> good<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.049> commuting

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
which is really good for commuting

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.100 
which is really good for commuting
I<00:01:34.770> even<00:01:35.250> turn<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.790> when<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:36.840> mountain

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
I even turn it on when I'm mountain

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.090 
I even turn it on when I'm mountain
biking<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.439> somebody<00:01:37.680> else<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:38.070> can

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100

see me from the side not that they

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.910 
see me from the side not that they
really<00:01:40.320> have<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> problem<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:42.920> kind

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.780 
of vacillates between you've got the
pulsing<00:01:46.619> mode<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.060> high<00:01:48.960> kind<00:01:49.590> of

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
pulsing mode you have it on high kind of

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.639 
pulsing mode you have it on high kind of
steady<00:01:50.790> mode<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.840> turn<00:01:52.079> off<00:01:52.110> again<00:01:52.500> and
