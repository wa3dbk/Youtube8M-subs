00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.500
 the motorcycles today are 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.200
 equipped with a gearbox or 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.680
 sequential transmission to five or six 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.720
 speeds 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.720
 these gearboxes are 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.580
 forks with your guiding tish them 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.640
 forks are installed on the 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.829
 barrel are three grooves the machined in the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.500
 barrel that guides the 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.780
 movement of fertilizer forks 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.200
 swims are used to change 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.200
 report 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.480
 in this video a gearbox 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.630
 sequential five-report will 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.970
 explained in detail most of 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.400
 motorcycles uses a lever of 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.130
 shifting to the left foot of the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.680
 motorcyclist if lever can be 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.990
 moved up or down 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.990
 to pass the reports 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.990
 sequentially 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.829
 using the change lever 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.059
 speed the motorcyclist moves a 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.100
 assembly together the barrel more 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.110
 turn but she can only 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.110
 60 degree tour 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.590
 small grooves have been machined in 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.020
 the barrel when the barrel turns the 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.039
 fork moves to the left or 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.860
 to the right 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.549
 this way the reports can be 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.549
 past 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.380
 let's see now the gears the wheel 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.479
 exits is on the right 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.030
 in this video the lava tree or 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.689
 exit is mounted inside of 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.810
 the hollow shaft of the input wheels into 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.209
 consequence the input shaft and the tree 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.259
 exits all even keen dependent 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.229
 one of the other 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.929
 the gear wheels in red are fixed 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.509
 on their trees match all 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.220
 the other gears can turn 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.579
 freely on their trees 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.280
 so apart from the road out each 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:19.610
 stationary gear is engaged with a 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.980
 road we are free clutch clutch 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.370
 are used to block the wheels 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.920
 free on the tree to go into 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.500
 first gear the second gear 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.329
 on the left side with some of 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.489
 shadow and claw shopping must be 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.440
 connected to the other part of the shadow and 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.269
 at each riff of the third wheel 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.879
 toothed on the left 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.970
 the second gear on the left 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.459
 is now fixed on the tree because the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.859
 third gear on left side is 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.880
 a fixed wheel in order to go into 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.489
 second gear 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.549
 the will is moved to the side 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.700
 right by the fork so the second 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.880
 will on the right side and is fixed on 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.340
 his tree wheels whose theo ashes do not 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.170
 are not fully engaged but this 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.150
 is not important because it does not 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.209
 transmit no first power 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.739
 and second gear 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.870
 with this guy you drink your speed 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.919
 the motorcyclist can switch to a 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.930
 top speed probed bray just 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:24.139
 to draw the tickets the changes of 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.329
 speed and art and accelerate that 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.220
 will not cause damage to the box and 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.090
 speed if this action is performed 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.090
 correctly
