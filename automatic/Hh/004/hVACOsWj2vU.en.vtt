it's where all electrical goes into

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.449 
it's where all electrical goes into
right<00:02:21.940> well<00:02:22.720> now<00:02:23.290> i'm<00:02:23.470> down<00:02:23.739> electrical<00:02:24.310> I've

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.430 
it he said one line at a time what do I
look<00:04:09.699> for<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.239> was<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.720> first<00:04:10.900> thing<00:04:11.139> has<00:04:11.290> my

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
look for I was the first thing has my

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.250 
look for I was the first thing has my
question<00:04:11.769> power<00:04:12.579> where<00:04:13.239> does<00:04:13.359> the<00:04:13.449> power<00:04:13.720> come

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
question power where does the power come

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.110 
question power where does the power come
from<00:04:14.290> so<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.250> started<00:04:15.579> pulling<00:04:15.849> things<00:04:16.000> down

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
from so I started pulling things down

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.229 
from so I started pulling things down
and<00:04:17.250> disconnected<00:04:18.250> find<00:04:18.639> the<00:04:18.760> power<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.209> i

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
and disconnected find the power so i

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.839 
and disconnected find the power so i
found<00:04:19.570> one<00:04:19.810> wire<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.530> had<00:04:20.680> power<00:04:20.919> well

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
found one wire that had power well

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.820 
found one wire that had power well
that's<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.630> feed<00:04:22.840> well<00:04:23.349> then<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.650> means

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
that's the feed well then that means

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.270 
that's the feed well then that means
these<00:04:24.039> other<00:04:24.250> two<00:04:24.430> were<00:04:24.550> travelers

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
these other two were travelers

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.040 
these other two were travelers
feedin<00:04:25.790> something<00:04:26.090> else<00:04:26.240> or<00:04:26.420> are<00:04:26.630> there

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
feedin something else or are there

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.680 
feedin something else or are there
switch<00:04:27.410> lip<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.639> then<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:28.880> just<00:04:29.090> started<00:04:29.330> you

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
switch lip so then I just started you

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.300 
switch lip so then I just started you
know<00:04:29.780> want<00:04:30.110> 100<00:04:30.560> of<00:04:30.620> time<00:04:30.740> break<00:04:31.070> it<00:04:31.190> down

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
know want 100 of time break it down

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.340 
know want 100 of time break it down
break<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.580> down<00:04:31.730> I<00:04:32.139> disconnected<00:04:33.139> the<00:04:33.200> whole

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
break it down I disconnected the whole

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.390 
break it down I disconnected the whole
thing<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:33.710> then<00:04:34.430> leave<00:04:34.820> 100<00:04:35.330> place<00:04:35.480> back<00:04:35.720> up

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
thing and then leave 100 place back up

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.730 
thing and then leave 100 place back up
work<00:04:37.400> perfect<00:04:37.880> I<00:04:37.970> didn't<00:04:38.240> have<00:04:38.389> one<00:04:38.740> problem

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
work perfect I didn't have one problem

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.900 
work perfect I didn't have one problem
not<00:04:40.550> one<00:04:41.230> so<00:04:42.400> what<00:04:43.400> I'm<00:04:43.520> trying<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.820> teach

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
not one so what I'm trying to teach

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.120 
not one so what I'm trying to teach
today<00:04:44.090> is<00:04:44.330> that<00:04:44.540> I've<00:04:44.810> been<00:04:45.350> an<00:04:45.470> impossible

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
today is that I've been an impossible

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.100 
today is that I've been an impossible
only<00:04:46.550> once<00:04:47.120> in<00:04:47.240> my<00:04:47.300> lifetime<00:04:47.570> there<00:04:47.870> was<00:04:47.960> 30

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
only once in my lifetime there was 30

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.170 
only once in my lifetime there was 30
years<00:04:48.200> ago<00:04:48.410> and<00:04:49.720> I've<00:04:50.720> never<00:04:51.230> ever<00:04:51.500> been<00:04:51.830> an

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
years ago and I've never ever been an

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.030 
years ago and I've never ever been an
impossible<00:04:53.180> again<00:04:53.500> everything<00:04:54.500> is<00:04:54.620> simple

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
impossible again everything is simple

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.330 
impossible again everything is simple
and<00:04:55.400> it's<00:04:56.300> one<00:04:56.840> wire<00:04:57.080> at<00:04:57.200> a<00:04:57.260> time<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.710> would<00:04:58.250> have

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
and it's one wire at a time I would have

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.310 
and it's one wire at a time I would have
been<00:04:58.430> an<00:04:58.550> impossible<00:04:59.120> but<00:04:59.780> then<00:04:59.870> I<00:04:59.960> realized

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
been an impossible but then I realized

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.409 
been an impossible but then I realized
it<00:05:00.620> wasn't<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:01.910> if<00:05:02.000> you've<00:05:02.120> been<00:05:02.210> in<00:05:02.330> a

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
it wasn't so if you've been in a

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.270 
it wasn't so if you've been in a
situation<00:05:02.630> in<00:05:03.020> your<00:05:03.080> life<00:05:03.169> where<00:05:03.560> things<00:05:04.070> are

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
situation in your life where things are

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.020 
situation in your life where things are
impossible<00:05:06.250> maybe<00:05:07.250> they're<00:05:07.490> not<00:05:07.520> maybe

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
impossible maybe they're not maybe

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.620 
impossible maybe they're not maybe
they're<00:05:08.210> just<00:05:08.680> one<00:05:09.680> wiring<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.430> time<00:05:10.640> take<00:05:11.450> your

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
they're just one wiring a time take your

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.680 
they're just one wiring a time take your
time<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.200> just<00:05:12.470> figure<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:13.550> out<00:05:13.610> don't<00:05:14.419> don't

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
time and just figure it out don't don't

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.860 
time and just figure it out don't don't
stress<00:05:15.020> out<00:05:15.200> just<00:05:15.650> relax<00:05:16.640> and<00:05:17.000> go<00:05:17.210> for<00:05:17.450> it<00:05:17.479> now

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
stress out just relax and go for it now

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.080 
stress out just relax and go for it now
that's<00:05:18.140> me<00:05:18.350> one<00:05:19.070> learning<00:05:19.310> curve<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:19.760> I<00:05:19.880> had

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
that's me one learning curve that I had

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.170 
that's me one learning curve that I had
no<00:05:20.570> I<00:05:20.600> hope<00:05:21.140> that<00:05:21.380> helps<00:05:22.070> you<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.490> move<00:05:22.970> you

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
no I hope that helps you and move you

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.650 
no I hope that helps you and move you
forward<00:05:23.500> thank<00:05:24.500> you
