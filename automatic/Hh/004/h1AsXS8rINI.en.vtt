00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
the shoot Vikings it's pretty much the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.890 
the shoot Vikings it's pretty much the
same<00:03:28.850> thing<00:03:28.910> sometimes<00:03:29.270> you<00:03:29.540> have<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.690> fly

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
same thing sometimes you have to fly

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.660 
same thing sometimes you have to fly
around<00:03:30.050> and<00:03:30.380> shoot<00:03:30.830> Vikings<00:03:31.250> at<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.490> same

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
around and shoot Vikings at the same

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.960 
around and shoot Vikings at the same
time<00:03:31.880> literally<00:03:32.330> oh<00:03:32.930> man<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:33.950> hate<00:03:34.490> this<00:03:34.550> game

time literally oh man I hate this game
it<00:03:35.330> really<00:03:35.810> doesn't<00:03:36.290> help<00:03:36.380> that<00:03:36.650> not<00:03:37.070> only<00:03:37.220> is

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
it really doesn't help that not only is

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.340 
it really doesn't help that not only is
the<00:03:37.670> gameplay<00:03:38.030> mind-numbingly<00:03:38.600> boring<00:03:38.870> but

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
the gameplay mind-numbingly boring but

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.860 
the gameplay mind-numbingly boring but
the<00:03:39.440> controls<00:03:39.920> are<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:40.520> slippery<00:03:41.330> and<00:03:41.630> just

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
the controls are so slippery and just

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.490 
the controls are so slippery and just
hard<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.980> use<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.700> was<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.330> was<00:03:44.450> really<00:03:44.810> trying<00:03:45.080> to

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
hard to use I was I was really trying to

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.530 
hard to use I was I was really trying to
get<00:03:45.980> used<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.460> this<00:03:46.610> game's<00:03:46.880> controls<00:03:47.330> but

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
get used to this game's controls but

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.020 
get used to this game's controls but
flying<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.320> dragon<00:03:48.770> is<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.100> slippery<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:49.760> so

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
flying the dragon is so slippery and so

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.850 
flying the dragon is so slippery and so
hard<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.870> do<00:03:51.020> especially<00:03:51.140> when<00:03:51.620> you're<00:03:51.710> trying

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
hard to do especially when you're trying

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.900 
hard to do especially when you're trying
to<00:03:52.040> fly<00:03:52.850> into<00:03:53.210> rings<00:03:53.780> which<00:03:54.560> by<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.010> way<00:03:55.190> the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
to fly into rings which by the way the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.880 
to fly into rings which by the way the
Rings<00:03:56.240> are<00:03:56.570> really<00:03:57.050> important<00:03:57.500> because<00:03:57.620> when

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
Rings are really important because when

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.200 
Rings are really important because when
you<00:03:58.010> fly<00:03:58.250> through<00:03:58.490> them<00:03:58.700> they<00:03:58.850> give<00:03:59.030> you<00:03:59.120> a

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
you fly through them they give you a

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.910 
you fly through them they give you a
speed<00:03:59.540> boost<00:03:59.780> any<00:04:00.050> do<00:04:00.260> if<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.560> don't<00:04:00.740> have

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
speed boost any do if you don't have

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.530 
speed boost any do if you don't have
that<00:04:00.950> speed<00:04:01.400> boost<00:04:01.640> you're<00:04:02.060> not<00:04:02.240> winning

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
that speed boost you're not winning

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.260 
that speed boost you're not winning
because<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.140> enemies<00:04:03.650> AI<00:04:04.190> in<00:04:04.610> this<00:04:04.760> game<00:04:05.000> is

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
because the enemies AI in this game is

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.480 
because the enemies AI in this game is
so<00:04:05.780> cheap<00:04:06.170> sometimes<00:04:06.860> they'll<00:04:07.040> let<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.280> win

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
so cheap sometimes they'll let you win

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.890 
so cheap sometimes they'll let you win
and<00:04:07.760> then<00:04:08.000> guess<00:04:08.180> what<00:04:08.270> I<00:04:08.390> don't<00:04:08.660> know<00:04:08.750> where

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
and then guess what I don't know where

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.570 
and then guess what I don't know where
boom<00:04:09.170> you're<00:04:09.350> losing<00:04:09.740> again<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.250> then<00:04:10.400> you'll

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
boom you're losing again and then you'll

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.980 
boom you're losing again and then you'll
never<00:04:10.820> catch<00:04:11.180> up<00:04:11.390> because<00:04:11.510> you<00:04:11.780> pretty<00:04:11.900> much

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
never catch up because you pretty much

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.350 
never catch up because you pretty much
go<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.620> same<00:04:12.920> speed<00:04:13.250> as<00:04:13.430> every<00:04:13.730> other<00:04:13.760> dragon

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
go the same speed as every other dragon

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.660 
go the same speed as every other dragon
unless<00:04:14.870> you<00:04:15.020> get<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.350> powerup<00:04:15.920> which<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.400> use

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
unless you get a powerup which you use

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.210 
unless you get a powerup which you use
these<00:04:16.910> power-ups<00:04:17.299> to<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.720> course<00:04:17.980> stop<00:04:18.980> other

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
these power-ups to of course stop other

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.830 
these power-ups to of course stop other
players<00:04:19.520> kind<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:19.940> like<00:04:20.060> mario<00:04:20.450> kart<00:04:20.720> but

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
players kind of like mario kart but

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.110 
players kind of like mario kart but
besides<00:04:21.350> that<00:04:21.470> it's<00:04:22.160> really<00:04:22.490> cheap<00:04:22.880> it's

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
besides that it's really cheap it's

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.909 
besides that it's really cheap it's
really<00:04:23.419> hard<00:04:23.750> it's<00:04:23.930> really<00:04:24.080> really<00:04:24.620> boring

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
really hard it's really really boring

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.950 
really hard it's really really boring
and<00:04:25.190> it's<00:04:25.520> also<00:04:25.700> very<00:04:26.060> frustrating

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
and it's also very frustrating

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.540 
and it's also very frustrating
and<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.139> controls<00:04:27.530> just<00:04:28.069> make<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.250> even<00:04:28.460> more

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
and the controls just make it even more

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.580 
and the controls just make it even more
frustrating<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.360> just<00:04:29.720> could<00:04:30.020> not<00:04:30.139> get<00:04:30.289> behind

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
frustrating I just could not get behind

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.080 
frustrating I just could not get behind
the<00:04:30.680> gameplay<00:04:31.009> at<00:04:31.160> all<00:04:31.310> when<00:04:31.759> you're<00:04:31.910> shooting
