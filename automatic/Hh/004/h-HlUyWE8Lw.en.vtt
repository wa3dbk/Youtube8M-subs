Panathinaikos<00:01:37.689> which<00:01:37.899> makes<00:01:38.109> it<00:01:38.200> difficult

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
Panathinaikos which makes it difficult

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.830 
Panathinaikos which makes it difficult
to<00:01:38.680> get<00:01:38.799> into<00:01:38.829> certain<00:01:39.280> hybrids<00:01:39.670> but<00:01:39.880> in<00:01:40.659> this

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
to get into certain hybrids but in this

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.889 
to get into certain hybrids but in this
one<00:01:40.899> it<00:01:41.259> wasn't<00:01:41.590> too<00:01:41.770> much<00:01:41.799> of<00:01:42.219> a<00:01:42.549> problem<00:01:43.000> so

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
one it wasn't too much of a problem so

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.560 
one it wasn't too much of a problem so
there<00:01:44.079> you<00:01:44.109> go<00:01:44.259> now<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:44.890> get<00:01:45.100> those<00:01:45.280> on<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.359> full

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
there you go now to get those on to full

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.389 
there you go now to get those on to full
chemistry<00:01:47.020> I<00:01:47.079> decided<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.590> use<00:01:47.649> another<00:01:48.189> girl

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
chemistry I decided to use another girl

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.130 
chemistry I decided to use another girl
named<00:01:48.640> player<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.240> comes<00:01:49.780> in<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.109> form

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
named player and that comes in the form

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.660 
named player and that comes in the form
of<00:01:50.530> Anand<00:01:51.429> he<00:01:51.789> is<00:01:52.030> from<00:01:52.539> I<00:01:52.719> think<00:01:53.109> it's<00:01:53.289> cas<00:01:53.679> are

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
of Anand he is from I think it's cas are

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.050 
of Anand he is from I think it's cas are
sooner<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.270> he<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.619> fantastic<00:01:57.009> players<00:01:57.670> 82

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
sooner and he is a fantastic players 82

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.029 
sooner and he is a fantastic players 82
place<00:01:58.299> I<00:01:58.509> think<00:01:58.689> he<00:01:58.780> starts<00:01:59.109> as<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.289> CDM

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
place I think he starts as a CDM

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.550 
place I think he starts as a CDM
originally<00:02:00.670> but<00:02:01.270> he<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.630> very<00:02:01.840> very<00:02:02.140> good<00:02:02.350> he

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
originally but he is very very good he

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.980 
originally but he is very very good he
has<00:02:02.679> 74<00:02:03.219> defending<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:03.939> he<00:02:04.179> sort<00:02:04.359> of<00:02:04.450> balances

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
has 74 defending and he sort of balances

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.539 
has 74 defending and he sort of balances
the<00:02:05.049> team<00:02:05.350> out<00:02:05.499> nicely<00:02:05.770> because<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.280> rest<00:02:06.460> of

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
the team out nicely because the rest of

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:07.889 
the team out nicely because the rest of
the<00:02:06.609> players<00:02:06.789> are<00:02:06.999> quite<00:02:07.179> attacking<00:02:07.689> in<00:02:07.810> the

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
the players are quite attacking in the

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.960 
the players are quite attacking in the
midfield<00:02:08.050> so<00:02:08.500> there<00:02:08.709> you<00:02:08.800> go<00:02:08.830> he<00:02:09.489> goes<00:02:09.670> into

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
midfield so there you go he goes into

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.970 
midfield so there you go he goes into
the<00:02:10.060> team<00:02:10.269> so<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.840> hybridize<00:02:11.379> this<00:02:11.620> up<00:02:11.769> further

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
the team so to hybridize this up further

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.950 
the team so to hybridize this up further
I<00:02:12.190> decided<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.849> put<00:02:13.090> someone<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.599> would<00:02:13.720> get

I decided to put someone that would get

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.630 
I decided to put someone that would get
him<00:02:14.080> on<00:02:14.200> full<00:02:14.530> chemistry<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.280> came<00:02:15.490> from

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
him on full chemistry and that came from

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.300 
him on full chemistry and that came from
his<00:02:15.850> teammate<00:02:16.480> who<00:02:17.080> year<00:02:17.470> who<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.160> a

all so to get him onto full chemistry I

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.420 
all so to get him onto full chemistry I
had<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.960> use<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.140> right-back<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:36.040> was<00:02:36.220> from

SAT<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.660> very<00:02:52.990> decent<00:02:53.230> right<00:02:53.710> back<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.610> that's

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
SAT a very decent right back so that's

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.130

the sore right side of the pitch

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.230 
the sore right side of the pitch
complete<00:02:56.710> I<00:02:56.890> moved<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> left<00:02:58.060> side

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
complete I moved on to the left side

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.780 
complete I moved on to the left side
from<00:02:58.540> here<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:58.990> put<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.070> some<00:03:00.250> players<00:03:00.520> that<00:03:00.730> I

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
from here and put in some players that I

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.930 
from here and put in some players that I
thought<00:03:01.000> we'd<00:03:01.180> do<00:03:01.360> well<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.810> team<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:02.940> at

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
thought we'd do well in the team so at

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.580 
thought we'd do well in the team so at
the<00:03:04.210> left<00:03:04.420> mid<00:03:04.660> position<00:03:04.870> we're<00:03:05.260> going<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.530> be

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
the left mid position we're going to be

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.800 
the left mid position we're going to be
using<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:06.130> Dutch<00:03:06.760> player<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.360> get<00:03:07.510> some

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
using a Dutch player to get some
