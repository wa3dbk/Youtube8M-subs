toothpick with a little wiggle will do

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.890 
toothpick with a little wiggle will do
just<00:01:55.320> fine<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:56.850> only<00:01:57.030> want<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.540> create

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
just fine you will only want to create

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.050 
just fine you will only want to create
between<00:01:58.440> four<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.800> six<00:01:59.370> holes<00:01:59.760> in<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
between four and six holes in the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.090 
between four and six holes in the
plastic<00:02:00.360> any<00:02:00.780> more<00:02:01.200> than<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.920> nuts

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
plastic any more than that and the nuts

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.770 
plastic any more than that and the nuts
have<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> better<00:02:02.610> chance<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:03.060> escaping<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
have a better chance of escaping and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.970 
have a better chance of escaping and
that<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.200> definitely<00:02:04.710> not<00:02:04.860> what<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.460> want<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
that is definitely not what we want and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.350 
that is definitely not what we want and
that's<00:02:07.980> pretty<00:02:08.160> much<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.430> you<00:02:08.790> just<00:02:09.149> leave

coming back and this is the reason for
having<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.520> little<00:02:26.850> holes<00:02:27.060> we<00:02:27.600> don't<00:02:27.810> want<00:02:27.960> the

gnats<00:02:31.680> quite<00:02:32.010> quickly<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.640> walked<00:02:33.209> away<00:02:33.390> and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
gnats quite quickly I walked away and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.900 
gnats quite quickly I walked away and
twenty<00:02:34.620> minutes<00:02:34.740> later<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.250> came<00:02:35.430> back<00:02:35.610> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
twenty minutes later it came back and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.000 
twenty minutes later it came back and
there<00:02:36.030> was<00:02:36.180> probably<00:02:36.390> 15<00:02:37.110> gnats<00:02:37.350> inside<00:02:37.770> this

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
there was probably 15 gnats inside this

little cup
the<00:02:40.450> gnats<00:02:40.660> will<00:02:40.870> fly<00:02:41.140> around<00:02:41.200> quite<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.920> bit

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
the gnats will fly around quite a bit

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.030 
the gnats will fly around quite a bit
and<00:02:42.400> try<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.730> escape<00:02:43.300> but<00:02:43.930> inevitably<00:02:44.680> they

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
and try to escape but inevitably they

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.949 
and try to escape but inevitably they
will<00:02:45.069> become<00:02:45.519> tired<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.180> fall<00:02:46.569> into<00:02:46.870> the

this cup on the counter I'm going to
peel<00:02:55.280> off<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.610> plastic<00:02:56.030> wrap<00:02:56.270> now<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.840> can

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
peel off the plastic wrap now so you can

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.320 
peel off the plastic wrap now so you can
see<00:02:57.320> what<00:02:57.800> an<00:02:57.920> effective<00:02:58.460> NAT<00:02:58.730> killer<00:02:59.030> this

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
see what an effective NAT killer this

a<00:03:34.910> little<00:03:35.090> gruesome<00:03:35.360> I<00:03:35.780> would<00:03:36.320> go<00:03:36.440> ahead<00:03:36.680> and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
a little gruesome I would go ahead and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.050 
a little gruesome I would go ahead and
use<00:03:36.980> something<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.370> does<00:03:37.580> not<00:03:37.700> see-through

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
use something that does not see-through

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.000 
use something that does not see-through
that<00:03:38.840> way<00:03:39.020> just<00:03:39.260> looks<00:03:39.380> like<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.620> have<00:03:39.770> a<00:03:39.800> mug

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
that way just looks like you have a mug

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.680 
that way just looks like you have a mug
on<00:03:40.160> your<00:03:40.340> counter<00:03:40.640> instead<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.180> bug<00:03:41.390> killing
