independent garden centers you can see
it<00:00:42.870> right<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.290> that's<00:00:43.500> trained<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.130> a<00:00:44.190> flat

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
it right here that's trained on a flat

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.610 
it right here that's trained on a flat
trellis<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:46.050> what's<00:00:46.380> nice<00:00:46.590> about

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
trellis and that's what's nice about

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
trellis and that's what's nice about
this<00:00:47.100> plant<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.730> versatile<00:00:48.239> well

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
this plant is so versatile well

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.060 
this plant is so versatile well
sometimes<00:00:49.230> when<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.560> get<00:00:49.739> them<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
sometimes when you get them on the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.350 
sometimes when you get them on the
trellis<00:00:50.310> you<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:50.790> don't<00:00:51.000> know<00:00:51.150> how<00:00:51.300> to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
trellis you really don't know how to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.240 
trellis you really don't know how to
keep<00:00:51.630> it<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.930> shape<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.680> see<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.040> kind

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
keep it in shape you can see it's kind

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.400 
keep it in shape you can see it's kind
of<00:00:53.340> getting<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.730> Medusa<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.540> fact<00:00:54.810> as<00:00:55.020> cool

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
of getting like Medusa in fact as cool

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.780 
of getting like Medusa in fact as cool
and<00:00:55.560> clear<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:55.920> around<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> gutter<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.700> you

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
and clear up around the gutter and you

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.450 
and clear up around the gutter and you
really<00:00:57.149> don't<00:00:57.420> want<00:00:57.720> that<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.290> happen<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:59.160> what

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
really don't want that to happen so what

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.580 
really don't want that to happen so what
I<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.790> do<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.480> first<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.410> I

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
I like to do on this is first of all I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.979 
I like to do on this is first of all I
just<00:01:01.680> take<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> look<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.700> how<00:01:02.880> they<00:01:03.360> did<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.870> you

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
just take a look at how they did it you

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.870 
just take a look at how they did it you
see<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.619> they<00:01:04.769> did<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.159> they<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.549> took<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
see what they did is they just took the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.399 
see what they did is they just took the
green<00:01:06.119> tape<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.749> can<00:01:06.929> find<00:01:07.229> at<00:01:07.380> your

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
green tape that you can find at your

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.379 
green tape that you can find at your
independent<00:01:07.979> garden<00:01:08.100> centers<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.700> they<00:01:09.149> just

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:09.389 
independent garden centers and they just

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:11.480 
independent garden centers and they just
kind<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.749> spread<00:01:10.079> it<00:01:10.109> out<00:01:10.319> over<00:01:10.829> the<00:01:10.950> trellis

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
kind of spread it out over the trellis

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.760 
kind of spread it out over the trellis
itself<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.479> tied<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.289> trials

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
itself and then tied it to the trials

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.039 
itself and then tied it to the trials
not<00:01:13.829> tight<00:01:14.460> keep<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.210> loose<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.810> don't

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
not tight keep it loose so you don't

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.440 
not tight keep it loose so you don't
throttle<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.649> plant<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.850> that's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
throttle the plant at all but that's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.149 
throttle the plant at all but that's
what<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.689> we're<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.139> to<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.740> keep<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.039> in

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
what all we're going to do to keep it in

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.219 
what all we're going to do to keep it in
shape<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.700> first<00:01:20.969> thing<00:01:21.149> I<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.329> is<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.079> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
shape the first thing I do is I do the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.190 
shape the first thing I do is I do the
time<00:01:22.729> before<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> do<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.240> cutting<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.749> that<00:01:24.959> way

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
time before I do the cutting in that way

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
time before I do the cutting in that way
I<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.469> what<00:01:25.889> to<00:01:26.039> cut<00:01:26.249> a<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.459> bit<00:01:26.579> later<00:01:26.850> on

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
I know what to cut a little bit later on

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:48.730 
I know what to cut a little bit later on
so<00:01:27.060> let's<00:01:27.359> do<00:01:27.479> some<00:01:27.659> tying<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.170> now

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.020 

now<00:01:49.740> once<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.069> a<00:01:50.130> while<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.670> one<00:01:50.909> of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
now once in a while you have one of

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.520 
now once in a while you have one of
these<00:01:51.149> that's<00:01:51.360> grow<00:01:51.600> into<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.929> backside<00:01:52.380> of

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
these that's grow into the backside of

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.590 
these that's grow into the backside of
the<00:01:52.619> trellis<00:01:53.069> so<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.420> just

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the trellis so what you can do is just

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.380 
the trellis so what you can do is just
very<00:01:54.960> gingerly<00:01:55.560> pull<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.030> window

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
very gingerly pull it out of the window

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.380 
very gingerly pull it out of the window
like<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.490> feed<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.520> tip<00:02:00.149> right

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
like that and feed that tip right

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.109 
like that and feed that tip right
through<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.740> trellis<00:02:02.100> back<00:02:02.640> through<00:02:02.939> like

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
through the trellis back through like

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.320 
through the trellis back through like
that<00:02:03.329> without<00:02:04.200> breaking<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:05.970> you

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
that without breaking it and then you

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.969 
that without breaking it and then you
really<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> back<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> front<00:02:07.709> where

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
really have it back to the front where

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.680 
really have it back to the front where
you<00:02:08.130> want<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.849> doesn't<00:02:09.060> harm<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
you want it and it doesn't harm the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.750 
you want it and it doesn't harm the
plant<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.500> kind<00:02:10.829> of<00:02:10.890> retrain<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.549> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
plant you can just kind of retrain it to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.729 
plant you can just kind of retrain it to
be<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.120> front<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:19.380> we're<00:02:19.560> keeping

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
be in front like that so we're keeping

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.990 
be in front like that so we're keeping
this<00:02:20.069> plant<00:02:20.400> two<00:02:20.760> dimensionally<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.110> and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
this plant two dimensionally just up and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.460 
this plant two dimensionally just up and
flat<00:02:24.000> like<00:02:24.299> this<00:02:24.540> nothing<00:02:25.049> growing<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.380> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
flat like this nothing growing to the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.080 
flat like this nothing growing to the
backside<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.950> noticed<00:02:26.430> as<00:02:26.549> I<00:02:26.670> was<00:02:26.700> doing<00:02:27.000> this

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
backside I noticed as I was doing this

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.880 
backside I noticed as I was doing this
there's<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.660> rogue<00:02:27.959> branch<00:02:28.349> it's<00:02:28.680> kind<00:02:28.860> of

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
there's a rogue branch it's kind of

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.860 
there's a rogue branch it's kind of
grown<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.400> backside<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.329> don't<00:02:30.540> be<00:02:30.630> afraid

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
grown to the backside so don't be afraid

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.080 
grown to the backside so don't be afraid
to<00:02:31.110> take<00:02:31.260> larger<00:02:31.680> cuts<00:02:31.890> off<00:02:32.099> like<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.549> just

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
to take larger cuts off like this just

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.160 
to take larger cuts off like this just
take<00:02:33.299> it<00:02:33.420> off<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:33.780> okay

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
take it off it's okay

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
tied up to the trellis now I can go

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.970 
tied up to the trellis now I can go
ahead<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.329> do<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.109> rest<00:02:40.139> of<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.560> pruning<00:02:40.799> I

plant<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.060> how<00:03:30.209> it's<00:03:30.480> grown<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:32.010> we<00:03:32.250> just

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
plant and how it's grown that we just

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.009 
plant and how it's grown that we just
followed<00:03:32.670> what<00:03:32.700> they<00:03:33.030> did<00:03:33.209> this<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.720> very
