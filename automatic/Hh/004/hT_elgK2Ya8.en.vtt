00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 today we will close our series on 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.400
 automatic gearbox 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.069
 in this episode the thousand and one ways of 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.950
 use the sequential 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.200
 diego likes having the car on hand that is 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.049
 changing gears for him is a matter of 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.150
 pleasure in an automatic car I drive 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.109
 he manual that likes a touched more 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.330
 this pro diego is also 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.010
 comfort because it shifts gears in 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.800
 use the clutch pedal 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.720
 now has automatic with lever and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.450
 penna o shift also known as 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.030
 butterfly and depends on the car because 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.870
 levers and butterflies are of various 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.960
 species 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.960
 Diego will meet six models 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.600
 the evo 10 lancer has the sequential gearbox 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.340
 on the lever and the turkey shift that is fixed 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.489
 now you will enter the left enter 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.750
 there O tries to climb but now only take 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.300
 ball spin mondale and fetch the brave 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.960
 temper the conventional shift on-the-fly 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.510
 on the right and two on the left 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.460
 this type of more sporty lever has 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.400
 simple logic when you brake 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.020
 rang up and you're coming 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.900
 reducing 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.100
 when you accelerate now it accelerates little 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.830
 time back is much more natural you 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.190
 says accelerate pushing or 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.790
 reducing gear and sub-gear by pulling 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.310
 all the competition exchange you have 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.619
 a sequential shift on the lever it is 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.460
 just like the audi a3 exactly the opposite 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.369
 diego supported 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.440
 I already erred all the margins because finding 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.399
 that were all behind but it's a 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.990
 a matter of habit 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.119
 the mini cup pedal shift 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.950
 It can increase both 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.229
 as right as left 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.759
 the difference is in the backward movement 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.890
 increases magically and reduces 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.200
 butterfly exchange was born on 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.360
 Formula 1 with it the rider does not need 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.369
 release the steering wheel and still wins in 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.679
 agility in the gear shift 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.459
 this year this type of star exchange 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.959
 stock car and where do you think you can trade 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.269
 makes a difference. 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.470
 sportsmanship you do not deviate from 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:24.049
 attention in addition there are other things 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.000
 for example you use gear reduction 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.100
 in braking 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.540
 Do you save fuel on yourself? 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.269
 tire saving 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.690
 you save brake and that the engine brake 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.440
 Helping you to brake is more comfortable. 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.440
 for passengers 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.730
 each has its particular captiva 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.330
 manual changeover and the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.659
 johnny's lever does not stop the shift 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.269
 but that seems seems to feel already feels 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.329
 He has a beautiful goal but he has less 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.909
 a pardon that is playing male not 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:03.540
 is changing the march will be that he is foot 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:06.569
 the West just for you went up and down the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.640
 radio volume will be right under the 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.280
 left the radio name changes 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.129
 station and now that you have there I already 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.620
 here I already have the manual and the manual 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.049
 I'm trading up marches for 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.959
 right and down gears to the 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.329
 left lowering right 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.489
 although there are so many ways of 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.799
 changing gears is good to test the best 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.629
 for you because nothing indicates that on the day 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.220
 they were all alike 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.959
 Actually, what we're talking about 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.329
 precisely the interface of the human being 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.640
 with the vehicle this is a point 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.010
 carmakers value enough because it brings 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.709
 a little bit of the identity of each brand 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.209
 No, I personally think it's 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.190
 unlikely we'll see 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.190
 some standardization in this regard 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.510
 the advice I give to people in 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.100
 start looking for other ways to 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.100
 change the gear that is not only in the 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.990
 drive seek because it is an experience 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.950
 Very cool, I did not know where I was. 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.950
 I learned too much
