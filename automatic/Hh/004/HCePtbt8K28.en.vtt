 let's move on to the realization of 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.030
 the recipe to start we will take 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.850
 50 g of butter and put them in 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.350
 our little bowl and we will spend the whole thing 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.659
 thirty seconds in the microwave 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.670
 while the butter is in the process of 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.810
 melt at the microphone we will take our 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.760
 big bowl and nauseous we will break our 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.790
 eyes and the whole masters like these 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.800
 in the big bowl then we take our 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.300
 100 g of sugar that we put like those 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.979
 This over our eyes, then we will 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.350
 take our general evil and we will 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.040
 put 2 tablespoons like these 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.180
 of maïzena a big bowl after having 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.390
 put cornflour 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.310
 we will take out our butter from the microwave 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.840
 like those who have melted and we will 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.840
 put it over the maïzena 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.130
 after putting the butter we will take 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.770
 our box of sliced ​​pineapple 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.239
 we will open it to the attention not to 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.940
 then cut yourself with our fork 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.989
 and our little bowl we'll take two 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.750
 three slices like these of pineapple 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.450
 so for us it will be three slices 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.730
 normally we need this slice 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.920
 to make the pie 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.150
 we have ten slices here so we take 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.239
 three slices then we will take 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.130
 our knife or with our function is going 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.030
 cut small pieces like these 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.239
 in the little bowl when we finished 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.549
 cut the two three slices as 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.130
 these in small pieces or in point 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.130
 our big bowl and put our little ones 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.640
 slices then giving with our 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.060
 fork 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.060
 we're all going to mix well like these 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.030
 after mixing everything together 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.930
 these are we going to put our big bowl of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.590
 side and take our roll of dough 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:21.320
 broken and open it gently as 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.360
 this then we will put it directly 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.600
 in our dish 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:33.700
 happart of course we know how to wash our hands 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.700
 before we work our paw 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.950

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.600
 edges 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.650
 very slowly so that it makes a 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.020
 little crust with the dough overflowing 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.690
 of the mold when we finished putting our 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.200
