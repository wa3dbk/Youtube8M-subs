normal portal and the other thing the
new<00:00:30.539> thing<00:00:30.779> one<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> new<00:00:31.439> things<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.740> can

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
new thing one of the new things you can

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.120 
new thing one of the new things you can
do<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.480> stack<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.410> portal<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.010> you

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
do is you can stack the portal so you

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.670 
do is you can stack the portal so you
get<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.640> portal<00:00:36.000> there<00:00:36.180> put<00:00:36.930> another<00:00:37.170> portal

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
get one portal there put another portal

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.410 
get one portal there put another portal
and<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.010> goes<00:00:38.160> clear<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.790> actually<00:00:39.149> still

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and it goes clear but it actually still

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.770 
and it goes clear but it actually still
works<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.980> then<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.700> also<00:00:41.910> make<00:00:42.570> them

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
works and then you can also make them

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.869 
works and then you can also make them
very<00:00:43.050> very<00:00:43.649> big<00:00:44.329> this<00:00:45.329> one<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.809> 23<00:00:46.559> by<00:00:46.590> 23

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
very very big this one is 23 by 23

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.660 
very very big this one is 23 by 23
blocks<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.289> pretty<00:00:49.559> huge<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.219> that's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
blocks so it's pretty huge and that's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.240 
blocks so it's pretty huge and that's
the<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.180> saw<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.809> dark<00:00:52.199> M's<00:00:52.440> video<00:00:52.949> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the one that I saw on dark M's video and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.880 
the one that I saw on dark M's video and
they<00:00:53.940> had<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.210> stacked<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.690> whole<00:00:54.809> bunch<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.440> also

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
they had it stacked a whole bunch I also

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
they had it stacked a whole bunch I also
figured<00:00:56.160> out<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.120> make<00:00:57.300> them<00:00:57.510> just

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
figured out that we can make them just

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.630 
figured out that we can make them just
about<00:00:57.870> any<00:00:58.050> shape<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.620> want<00:00:58.649> they<00:00:59.340> don't<00:00:59.460> have

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
about any shape we want they don't have

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.900 
about any shape we want they don't have
to<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.879> square<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.010> 23<00:01:02.670> by

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
to be square so this one here is 23 by

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.750 
to be square so this one here is 23 by
the<00:01:02.969> standard<00:01:03.780> height<00:01:03.960> 3<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.549> can

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the standard height 3 and then you can

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.880 
the standard height 3 and then you can
make<00:01:05.909> them<00:01:06.060> tall<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.540> skinny<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.710> wanted

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
make them tall and skinny but I wanted

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.350 
make them tall and skinny but I wanted
to<00:01:07.950> figure<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.369> what<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.670> could<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.150> them

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to figure out what we could do with them

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.660 
to figure out what we could do with them
so<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.590> doing<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.040> playing<00:01:11.490> around

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
so what I was doing was playing around

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
so what I was doing was playing around
because<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.270> saw<00:01:12.479> lots<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.840> Pigman<00:01:13.229> spawning

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
because I saw lots of Pigman spawning

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410 
because I saw lots of Pigman spawning
and<00:01:14.250> wondering<00:01:14.580> how<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.729> could<00:01:14.909> make<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> gold

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and wondering how we could make a gold

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.760 
and wondering how we could make a gold

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.039 
I'll go up to the top and show you what
I<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:47.909> because<00:01:48.000> I'm<00:01:48.240> gonna<00:01:48.329> turn<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.689> one<00:01:48.899> on

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
I did because I'm gonna turn this one on

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.880 
I did because I'm gonna turn this one on
yet

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
yet

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.730 
yet
and<00:01:50.979> basically<00:01:51.940> what<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.870> did<00:01:52.990> was<00:01:53.260> because

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
and basically what I did was because

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.580 
and basically what I did was because
before<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.729> was<00:01:54.940> just<00:01:55.210> one<00:01:55.479> great<00:01:55.930> big<00:01:55.960> room

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
before this was just one great big room

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.520 
before this was just one great big room
and<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.729> problem<00:01:58.060> was<00:01:58.180> having<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:59.200> couldn't

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
and the problem was having is I couldn't

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.870 
and the problem was having is I couldn't
get<00:01:59.650> them<00:01:59.830> to<00:01:59.950> get<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.220> one<00:02:00.430> end<00:02:00.610> or<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.790> other

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
get them to get to one end or the other

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.690 
get them to get to one end or the other
so<00:02:01.300> that<00:02:01.390> we<00:02:01.510> could<00:02:01.690> kill<00:02:01.900> them<00:02:02.220> so<00:02:03.220> what<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.550> did

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
so that we could kill them so what I did

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.600 
so that we could kill them so what I did
was<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.270> put<00:02:04.479> this<00:02:04.600> into<00:02:05.050> two<00:02:05.350> by<00:02:05.560> four<00:02:05.979> two<00:02:06.190> wide

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
was I put this into two by four two wide

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.359 
was I put this into two by four two wide
portals<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.660> then<00:02:08.170> ran<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.890> water<00:02:09.070> down

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
portals and then ran the water down

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.190 
portals and then ran the water down
channels<00:02:10.000> in<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.270> middle<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:11.020> did<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.140> whole

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
channels in the middle and did a whole

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.060 
channels in the middle and did a whole
series<00:02:11.709> like<00:02:12.100> this<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:14.140> then<00:02:14.260> basically<00:02:14.830> all

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
series like this and then basically all

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.550 
series like this and then basically all
you<00:02:15.190> got<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.459> do<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.900> need<00:02:17.050> some<00:02:17.260> water<00:02:17.380> I

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
you got to do is I need some water I

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.949 
you got to do is I need some water I
guess<00:02:21.840> what<00:02:22.840> happened<00:02:23.140> there

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
guess what happened there

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.180 
guess what happened there
okay<00:02:25.959> so<00:02:26.020> put<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.560> water<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:26.980> each<00:02:27.100> end<00:02:29.190> we

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
okay so put the water in each end we

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.509 
okay so put the water in each end we
grabbed<00:02:30.430> our<00:02:30.580> fire<00:02:31.080> we<00:02:32.080> light<00:02:32.290> them<00:02:32.440> up<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:33.040> we

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
grabbed our fire we light them up and we

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.970 
grabbed our fire we light them up and we
back<00:02:33.790> up<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.239> next<00:02:34.420> one<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:35.140> just<00:02:35.769> keep

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
back up to the next one and just keep

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.430 
back up to the next one and just keep
continue<00:02:36.489> doing<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.790> like<00:02:36.970> that

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
continue doing it like that

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.250 
continue doing it like that
now<00:02:38.440> this<00:02:39.130> isn't<00:02:39.340> terribly<00:02:40.209> efficient<00:02:41.110> like

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
now this isn't terribly efficient like

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.810 
now this isn't terribly efficient like
I'm<00:02:41.380> not<00:02:41.530> getting<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.860> lot<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.190> pigment<00:02:42.519> in

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
I'm not getting a lot of pigment in

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.330 
I'm not getting a lot of pigment in
these<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:44.080> don't<00:02:44.440> know<00:02:44.769> what<00:02:45.040> their<00:02:45.220> normal

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
these I don't know what their normal

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.040 
these I don't know what their normal
spawn<00:02:45.850> rights<00:02:46.150> are<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.570> I'm<00:02:46.630> sure<00:02:46.810> somebody

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
spawn rights are and I'm sure somebody

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.680 
spawn rights are and I'm sure somebody
could<00:02:47.320> tweet<00:02:47.590> us<00:02:48.150> we're<00:02:49.150> not<00:02:49.300> getting<00:02:49.510> any

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
could tweet us we're not getting any

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.570 
could tweet us we're not getting any
pigment<00:02:49.989> maybe<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.590> is<00:02:50.680> affected<00:02:51.130> by<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.340> dark

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
pigment maybe it is affected by the dark

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.860 
pigment maybe it is affected by the dark
from<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.850> day

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.210 

let's<00:02:57.870> turn<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.200> tonight<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.620> let<00:02:58.710> stop<00:02:59.040> this

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
let's turn it tonight and let stop this

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.720 
let's turn it tonight and let stop this
rain

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.509 

okay<00:03:07.700> come<00:03:08.700> on<00:03:08.849> big<00:03:09.300> men<00:03:09.739> where<00:03:10.739> are<00:03:10.980> you

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
okay come on big men where are you

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.780 
okay come on big men where are you
all<00:03:12.150> these<00:03:12.360> were<00:03:12.540> turned<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:12.930> there's<00:03:13.349> one<00:03:13.790> go

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
all these were turned on there's one go

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.009 
all these were turned on there's one go
one<00:03:15.000> there<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:18.060> channels<00:03:18.480> are<00:03:18.569> only<00:03:18.690> one

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
one there and the channels are only one

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.540 
one there and the channels are only one
deep<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.500> guess<00:03:19.709> maybe<00:03:19.950> they<00:03:20.129> could<00:03:20.310> have<00:03:20.400> been

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
deep I guess maybe they could have been

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.970 
deep I guess maybe they could have been
too<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.209> they<00:03:21.780> can<00:03:21.959> still<00:03:22.170> get<00:03:22.380> out<00:03:22.530> look<00:03:22.739> what

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
too and they can still get out look what

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.550 
too and they can still get out look what
basically<00:03:23.400> happens<00:03:24.000> we'll<00:03:24.810> pull<00:03:25.019> top<00:03:25.260> again

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
basically happens we'll pull top again

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.710 
basically happens we'll pull top again
here<00:03:25.769> where<00:03:25.890> it's<00:03:26.010> easier<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.310> get<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:29.330> is<00:03:30.330> they

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
here where it's easier to get in is they

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.070 
here where it's easier to get in is they
fall<00:03:30.959> down<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.380> one<00:03:31.500> channel<00:03:32.630> which<00:03:33.630> takes

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
fall down the one channel which takes

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.080 
fall down the one channel which takes
them<00:03:34.260> into<00:03:34.380> this<00:03:34.530> larger<00:03:35.160> channel<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:35.790> there

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
them into this larger channel and there

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.070 
them into this larger channel and there
goes<00:03:36.239> one<00:03:36.480> now<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.080> then<00:03:37.790> down<00:03:38.790> they<00:03:39.030> go<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.569> I

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
goes one now and then down they go and I

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.380 
goes one now and then down they go and I
just<00:03:40.380> used<00:03:40.590> gravity<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.610> height<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:42.030> kill

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
just used gravity and height to kill

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.420 
just used gravity and height to kill
them<00:03:42.569> now<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:43.410> hasn't<00:03:43.650> really<00:03:43.799> been<00:03:44.040> running

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
them now this hasn't really been running

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.030 
them now this hasn't really been running
all<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.730> long<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.590> what<00:03:46.590> do<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.739> have

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
all that long and what do I have

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.449 
all that long and what do I have
I<00:03:47.310> got<00:03:47.579> 51<00:03:48.180> gold<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:49.319> other<00:03:49.470> stuff<00:03:50.099> you<00:03:50.130> see

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
I got 51 gold the other stuff you see

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.089 
I got 51 gold the other stuff you see
here<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:51.120> just<00:03:51.599> because<00:03:52.019> that<00:03:52.349> top<00:03:52.650> ones<00:03:52.890> not

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
here is just because that top ones not

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.500 
here is just because that top ones not
turned<00:03:53.430> on<00:03:53.519> so<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.790> got<00:03:53.970> other<00:03:54.090> creatures

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
turned on so I got other creatures

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.470 
turned on so I got other creatures
spawning<00:03:54.870> on<00:03:55.110> them<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:56.670> anyways<00:03:57.000> that's<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
spawning on them so anyways that's the

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.960 
spawning on them so anyways that's the
design<00:03:57.810> if<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.560> liked<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:58.799> subscribe<00:03:59.160> be<00:03:59.790> sure
