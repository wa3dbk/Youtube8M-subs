00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.440
 we are counting down because 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.790
 let's say we are missing three given endings 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.470
 that that inter and genoa do not give up 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.440
 we can't do calculations because 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.230
 we must try to win all three 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.140
 start or at least not lose that one 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.009
 end we'll do the accounts 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.800
 we know that the Lazio is a team 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.800
 definitely strong at the end of the season 

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:43.170
 the values are not the only single one 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.329
 unique unique value as it was 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.399
 2 competence to tell a team why 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.500
 the motivations also count a lot 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.370
 a team 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.200
 in that point we say we have 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.960
 caught worst opponent because over 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.570
 to be strong also large 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.910
 reasons 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.560
 I will proceed we must do we must give 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.050
 everything and give the best if we want 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.600
 if we want to win the game 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.240
 I trust because we play at home 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.190
 ours where we almost always did 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.729
 well we only lost once in 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.890
 home against juve we have 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.369
 found moral even after the publisher a 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.680
 udine therefore we are ready we know that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.649
 they are strong that a team 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.500
 organized quality 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.240
 strikers who make little mistakes 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.880
 externals who are very fast good 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.649
 in one against one 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.649
 midfielders who have a big one 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.830
 sense of wall I had to be perfect 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.130
 but as said more g our home e 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.350
 I think as I have said this many times 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.850
 team if it plays a game 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.700
 dry can win against anyone 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.220
 then of course seen that in the week 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.720
 also some of my players but me too 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.340
 in the past I have often called i 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.040
 fans come to the stadium 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.580
 I do it again this time because 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.420
 this one had n't started anyway 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.170
 we say that the matches in the year therefore 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.270
 I hope that tomorrow stadium will be full and that 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.690
 they make you feel the weight of marassi 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.490
 especially to our adversaries 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.430
 if we have only lost at home 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.250
 once it is merit above all 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.550
 also of the fans because they are there anyway 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.960
 you were close tomorrow I want one too 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.190
 bedlam and who support us because they are 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.800
 very important to us 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.480
 then at the end of the game they will be happy 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.490
 they will applaud if they are not happy 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.590
 they can also whistle but during the 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.240
 game 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.010
 I would not even hear a whistle but 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.330
 just encouragement because you think of 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.959
 these guys for all that 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.230
 they did 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.230
 this year they deserved once 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.000
 well
