perfectly<00:01:24.869> obviously<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.939> doesn't<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
perfectly obviously but it doesn't to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.950 
perfectly obviously but it doesn't to
hinder<00:01:27.840> anything<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.880> far<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> light

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
