breakage more than I used to it could be

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.560

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
schedule around that specific thing and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.870 
schedule around that specific thing and
the<00:02:48.590> school<00:02:48.890> was<00:02:48.920> one<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.400> those<00:02:49.550> things<00:02:49.760> that

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
the school was one of those things that

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.020 
the school was one of those things that
I<00:02:50.060> really<00:02:50.959> never<00:02:51.230> had<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.739> set<00:02:52.220> schedule<00:02:52.519> for<00:02:52.820> my
