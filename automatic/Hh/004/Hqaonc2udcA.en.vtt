00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 Hello dear friends of the 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.780
 mathematics hello love math 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.230
 interested here is andrÃ© with one 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.750
 video under the title the derivative of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.310
 potent function with complete 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.949
 prove induction 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.500
 you surely know the formula very well 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:28.490
 sometimes you get them in mathematics 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 teach only carelessly clipped xm 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:38.420
 derived is equal to s x ICS highly n - 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.570
 1 for an element of natural numbers 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.649
 In addition, you could end up zero 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.850
 also with record 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.110
 the derivative for this case would be 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:54.059
 Derivation of yesteryear is almost zero 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.020
 Now a few words to the full 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.300
 induction 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.149
 I 've been to sofatutor 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.500
 looked around and today 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.619

 Nevertheless, I want to be the essence of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.030
 complete induction once more 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.040
 call remembrance 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:28.430
