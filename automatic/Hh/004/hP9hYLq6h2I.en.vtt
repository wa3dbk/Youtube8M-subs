first and foremost I'd like to say that

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.140 
first and foremost I'd like to say that
there's<00:00:09.420> not<00:00:09.630> one<00:00:09.929> way<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.170> hold<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> bow<00:00:11.150> go

there's not one way to hold the bow go
on<00:00:12.269> youtube<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.870> study<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> great<00:00:13.380> masters

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
on youtube and study the great masters

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.359 
on youtube and study the great masters
like<00:00:14.219> heifetz<00:00:14.700> milstein<00:00:15.509> Perlman<00:00:16.470> oistrakh

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
like heifetz milstein Perlman oistrakh

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.760 
like heifetz milstein Perlman oistrakh
etc<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.240> you'll<00:00:18.869> notice<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.260> no<00:00:19.710> two

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
etc and you'll notice that no two

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.010 
etc and you'll notice that no two
violinists<00:00:20.430> hold<00:00:20.880> above<00:00:21.150> exactly<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> same

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
violinists hold above exactly the same

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.310 
violinists hold above exactly the same
way<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:23.180> this<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.300> because<00:00:24.480> no<00:00:25.140> two

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
way and this is because no two

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.439 
way and this is because no two
violinists<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.220> exact<00:00:26.519> same<00:00:26.760> body<00:00:27.060> and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
violinists have the exact same body and

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.030 
violinists have the exact same body and
the<00:00:27.539> exact<00:00:27.869> same<00:00:28.109> hands<00:00:28.970> on<00:00:30.140> each<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.529> have

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the exact same hands on each of you have

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.030 
the exact same hands on each of you have
to<00:00:32.250> find<00:00:32.520> your<00:00:32.940> own<00:00:33.690> low<00:00:34.050> grip<00:00:34.290> which<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.829> most

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to find your own low grip which is most

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.160 
to find your own low grip which is most
comfortable<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.210> which<00:00:36.719> achieved

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
comfortable to you and which achieved

music but just to give you a few ideas

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.020 
music but just to give you a few ideas
I'd<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.059> start<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.629> off<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.989> this

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
I'd like to start you off with this

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.900 
I'd like to start you off with this
first<00:00:48.110> try<00:00:49.110> making<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.559> circle<00:00:49.800> between<00:00:50.399> your

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
first try making a circle between your

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.680 
first try making a circle between your
thumb<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.329> your<00:00:52.100> middle<00:00:53.100> finger<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.699> make

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
thumb and your middle finger and make

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.200 
thumb and your middle finger and make
sure<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.289> always<00:00:55.860> flexible<00:00:56.600> like<00:00:57.600> this

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
sure that it's always flexible like this

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.539 
sure that it's always flexible like this
secondly<00:01:00.210> place<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.379> thumb<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.449> wedge<00:01:03.449> it

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
secondly place the thumb and wedge it

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.880 
secondly place the thumb and wedge it
diagonally<00:01:05.549> onto<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> stick<00:01:06.860> opposite<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
diagonally onto the stick opposite the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.149 
diagonally onto the stick opposite the
middle<00:01:08.159> finger<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.979> hold<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
middle finger as you can see I hold it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.340 
middle finger as you can see I hold it
right<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.479> leather<00:01:12.780> grip<00:01:13.049> where

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
right there on the leather grip where

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.200 
right there on the leather grip where
it's<00:01:13.530> worn<00:01:13.920> away<00:01:14.600> I<00:01:15.740> do<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:17.210> diagonally

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it's worn away I do that diagonally

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.230 
it's worn away I do that diagonally
because<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.170> don't<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.890> poke<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.119> way

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
because I don't want to poke all the way

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.080 
because I don't want to poke all the way
through<00:01:21.509> with<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> thumb<00:01:22.790> locking<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> into

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
through with the thumb locking it into

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.780 
through with the thumb locking it into
place<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.900> don't<00:01:25.200> really<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.130> just

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
place and I don't really want it on just

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.289 
place and I don't really want it on just
the<00:01:26.970> side<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.509> stick<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.729> have

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the side of the stick so as to not have

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.929 
the side of the stick so as to not have
the<00:01:30.479> bow<00:01:30.630> fall<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.200> my<00:01:31.380> hands<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.520> if<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.729> had<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the bow fall on my hands but if I had to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.760 
the bow fall on my hands but if I had to
choose<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.540> or<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> other<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.200> would<00:01:34.439> choose

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
choose one or the other I would choose

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.929 
choose one or the other I would choose
the<00:01:34.979> loser<00:01:35.340> grip<00:01:35.900> in<00:01:36.900> all<00:01:37.619> cases<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the loser grip in all cases because you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.210 
the loser grip in all cases because you
want<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.630> least<00:01:39.810> amount<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.170> tension<00:01:40.409> most

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
want the least amount of tension most

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.760 
want the least amount of tension most
around<00:01:41.549> amount<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.030> relaxation<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:43.170> your<00:01:43.560> body

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
around amount of relaxation in your body

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.370 
around amount of relaxation in your body
at<00:01:43.979> all<00:01:44.070> times<00:01:44.399> when

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
at all times when

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.820 
at all times when
that<00:01:46.380> will<00:01:46.700> create<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.000> largest<00:01:48.840> sound<00:01:49.470> and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
that will create the largest sound and

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.990 
that will create the largest sound and
give<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.060> most<00:01:52.880> facility<00:01:53.880> while<00:01:54.180> playing

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
give you the most facility while playing

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.570 
give you the most facility while playing
the<00:01:57.000> other<00:01:57.120> reason<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.040> you<00:01:59.040> need<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.400> be

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
the other reason is that you need to be

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.960 
the other reason is that you need to be
able<00:01:59.730> to<00:02:00.200> angle<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.230> bow<00:02:01.670> differently<00:02:02.670> at

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
able to angle the bow differently at

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.810 
able to angle the bow differently at
different<00:02:03.030> points<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.440> music<00:02:04.860> for

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
different points in the music for

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.370 
different points in the music for
example<00:02:06.300> if<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.540> want<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.780> play<00:02:06.900> a<00:02:06.930> date<00:02:07.230> Tasha

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
example if you want to play a date Tasha

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.820 
example if you want to play a date Tasha
a<00:02:07.650> stroke<00:02:08.010> you'll<00:02:08.790> want<00:02:09.119> flat<00:02:09.510> hair<00:02:09.810> trying<00:02:10.619> to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
a stroke you'll want flat hair trying to

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.300 
a stroke you'll want flat hair trying to
get<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.310> most<00:02:11.550> sound<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.900> instrument<00:02:13.310> so

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
get the most sound on the instrument so

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.850 
get the most sound on the instrument so
in<00:02:14.460> this<00:02:14.580> case<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.850> would<00:02:15.120> keep<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.600> boat

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
in this case you would keep the boat

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:25.970 
in this case you would keep the boat
perpendicular<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> strings<00:02:24.620> but<00:02:25.620> rather

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
perpendicular to the strings but rather

stroke it's not I don't think going to
happen<00:04:17.880> like<00:04:18.030> this<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:19.229> need<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.889> fingers<00:04:20.220> to

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
happen like this you need the fingers to

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.250 
happen like this you need the fingers to
be<00:04:20.430> flexible<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.150> your<00:04:21.269> dirt<00:04:21.389> in<00:04:21.780> order<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.139> go

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
to that as well for starters I would try

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.420 
to that as well for starters I would try
to<00:04:35.970> keep<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.360> on<00:04:36.449> top<00:04:37.039> giving<00:04:38.039> you<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.340> ability

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
to keep it on top giving you the ability

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.080 
to keep it on top giving you the ability
to<00:04:38.789> shift<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.449> weight<00:04:39.600> at<00:04:39.870> any<00:04:40.229> moment<00:04:41.090> for

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
to shift the weight at any moment for

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.810 
to shift the weight at any moment for
string<00:04:42.360> crossings<00:04:42.960> this<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:44.160> comes<00:04:44.430> in<00:04:44.580> most

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
string crossings this it comes in most

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.469 
string crossings this it comes in most
handy<00:04:45.270> for<00:04:46.199> example<00:04:46.940> changing<00:04:47.940> from<00:04:48.150> G<00:04:50.449> to<00:04:51.449> the
