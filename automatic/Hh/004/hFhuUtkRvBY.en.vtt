I'll<00:02:17.830> have<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.280> answer<00:02:18.700> for<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:19.090> if<00:02:19.300> not<00:02:20.050> I'll

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
I'll have the answer for you if not I'll

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.780 
I'll have the answer for you if not I'll
just<00:02:20.290> sound<00:02:20.680> really<00:02:21.070> convincing<00:02:21.670> and

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
just sound really convincing and

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.240 
just sound really convincing and
hopefully<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.180> will<00:02:22.450> make<00:02:22.960> that<00:02:23.140> work

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
hopefully I will make that work

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.770 
hopefully I will make that work
really<00:02:25.000> there<00:02:25.150> are<00:02:25.240> two<00:02:25.330> different<00:02:25.600> kind<00:02:25.750> of

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
really there are two different kind of

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.540 
really there are two different kind of
classifications<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.740> wine<00:02:26.950> typically

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
classifications of wine typically

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.640 
classifications of wine typically
there's<00:02:27.760> white<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.270> there's<00:02:28.450> red<00:02:28.720> now<00:02:29.350> what<00:02:29.620> I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
there's white and there's red now what I

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.740 
there's white and there's red now what I
want<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:29.920> point<00:02:30.070> out<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.490> I<00:02:30.580> grabbed<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.540> couple

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
want to point out is I grabbed a couple

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.960 
want to point out is I grabbed a couple
bottles<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.380> show<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.650> for<00:02:33.370> example<00:02:33.400> this

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
bottles to show you for example this

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.060 
bottles to show you for example this
white<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.540> vino<00:02:34.930> Verde<00:02:35.320> if<00:02:35.710> you<00:02:35.860> were<00:02:35.950> to

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
white is a vino Verde if you were to

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.390 
white is a vino Verde if you were to
hold<00:02:36.310> this<00:02:36.520> poor<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.450> wine<00:02:37.830> next<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.100> glass

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
hold this poor this wine next to a glass

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.280 
hold this poor this wine next to a glass
of<00:02:39.640> water<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.270> would<00:02:40.420> look<00:02:40.510> exactly<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.140> same

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
of water it would look exactly the same

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.790 
of water it would look exactly the same
so<00:02:42.160> it's<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.370> very<00:02:42.400> crystal<00:02:43.360> clear<00:02:43.660> wine<00:02:43.959> does

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
so it's a very crystal clear wine does

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.520 
so it's a very crystal clear wine does

Chardonnay<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.560> Chardonnay<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.900> actually

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
Chardonnay this Chardonnay is actually

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.070 
Chardonnay this Chardonnay is actually
aged<00:03:11.230> in<00:03:11.739> an<00:03:11.950> oak<00:03:12.010> barrel<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.910> fact<00:03:13.600> you

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
aged in an oak barrel in fact you

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.720 
aged in an oak barrel in fact you
probably<00:03:14.230> can't<00:03:14.739> see<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.070> barrel<00:03:15.340> here<00:03:15.580> but

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
probably can't see the barrel here but

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.820 
probably can't see the barrel here but
we<00:03:15.820> actually<00:03:15.940> have<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.330> Wohlers<00:03:16.810> I'm<00:03:17.050> oak

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
we actually have a Wohlers I'm oak

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.320 
we actually have a Wohlers I'm oak
barrel<00:03:19.050> that<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.830> Chardonnay<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.730> aged<00:03:22.060> in

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
barrel that the Chardonnay is aged in

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.720 
barrel that the Chardonnay is aged in
which<00:03:22.870> causes<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.530> white<00:03:23.709> wine<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.340> become

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
which causes the white wine to become

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.770 
which causes the white wine to become
more<00:03:25.630> creamy<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.800> lot<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:26.950> people<00:03:27.070> associate

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
more creamy so a lot of people associate

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.270 
more creamy so a lot of people associate
Chardonnay<00:03:28.780> with<00:03:29.019> like<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.200> buttery<00:03:29.650> creamy

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
Chardonnay with like a buttery creamy

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.970 
Chardonnay with like a buttery creamy
texture<00:03:31.000> style<00:03:31.420> wine<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.440> would<00:03:32.560> be<00:03:32.590> a

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
texture style wine and that would be a

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.350 
texture style wine and that would be a
Chardonnay<00:03:33.910> that's<00:03:34.209> been<00:03:34.450> aged<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:35.080> oak<00:03:35.350> so

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
Chardonnay that's been aged in oak so

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.460 
Chardonnay that's been aged in oak so
just<00:03:37.360> wanted<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.690> show<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.110> different

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
just wanted to show you the different

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.229 
just wanted to show you the different
colors<00:03:38.950> of<00:03:38.980> what's<00:03:39.580> considered<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
colors of what's considered a

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.120 
colors of what's considered a
classification<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.989> white<00:03:41.170> wine<00:03:41.290> now<00:03:42.100> a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
classification of white wine now a

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.340 
classification of white wine now a
classification<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:43.269> red<00:03:43.480> wine<00:03:43.510> which<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:44.170> the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
classification of red wine which is the

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.330 
classification of red wine which is the
the<00:03:44.950> other<00:03:45.130> could<00:03:46.120> be<00:03:46.150> as<00:03:46.450> light<00:03:46.840> as<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:47.709> rose<00:03:48.040> a

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
the other could be as light as a rose a

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.800 
the other could be as light as a rose a
so<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.730> lot<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.030> people<00:03:49.150> are<00:03:49.420> familiar<00:03:49.570> with

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
so a lot of people are familiar with

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.100 
so a lot of people are familiar with
Rose<00:03:50.080> days<00:03:50.350> that's<00:03:50.950> classified<00:03:51.549> as<00:03:51.820> white

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
Rose days that's classified as white

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.870 
Rose days that's classified as white
essentially<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.200> Rose<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.860> a<00:03:53.890> red<00:03:54.459> grape

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
essentially the Rose a is a red grape

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.180 
essentially the Rose a is a red grape
but<00:03:55.600> once<00:03:55.780> they<00:03:56.019> start<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.560> press<00:03:56.920> in

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
but once they start to press in

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.400 
but once they start to press in
fermentation<00:03:57.549> they<00:03:58.120> use<00:03:58.420> just<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.110> little<00:03:59.320> bit

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
fermentation they use just a little bit

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.780 
fermentation they use just a little bit
of<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> grape<00:03:59.890> skin<00:04:00.250> so<00:04:00.459> there's<00:04:00.610> a<00:04:00.670> little

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
of the grape skin so there's a little

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.090 
of the grape skin so there's a little
bit<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:01.000> contact<00:04:01.480> when<00:04:01.750> they<00:04:01.840> press<00:04:02.200> which

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
bit of contact when they press which

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.620 
bit of contact when they press which
gives<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.519> little<00:04:03.700> bit<00:04:03.910> color<00:04:04.150> that's<00:04:04.480> where

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
gives it a little bit color that's where

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.940 
gives it a little bit color that's where
the<00:04:04.690> red<00:04:04.840> comes<00:04:05.079> from<00:04:05.290> comes<00:04:05.470> from<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.769> red

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
the red comes from comes from the red

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.069 
the red comes from comes from the red
grape<00:04:06.190> so<00:04:06.940> one<00:04:07.090> thing<00:04:07.299> to<00:04:07.450> always<00:04:07.600> know<00:04:07.720> is

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
grape so one thing to always know is

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.400 
grape so one thing to always know is
that<00:04:08.290> white<00:04:08.560> wines<00:04:08.860> always<00:04:09.820> come<00:04:10.660> from<00:04:11.200> white

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
that white wines always come from white

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.430 
that white wines always come from white
grapes<00:04:11.739> red<00:04:12.400> wines<00:04:12.640> always<00:04:13.390> from<00:04:13.989> red<00:04:14.170> grapes

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
grapes red wines always from red grapes

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.890 
grapes red wines always from red grapes
and<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:14.890> difference<00:04:15.760> again<00:04:16.030> is<00:04:16.299> rose<00:04:16.690> a

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
and the difference again is rose a

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.400 
and the difference again is rose a
meaning<00:04:17.260> there's<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:17.680> slight<00:04:18.370> skin

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
meaning there's just slight skin

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.810 
meaning there's just slight skin
connection<00:04:20.410> or<00:04:20.530> color<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:20.979> then<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.790> course

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
connection or color and then of course

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.330 
connection or color and then of course
Reds<00:04:22.419> can<00:04:22.630> go<00:04:22.780> with<00:04:22.990> deep<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.590> as<00:04:23.740> dark<00:04:24.100> as

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
Reds can go with deep and as dark as

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.700 
Reds can go with deep and as dark as
what<00:04:24.970> we<00:04:25.090> have<00:04:25.300> here<00:04:25.600> is<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.720> Cabernet<00:04:26.320> from

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
what we have here is a Cabernet from

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.770 
what we have here is a Cabernet from
California<00:04:27.640> actually<00:04:28.360> it's<00:04:28.479> a<00:04:28.570> little

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
California actually it's a little

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.360 
California actually it's a little
deceiving<00:04:29.080> because<00:04:29.440> this<00:04:29.770> is<00:04:29.950> actually<00:04:30.100> a

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
deceiving because this is actually a

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.410 
deceiving because this is actually a
black<00:04:30.669> bottle<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.330> really<00:04:31.600> can't<00:04:31.810> see<00:04:31.900> it

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
black bottle so you really can't see it

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.210 
black bottle so you really can't see it
or<00:04:32.540> one<00:04:32.750> but<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.350> can<00:04:33.560> tell<00:04:33.680> you<00:04:33.740> if<00:04:33.890> we<00:04:34.010> were<00:04:34.130> to

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
or one but I can tell you if we were to

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.650 
or one but I can tell you if we were to
pour<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:34.580> it<00:04:34.670> would<00:04:34.790> look<00:04:34.880> very<00:04:35.120> similar<00:04:35.480> to

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
pour it it would look very similar to

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.420 
pour it it would look very similar to
this<00:04:38.530> all<00:04:39.530> right<00:04:41.560> so<00:04:42.560> that's<00:04:43.100> kind<00:04:43.340> of<00:04:43.370> the

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
this all right so that's kind of the

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.590 
this all right so that's kind of the
classification<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.510> red<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.990> whites

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
classification of the red and the whites

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.260 
classification of the red and the whites
here<00:04:47.600> since<00:04:48.230> we've<00:04:48.440> opened<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.890> wine<00:04:49.010> shop

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
here since we've opened the wine shop

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.970 
here since we've opened the wine shop
what<00:04:50.270> we've<00:04:50.390> noticed<00:04:50.660> is<00:04:51.020> that<00:04:51.050> people<00:04:51.680> really

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
what we've noticed is that people really

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.580 
what we've noticed is that people really
don't<00:04:52.220> know<00:04:52.400> how<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.580> sample<00:04:53.030> wine<00:04:53.420> I<00:04:53.690> know

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.180 
that sounds kind of funny that you don't
know<00:04:56.780> how<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.900> sample<00:04:57.140> wine<00:04:57.440> because<00:04:57.650> most

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190

their time on really the smell of the
line<00:05:16.400> because<00:05:16.520> that's<00:05:16.790> really<00:05:17.150> where<00:05:17.480> the

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
line because that's really where the

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.630 
line because that's really where the
sensation<00:05:18.170> of<00:05:18.230> wine<00:05:18.440> comes<00:05:18.740> from<00:05:18.830> so<00:05:19.460> that's

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640

the nose of the wine ok so again there

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.440 
the nose of the wine ok so again there
are<00:05:27.830> four<00:05:28.100> steps<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.610> first<00:05:28.640> step<00:05:28.940> we've<00:05:29.240> kind

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
are four steps the first step we've kind

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.390 
are four steps the first step we've kind
of<00:05:29.510> talked<00:05:29.750> about<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.110> color<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:31.010> second

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
of talked about the color the second

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.510 
of talked about the color the second
step<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:31.850> actually<00:05:32.720> the<00:05:32.960> body<00:05:33.230> of<00:05:33.560> wine<00:05:33.830> now

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
step is actually the body of wine now

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.920 
step is actually the body of wine now
it's<00:05:34.730> actually<00:05:34.910> the<00:05:35.180> center<00:05:35.480> of<00:05:35.510> your<00:05:35.600> tongue

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
it's actually the center of your tongue

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.240 
it's actually the center of your tongue
when<00:05:36.140> you<00:05:36.230> take<00:05:36.410> a<00:05:36.440> drink<00:05:36.740> that<00:05:36.890> actually

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
when you take a drink that actually

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.730 
when you take a drink that actually
determines<00:05:37.790> that<00:05:38.000> you<00:05:38.390> can<00:05:38.570> tell<00:05:38.810> if<00:05:39.110> what<00:05:39.620> the

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
determines that you can tell if what the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.590 
determines that you can tell if what the
body<00:05:39.950> of<00:05:40.130> the<00:05:40.430> style<00:05:40.970> of<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.210> body<00:05:41.390> of<00:05:41.540> the

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
body of the style of the body of the

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.330 
body of the style of the body of the
wine<00:05:41.810> is<00:05:42.020> it's<00:05:42.470> I<00:05:42.620> they're<00:05:42.770> going<00:05:42.890> to<00:05:42.950> be<00:05:43.070> light

have two percent you have whole milk if
you<00:05:53.210> were<00:05:53.300> to<00:05:53.390> lay<00:05:53.540> all<00:05:53.780> three<00:05:54.140> out<00:05:54.260> and<00:05:54.470> close

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
you were to lay all three out and close

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.190 
you were to lay all three out and close
your<00:05:54.710> eyes<00:05:55.040> and<00:05:55.070> try<00:05:55.850> it<00:05:56.000> you<00:05:56.480> probably<00:05:56.780> be

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
your eyes and try it you probably be

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.660 
your eyes and try it you probably be
able<00:05:57.260> to<00:05:57.470> tell<00:05:57.680> the<00:05:57.800> difference<00:05:57.830> between<00:05:58.250> all

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
able to tell the difference between all

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.930 
able to tell the difference between all
three<00:05:59.110> okay<00:06:00.110> not<00:06:00.500> necessarily<00:06:01.130> by<00:06:01.340> just<00:06:01.640> taste

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
three okay not necessarily by just taste

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.910 
three okay not necessarily by just taste
but<00:06:02.510> also<00:06:02.660> by<00:06:02.990> just<00:06:03.230> the<00:06:03.290> weight<00:06:03.590> because

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
but also by just the weight because

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.050 
but also by just the weight because
that's<00:06:04.130> something<00:06:04.310> that<00:06:04.460> your<00:06:04.670> tongue<00:06:04.850> does

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
that's something that your tongue does

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.540 
that's something that your tongue does
it<00:06:05.180> determines<00:06:05.930> the<00:06:06.020> weight<00:06:06.230> ok<00:06:06.920> so<00:06:07.220> the<00:06:07.340> same

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
it determines the weight ok so the same

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.220 
it determines the weight ok so the same
is<00:06:07.730> true<00:06:07.760> with<00:06:08.060> wine<00:06:09.400> the<00:06:10.600> third<00:06:11.600> step<00:06:11.630> which

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
is true with wine the third step which

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.920 
is true with wine the third step which
is<00:06:12.290> the<00:06:12.590> most<00:06:12.740> often<00:06:13.280> skip<00:06:14.270> this<00:06:14.480> step<00:06:14.750> but

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
is the most often skip this step but

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.330 
is the most often skip this step but
it's<00:06:14.990> probably<00:06:15.410> one<00:06:15.590> of<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:15.770> most<00:06:15.830> important

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
it's probably one of the most important

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.070 
it's probably one of the most important
steps<00:06:16.610> that's<00:06:17.090> actually<00:06:17.510> the<00:06:17.600> nose<00:06:17.810> of<00:06:18.020> the

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
steps that's actually the nose of the

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.370 
steps that's actually the nose of the
wine<00:06:18.230> and<00:06:18.470> that<00:06:18.950> is<00:06:19.600> when<00:06:20.600> we<00:06:20.630> pour<00:06:21.080> the<00:06:21.110> glass

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
wine and that is when we pour the glass

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.350 
wine and that is when we pour the glass
who's<00:06:22.160> going<00:06:22.340> to<00:06:22.400> sample<00:06:22.820> wine<00:06:23.000> let's<00:06:23.240> go

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
who's going to sample wine let's go

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.110 
who's going to sample wine let's go
ahead<00:06:23.480> and<00:06:23.630> pour<00:06:24.500> some<00:06:25.220> glasses<00:06:25.460> for<00:06:25.880> you<00:06:25.940> guys

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120
