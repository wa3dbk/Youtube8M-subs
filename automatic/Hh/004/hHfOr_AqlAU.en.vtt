00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
opening this box by cutting see you on

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:14.459 
opening this box by cutting see you on
top<00:01:04.970> should<00:01:05.970> be

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:21.249 

nice<00:01:15.469> thorough<00:01:15.770> phone<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.600> guess<00:01:20.810> we<00:01:21.020> slide

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
nice thorough phone and I guess we slide

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.399 
nice thorough phone and I guess we slide
out<00:01:21.530> like<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:22.509> there's<00:01:23.509> still<00:01:23.600> some<00:01:23.899> stuff

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
out like that there's still some stuff

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.600 
out like that there's still some stuff
in<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:24.950> books<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:25.460> now<00:01:25.670> it's<00:01:25.819> empty<00:01:27.549> okay<00:01:28.549> so

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
in the books and now it's empty okay so

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.389 
in the books and now it's empty okay so
let's<00:01:29.000> start<00:01:29.240> with<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.509> heatsink<00:01:29.869> then<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:30.860> I

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
let's start with the heatsink then so I

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.499 
let's start with the heatsink then so I
guess<00:01:32.000> this<00:01:32.209> is<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.509> protect<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.049> fan<00:01:34.509> try

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
guess this is to protect the fan try

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.130 
guess this is to protect the fan try
taking<00:01:35.929> it<00:01:36.049> off<00:01:38.679> alright<00:01:39.679> so<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.100> is<00:01:41.140> the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
taking it off alright so this is the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.330 
taking it off alright so this is the
heatsink<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:42.740> fan<00:01:43.720> you<00:01:44.720> can<00:01:44.869> see<00:01:44.989> there<00:01:45.110> is<00:01:45.200> a

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
heatsink and fan you can see there is a

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.059 
heatsink and fan you can see there is a
120<00:01:46.340> mm<00:01:46.489> your<00:01:46.700> fan<00:01:46.909> on<00:01:47.119> this<00:01:47.479> heat<00:01:47.989> sink<00:01:48.229> but

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
120 mm your fan on this heat sink but

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.469 
120 mm your fan on this heat sink but
you<00:01:49.130> can<00:01:49.250> also<00:01:49.369> install<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.819> one<00:01:50.149> hundred<00:01:50.450> and

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
you can also install a one hundred and

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.169 
you can also install a one hundred and
forty<00:01:50.899> millimeter<00:01:51.229> fan<00:01:51.500> in<00:01:51.679> here<00:01:51.709> and<00:01:52.179> this

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
forty millimeter fan in here and this

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.020 
forty millimeter fan in here and this
fan<00:01:53.569> has<00:01:53.929> a<00:01:54.259> 3-pin<00:01:54.829> connector<00:01:54.860> has<00:01:55.489> a<00:01:55.549> black

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
fan has a 3-pin connector has a black

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.160 
fan has a 3-pin connector has a black
cable<00:01:57.009> there<00:01:58.009> are<00:01:58.189> five<00:01:58.489> pipes<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.599> as<00:02:00.049> you

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
cable there are five pipes and as you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.919 
cable there are five pipes and as you
can<00:02:00.319> see<00:02:00.349> this<00:02:00.530> is<00:02:00.739> a<00:02:00.920> low<00:02:01.250> profile<00:02:01.880> cpu<00:02:02.630> cooler

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
can see this is a low profile cpu cooler

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.380 
can see this is a low profile cpu cooler
so<00:02:03.079> this<00:02:03.259> might<00:02:03.439> be<00:02:03.560> useful<00:02:03.679> for<00:02:04.209> builds<00:02:05.209> like

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
so this might be useful for builds like

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.130 
so this might be useful for builds like
ofir<00:02:06.049> pc<00:02:06.679> builds<00:02:07.189> and<00:02:07.479> well<00:02:08.479> if<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.750> need<00:02:08.899> a

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
ofir pc builds and well if you need a

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.680 
ofir pc builds and well if you need a
lower<00:02:09.860> cpu<00:02:10.220> cooler<00:02:10.640> but<00:02:11.030> still<00:02:11.090> want<00:02:11.569> an

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
lower cpu cooler but still want an

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.190 
lower cpu cooler but still want an
aftermarket<00:02:12.170> one<00:02:13.060> alright<00:02:14.060> i'll<00:02:14.810> cover<00:02:14.989> this

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
aftermarket one alright i'll cover this

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.400

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.740 
you would need to follow during the
process<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.720> installation<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:32.660> is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
process of installation this is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.020 
process of installation this is
basically<00:02:33.079> exactly<00:02:33.380> actually<00:02:33.859> the<00:02:34.220> same<00:02:34.489> but

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
basically exactly actually the same but

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.020 
basically exactly actually the same but
probably<00:02:35.389> in<00:02:35.510> few<00:02:35.630> other<00:02:35.780> languages<00:02:37.030> and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
probably in few other languages and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.240 
probably in few other languages and
right<00:02:38.239> here<00:02:38.630> in<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.560> bag<00:02:40.329> we<00:02:41.329> get<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:42.250> thermal

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
right here in the bag we get a thermal

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.440 
right here in the bag we get a thermal
grease<00:02:44.739> few<00:02:45.739> other<00:02:45.950> screws<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:47.150> bolts

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
grease few other screws and bolts

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.910 
grease few other screws and bolts
whatever<00:02:47.959> for<00:02:48.380> installation<00:02:50.920> apparently

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
whatever for installation apparently

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.000 
whatever for installation apparently
there's<00:02:52.099> a<00:02:52.510> resistor<00:02:53.510> here<00:02:53.780> this<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.739> for<00:02:54.769> the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
there's a resistor here this is for the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.159 
there's a resistor here this is for the
fan<00:02:55.340> if<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:55.639> won't<00:02:55.819> have<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.090> run<00:02:56.569> slower<00:02:56.930> so

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
fan if you won't have that run slower so

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.440 
fan if you won't have that run slower so
it<00:02:57.260> would<00:02:57.380> be<00:02:57.470> sight<00:02:57.769> more<00:02:57.980> silent<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:59.359> we

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
it would be sight more silent and we

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.020 
it would be sight more silent and we
have<00:02:59.599> the<00:02:59.720> brackets<00:03:00.139> for<00:03:00.380> install<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:03.069> D<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.430> of

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
have the brackets for install a D and of

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.789 
have the brackets for install a D and of
course<00:03:05.419> not<00:03:06.049> forget<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:07.489> backplate<00:03:08.329> and<00:03:08.799> well

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
course not forget the backplate and well

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.210 
course not forget the backplate and well
