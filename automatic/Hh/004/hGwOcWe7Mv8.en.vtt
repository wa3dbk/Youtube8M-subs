we're surrounded by technology but we
don't<00:00:03.389> really<00:00:03.570> know<00:00:03.810> how<00:00:03.959> it<00:00:04.110> works<00:00:04.140> like<00:00:04.650> we

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
don't really know how it works like we

don't really know how it works like we

they would look to other oh my god
and<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.720> jumpstart<00:00:22.380> science<00:00:22.920> we'd<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.369> a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and we jumpstart science we'd be a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.890 
and we jumpstart science we'd be a
wonder<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> age<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.300> tell<00:00:24.600> them<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> things

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
wonder the age we tell them the things

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.120 
wonder the age we tell them the things
they<00:00:25.230> would<00:00:25.320> never<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.650> heard<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.949> would<00:00:26.039> be

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.990 
it sends information all over the world
and<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.260> draws<00:00:40.469> information<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:41.550> god<00:00:41.850> they

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
and it draws information in my god they

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299 
and it draws information in my god they
say<00:00:42.149> sketching<00:00:42.629> furiously<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.530> amazing

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
say sketching furiously that is amazing

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.400 
say sketching furiously that is amazing
and<00:00:44.550> how<00:00:44.850> does<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.120> keep<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.840> well<00:00:46.289> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and how does it keep going well it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.000 
and how does it keep going well it's
connected<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> wall<00:00:47.219> by<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> cable<00:00:49.010> what

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
connected to the wall by a cable what

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:58.750 
connected to the wall by a cable what
happens<00:00:50.340> there<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.750> really<00:00:51.960> know

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
that lives in the wall and it makes the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.510 
that lives in the wall and it makes the
pictures<00:01:10.850> change<00:01:11.180> that's<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:11.689> just<00:01:11.899> sit<00:01:12.080> event

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
pictures change that's it just sit event

they<00:01:13.520> are<00:01:13.549> walking<00:01:13.970> away<00:01:14.299> at<00:01:14.509> this<00:01:14.659> stage<00:01:14.930> and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
they are walking away at this stage and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.200 
they are walking away at this stage and
you<00:01:15.229> were<00:01:15.320> touching<00:01:15.590> your<00:01:15.860> weight<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:17.000> think

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
you were touching your weight we think

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.700 
you were touching your weight we think
on<00:01:17.270> a<00:01:17.299> fridge<00:01:17.570> in<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.780> future<00:01:18.049> our<00:01:18.200> fridge<00:01:18.680> is

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
on a fridge in the future our fridge is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.469 
on a fridge in the future our fridge is
an<00:01:18.890> amazing<00:01:19.250> machine<00:01:19.369> because<00:01:19.940> it<00:01:20.060> keeps<00:01:20.149> cold

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
an amazing machine because it keeps cold

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.180 
an amazing machine because it keeps cold
on<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.780> inside<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:21.259> we<00:01:21.380> can<00:01:21.500> put<00:01:21.649> food<00:01:21.890> into

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
on the inside and we can put food into

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.190 
on the inside and we can put food into
it<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.549> it<00:01:22.640> doesn't<00:01:22.909> rot<00:01:23.149> and<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:23.630> means<00:01:23.840> we

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
it and it doesn't rot and that means we

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.320 
it and it doesn't rot and that means we
are<00:01:24.229> healthier<00:01:24.710> for<00:01:24.920> longer<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.399> work<00:01:25.520> harder

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
are healthier for longer and work harder

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.899 
are healthier for longer and work harder
that's<00:01:26.570> amazing<00:01:27.289> and<00:01:27.380> how<00:01:27.530> does<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:27.740> work<00:01:27.909> it

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
that's amazing and how does it work it

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.210 
that's amazing and how does it work it

hums humming is in some way related to
the<00:01:34.340> cold<00:01:35.470> what<00:01:36.470> keeps<00:01:36.679> it<00:01:36.830> humming<00:01:37.330> that's

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
the cold what keeps it humming that's

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.280 
the cold what keeps it humming that's
connected<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:38.929> the<00:01:39.110> wars

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.140 

this<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.160> same<00:01:43.370> thing<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:43.820> made<00:01:44.000> the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
this is the same thing that made the

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.600 
this is the same thing that made the
pictures<00:01:44.480> change<00:01:45.070> would<00:01:46.070> be<00:01:48.370> did<00:01:49.370> you<00:01:49.400> imagine
