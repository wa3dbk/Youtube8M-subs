00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.939 

first<00:00:00.420> of<00:00:00.539> all<00:00:00.599> I<00:00:00.659> start<00:00:01.020> off<00:00:01.140> with<00:00:01.380> the<00:00:01.530> Thule

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
first of all I start off with the Thule

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.619 
first of all I start off with the Thule
Air<00:00:02.040> but<00:00:03.110> that's<00:00:04.110> all<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.560> did<00:00:04.740> for<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.009> was

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:05.629 
Air but that's all I did for that was

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.270 
Air but that's all I did for that was
MTO<00:00:06.770> cut<00:00:07.770> off<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.040> top<00:00:08.750> fairly<00:00:09.750> simple<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.290> then

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
MTO cut off the top fairly simple I then

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.030 
MTO cut off the top fairly simple I then
got<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> beer<00:00:11.790> bottle<00:00:12.170> cleaned<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.349> got<00:00:13.830> rid<00:00:13.980> of

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
got a beer bottle cleaned it got rid of

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.510 
got a beer bottle cleaned it got rid of
all<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.030> paper<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.710> I<00:00:16.710> then<00:00:17.100> super

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
all of the paper on it and I then super

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.120 
all of the paper on it and I then super
glued<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:18.119> protractor<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.170> top<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.560> leaf<00:00:19.770> or

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
glued a protractor to the top of leaf or

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.330 
glued a protractor to the top of leaf or
one<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.670> those<00:00:21.800> triangle<00:00:22.800> rule<00:00:22.980> or<00:00:23.130> things

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
one of those triangle rule or things

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.490 
one of those triangle rule or things
that<00:00:23.400> no<00:00:23.550> one<00:00:23.640> ever<00:00:23.730> uses<00:00:24.109> but<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.230> all<00:00:25.350> that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
that no one ever uses but that all that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.670 
that no one ever uses but that all that
supposed<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.160> hold<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.730> top<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
supposed to do is hold it on top of the

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.890 
supposed to do is hold it on top of the
bigger<00:00:28.680> ball<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.310> you'll<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> pictures

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
bigger ball and you'll see the pictures

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.049 
bigger ball and you'll see the pictures
later<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.890> worked<00:00:32.070> after<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
later on and how it worked after the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.720 
later on and how it worked after the
glue<00:00:33.239> set<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.930> want<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.579> get<00:00:35.579> your

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
glue set what you want to do is get your

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.600 
glue set what you want to do is get your
silicon<00:00:36.180> ready<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.719> silicon<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.920> got<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> two

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
silicon ready so silicon I got a two

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.200 
silicon ready so silicon I got a two
kilogram<00:00:39.120> 1<00:00:39.300> or<00:00:39.510> 1.5<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.230> think<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.210> literally

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
kilogram 1 or 1.5 I think and literally

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.400 
kilogram 1 or 1.5 I think and literally
it's<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.570> paint<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.050> all<00:00:43.260> you're

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
it's just like paint and all you're

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.729 
it's just like paint and all you're
doing<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.800> mixing<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.610> paint<00:00:45.590> mixing<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
doing is mixing the paint mixing the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.740 
doing is mixing the paint mixing the
silicon<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.610> you're<00:00:47.760> adding<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.180> if

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
silicon and then you're adding in if

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.869 
silicon and then you're adding in if
this<00:00:49.140> blue<00:00:49.500> dye<00:00:49.770> which<00:00:50.219> was<00:00:50.399> actually<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
this blue dye which was actually the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.779 
this blue dye which was actually the
hardening<00:00:51.360> stuff<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.829> make<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.399> made

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
hardening stuff so make that and made

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.479 
hardening stuff so make that and made
sure<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.180> evenly<00:00:54.449> blue<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.160> then<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> put

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
sure it was evenly blue and then I put

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.700 
sure it was evenly blue and then I put
it<00:00:56.579> inside<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.239> mold<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.079> rig<00:00:58.379> ready

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it inside the mold with the rig ready

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.029 
it inside the mold with the rig ready
and<00:00:59.180> that<00:01:00.180> was<00:01:00.270> fairly<00:01:00.510> easy<00:01:00.629> took<00:01:01.109> about<00:01:01.649> 20

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and that was fairly easy took about 20

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.709 
and that was fairly easy took about 20
minutes<00:01:02.120> make<00:01:03.120> sure<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> put<00:01:03.539> something

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
minutes make sure to put something

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.440 
minutes make sure to put something
really<00:01:04.080> heavy<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.500> top<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.729> stable

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
really heavy on top of it and stable

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.600 
really heavy on top of it and stable
because<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> thickness<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
because because the thickness of the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.539 
because because the thickness of the
silicon<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.240> really<00:01:09.630> buoyant<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.310> want<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
silicon is really buoyant so you want to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.149 
silicon is really buoyant so you want to
be<00:01:11.670> careful<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.380> so<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.650> let<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.920> set

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
be careful of that so we let that set

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.030 
be careful of that so we let that set
for<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.400> birthday<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.270> said<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.170> let<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.350> set<00:01:16.590> 15

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
for a birthday I said it let it set 15

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.020 
for a birthday I said it let it set 15
hours<00:01:17.340> because<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> was<00:01:17.700> absolutely<00:01:17.970> perfect

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
hours because it was absolutely perfect

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.980 
hours because it was absolutely perfect
after<00:01:18.540> 15<00:01:18.869> hours<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:20.430> cut<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.759> off<00:01:20.900> cut<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
after 15 hours I then cut it off cut the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
after 15 hours I then cut it off cut the
plastic<00:01:22.200> off<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.920> cut<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.850> half

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
plastic off and cut it in half

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.950 
plastic off and cut it in half
essentially<00:01:25.049> leaving<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.070> bottom<00:01:26.340> intact<00:01:26.960> so

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
essentially leaving the bottom intact so

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.929 
essentially leaving the bottom intact so
it<00:01:27.990> was<00:01:28.229> almost<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.650> split<00:01:29.100> except<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
it was almost like split except for the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.240 
it was almost like split except for the
bomb<00:01:30.470> this<00:01:31.470> although<00:01:31.740> easel<00:01:32.340> ease<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:34.250> access

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
bomb this although easel ease of access

heat up and you want to turn you want to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.449 
heat up and you want to turn you want to
cook<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.629> slowly<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.709> want<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:25.040> bring<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.430> a

boil<00:02:25.730> very<00:02:26.090> slowly<00:02:26.360> or<00:02:26.540> else<00:02:26.569> it<00:02:26.870> will<00:02:27.049> go

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
boil very slowly or else it will go

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.940 
boil very slowly or else it will go
yellow<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.860> it'll<00:02:28.099> make<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.400> look<00:02:28.579> horrible

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
yellow and it'll make it look horrible

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.589 
yellow and it'll make it look horrible
because<00:02:30.950> that's<00:02:31.280> because<00:02:31.609> the<00:02:31.909> the<00:02:32.390> sugar

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
because that's because the the sugar

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.970 
because that's because the the sugar
caramelize<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:34.040> learned<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:34.939> the<00:02:35.269> hard<00:02:35.480> way

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
caramelize I learned that the hard way

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.890 
caramelize I learned that the hard way
that<00:02:37.120> took<00:02:38.120> roughly<00:02:38.900> about<00:02:39.170> 35<00:02:39.650> minutes

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
that took roughly about 35 minutes

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.089 
that took roughly about 35 minutes
apparently<00:02:41.900> supposed<00:02:42.109> to<00:02:42.230> get<00:02:42.349> up<00:02:42.439> to<00:02:42.560> 150

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
apparently supposed to get up to 150

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.710 
apparently supposed to get up to 150
degrees<00:02:43.310> which<00:02:43.909> it<00:02:44.030> didn't<00:02:44.269> have<00:02:44.420> that<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
degrees which it didn't have that the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.960 
degrees which it didn't have that the
long<00:02:44.870> before<00:02:45.290> which<00:02:46.069> I<00:02:46.310> think<00:02:46.579> I've<00:02:46.700> suffered

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
long before which I think I've suffered

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.640 
long before which I think I've suffered
for<00:02:47.239> later<00:02:47.510> on<00:02:47.659> so<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.900> think<00:02:48.019> next<00:02:48.319> time<00:02:48.560> we'll

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
for later on so I think next time we'll

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.369 
for later on so I think next time we'll
do<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:49.010> will<00:02:49.129> get<00:02:49.280> from<00:02:49.459> Alberto<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:51.230> after

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
do it I will get from Alberto so after

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.309 
do it I will get from Alberto so after
you've<00:02:51.470> done<00:02:51.590> this<00:02:51.799> ad<00:02:52.069> you<00:02:52.280> die<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:53.200> pour<00:02:54.200> it

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
you've done this ad you die and pour it

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.149 
you've done this ad you die and pour it
into<00:02:54.500> your<00:02:55.190> mold<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:58.090> did<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.329> by<00:03:00.159> pouring

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
into your mold and I did this by pouring

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.949 
into your mold and I did this by pouring
into<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.670> pouring<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.209> bit<00:03:02.389> of<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.629> into<00:03:02.870> the

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
into the pouring a bit of it into the

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.619 
into the pouring a bit of it into the
mold<00:03:03.139> not<00:03:03.530> much<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.099> then<00:03:04.700> coating<00:03:05.239> the

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
mold not much and then coating the

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.539 
mold not much and then coating the
insides<00:03:06.109> of<00:03:06.409> the<00:03:06.560> mold<00:03:06.739> by<00:03:06.980> rolling<00:03:07.430> it

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
insides of the mold by rolling it

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.599 
insides of the mold by rolling it
constantly<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.889> after<00:03:09.889> I<00:03:09.920> felt<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.340> as<00:03:10.459> well

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
constantly and after I felt that as well

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.220 
constantly and after I felt that as well
coated<00:03:10.849> I<00:03:11.209> put<00:03:11.389> it<00:03:11.480> in<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.599> fridge<00:03:11.780> for<00:03:12.109> about

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
coated I put it in the fridge for about

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.039 
coated I put it in the fridge for about
an<00:03:12.379> hour<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.829> a<00:03:12.859> half<00:03:13.329> and<00:03:14.329> that<00:03:14.510> was<00:03:14.629> plenty

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
an hour and a half and that was plenty

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.949 
an hour and a half and that was plenty
of<00:03:15.109> time<00:03:15.349> for<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:18.049> settle<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:20.720> here's<00:03:20.900> a

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
of time for it to settle so here's a

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.150 
of time for it to settle so here's a
results<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:22.989> two<00:03:23.989> probably<00:03:24.799> about<00:03:24.919> a<00:03:24.949> week's

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
results of two probably about a week's

looking ball when it came out it looked
absolutely<00:03:32.480> fine<00:03:33.049> but<00:03:33.829> as<00:03:34.430> soon<00:03:34.609> as<00:03:34.699> it<00:03:34.819> seems

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
to have hit attempt at the room which

room temperature he was on etc it

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.379 
room temperature he was on etc it
started<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.659> bend<00:03:41.900> just<00:03:43.150> holding<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.239> it

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
started to bend just holding it it

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.309 
started to bend just holding it it
started<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.900> melt

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
started to melt

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.890 
started to melt
almost<00:03:45.819> it's<00:03:46.819> very<00:03:47.030> malleable<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:50.000> was<00:03:50.209> pretty

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
almost it's very malleable it was pretty

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.770 
almost it's very malleable it was pretty
hard<00:03:51.169> to<00:03:51.379> understand<00:03:52.250> what's<00:03:52.699> gone<00:03:52.940> wrong<00:03:52.970> and

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
hard to understand what's gone wrong and

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.780 
hard to understand what's gone wrong and
as<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:54.019> see<00:03:54.229> if<00:03:54.409> you<00:03:54.500> can<00:03:54.680> see<00:03:54.859> there<00:03:55.069> there's

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
as you see if you can see there there's

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.339 
as you see if you can see there there's
a<00:03:55.879> lot<00:03:56.120> of<00:03:56.209> this<00:03:56.329> collected<00:03:56.750> at<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.900> bottom<00:03:57.290> of

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
a lot of this collected at the bottom of

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.830 
a lot of this collected at the bottom of
the<00:03:57.560> bowl<00:03:57.919> and<00:03:58.129> I<00:03:59.090> believe<00:03:59.389> that's<00:03:59.690> just

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
the bowl and I believe that's just

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.599 
the bowl and I believe that's just
because<00:03:59.959> when<00:04:00.799> I<00:04:00.829> put<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.099> in<00:04:01.159> the<00:04:01.220> fridge<00:04:01.400> up

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
because when I put it in the fridge up

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.280 
because when I put it in the fridge up
put<00:04:01.729> it<00:04:01.790> up<00:04:01.849> up<00:04:02.030> right<00:04:02.299> so<00:04:02.870> I'm<00:04:02.959> gonna<00:04:03.079> try

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
put it up up right so I'm gonna try

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.250 
put it up up right so I'm gonna try
putting<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.709> on<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:03.949> side<00:04:04.159> the<00:04:04.430> next<00:04:04.760> time<00:04:05.260> so

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
putting it on the side the next time so

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.610 
putting it on the side the next time so
I<00:04:06.709> figured<00:04:06.829> I'd<00:04:07.220> put<00:04:07.430> it<00:04:07.519> back<00:04:07.699> in<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:08.000> fridge

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
I figured I'd put it back in the fridge

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.159 
I figured I'd put it back in the fridge
