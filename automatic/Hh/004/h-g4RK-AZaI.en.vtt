you know what I'm saying anyway so my
only<00:01:09.160> thought<00:01:09.520> kill<00:01:09.729> streak<00:01:09.970> was<00:01:10.210> the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
only thought kill streak was the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.480 
only thought kill streak was the
lightning<00:01:11.020> strike<00:01:11.289> and<00:01:11.860> I<00:01:12.039> was<00:01:12.160> using<00:01:12.310> the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
lightning strike and I was using the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.150 
lightning strike and I was using the
vsat<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.119> UAV<00:01:13.479> so<00:01:13.930> getting<00:01:14.410> 51<00:01:14.830> kills<00:01:15.009> with

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
vsat and UAV so getting 51 kills with

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.950 
vsat and UAV so getting 51 kills with
SVU<00:01:15.490> just<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.180> lightning<00:01:16.420> strike<00:01:16.539> as<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:16.750> lethal

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
SVU just a lightning strike as a lethal

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.840 
SVU just a lightning strike as a lethal
kill<00:01:17.259> streak<00:01:17.440> I<00:01:17.680> think<00:01:18.190> it's<00:01:18.280> pretty<00:01:18.399> decent

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
kill streak I think it's pretty decent

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.310 
kill streak I think it's pretty decent
I'm<00:01:18.910> not<00:01:19.090> saying<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:19.539> it's<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.899> best<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.289> the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.069 
might get to like three shots in the
body<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:51.070> our<00:01:51.460> range<00:01:51.759> which<00:01:52.299> is<00:01:52.329> very<00:01:52.810> powerful

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
body of our range which is very powerful

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.230 
body of our range which is very powerful
but<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.829> job<00:01:54.070> back<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.369> them<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.880> just

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
but the job back to them is that just

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.370 
but the job back to them is that just
cuz<00:01:55.360> they're<00:01:55.479> semi-auto<00:01:55.869> you<00:01:55.990> need<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.229> have<00:01:56.350> a

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
cuz they're semi-auto you need to have a

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.499 
cuz they're semi-auto you need to have a
good<00:01:56.650> trigger<00:01:56.950> finger<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.850> fight<00:01:58.150> in<00:01:58.360> close

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
good trigger finger to fight in close

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.510 
good trigger finger to fight in close
range<00:01:58.540> in<00:01:58.900> most<00:01:59.170> people<00:01:59.560> don't<00:01:59.829> have<00:02:00.040> that<00:02:00.100> so

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
range in most people don't have that so

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.190 
range in most people don't have that so
they<00:02:00.820> will<00:02:00.970> lose<00:02:01.329> like<00:02:01.540> in<00:02:01.630> gunfights<00:02:01.990> in

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
they will lose like in gunfights in

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.950 
they will lose like in gunfights in
close<00:02:02.439> range<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.130> also<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.390> fact<00:02:04.600> they<00:02:04.750> need

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
close range and also the fact they need

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.260 
close range and also the fact they need
to<00:02:05.079> control<00:02:05.439> your<00:02:05.710> aim<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.430> mean<00:02:06.729> your<00:02:06.850> recoil

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
to control your aim I mean your recoil

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.800 
to control your aim I mean your recoil
and<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:09.190> concentrate<00:02:09.910> on<00:02:10.060> shooting<00:02:10.630> bullets

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
and the concentrate on shooting bullets

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.229 
and the concentrate on shooting bullets
like<00:02:11.079> at<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.320> time<00:02:11.560> that's<00:02:12.489> that's<00:02:12.850> kind<00:02:13.150> of

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
like at a time that's that's kind of

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.660 
like at a time that's that's kind of
hard<00:02:13.450> for<00:02:13.510> most<00:02:13.810> players<00:02:14.049> but<00:02:14.440> for<00:02:14.860> for<00:02:15.579> the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
hard for most players but for for the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.520 
hard for most players but for for the
majority<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.239> good<00:02:16.540> players<00:02:16.780> like<00:02:17.079> MLG

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
majority of good players like MLG

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.220 
majority of good players like MLG
professionals<00:02:18.100> GP<00:02:18.579> players<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.269> good<00:02:19.959> pup

guys sitting like in the background just

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.640 
guys sitting like in the background just
because<00:02:34.360> I'm<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.660> count<00:02:35.050> myself<00:02:35.200> as<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.470> good

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
because I'm I count myself as a good

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.619 
because I'm I count myself as a good
player<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.220> then<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.610> was<00:02:37.060> playing<00:02:37.360> with<00:02:37.569> a

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
player and then I was playing with a

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.630 
player and then I was playing with a
semiotic<00:02:37.959> gun<00:02:38.379> I<00:02:38.560> would<00:02:38.800> just<00:02:38.980> want<00:02:39.160> ham<00:02:39.430> on

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
semiotic gun I would just want ham on

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.369 
semiotic gun I would just want ham on
these<00:02:39.819> kids<00:02:40.090> i<00:02:40.239> was<00:02:40.390> getting<00:02:40.660> visa<00:02:40.840> us<00:02:41.019> left<00:02:41.319> to

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
these kids i was getting visa us left to

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.650 
these kids i was getting visa us left to
right<00:02:41.650> because<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.370> gun<00:02:42.580> has<00:02:42.610> range<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.480> it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
right because that gun has range and it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.289 
right because that gun has range and it
has<00:02:43.780> power<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:44.920> i'm<00:02:45.280> very<00:02:45.310> worried<00:02:46.120> about

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
has power so that i'm very worried about

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.360 
has power so that i'm very worried about
that<00:02:46.480> because<00:02:46.780> if<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.290> guns<00:02:47.530> in<00:02:47.739> marksman

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
that because if the guns in marksman

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.780 
that because if the guns in marksman
class<00:02:48.610> are<00:02:49.060> as<00:02:49.599> powerful<00:02:49.930> as<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.349> FAL<00:02:50.799> mk14<00:02:51.670> or

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790

even the SVU which is like really

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.430 
even the SVU which is like really

underrated in black ops 2 it can be very

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.289 
underrated in black ops 2 it can be very
dangerous<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.489> might<00:02:57.610> ruin<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.090> game

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
the vector in ecology ghosts and then he

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.509 
the vector in ecology ghosts and then he
just<00:04:04.840> hit<00:04:05.260> fired<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.859> one<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.190> shots<00:04:06.370> hit
