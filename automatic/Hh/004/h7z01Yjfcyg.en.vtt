00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.280
 again 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.040
 yesterday I spent all day hitting the 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.770
 water and the same thing the day before you should 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.660
 of being an expert if I'm wishing that 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.700
 I took a basin to catch 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.500
 strength in your arms you have not lent me 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.380
 attention the lack of strength is not my 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.380
 problem is not controlling it 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.790
 again 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.070
 that's how you sent an uncle to 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.070
 hospital the other day 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.950
 how do you know that does not matter to you started to 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.620
 matter when you agreed to it 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.920
 help to 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.150
 I met someone counted 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.150
 someone who injected mine 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.820
 but my son 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.880
 of that drug distortion or your mind up 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.880
 such a point that I did not even recognize him 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.880
 have 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.500
 How is it that I have not heard of the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.500
 look curo 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.770
 there's nothing you can tell me about 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.770
 yes 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.619
 I had to call an arrow in the eye 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.070
 if you stay at home I thought you were staying 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.000
 with roy is that he needed time for me 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.020
 what are you doing well 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.079
 oh yeah great I'm 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.140
 is roy last week he had a 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.290
 little problem 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.940
 I want to help you but I do not know how you want 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.000
 that I stay with you I love walter and 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.190
 it was another day flatly not if walter 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.510
 and you are going to fix things 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.060
 no pressures but you are going to go 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.480
 maybe it's not so just there's a way to 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.480
 know it 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.710
 now you 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.710
 do it slowly 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.620
 it's not about learning to punch 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.220
 it's about learning to control your 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.220
 force 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.630
 first the water already with this 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.470
 when you will run out of forms 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.470
 leave me like a fool 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.030
 I'm just learning new ways to 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.550
 piss off and that already gives me enough 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.950
 well the anger is not bad roy the fury is 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.590
 energy but you have to channel the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.080
 a positive way to hurt 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.209
 uncles that destroy the city let me 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.989
 hitting something that can be defended is 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.710
 joke 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:57.170
 let me go out with you one night 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.170
 and all this will be easier to accept 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.390
 ahead 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.160
 with multiple slashes as of one 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.780
 war the victim was an architect 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.210
 turner has taken plans of his 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.330
 projects and one of those projects was the 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.460
 malcolm house erling not know much about 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.650
 architecture of I do not like that kerry 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.360
 or terms of mary's house not yet what 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.750
 I know all the goods of Malcolm are 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.430
 seized with whom you speak 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.220
 Let's see if you can not hit me either 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.470
 say an uncle that I put in jail has 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.040
 escaped and I know where he is headed 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.040
 ah 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.190
 you have something with a hood and you have to 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.190
 ask 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.000
 and we meet who we are 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:57.510
 let's find you do not face them 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.510
 do not touch anything is that guy right 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.880
 the kid 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.960
 you know very well how is this have you been 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.960
 here before 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.070
 that has been alone 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.400
 comes from below there is not a garage very 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.830
 big let's go 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.020
 it seems a prototype of what 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.530
 of the machine that killed five hundred three 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.530
 people 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:40.430
