00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
this way that that this was something

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
whole journey with cancer whether that's

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.250 
whole journey with cancer whether that's
surgery<00:00:52.760> or<00:00:53.059> getting<00:00:53.329> additional<00:00:53.660> treatment

patients with Joanne cancers is to

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.609 
patients with Joanne cancers is to
really<00:01:46.789> be<00:01:46.909> their<00:01:47.090> guide<00:01:47.329> to<00:01:48.109> be<00:01:48.259> their<00:01:48.409> team

really be their guide to be their team

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.440 
really be their guide to be their team
captain<00:01:49.099> but<00:01:49.279> to<00:01:49.729> also<00:01:49.939> make<00:01:50.240> sure<00:01:50.270> that

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
captain but to also make sure that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.159
