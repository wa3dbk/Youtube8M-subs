and so once I've maintenance this you
will<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.339> pretty<00:00:53.579> much<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.210> looking

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
will see pretty much what it's looking

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.560 
will see pretty much what it's looking

like and I'll show you just one second
this<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.719> pretty<00:00:57.929> much<00:00:58.019> your<00:00:58.350> outcome<00:00:58.859> after

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
this is pretty much your outcome after

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.799 
this is pretty much your outcome after
maintenance<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.300> took<00:01:00.449> all<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.629> those

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
maintenance and just took all of those

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.200 
maintenance and just took all of those
hairs<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.530> associated<00:01:02.460> them<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.640> these

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
hairs and associated them with these

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.020 
hairs and associated them with these
four<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.929> five<00:01:04.140> locks<00:01:04.439> right<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.159> after

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
four to five locks right here and after

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.510 
four to five locks right here and after
a<00:01:06.060> while<00:01:06.299> I'm<00:01:06.979> putting<00:01:07.979> them<00:01:08.189> into<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
a while I'm putting them into a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.819 
a while I'm putting them into a
different<00:01:08.850> routine<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:10.079> will<00:01:10.229> all<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.590> back

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
different routine they will all go back

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.770 
different routine they will all go back
into<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.280> different<00:01:11.729> place<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.659> they

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
into a different place so that they

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.060 
into a different place so that they
won't<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.290> an<00:01:13.380> arrow<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:13.979> bottom

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
won't just be an arrow at the bottom

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.149 
won't just be an arrow at the bottom
anymore<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.380> those<00:01:16.590> issues<00:01:16.799> just

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
anymore so if you have those issues just

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.469 
anymore so if you have those issues just
make<00:01:17.369> sure<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.700> you're<00:01:17.909> associated<00:01:18.149> with

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
make sure that you're associated with

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
make sure that you're associated with
the<00:01:18.600> closest<00:01:18.990> lock<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:19.380> either<00:01:19.500> if<00:01:20.490> there's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the closest lock or either if there's

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.030 
the closest lock or either if there's
enough<00:01:20.969> that<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.450> add<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> lot<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.920> can

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
enough that you can add a lot to you can

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.380 
enough that you can add a lot to you can
either<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.149> two

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
either do one of the one of the two

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.050 
either do one of the one of the two
sorts<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.020> make<00:01:25.229> sure<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.890> those<00:01:26.610> hairs<00:01:26.939> are

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
sorts but make sure that those hairs are

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.429 
sorts but make sure that those hairs are
just<00:01:27.299> sitting<00:01:27.540> there<00:01:27.570> because<00:01:27.960> after<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> while

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
just sitting there because after a while

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.440 
just sitting there because after a while
they<00:01:28.619> will<00:01:28.799> start<00:01:29.039> one<00:01:29.280> big<00:01:29.520> huge<00:01:29.939> lock<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
they will start one big huge lock and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.510 
they will start one big huge lock and
that<00:01:30.930> was<00:01:31.140> offset<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> whole<00:01:31.979> placement<00:01:32.460> of

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that was offset the whole placement of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.080 
that was offset the whole placement of

in the formation to where they're not

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:47.520 
in the formation to where they're not
just<00:06:45.340> coming<00:06:45.610> down<00:06:45.880> in<00:06:46.419> blunt<00:06:46.690> if<00:06:47.169> you<00:06:47.349> have

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
just coming down in blunt if you have

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.110 
just coming down in blunt if you have
these<00:06:47.740> locks<00:06:48.039> from<00:06:48.160> the<00:06:48.250> top<00:06:48.550> just<00:06:48.820> coming

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
these locks from the top just coming

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.330 
these locks from the top just coming
straight<00:06:49.449> here<00:06:49.810> these<00:06:50.680> will<00:06:50.919> be<00:06:51.070> a<00:06:51.099> lot

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
straight here these will be a lot

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.219 
straight here these will be a lot
heavier<00:06:51.699> so<00:06:51.849> these<00:06:52.030> will<00:06:52.270> break<00:06:52.509> a<00:06:52.539> lot<00:06:52.780> faster

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:53.229 
heavier so these will break a lot faster

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:54.390 
heavier so these will break a lot faster
than<00:06:53.320> the<00:06:53.440> one<00:06:53.620> that<00:06:53.650> we're<00:06:53.860> in<00:06:53.949> the<00:06:54.009> back<00:06:54.190> they

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
than the one that we're in the back they

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.850 
than the one that we're in the back they
will<00:06:54.550> be<00:06:54.639> a<00:06:54.669> lot<00:06:54.849> shorter<00:06:55.289> so<00:06:56.289> just<00:06:56.530> be<00:06:56.650> careful

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:56.860 
will be a lot shorter so just be careful

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.830 
will be a lot shorter so just be careful
with<00:06:57.190> that<00:06:57.220> make<00:06:58.000> sure<00:06:58.150> that<00:06:58.180> you're<00:06:58.479> not<00:06:58.660> just

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
with that make sure that you're not just

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.180
