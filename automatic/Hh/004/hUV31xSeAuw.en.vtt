00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
on how to waterproof your ESC for

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.860 
on how to waterproof your ESC for
whatever<00:00:05.069> reason<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:05.790> want<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.000> do<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.390> um

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
whatever reason you want to do that um

the first thing you should do is cut off
this<00:00:10.170> heat<00:00:10.800> shrink<00:00:11.400> tubing<00:00:11.940> stuff<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.780> throw

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
this heat shrink tubing stuff and throw

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.379 
this heat shrink tubing stuff and throw
that<00:00:13.440> away<00:00:13.590> or<00:00:13.740> whatever<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.969> second

thing is you want to really gently pry
off<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:19.130> heat<00:00:20.130> sink<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.330> might<00:00:21.510> just<00:00:21.720> be

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
off the heat sink and it might just be

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.320 
off the heat sink and it might just be
like<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.140> little<00:00:22.230> solid<00:00:23.130> metal<00:00:23.490> plate<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.970> some

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
like a little solid metal plate on some

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.170 
like a little solid metal plate on some
vsi's<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.670> it's<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.939> these

vsi's but on this one it's one of these

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.830 
vsi's but on this one it's one of these
things<00:00:27.449> um<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.710> ya<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.310> very<00:00:29.580> gently<00:00:30.029> the

some epoxy um I'm just using this

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.910 
some epoxy um I'm just using this
fifteen-minute<00:00:36.239> made<00:00:36.630> cure<00:00:37.079> epoxy<00:00:37.680> from

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
fifteen-minute made cure epoxy from

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.860 
fifteen-minute made cure epoxy from
Hobby<00:00:38.190> City

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.869 

now<00:00:42.870> take<00:00:43.379> your<00:00:43.620> epoxy<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> sticker

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
now take your epoxy with a sticker
whatever<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:46.129> smear<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.160> all<00:00:47.430> over<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:49.320> ESD

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
whatever and smear it all over the ESD

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.430 
whatever and smear it all over the ESD
and<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.340> sure<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.850> miss<00:00:51.030> any<00:00:51.329> little<00:00:51.930> parts

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and be sure not to miss any little parts

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.750 
and be sure not to miss any little parts
of<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:54.270> get<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.600> all<00:00:54.719> over<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
of it so just get it all over the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.000 
of it so just get it all over the
electronics<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.180> all<00:00:57.510> over<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.710> then

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
electronics and all over there and then

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.979 
electronics and all over there and then
be<00:00:59.820> sure<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> sides<00:01:00.629> because

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
be sure to get the sides because

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.930 
be sure to get the sides because
sometimes<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.890> miss<00:01:02.070> stuff<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> sides

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
sometimes you miss stuff on the sides

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.050 
sometimes you miss stuff on the sides
and<00:01:03.300> also<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.710> capacitors<00:01:05.400> back<00:01:05.729> here

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and also on these capacitors back here

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.570 
and also on these capacitors back here
in<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> back<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.659> want<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.900> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.170> get<00:01:07.580> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
in the back you want to kind of get the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.149 
in the back you want to kind of get the
backs<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.060> those<00:01:09.240> because<00:01:09.780> their<00:01:10.140> water<00:01:10.770> could

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
backs of those because their water could

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.130 
backs of those because their water could
get<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.729> there<00:01:11.909> probably<00:01:12.299> not<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.960> don't

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
get in there probably not but I don't

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.359 
get in there probably not but I don't
know<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.970> be<00:01:14.970> sure<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.390> everywhere<00:01:16.369> so

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
know just be sure to get everywhere so

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.080 
know just be sure to get everywhere so
as<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.710> all<00:01:20.250> covered<00:01:20.820> in

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
as you can see here it's all covered in

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.230 
as you can see here it's all covered in
epoxy<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.220> want<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.820> is

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
epoxy and now what you want to do is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.429 
epoxy and now what you want to do is
take<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.790> slide<00:01:26.790> all<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.299> epoxy<00:01:28.170> off

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
take it and slide all the epoxy off

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.420 
take it and slide all the epoxy off
those<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:29.100> black<00:01:29.759> box<00:01:30.329> things<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.229> are

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
those little black box things that are

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.370 
those little black box things that are
under<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> heatsink<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.600> are<00:01:33.720> under<00:01:34.049> where

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
under the heatsink that are under where

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.620 
under the heatsink that are under where
that<00:01:34.590> used<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.060> want<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.329> get<00:01:36.479> as

that used to be and you want to get as

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.350 
that used to be and you want to get as
much<00:01:36.840> epoxy<00:01:37.560> off<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.220> tops<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.670> those<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.210> you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
much epoxy off the tops of those as you

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.350 
much epoxy off the tops of those as you
can<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:41.430> doesn't<00:01:41.610> matter<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.060> they're<00:01:42.240> not

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
can it doesn't matter if they're not

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.990 
can it doesn't matter if they're not
like<00:01:42.659> totally<00:01:43.140> clean<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.880> just

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
like totally clean but then you just

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
like totally clean but then you just
want<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.180> go<00:01:45.329> ahead<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.320> heatsink

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
want to go ahead and take your heatsink

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.850 
want to go ahead and take your heatsink
that<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.490> took<00:01:47.670> off<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.290> put<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.409> back<00:01:49.619> on

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
that you took off and put it back on

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.819 
that you took off and put it back on
there<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.310> push<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.180> really<00:01:51.600> hard<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.649> it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
there and push it down really hard so it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.100 
there and push it down really hard so it
makes<00:01:53.729> contact<00:01:54.329> with<00:01:54.509> all<00:01:54.750> those<00:01:54.960> little

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
makes contact with all those little

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.789 
makes contact with all those little
things<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.869> now<00:01:58.439> all

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
things so it's like that and now all

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.850 
things so it's like that and now all
that<00:01:59.040> leftover<00:01:59.579> epoxy<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.590> isn't

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that leftover epoxy it is this isn't

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.789 
that leftover epoxy it is this isn't
like<00:02:02.100> totally<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.540> do<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.140> it's

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
like totally you have to do it but it's

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.770 
like totally you have to do it but it's
not<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> bad<00:02:05.610> idea<00:02:05.850> at<00:02:06.360> all<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.200> okay

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
not a bad idea at all to like okay

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.090 
not a bad idea at all to like okay
something<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:09.330> prop<00:02:10.330> up<00:02:10.539> your<00:02:10.720> ESC<00:02:11.319> here<00:02:11.709> and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
something and prop up your ESC here and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.470 
something and prop up your ESC here and
then<00:02:12.400> take<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.640> lighter<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:15.790> like<00:02:16.000> heat

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
then take a lighter and just like heat

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.270 
then take a lighter and just like heat
up<00:02:16.690> all<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.170> because<00:02:17.680> when<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.069> heat<00:02:18.250> up

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
up all that because when you heat up

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.150 
up all that because when you heat up
epoxy<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.000> gets<00:02:19.180> really<00:02:19.390> runny<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:21.010> will

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
epoxy it gets really runny and that will

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.820 
epoxy it gets really runny and that will
most<00:02:21.490> likely<00:02:21.670> drip<00:02:22.240> off<00:02:22.450> like<00:02:23.350> mine's<00:02:23.620> not

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
most likely drip off like mine's not

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.180 
most likely drip off like mine's not
doing<00:02:24.190> oh<00:02:24.280> there<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:24.580> goes

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
doing oh there it goes

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.190 
doing oh there it goes
but<00:02:27.190> yeah<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:28.060> just<00:02:28.239> helps<00:02:28.569> get<00:02:28.810> rid<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.959> some

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
but yeah that just helps get rid of some

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.140 
but yeah that just helps get rid of some
of<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.560> excess<00:02:29.920> epoxy<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:31.770> get<00:02:32.770> some

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
of the excess epoxy and get some

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.949 
of the excess epoxy and get some
unneeded<00:02:34.150> weight<00:02:34.630> off<00:02:34.989> there<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:36.720> just<00:02:37.720> kind

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
unneeded weight off there so just kind

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.530 
unneeded weight off there so just kind
of<00:02:37.989> let<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.230> drip<00:02:38.590> off<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:39.550> as<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.970> can<00:02:40.120> see

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
of let that drip off so as you can see

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.810 
of let that drip off so as you can see
here<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:40.900> went<00:02:41.140> ahead<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.500> taped<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.950> my<00:02:41.980> ESC<00:02:42.610> to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
here I went ahead and taped to my ESC to

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.000 
here I went ahead and taped to my ESC to
the<00:02:42.940> side<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.360> this<00:02:43.450> box<00:02:43.840> or<00:02:44.350> like<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.890> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
the side of this box or like in the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.920 
the side of this box or like in the
middle<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.239> just<00:02:46.480> holds<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.870> there

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
middle and that just holds it there

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.490 
middle and that just holds it there
while<00:02:47.350> it's<00:02:47.620> drying<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:49.150> here's<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.050> finished

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
while it's drying so here's the finished

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.360 
while it's drying so here's the finished
product<00:02:51.150> it's<00:02:52.150> nice<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.660> good<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:54.310> would
