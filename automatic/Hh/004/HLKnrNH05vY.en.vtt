00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
if this was the semi-final or if this

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.820 
if this was the semi-final or if this
was<00:04:07.750> because<00:04:08.750> we<00:04:08.870> played<00:04:09.110> london

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
we beat them and that jump a straight to

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.180 
we beat them and that jump a straight to
the<00:04:13.799> semi-final<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.840> then<00:04:15.840> we<00:04:16.650> played<00:04:17.009> them

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190

again<00:04:17.430> in<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.639> semi-final<00:04:18.650> but<00:04:19.650> this<00:04:19.739> is<00:04:19.889> over

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
again in the semi-final but this is over

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.420

time<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:20.820> was<00:04:20.940> 22<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.539> just<00:04:22.229> like<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.430> game

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
time it was 22 and just like that game

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.320 
time it was 22 and just like that game
over<00:04:23.759> 12<00:04:24.240> seconds<00:04:24.630> in<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.870> overtime<00:04:26.330> to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
over 12 seconds in the overtime to

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.180 
over 12 seconds in the overtime to
finish<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.870> off<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.590> we'll<00:04:28.830> see<00:04:29.009> by<00:04:29.130> the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
finish it off and we'll see by the

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.379 
finish it off and we'll see by the
reaction<00:04:29.250> at<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.729> end<00:04:29.850> ya<00:04:30.000> know<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:30.300> this

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
reaction at the end ya know so this

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.450 
reaction at the end ya know so this
isn't<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.720> semi-final<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:31.440> don't<00:04:31.590> think<00:04:31.800> this

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
isn't the semi-final I don't think this

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.040 
isn't the semi-final I don't think this
was<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.850> game<00:04:33.000> before<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.389> semi-final

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
was the game before the semi-final

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.129 
was the game before the semi-final
discard<00:04:34.350> us<00:04:34.440> into<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.740> semi-finals<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.990> was

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
discard us into the semi-finals it was

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.710 
discard us into the semi-finals it was
pretty<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.860> was<00:04:38.669> a<00:04:38.699> pretty<00:04:38.910> nice<00:04:39.120> golden<00:04:39.630> eye

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
pretty I was a pretty nice golden eye

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.020 
pretty I was a pretty nice golden eye
shot<00:04:40.050> what<00:04:40.979> I<00:04:41.009> find<00:04:41.250> it's<00:04:41.460> just<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.729> the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
shot what I find it's just the the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.700 
shot what I find it's just the the
normal<00:04:42.479> snapshot<00:04:43.139> is<00:04:43.259> actually<00:04:43.560> more

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
normal snapshot is actually more

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.409 
normal snapshot is actually more
effective<00:04:44.160> than<00:04:44.340> kind<00:04:44.729> of<00:04:44.820> pulling<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.240> back

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
effective than kind of pulling it back

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.080 
effective than kind of pulling it back
and<00:04:45.660> doing<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.900> full<00:04:46.110> wrist<00:04:46.380> shot<00:04:46.560> in<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:46.800> game

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
and doing a full wrist shot in this game

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.159 
and doing a full wrist shot in this game
the<00:04:48.090> defense<00:04:48.360> closes<00:04:48.810> in<00:04:48.900> on<00:04:48.990> you<00:04:49.139> very

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
the defense closes in on you very

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.589 
the defense closes in on you very
quickly<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:50.039> just<00:04:50.460> getting<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.060> shot<00:04:51.300> on<00:04:51.449> that

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
quickly so just getting the shot on that

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.620 
quickly so just getting the shot on that
and<00:04:51.660> having<00:04:52.320> an<00:04:52.500> accurate<00:04:52.860> shot<00:04:52.919> is<00:04:53.490> is<00:04:53.789> more

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
and having an accurate shot is is more

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.510 
and having an accurate shot is is more
important<00:04:55.169> than<00:04:55.830> anything<00:04:56.070> so<00:04:56.280> they<00:04:56.370> get<00:04:56.460> a

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
important than anything so they get a

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.770 
important than anything so they get a
few<00:04:56.910> highlights<00:04:57.330> from<00:04:57.599> the<00:04:57.750> game<00:04:57.780> here<00:04:58.349> and
