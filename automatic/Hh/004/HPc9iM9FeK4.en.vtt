00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:26.330
 hello friends true gay but who access the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.430
 Blog of the game revolution be all 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.040
 Welcome to yet another episode of 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.410
 our guide to super street fighter 4 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.140
 series that has remained temporarily 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.730
 native but now fortunately 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.250
 returning every beginner in 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.930
 fight as a rule and idealizes that the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.970
 best way to get closer to a 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.900
 opponent and delivering air strikes and 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.780
 strong 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.720
 but what many of them do not notice is that 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.400
 while executing the attack and it shows 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.130
 completely vulnerable to an attack 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.579
 the enemy in the worst 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.009
 combos that can give to invade as 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.420
 will be able to get closer to the 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.150
 your enemies without being 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.159
 completely vulnerable opening wings 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.840
 for possible counterattacks or even 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:21.940
 even metal combos 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:26.620
 this is what we see the following episodes 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.620
 progress from defining themselves to crossing the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.920
 many of you may have noticed in 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.840
 competitive struggles or in general 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.030
 strategy of players that when knocking 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.130
 and their opponents is appropriated 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.280
 air strikes that hit them 1 while 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.850
 the player was moving to the opposite side 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.130
 this type of attack denominates crusade 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.380
 and their usefulness is concentrated 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.810
 reversing the defense position of the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.060
 enemy at the very moment the hit 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.700
 performed so that even the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.740
 player is defending back him 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.479
 It ends up being achieved since it must be 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.830
 holding to the opposite side to 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.900
 execute the defense 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.060
 may seem somewhat complex in the 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.980
 theory but I see the applications of this 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.980
 strategy logo the slow motion background 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.010
 as you can see right now 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.890
 that hit hit our character 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.989
 already on the reverse side of the top 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.569
 in the forum started on the other side of the 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.180
 enemy itself as side 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.700
 necessarily reversed the position of 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.489
 defense also reversed if the player did not 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.440
 if you look at this type of strategy 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:53.620
 vulnerable to a wide range of 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:56.050
 combos all characters have 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.940
 cross the track and these vary 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.489
 between weaker attacks such as 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.220
 example a weak kick or even the 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.500
 for example strong kicks and if it varies 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.549
 from character to character 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.880
 own player 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:15.519
 discovering the training room in short 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.370
 be careful when carrying out this attack 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.340
 serious combat as it has already been said 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.819
 while the character is in the 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.890
 air 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.709
 it becomes completely vulnerable to a 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.380
 air strike and in some cases there is a 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.019
 combo all the characters have 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.900
 attacks and attacks 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.420
 Many anti-aircraft bombs can arise 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.450
 these attacks can be both attacks 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.640
 more as well as special attacks with the 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.290
 ultra combos to super combos beyond 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.390
 conventional 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.359
 so it gets closer to your opponents 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.000
 always carefully exploring the attacks 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.209
 what vast range of characters 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.340
 the safest ground approach 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.470
 existing in super street fighter 4 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.019
 only needed and when it was 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.359
 safe 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.940
 So that's it , folks, we've come to an end. 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.549
 of another episode of our guide 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.340
 super street fighter 4 I ask my 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.900
 sincere apologies for the absence of this 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.060
 series that in turkey and russia as 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.739
 Also the absence of our guide 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.510
 street fighter cross tech 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.489
 I will try to complete these series the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.350
 soon as possible for the first series of 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.000
 other fighting games according to this same 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.220
 concept 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.919
 this is a concept that aims above 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.990
 all the more accurate understanding of the 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.330
 mechanics about what to do four said 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.220
 that goes of protec so that you that 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.190
 they like the style but can not 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.920
 do very well in the fighting 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.830
 training can improve so I'm not 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.520
 the best player kicks hard on the face of the 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.830
 Earth 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.410
 but I consider myself a good player myself 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.480
 I think I have content knowledge 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.850
