00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
we want to make sure that a exercise

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.150 
we want to make sure that a exercise
program<00:01:58.330> is<00:01:58.510> individual<00:01:59.170> for<00:01:59.770> what<00:01:59.950> people

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160

really<00:02:05.140> it's<00:02:05.320> approaching<00:02:05.950> balance<00:02:06.430> not<00:02:06.970> only

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
really it's approaching balance not only

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.510 
really it's approaching balance not only
from<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.480> outside<00:02:07.800> physical<00:02:08.800> but<00:02:09.190> from<00:02:09.400> the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
from the outside physical but from the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.580 
from the outside physical but from the
inside<00:02:10.140> biochemical<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.230> that's<00:02:11.350> really

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
inside biochemical and that's really

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.350 
inside biochemical and that's really
what<00:02:11.800> we<00:02:11.950> tried<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.430> approach<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.940> seasons

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
what we tried to approach it seasons

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.170 
what we tried to approach it seasons

Knoxville and started private practice
actually<00:02:29.710> in<00:02:30.190> Georgia<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.540> was<00:02:31.690> from<00:02:31.870> that

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
actually in Georgia and it was from that

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.230 
actually in Georgia and it was from that
standpoint<00:02:32.350> where<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:32.950> really<00:02:33.460> started<00:02:34.150> to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
standpoint where I really started to

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.480 
standpoint where I really started to
make<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.540> change<00:02:34.840> because<00:02:35.110> when<00:02:36.010> you're<00:02:36.190> in

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
make the change because when you're in

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.820 
make the change because when you're in
your<00:02:37.060> own<00:02:37.270> office<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:38.020> you're<00:02:38.320> seeing<00:02:38.620> your

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
patients every day and you see the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.190 
patients every day and you see the
effects<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:42.010> your<00:02:42.190> therapy<00:02:42.520> that's<00:02:43.420> really

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
effects of your therapy that's really

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.620
