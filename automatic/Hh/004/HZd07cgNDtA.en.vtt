00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello everyone in this video I want you 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.299
 tell how to flash custom 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.740
 firmware 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.349
 Oakb on smartphone nexus 4 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.139
 as you probably already see this 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.369
 custom firmware does not support 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.230
 only nexus 4 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 but also other smartphones and tablets 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:31.380
 ruler nexus also when loading itself 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.440
 firmware you will see that here 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:40.620
 support also other smartphones 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:44.190
 type galaxy s3 and so on but it 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.200
 I have no experience I used this 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.719
 firmware only on galaxy nexus and on 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.440
 it means 4 at the moment therefore speech 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.520
 will go for them now if you have any 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.940
 other smartphones 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.820
 like galaxy s3 and stuff that i'm here 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.430
 in the list, I recommend that you go to 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.700
 appropriate form to read as 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.159
 everything is stable there now I 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.460
 can i tell you what 's gpsu 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.830
 I use this firmware for these four 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.810
 for several days everything works fine 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.130
 no complaints as i will 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.159
 A review of this firmware will show what it has 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:33.079
 features added what features chips and so 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.079
 further so 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.780
 we need to upload two files 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.670
 first directly the firmware itself i 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.820
 I choose tables here 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.020
 your nexus 4 smartphone 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:58.119
 he is called jersey here I see two builds 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:00.500
 I download the latest build of January 2 22 guests 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.790
 Click on this link and it will be 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.450
 jump made 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:11.170
 archive I have it already loaded also to us 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:17.320
 will need google maps 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.320
 click here here and download 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:28.730
 December thirteenth at the end of 12 12 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:32.380
 12 last google apps and so 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.010
 two archives on our computer 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.370
 connect the smartphone 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.320
 lace bend throw it in memory 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.320
 smartphone both of these archives 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.920
 we also need to make two bulls 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.019
 on 1 it is backup of applications and their data with 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.160
 using for example applications titanium 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:59.690
 backup or lips to how to do these backups and 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.209
 I will post again will take off the video 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:08.540
 instruction if you suddenly don't know what 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:12.290
 this is 2 backup this is a backup through 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.079
 clockworkmod recovery is being backed up 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.350
 our firmware which we now have on 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.540
 This moment is worth us and 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.820
 we need for that if suddenly you 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.570
 something is not satisfied with the new firmware you 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:30.920
 could come back rolling back on this one 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.320
 backup again I repeat that below 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.950
 Video instructions will be needed if 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.910
 suddenly you do not know how to do it 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.520
 there will also be a link to this page 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:47.930
 let's see what we need for 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:51.200
 installation to install the firmware author 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.320
 recommends that we do a full reset 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.140
 wipe date is necessary when we first 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:01.810
 once asked for custom firmware 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:04.820
 so as not to drag along some bugs 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.180
 the first time is recommended to do full 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.970
 reset 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.850
 with subsequent updates to us of this 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:16.060
 do not need it we load 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.730
 in club fashion park recovery 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.040
 make wipe date the second step we 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.310
 flashing 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.000
 Directly firmware itself ru 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.920
 who downloaded 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.860
 and the capa can jelly beam and so on 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.940
 next step we flash google ems 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.490
 2 archive 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:43.750
 Well, we do require after this smartphone 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.730
 loading the first boot will be long 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.510
 I will show the flashing procedure itself 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.880
 I will not be as I recently 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.520
 showed how to flash firmware 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.480
 cyanogenmod via clockworkmod recovery 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.620
 and this procedure on 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.110
 nothing different from and again 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:11.440
 below you will place a video instruction manual 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:13.690
 you can download it and see all 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:20.980
 in the same way just to do with these 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:23.170
 two archives and so after you 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.040
 all this business about sew and smartphone 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:30.220
 You will need to restore the boot 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.710
 backup applications and their data that we 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.640
 did with the application titanium 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.120
 backup or lip to and enjoy the new 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.120
 firmware 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:47.500
 firmware review 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:50.170
 as I said, I will also take off and post 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.240
 again below the video that is before 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:56.070
 the way you can flash 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:02.830
 look will suit you such firmware and 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:06.460
 what does she bring with her 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.760
