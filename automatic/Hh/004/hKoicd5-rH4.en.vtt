00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.570
 last aid party with all 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.340
 his tips for improving your going 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.570
 back we will be interested in the movements 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.370
 inside and outside 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.990
 so if you do not know what it is 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.910
 I advise you to go right away 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.770
 see the course which is called the go 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.090
 back on several ropes since 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.609
 it is in this course that we speak 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.050
 exterior interior movements and 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.070
 if you have not seen you do not know 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.119
 what are the inner movements 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.380
 outside you risk not 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.849
 understand a lot about what I'm going 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.830
 tell 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.990
 so I guess you saw it and 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.670
 you have probably noticed as I 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.650
 spoke in the shot in question that if 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.270
 you work these movements there there 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.170
 has one that you will usually arrive 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.640
 to do better than the other 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.320
 some are more talented are moving 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.120
 satin interior in addition to its movement 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.270
 outside of times you are at the same 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.190
 level but good luck in all 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.809
 case what we want is to have both 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.520
 same level and strengthen these movements 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.750
 inside and outside since 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.280
 the moment when we change the code 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.840
 round trip everything depends on these 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.629
 internal and external movements 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.949
 then there is a very simple method for 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.530
 work these two movements 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.160
 we will take notes on two bodies of 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.440
 difference 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.940
 I'm going to take the breakage 5 for 2010 and 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.770
 the box six strings of 6 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.690
 and in fact we're going to chain these two 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.840
 notes it's going to be a bit of a pin pon by 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.920
 a firefighter back and forth either in 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.750
 inner movement are in motion 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.250
 outside to do it in motion 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.620
 outside we will first miss the rope of 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.020
 6 down and the rope half the treble 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.360
 to the top and we start again like that 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.800
 we make sure to lift our fingers 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.760
 damart left every time we do not want 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.770
 leave the notes it's like that 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.150
 otherwise we do not hear very well 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.810
 exactly when do we 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.470
 scratch the rope 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.930
 we really want to have a very sound 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.870
 defined well to hear the regularity of 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.920
 notes and so it's out there and 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.280
 all we have to do was speed up 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.280
 gradually 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.560
 that's a lot but obviously we get 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.270
 focuses on the right hand for 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.610
 try to stay steady to have the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.180
 same power with each note and not 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.070
 to crash 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.390
 then we do the same thing on the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.650
 inner movement one keeps both 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.979
 same notes same principle by hand 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.420
 left 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.890
 but this time we will start with 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.229
 play rope better that down 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.490
 I agree to 6 up the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.070
 snub the inner movement 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.630
 reverse humor outside and even 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.050
 thing we start in single-seater 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.050
 Readership 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.800
 if you do this work at the metronome 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.500
 that with really a very regular rhythm 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.820
 you will probably find that one of the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.360
 two methods could go faster 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.260
 that the other 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.750
 the goal of the game is to work 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.980
 the other slowest of well there 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.410
 work every day a few muta 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.880
 do that it's a bit boring cut out 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.420
 work in several sessions of 30 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.100
 seconds 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.150
 between two pieces you do that to 30 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.260
 seconds after all nothing else 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.120
 pieces for it's thirty seconds 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.320
 etc. 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.790
 but really do you focus 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.410
 on it to try to have both 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.360
 techniques at the same speed 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.880
 and if you already have both techniques 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.980
 at the same speed congratulations it's a 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.120
 very very well the purpose of the game after this 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.030
 will work for both 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.380
 improve both since in the end all 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.630
 there the returns that you will do on 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.340
 several strings will be limited by these 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.180
 movements there if you do not get to the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.959
 be at a certain speed is 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.579
 could not make the return trip 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.880
 on several ropes beyond this 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.630
 speed 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.310
 if you improve 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.070
 the speed of your inner movements 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.170
 and outside you can go 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.460
 much faster in return with 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.330
 of work obviously it's not 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.460
 automatic 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.230
 so this is the last tip I have to 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.960
 give you to perfect your 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.100
 go back if you apply all his 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.080
 advice then you do not have to 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.550
 of everything applied obviously had to 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.110
 take what really concerns your 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.150
 case if you already have a shot towards the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.590
 up by doing very well their job and 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.510
 not the advice of the 1st party the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.130
 second part forgiveness but if you 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.110
 really apply all these tips 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.790
 you will have a much more round trip 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.010
 clean with a much better movement 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.160
 precise economy and all that is needed 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.330
 for after work your exercises 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.790
 accelerated little by little was never going 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.350
 too fast and you will end up becoming 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.570
 very very good back 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.800
 so here I am I tell you to the 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.330
 next time for another course of 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.310
 guitar on table on acoustic point 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.540
 com and of course we repeat it you 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.850
 can join us on facebook.com 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.390
 buy 4 habitat or twitter.com this 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.390
 I will be acoustic
