00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.000
 wonderful now there is the 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.339
 next part of eighth and how 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.740
 I promised a little whole 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.630
 concrete rhythmics also quite common 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.809
 in some songs sometimes like that 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.210
 We need form and we need it 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.179
 four chords I just have one 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.039
 few power courts always combine this 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.449
 in the key e minor for example right 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.710
 So often you can be too 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.050
 just more into this power shortly 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.029
 show the same in many songs 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.439
 in combination with him in general 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.819
 of course, there could be some riffs there 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.199
 still pretty nice with the same 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:34.640
 experimenting it always gets together 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.699
 sound these chords combined sound 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.379
 you cool and we take ours 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.210
 power we could in the first part also 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.129
 So already have the teaching deep side 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.399
 and in the second bunch on the a-side 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.350
 grabbed the hair or b in braces 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.449
 power corp number one next power 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.339
 could we play this is me 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.559
 just make short chords before that's on 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.629
 g power court there's the index finger 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.449
 on the low e since the third band 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.440
 played brave and best of all 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.510
 ring finger 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.509
 this is relatively hose playing here 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.820
 ton in the fifth bunch on the a-side that 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.130
 it the note d this is our portal 2 that 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.290
 is a g-powerscourt power, briefly 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.570
 also basically always with a 5 in 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.090
 chord symbol is written so e5 is 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.689
 a power corp a g5 is a g power 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.409
 corp next we go to 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.939
 empty a page we play empty and 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.070
 then we play on the b-side in the 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.390
 second bunch with the index finger again 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.780
 the note e 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.119
 that is then a chord a5 and too 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.070
 good last four chords that each 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.630
 rally so many chord sequences come 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.009
 exactly with four chords just stop too 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.350
 that's why I just like that 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.390
 Practice has combined four chords 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.189
 then the index finger goes on the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.350
 A side in the second bunch that is 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.619
 Now plays the note b or a and the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.869
 Ringfinger comes in the fourth bunch of 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.600
 the d side there would be the nuthe fis 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.939
 Hidden and that is a hair or a 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.679
 bauer court then on the spot 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.920
 I also play these four chords exactly 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.020
 in sequence epower court g power 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.170
 power corp and a hair in braces 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.160
 power corp so and now we come to 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.080
 a very famous one 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.820
 You often accentuate it that way 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.220
 or in slightly modified form 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.660
 in a song I feel her 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.090
 just before 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.040
 Of course there's the whole thing again 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.630
 at the end of the video with a little yes 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.950
 with a small becking track it became 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.240
 You can try it where he hears it 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.190
 you can and will play again 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.080
 I can and I play it first 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.610
 just for the sake of emphasizing that 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.350
 Just learn how to emphasize I say 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.150
 it very briefly, we play eighth 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:43.450
 we emphasize the 1 the two and and the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.100
 Target time 4 and on the 4 and yourself 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.350
 We even take a little break 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.060
 that i kinda sign that 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.709
 look like a 7 living or stroking 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.390
 by missing so to speak this is one 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.459
 Of course, it has to be an eighth break 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.140
 after the eighth break so that's up 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.360
 4 and then we do nothing 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.430
 we play the once emphasized the two 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.560
 and the fourth one sounds like that 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.860
 like this, I just play 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.860
 times 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.590
 so hear and see and I do now 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.010
 again the same as in the first one 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.200
 part 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.730
 Whenever the accentuation comes up 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.180
 I shake hands all the others 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.769
 Eighth are damped so I'm still counting 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.599
 once with it the rhythms still one 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:45.950
 Maybe that understands a little better 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:47.959
 then 1234 would be like that and the whole game 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.069
 I might be slow now 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.409
 even with a little break in between 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.629
 First of all I play now 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.280
 once complete with my four 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.170
 chords I explained at the beginning 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.609
 Once through I have to go with a whole 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:06.849
 small break now very slowly 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:06.849
 we have 12 34 12 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.449
 23 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.520
 and then continue from the front and then the 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.219
 of course repeat the whole idea in 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.870
 to play loop yes I think 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:38.550
 Little exercise can be done to emphasize this 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.770
 understand very well and if you 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.319
 maybe one or the other 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.449
 song sounds then you will this 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.319
 quite often emphasize somehow 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.439
 Recognize that way 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.210
 in many songs the 1 and the 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.009
 two and emphasizes that I'm here the four 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.270
 taken have the is simply because 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.379
 because I have such a small paragraph yet 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.310
 always wanted to go to the next clock 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.020
 because otherwise that may be one 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.180
 a bit difficult to understand where 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.099
 But the accord change is the emphasis 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.349
 on the one and on the two and so 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.729
 The beginning of this rhythm is there 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.889
 Quite often mean something 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.020
 Chord sequences do not even have to with 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.099
 Power court can also be normal 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.770
 Chords can often always 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.990
 works so you take her best 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.849
 Again, only tees down strokes 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.129
 for the whole story as I said hand 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.779
 briefly raise the rest like steam 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.469
 said with the easily counted sound 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:24.779
 it works fine 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.849
 Please make hall and such a nonsense 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:28.110
 So everything is gone just like me 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.330
 that just made a completely 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.680
 unreflective guitar sound in brackets 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.289
 old just a little bit of distortion 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.699
 then it will be completely and completely 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.529
 important the rear pick up should be 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.129
 Borrow because we're back here too 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.319
 abdÃ¤mpfen 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.389
 there is also the rear pick up 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.099
 Of course it will be there right there 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.689
 So, sound is relative 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.699
 important to do that with the back 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:48.479
 pickup also makes a switch, of course 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.969
 all the way to the back 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.789
 I think you should do it all 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.080
 fix 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.599
 of course you can already tell 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.310
 we have 88 per clock and we can 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.659
 Of course we can emphasize the things 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.250
 now also sound some time 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.050
 leave something so you can with 18 already 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.219
 do everything possible because of that 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.629
 relatively carefully and if you are eighth 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:10.770
 that's how cool everything gets 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:14.580
 possible what we will do afterwards 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.899
 can stress the notes overcome so 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.789
 let that finish longer 

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:19.740
 means overcome or others 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.419
 Adding scores does not just mean that 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.219
 Eight maybe also my quarters one 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.710
 Half note somewhere reinter this 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:27.599
 Of course, then somehow, too 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.849
 Actually, you already get pretty much 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.069
 everything turns out to be what you actually are 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:35.580
 So that's it, that's it 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:37.740
 times the basis of many dedicate 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.129
 you just have to say that is the eighth 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.110
 first 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.569
 Nothing discipline I would like to say jo 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.830
 Try it from the back there 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.020
 of course now the notes again 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.429
 And just the whole idea holds here 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.719
 made as a small sound example 

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:52.149
 so that you can play the same 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:54.479
 now again 44 counter and fire free much 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:54.479
 fun
