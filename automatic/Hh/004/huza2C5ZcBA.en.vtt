understand out to speed up the modeling

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.609 
understand out to speed up the modeling
then<00:00:26.340> we'll<00:00:26.550> cover<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.210> UV<00:00:27.630> preparation<00:00:28.439> with

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
then we'll cover the UV preparation with

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.690 
then we'll cover the UV preparation with
standard<00:00:29.070> UV<00:00:29.490> maps<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.289> UV<00:00:31.289> improper<00:00:31.980> then

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
standard UV maps and UV improper then

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.639 
standard UV maps and UV improper then
we'll<00:00:32.910> see<00:00:33.149> how<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> prepare<00:00:33.780> some<00:00:34.170> texture

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
we'll see how to prepare some texture

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.340 
we'll see how to prepare some texture
and<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> use<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.880> textures<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:37.020> and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and now to use the textures we have and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.700 
and now to use the textures we have and
will<00:00:38.070> prepare<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:39.260> shaders<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
will prepare the shaders and the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.709 
will prepare the shaders and the
lighting<00:00:40.980> using<00:00:41.670> mental<00:00:41.969> ray<00:00:42.030> because<00:00:42.420> the

lighting using mental ray because the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.389 
lighting using mental ray because the
final<00:00:43.079> render<00:00:43.320> will<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.649> done<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:44.070> mental

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
final render will be done with mental

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.510 
final render will be done with mental
ray<00:00:44.550> will<00:00:45.539> prepare<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.930> HDR<00:00:46.680> illumination

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
ray will prepare the HDR illumination

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.209 
ray will prepare the HDR illumination
and<00:00:47.700> some<00:00:48.030> basic<00:00:48.390> studio<00:00:48.719> lighting<00:00:49.219> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and some basic studio lighting the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.250 
and some basic studio lighting the
materials<00:00:50.640> will<00:00:50.789> be<00:00:50.910> done<00:00:51.270> using<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.809> arc<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
materials will be done using the arc and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.160 
materials will be done using the arc and
design<00:00:52.559> shader<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.039> we'll<00:00:54.030> see<00:00:54.210> also<00:00:54.840> how<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
design shader and we'll see also how to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.189 
design shader and we'll see also how to
split<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.149> rendering<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.300> some<00:00:57.629> layers<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
split the rendering in some layers and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.349 
split the rendering in some layers and
how<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.469> use<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> state<00:00:59.190> set<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.879> add<00:01:00.000> some

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
how to use the state set to add some

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.900 
how to use the state set to add some
additional<00:01:00.510> passes<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.910> final

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
additional passes and the final

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.310 
additional passes and the final
composition<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> final<00:01:04.080> look

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
composition and the final look

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.830 
composition and the final look
development<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> image<00:01:05.970> grading<00:01:06.420> will

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
development and the image grading will

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.859 
development and the image grading will
be<00:01:06.960> done<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.200> fusion<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.970> final<00:01:09.150> result<00:01:09.420> we

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
be done in fusion so the final result we

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.250 
be done in fusion so the final result we
are<00:01:09.960> trying<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.590> achieve<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:11.750> like<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.990> image

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
are trying to achieve is like this image

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.010 
are trying to achieve is like this image
you<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.939> really<00:01:15.360> nice<00:01:15.659> look

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
you see that we have a really nice look

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.260 
you see that we have a really nice look
the<00:01:16.350> model<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.830> not<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.280> complex<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.060> we'll

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the model is not so complex but we'll

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.050 
the model is not so complex but we'll
see<00:01:18.509> how<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.840> model<00:01:19.439> something<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.220> how

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
see how to model something like that how

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.960 
see how to model something like that how
to<00:01:21.119> set<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.900> scene<00:01:22.250> if<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.460> go<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> check

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
to set up the scene if we go to check

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.289 
to set up the scene if we go to check
you<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.380> our<00:01:25.770> sin<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
you see that that's the our sin and

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.440 
you see that that's the our sin and
we'll<00:01:27.299> work<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.259> model<00:01:28.909> let's<00:01:29.909> go<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
we'll work on this model let's go in the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.740 
we'll work on this model let's go in the
isolation<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.750> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
isolation you see that this one is a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
isolation you see that this one is a
really<00:01:34.759> simple<00:01:35.759> model<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.590> will<00:01:37.590> create<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
really simple model and will create a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.830 
really simple model and will create a
very<00:01:39.150> part<00:01:40.400> with<00:01:41.400> different<00:01:41.970> poly<00:01:42.479> modeling

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
very part with different poly modeling

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.190 
very part with different poly modeling
tools<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:44.939> there<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.840> our

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
tools so you see that there we have our

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.880 
tools so you see that there we have our
structure<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.170> we'll<00:01:49.590> start

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
structure so as you can see we'll start

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.960 
structure so as you can see we'll start
with<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:51.350> simple<00:01:52.520> let's<00:01:53.520> go<00:01:53.700> for

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
with a really simple let's go for

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.760 
with a really simple let's go for
example<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> isolation<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.560> one

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
example in the isolation for this one

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
example in the isolation for this one
you<00:01:56.460> see<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.820> dear<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.299> start<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
you see that dear we start just with the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.459 
you see that dear we start just with the
line<00:01:58.409> then<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.610> go<00:01:59.790> with<00:02:00.180> some<00:02:00.509> extraction

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
line then we go with some extraction

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.600 
line then we go with some extraction
then<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.960> modeling<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.070> goes

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
then we have the modeling that goes

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.890 
then we have the modeling that goes
forward<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.539> see<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.990> step<00:02:10.470> by<00:02:10.740> step<00:02:11.900> we

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
forward and you see that step by step we

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.280 
forward and you see that step by step we
go<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:14.400> change<00:02:14.790> something<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:15.600> we<00:02:15.810> will<00:02:15.960> work

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
go to change something then we will work

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.910 
go to change something then we will work
on<00:02:16.700> for<00:02:17.700> example<00:02:17.790> also<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.020> UV<00:02:19.290> mapping<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
on for example also the UV mapping and

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.820 
on for example also the UV mapping and
we'll<00:02:20.760> cover<00:02:21.000> out<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.570> solve<00:02:21.840> UV<00:02:22.290> mapping<00:02:22.500> is

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
we'll cover out to solve UV mapping is

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.790 
we'll cover out to solve UV mapping is
in<00:02:23.010> standard<00:02:23.420> UV<00:02:24.420> modifier<00:02:24.959> but<00:02:25.380> we'll<00:02:25.560> see

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
in standard UV modifier but we'll see

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.360 
in standard UV modifier but we'll see
also<00:02:26.160> how<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.459> work<00:02:26.910> on<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:28.050> am<00:02:28.709> wrapper<00:02:29.220> and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
also how to work on the am wrapper and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.570 
also how to work on the am wrapper and
then<00:02:30.360> we'll<00:02:30.570> talk<00:02:30.870> about<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.709> texture<00:02:32.100> into

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
then we'll talk about the texture into

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.880 
then we'll talk about the texture into
and<00:02:32.940> will<00:02:33.720> model<00:02:34.020> all<00:02:34.230> these<00:02:34.560> pieces<00:02:36.650> let's<00:02:37.650> go

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
and will model all these pieces let's go

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.220 
and will model all these pieces let's go
inside<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.850> see<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.270> we<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:39.480> also<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
inside you see that we have also the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.440 
inside you see that we have also the
environment<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.640> environment<00:02:42.120> will<00:02:42.300> be

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
environment and this environment will be

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.870 
environment and this environment will be
used<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:43.470> simulate<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:45.330> studio<00:02:46.290> lighting<00:02:46.530> and

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
used to simulate the studio lighting and

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.530 
used to simulate the studio lighting and
we<00:02:47.880> have<00:02:48.060> also<00:02:48.270> more<00:02:48.930> complex<00:02:49.730> model<00:02:50.730> as<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
we have also more complex model as the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.090 
we have also more complex model as the
leader<00:02:52.380> cushion<00:02:53.040> there<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:54.560> sorry<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.800> see

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
leader cushion there and sorry you see

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.990 
leader cushion there and sorry you see
that<00:02:56.340> we<00:02:56.670> are<00:02:57.170> starting<00:02:58.170> with<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.530> really

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
that we are starting with a really

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.190 
that we are starting with a really
simple<00:03:00.000> mesh<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:02.880> was<00:03:03.180> extracted<00:03:03.690> by<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
simple mesh that was extracted by the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.220 
simple mesh that was extracted by the
food<00:03:04.950> part<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.330> would<00:03:06.510> work<00:03:06.540> with

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
food part and that would work with

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.640 
food part and that would work with
modifier<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.640> create<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.150> structure<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.989> to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
modifier to create the structure and to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.190 
modifier to create the structure and to
create<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.100> tails<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.820> add<00:03:12.000> details<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
create the tails and add details to the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.949 
create the tails and add details to the
to<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.620> model<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.519> obtain<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:14.880> final<00:03:15.239> one<00:03:15.630> and

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
to the model to obtain the final one and

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.710 
to the model to obtain the final one and
when<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.860> final<00:03:17.280> model<00:03:17.670> will<00:03:17.910> be<00:03:17.940> achieved

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
when the final model will be achieved

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.340 
when the final model will be achieved
we'll<00:03:19.260> work<00:03:19.530> on<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:20.180> simple<00:03:21.180> setup<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.930> simulate

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
we'll work on a simple setup to simulate

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.910 
we'll work on a simple setup to simulate
the<00:03:22.620> studio<00:03:22.920> lighting<00:03:23.420> with<00:03:24.420> let's<00:03:25.410> go<00:03:25.590> in<00:03:25.769> the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the studio lighting with let's go in the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.600 
the studio lighting with let's go in the
layers<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:26.790> we<00:03:26.940> see<00:03:27.120> also<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.480> manage<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.170> seam

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
layers so we see also to manage a seam

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.640 
layers so we see also to manage a seam
covering<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.910> lighting<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.080> scene

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
covering the lighting and the scene

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.280 
covering the lighting and the scene
management<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.489> see<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.940> we<00:03:33.120> have<00:03:33.290> a

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
management you see that we have a

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.550 
management you see that we have a
lighting<00:03:34.980> made<00:03:35.250> with<00:03:35.910> HDR<00:03:36.510> map<00:03:36.870> for

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
lighting made with HDR map for

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.190 
lighting made with HDR map for
reflection<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.459> partly<00:03:39.209> for<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:40.019> lighting

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
reflection and partly for the lighting

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.940 
reflection and partly for the lighting
and<00:03:40.500> we<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:41.610> two<00:03:41.880> lied<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.750> cover<00:03:43.110> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
and we have just two lied to cover the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.710 
and we have just two lied to cover the
studio<00:03:44.280> lighting<00:03:44.519> setup<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.239> we<00:03:45.570> have<00:03:45.690> a

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
studio lighting setup and we have a

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.440 
studio lighting setup and we have a
simple<00:03:46.049> environment<00:03:46.739> all<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.730> materials<00:03:48.239> are

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
simple environment all the materials are

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.970 
simple environment all the materials are
done<00:03:49.170> using<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:50.370> Arcan<00:03:50.880> design<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:52.530> we'll<00:03:52.709> see

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
done using the Arcan design so we'll see

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.340 
done using the Arcan design so we'll see
how<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.670> create<00:03:54.269> simple<00:03:54.750> material<00:03:55.170> as<00:03:55.290> the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
how to create simple material as the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.190 
how to create simple material as the
food<00:03:55.920> material<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:57.150> leader<00:03:57.390> material<00:03:57.870> and

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
food material the leader material and

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.750 
food material the leader material and
the<00:03:58.560> metal<00:03:59.220> material<00:04:00.590> from<00:04:01.590> scratch<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:02.700> you

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
the metal material from scratch so you

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.140 
the metal material from scratch so you
see<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.209> we'll<00:04:03.840> use<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.890> ark<00:04:05.310> indesign<00:04:05.850> to

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
see that we'll use the ark indesign to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.490 
see that we'll use the ark indesign to
do<00:04:06.410> some<00:04:07.410> stuffs<00:04:08.090> we'll<00:04:09.090> see<00:04:09.360> also<00:04:09.840> out<00:04:10.110> you

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
do some stuffs we'll see also out you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.160 
do some stuffs we'll see also out you
create<00:04:11.010> some<00:04:11.370> texture<00:04:11.790> as<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.450> boot<00:04:12.660> texture

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
create some texture as the boot texture

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.190 
create some texture as the boot texture
starting<00:04:14.100> from

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.390 

cg<00:04:17.040> texture<00:04:18.140> downloaded<00:04:19.140> by<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.410> website<00:04:19.800> and

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
cg texture downloaded by the website and

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.500 
cg texture downloaded by the website and
then<00:04:20.900> we'll<00:04:21.900> see<00:04:22.200> how<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.500> adjust<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:23.760> map<00:04:24.060> to

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
then we'll see how to adjust this map to

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.640 
then we'll see how to adjust this map to
be<00:04:24.660> used<00:04:24.930> on<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.470> rapid<00:04:26.400> UVs<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:28.050> just<00:04:28.350> created

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
be used on the rapid UVs we just created

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.540 
be used on the rapid UVs we just created
for<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.400> root<00:04:29.610> parts<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:31.830> rendering<00:04:32.250> will<00:04:32.400> be

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
for the root parts the rendering will be

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.260 
for the root parts the rendering will be
created<00:04:33.450> using<00:04:33.570> mental<00:04:34.260> ray<00:04:34.350> but<00:04:35.190> we'll<00:04:35.970> use

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
created using mental ray but we'll use

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.140 
created using mental ray but we'll use
also<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:37.050> render<00:04:37.410> elements<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.010> we'll<00:04:38.880> see

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
also the render elements and we'll see

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.770 
also the render elements and we'll see
also<00:04:39.840> how<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.140> use<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.980> state<00:04:41.310> set<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:42.570> create

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
also how to use the state set to create

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.010 
also how to use the state set to create
two<00:04:43.650> different<00:04:43.970> render<00:04:44.970> passes<00:04:45.270> with<00:04:45.990> a

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
two different render passes with a

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.170 
two different render passes with a

nice quality but with a different look

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.930 
nice quality but with a different look
and<00:05:09.810> then<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:10.530> see<00:05:10.740> that<00:05:10.890> we<00:05:11.040> have<00:05:11.220> different

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
and then you see that we have different

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.780 
and then you see that we have different
passes<00:05:12.450> to<00:05:13.020> simulate<00:05:13.590> depth<00:05:14.010> of<00:05:14.190> field<00:05:14.520> and

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
passes to simulate depth of field and

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.890 
passes to simulate depth of field and

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
step with a simple but huge compositing

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.010 
step with a simple but huge compositing
process<00:05:25.680> you<00:05:25.920> see<00:05:26.250> with<00:05:26.550> some<00:05:26.940> simulation<00:05:27.780> for

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
process you see with some simulation for

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.920 
process you see with some simulation for
the<00:05:28.320> depth<00:05:28.500> of<00:05:28.620> field<00:05:29.270> lighting<00:05:30.270> adjustment

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.430 
the depth of field lighting adjustment
and<00:05:31.170> other<00:05:32.040> really<00:05:33.000> interesting<00:05:33.030> stuff<00:05:33.630> easy

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
and other really interesting stuff easy

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.690 
and other really interesting stuff easy
to<00:05:34.770> create<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:36.180> final<00:05:36.810> compositing<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:37.830> the

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
to create the final compositing and the

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.240 
to create the final compositing and the
final<00:05:39.210> loop<00:05:39.570> development<00:05:40.320> will<00:05:40.770> obtain<00:05:40.920> our

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
final loop development will obtain our

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.340 
final loop development will obtain our
for<00:05:41.580> an<00:05:41.700> image<00:05:41.940> so<00:05:42.480> the<00:05:42.510> skills<00:05:43.110> will<00:05:43.320> be

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
for an image so the skills will be

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.900 
for an image so the skills will be
really<00:05:43.860> interesting<00:05:43.890> because<00:05:44.400> we'll

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
really interesting because we'll

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.150 
really interesting because we'll
approach<00:05:45.270> to<00:05:45.540> a<00:05:45.570> simple<00:05:46.050> project<00:05:46.500> but<00:05:46.950> will

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
approach to a simple project but will

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.790 
approach to a simple project but will
cover<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:47.760> entire<00:05:47.850> workflow<00:05:48.540> since<00:05:49.260> modeling
