00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.190
 feel with you today in one 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.470
 show very short video how to 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.510
 Mostly prepared 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.660
 there you can quite wrong 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.030
 we need a pot 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.960
 a relatively large so the fig 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.750
 because of reinpassen 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.029
 the sausages and can swim one 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.609
 pot with matching lids 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.340
 I already have plenty of water in there 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.560
 and I am now first to the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.560
 cook and then it goes on 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:42.469
 the water is boiling now it is being salted 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.050
 and I give a little parsley pure 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:49.440
 so stem 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:54.750
 who or what else is not allowed in there 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:01:02.010
 Now I make the pot out of it 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:05.180
 from the stove plate and give the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.180
 whitewashed pure 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.880
 then comes the lid again 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.619
 and they're about twelve now 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.720
 minutes 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.409
 they are not allowed to cook because of that 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.540
 down from the stove top and that with 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.240
 parsley that is not a must that can 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.009
 you but something else as in those where 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.440
 things as always have been heard 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.270
 not in any case 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.110
 and now we leave the twelve minutes 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.240
 pull the white sausages 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.869
 the twelve minutes are over 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.140
 white sausages are hot and you can see 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.090
 then do not burst the water 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.090
 definitely can not cook anymore 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.800
 if the white sausages come in because of that 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.799
 immediately from the plate 110 and now 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.000
 I take two out of the rest may 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.000
 definitely stay in there 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:17.440
 then you stay hot the winner 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.590
 met and I renounce that 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:26.280
 of course you have a white sausage 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:31.090
 Mustard that is a sweet one 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:35.040
 of course pretzels and what not 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.590
 is missing is of course a read bio 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.560
 the wheat beer glass is initially under 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.180
 kept under the cold water with it 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.750
 the glass gets cool and then through 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.750
 poured out 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.560
 that's what our prepared looks like 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.540
 white sausage breakfast from now on it goes 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:22.710
 how do you eat the weisswürste the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.890
 Traditional method is the most white sausage 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.610
 undress 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.240
 that means you suck what you do not 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:35.050
 of course is the pelle 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:39.340
 to eat with that is completely wrong and 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.080
 also makes the prototypical never in Bavaria, the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.480
 are you equal hear the preußen 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.489
 because everything is above bayern 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.830
 is that all pruss and have everything 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.540
 no idea and now I'll show you 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.260
 how to do it with a knife and 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.170
 fork can eat and now on the subject 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.140
 how do you eat how important 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.860
 traditionally as already said to draw 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:15.840
 the trade possibility you already something 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:15.840
 cut in and pearl 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:29.770
 just pull off the balls so that is 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.760
 the method number one and tablets 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.420
 the pel 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:40.420
 quite the other way with knife 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:48.250
 and fork does not quite cut here 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:51.430
 through and you stood out the sow and 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:56.170
 then you have this one piece here 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.490
 simple as that and then you can here 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:03.060
 continue from that 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:05.560
 if you just cut back here 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.710
 himself here again 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.670
 bit cut through the pill here 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:16.000
 make it off and then you have the good then 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.730
