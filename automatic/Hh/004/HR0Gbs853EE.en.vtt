00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.309
 I 'm just with you today to record a 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.920
 video as soon as I have already own a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.320
 Blog showing everything here in Natal 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.119
 only then a lot of people keep asking 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.119
 commented on the videos so I decided to do 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.380
 a video about it only the following 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.689
 whoever accompanies the blog knows that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.699
 two months optimism the hair and 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.619
 they are usually changing the tamayo ink 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.520
 many paints I'll try the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.759
 Paints so this video will not stay 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.800
 out of date 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.750
 here I'll just speak the procedures 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.600
 until I get red 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.750
 when I started getting red even though I 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.160
 I will stop talking and you already operate post 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.379
 in the blog that is always updating 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.219
 Whenever I paint, I'll put the name of the ink 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.920
 in so good so come on it's the next 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.039
 I had light brown hair, and I 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.010
 already had painted in black and everything 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.559
 I was only there a year and a half ago. 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.140
 and the black paint had already fallen and everything 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.280
 more was professionalizing paint the photo 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.110
 will is here is good at it I attached little I 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.600
 I stayed a year so the mail feels 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.700
 indignant and wanted to change that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.610
 I wanted to see that everything was going to be what I wanted 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.600
 he is more natural and that's when I decided 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.490
 turn red 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.439
 I thought so, man, I'm with you. 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.229
 presence in hair even with hair 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.450
 all facing the light brown that is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.009
 Mine has that deal in black ink. 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.369
 very difficult to leave 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.979
 So I got the boy was still there. 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.590
 I thought it's good when I get red. 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.270
 do to make a woman in the hall 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.270
 and such strands or PA 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.939
 I'll ask for women to do. 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.229
 some wicks here because it was where 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.780
 had black ink 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.390
 Okay, she painted with the ink style 8 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.000
 r I do not know what to score, this would be a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.360
 very bum letta brand and she 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.479
 did she make thick strands of hair 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.509
 I'll get more down here and 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.340
 I hit my hair with this ink 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.910
 At the beginning it was beautiful, wonderful 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.099
 The photo is in this, right? 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.000
 It's beautiful, wonderful, that orange is perfect. 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.590
 huh 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.810
 three days later he became a middle-aged ox 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.540
 yellowed three days of politics 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.910
 three days later with that LamarÃ£o side 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.620
 even though they deserve nothing and it is a milk 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.870
 Why do we need to paint our hair? 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.590
 because he was not giving that 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.019
 Yellow the pink on that you see more then 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.069
 What you noticed in the photo 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:47.739
 even with the strands in the hair became light 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.560
 natural understood I thought it was to stain 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.440
 is not show so my hair that was 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.630
 natural brown natural did not find it 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.209
 so I've necessarily done the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.620
 wicks because if you notice the same 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.720
 the goals we were in that did not 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.720
 were discolored the paint took 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.930
 usually this is ok 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.660
 Then I decided to paint with that. 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.560
 at home rate that day I looked in the pharmacy 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:18.310
 the biocolor 7.44 is the people 's bill 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.560
 mccollum 7:44 start optional volume 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.680
 video that already comes I think I already came 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.420
 Continuous tried it and this is the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.849
 result first with that 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.579
 Red stove so I'll show 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.440
 you 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.870
 after three days he defeated the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.019
 very pretty orange or not so show 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.599
 factor also in this orange 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.889
 cute too from fast bottomed of 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.440
 sewage in one month 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.900
 they received people I failed understood 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.940
 because while I find on Thursday 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.549
 I did not really 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.750
 choose a lot of neon because then I 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.299
 I've been a long time trying to hide 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.889
 move because the locks opened very fast 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.290
 because it was very clear not of life 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:02.799
 so clear so early in the month after 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.950
 defeated wipes waxen neither clear nor 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.450
 very bright indeed and then I went to 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.269
 pharmacy again a month later we 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.069
 been followed for a month even I do not recommend it 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.349
 Obviously I usually know that it takes three 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.979
 months for hair and healthy but I do not 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:21.000
 I was enduring the situation in this 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.040
 I bought koleston and it's not 4 now released. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.290
 the two versions of koleston on set but the 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.560
 that I do not know anymore 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.730
 here I used was 6 64 nor 6 point for 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.100
 64 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.890
 I do not know if it was replaced I do not know 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.640
 I 'm not, I 'm not like that knowing these 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.440
 Ribbons of pharmacy, that's when I went to 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.330
 law she mixed it is so I thought 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.510
 so face like the other time with my 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.450
 Colo turned the stove red 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.550
 I'll mix it as a type toner 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.340
 toning to darken to invest 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.800
 who to turn vermilion to wine 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.930
 So this at home, we do not even jump. 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.300
 all this is no use asking me 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.950
 in the mix is the current works do not know 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.560
 that this depends on the ink in the hair and 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:09.300
 This is good to look for a professional tap 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:12.990
 then I showed the gel flow 7.4 is 7.44 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.130
 along with the glue are 64 and went well 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.810
 That's how cool it was for me. 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.930
 I thought it was a wine 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.030
 Look at the picture with wine and reddish mail. 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.880
 and self-analysis before then taken 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.760
 in my head and illegal access to people 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.229
 I just lost the last part of this 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.340
 video was watching I'll record from 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.780
 new here, right? 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.090
 I'm recording another video but had those 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.220
 makeup had little else but 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:41.010
 everything is there I asked for the cold mixed 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:44.370
 17.44 and the collection 64 because the 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.840
 afflicted by the joy of voting and 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.640
 does not play very red hair and 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.010
 to let him come, and he was exactly the 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.990
 that happened leaving the hair wine and 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.460
 company was adopted there and was 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.560

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.630
 defeating and eventually leaving the hair 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.820
 very pretty, pretty orange in which I passed 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.380

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.860

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.860
