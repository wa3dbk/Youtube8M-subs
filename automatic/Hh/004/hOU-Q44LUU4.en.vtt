00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:11.510
 First of all I talked about the tube single as the current situation so far with the short hairstyle 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:13.670
 It was one month ago that was the last time in a state where it was stretched 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.200
 q I'm in a state 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.180
 Again though you can see and you'll look around first from Mohawk Edo-3 made by 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.210
 Inverse panel 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:28.270
 That you have to look out for that time 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.270
 Gradually the pachinko will continue to add up to radiation 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:40.100
 Right-handed party at this time 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:43.550
 The direction of the stay list should change in particular. 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.150
 When the top section is pulled out as well 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.530
 With the part that is helping to lighten 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:56.900
 See the part where the weight that isn't helping is going well 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:03.830
 What I have to put in now is the part where this middle thickness has stopped 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.550
 The roundness of this top section was made to look beautiful most naturally 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.140
 The 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.710
 Of course layers and soul for it 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.060
 It becomes possible by adjusting the texture of the coming part 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.980
 As it is masterpiece key one curl about the whole 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.490
 Flat winding the same as in the Eto hair destination to the next to those who pulled out 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:28.550
 Think 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:34.010
 If you can do it, put the things you put on from behind in the order of the side back finally 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:38.420
 I think that it will be the most important point to finish it in a short time 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.310
 As a whole, it is an orthodox agoline bob, so it tends to be commonplace 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.260
 But there dare 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.980
 Setting a short number makes her stand out and individuality 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.960
 The 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:54.000
 Light but it's Well heavier than just look the other other hand accumulated in the positive down 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:00.720
 Layer settings, etc. to create a feel for what you think 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.690
 Three bad keys: heavy texture , yet easy to handle 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:09.000
 I made a design for the word 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:13.140
 Because she thinks that it is a texture adjustment that can be done easily even if she falls herself 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.550
 This time sailing but I think that there is an age corresponding to the Fenice ring 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:23.330
 We will make it with scissors with only the collar foot part used 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.330
 Well , it is a process that can be made in a short time
