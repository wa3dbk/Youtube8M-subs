possession style of football but very

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.910 
possession style of football but very
quick<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.660> counter-attack<00:00:22.080> as<00:00:22.500> well<00:00:22.710> and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
quick on the counter-attack as well and

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.099 
quick on the counter-attack as well and
probably<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.850> whipping<00:00:24.180> boys<00:00:24.330> Australia<00:00:25.050> I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
think we're all agreed that term it's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.179 
think we're all agreed that term it's
gonna<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.269> probably<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.199> little<00:00:28.470> bit<00:00:28.800> too<00:00:29.010> much

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
gonna be probably a little bit too much

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.209 
gonna be probably a little bit too much
for<00:00:29.429> them<00:00:29.750> but<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.470> opening<00:00:31.740> fixture<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
course is fascinating as well Spain

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.530 
course is fascinating as well Spain
against<00:00:34.469> Holland<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.670> group<00:00:35.940> which<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
against Holland in that group which is a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.410

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
instincts early in their style of play

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.639 
instincts early in their style of play
and<00:00:44.940> they<00:00:45.000> try<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> kick<00:00:45.629> Spain<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.379> park

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
but thankfully in the end good overcame

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.670 
but thankfully in the end good overcame
evil<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.520> Spanish<00:00:50.969> went<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.600> lift<00:00:52.350> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
beautiful football with wide open spaces

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.609 
beautiful football with wide open spaces
as<00:01:08.520> we're<00:01:08.970> accustomed<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.450> seeing<00:01:09.750> under<00:01:10.350> that

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
as we're accustomed to seeing under that

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.190 
as we're accustomed to seeing under that
particular<00:01:11.040> manager<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.689> bodes<00:01:12.900> well<00:01:13.020> for

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
particular manager so it bodes well for

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
particular manager so it bodes well for
a<00:01:13.409> terrific<00:01:13.590> game<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.060> hard<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> get

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
a terrific game but it's hard to get

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
a terrific game but it's hard to get
possession<00:01:15.810> when<00:01:16.590> you're<00:01:16.740> playing<00:01:16.890> against

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
possession when you're playing against

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.859 
possession when you're playing against
Spain<00:01:17.460> because<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:17.909> are<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> Masters<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
Spain because they are the Masters at it

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.609 
Spain because they are the Masters at it
and<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:20.330> of<00:01:21.330> course<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.080> look<00:01:22.229> at<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and and of course if you look at it you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.679 
and and of course if you look at it you
could<00:01:22.830> say<00:01:23.009> Spain<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> possibly<00:01:24.060> stronger<00:01:24.540> now

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
could say Spain a possibly stronger now

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.149 
could say Spain a possibly stronger now
than<00:01:24.990> they've<00:01:25.530> been<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.920> last<00:01:26.070> three

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
than they've been in the last three

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.490 
than they've been in the last three
tournaments<00:01:26.820> which<00:01:26.939> they've<00:01:27.180> won<00:01:27.500> because

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
tournaments which they've won because

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.399 
tournaments which they've won because
they've<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.670> times<00:01:29.970> lacked<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.570> centre<00:01:31.140> forward

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
they've at times lacked a centre forward

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.410 
they've at times lacked a centre forward
figure<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.400> they've<00:01:32.579> got<00:01:32.700> Diego<00:01:32.970> Costa

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
figure but now they've got Diego Costa

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.600 
figure but now they've got Diego Costa
who's<00:01:33.540> been<00:01:33.780> an<00:01:34.590> absolute<00:01:34.979> revelation<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
a couple of years ago and it was a tough

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.969 
a couple of years ago and it was a tough
game<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:51.060> Spain<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.509> they'll<00:01:52.500> cause<00:01:52.710> both

game for Spain and they'll cause both

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.310 
game for Spain and they'll cause both
those<00:01:53.250> sites<00:01:53.490> probably<00:01:53.750> problems<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:55.049> just

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
those sites probably problems it's just

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.630 
those sites probably problems it's just
a<00:01:55.380> question<00:01:55.710> whether<00:01:55.860> they<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.040> sneak<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.549> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
a question whether they can sneak in and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.660 
a question whether they can sneak in and
