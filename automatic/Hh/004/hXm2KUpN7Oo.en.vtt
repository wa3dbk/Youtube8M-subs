00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
- any antenna to stop them but L think

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.219 
- any antenna to stop them but L think
it<00:01:29.509> would<00:01:29.690> work<00:01:29.930> at<00:01:30.140> all<00:01:31.720> since<00:01:32.720> you're<00:01:32.930> adding

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
it would work at all since you're adding

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.380 
it would work at all since you're adding
new<00:01:33.259> colors<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.039> 3ds<00:01:34.399> version<00:01:34.520> of<00:01:35.030> certain

hand<00:01:35.630> slip<00:01:36.170> no<00:01:36.320> Studios<00:01:36.770> 3d<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:37.490> don't<00:01:38.149> think

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
hand slip no Studios 3d I don't think

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.590 
hand slip no Studios 3d I don't think
could<00:01:38.509> be<00:01:38.720> make<00:01:38.899> sense<00:01:39.259> for<00:01:39.470> them<00:01:39.590> -<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:40.600> don't

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
could be make sense for them - I don't

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.120 
could be make sense for them - I don't
know<00:01:42.850> it's<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:44.000> good<00:01:44.270> idea<00:01:44.420> are<00:01:45.380> they<00:01:45.619> just<00:01:45.860> bad

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
know it's a good idea are they just bad

00:01:46.130 --> 00:02:02.440 
know it's a good idea are they just bad
neither<00:01:46.460> removing<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:48.409> old<00:01:48.590> antenna

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.140 

nice<00:02:03.080> flip<00:02:03.560> notes<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:04.070> are<00:02:04.610> available<00:02:04.880> right

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
nice flip notes that are available right

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.430 
nice flip notes that are available right
now<00:02:06.280> like<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.640> really<00:02:07.970> wished<00:02:08.209> up<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.810> really

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
now like I really wished up I really

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.680 
now like I really wished up I really
wish<00:02:09.619> there<00:02:09.830> was<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.039> way<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:10.399> antenna<00:02:11.090> could

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
wish there was a way that antenna could

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.740 
wish there was a way that antenna could
have<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> 3ds<00:02:13.160> website<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.150> root<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
have a 3ds website of the root of the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.610 
have a 3ds website of the root of the
antenna<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.530> DSi<00:02:16.370> version<00:02:17.319> it<00:02:18.319> might<00:02:18.470> be

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
antenna and the DSi version it might be

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.240 
antenna and the DSi version it might be
pretty<00:02:18.800> cool<00:02:19.100> there<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.680> not<00:02:21.680> have<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.980> shut

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
pretty cool there and not have to shut

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.590 
pretty cool there and not have to shut
down<00:02:22.280> one<00:02:22.730> for<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.209> other<00:02:25.060> or<00:02:26.060> maybe<00:02:26.300> there

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
down one for the other or maybe there

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.199 
down one for the other or maybe there
will<00:02:26.690> be<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.840> way<00:02:27.110> that<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:28.700> can<00:02:28.880> actually

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
will be a way that you can actually

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.800 
will be a way that you can actually
transfer<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.840> your<00:02:29.930> 3ds<00:02:30.410> or<00:02:31.599> if<00:02:32.599> they'll

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
transfer it to your 3ds or if they'll

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.309 
transfer it to your 3ds or if they'll
update<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.470> tenants<00:02:33.860> have<00:02:34.010> six<00:02:34.310> colors<00:02:34.700> to

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
update and tenants have six colors to

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.110 
update and tenants have six colors to
like<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.500> was<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.739> under<00:02:37.040> wine<00:02:37.250> tent<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.880> only

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
like I was to under wine tent and only

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.690 
like I was to under wine tent and only

has about one red and blue
we<00:02:44.120> gotta<00:02:44.330> up<00:02:44.569> with<00:02:44.810> other<00:02:45.019> colors<00:02:45.380> be<00:02:45.560> worth

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
we gotta up with other colors be worth

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.840 
we gotta up with other colors be worth
it<00:02:46.040> for<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.430> 3ds<00:02:46.760> version<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.670> would<00:02:49.670> then

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
it for the 3ds version and would then

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.850 
it for the 3ds version and would then
improve<00:02:50.209> this<00:02:50.360> space<00:02:50.810> when<00:02:51.290> we<00:02:51.410> can<00:02:51.560> just<00:02:51.590> slip

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
improve this space when we can just slip

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.890 
improve this space when we can just slip
nope

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
nope

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.390 
nope
maybe<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:54.019> maybe<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.830> might<00:02:54.980> actually

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
maybe I maybe that might actually

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.270 
maybe I maybe that might actually
improve<00:02:56.319> like<00:02:57.319> instead<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.709> just<00:02:57.830> stopping

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
improve like instead of just stopping

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.729 
improve like instead of just stopping
that<00:02:58.549> uh<00:02:58.610> passing<00:02:59.390> close<00:02:59.780> it<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.200> speak<00:03:00.500> nine

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
that uh passing close it I speak nine

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.979 
that uh passing close it I speak nine
