00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.559
 and to apply the theme of prestige 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.320
 electrical that is different from the others 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:14.429
 let's see the good topic when 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.950
 we reached level 60 at the expense of level 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.840
 from 1 to 60 once we get there 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.240
 at 60 we can walk presided over but 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.140
 how can we know for example here to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.029
 this character that we have a level 60 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.720
 maximum 60 but we can not if we want 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.470
 keep flying 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.140
 we can not follow 61 nor the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 next iconic are worth that we have 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.530
 then that's what we have to do 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.079
 here we have 10 people who are worth 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.809
 we have 10 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.809
 then each character has a symbol 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.030
 for example here you can see to the right 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.360
 and that means that the staff reaches 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.879
 maximum of 12 how much when we do the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.010
 second character for parkinson when 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.420
 I say badly you feel we understand another one is 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.489
 different credit and so on up to ten 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.489
 great the ten principles that we have 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.460
 and you can put it what you want 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.759
 they are worth the same will start this the other 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.280
 each character of each time you do 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.490
 with different characters and reach the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.869
 universe and surpass level 60 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.020
 you can have to play with other people 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.460
 if you want to change the drawing we want 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.140
 for example play with this character 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.140
 we can play perfectly with this 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.119
 character we currently have all the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.640
 things that we have unlocked and it is 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.740
 we have as if he were always players 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.600
 ok and now for example if we want 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.490
 play from level 0 here for example 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.100
 in this character before we have it 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.280
 unlock we have this one cost us 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.409
 the first 8 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.040
 the first six costs us three points 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:04.390
 after seventh it costs us 200 points 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.290
 the eighth 300 the ninth 400 and the last 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.990
 the 500 accounts soon 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.930
 of platoon if we want to place as 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.140
 they argue the first costs us very 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.210
 little and he 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.160
 the seventh and the positions enough ma 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.100
 Platoon 200 points we need to gather 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.230
 the five and yes yes every time 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.230
 example let's unlock this voucher 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.840
 and now we can select a series of 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.050
 little things we do not have five seconds 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.450
 unlocking then you can for example 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.910
 we have certain gusts and certain 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.860
 advantages and some equipment unlocked 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.690
 already by default now if we want it to be 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.350
 our inspiring staff 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.460
 here we have gunner worth 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.460
 here we have the covered 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.970
 there are some gusts and forgiveness invented 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.819
 they are also runaway because the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.069
 advantages and others as we go up 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:13.150
 the level we can go unlocking or 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:21.300
 also if we have a much higher cost 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:25.830
 to 96 we selected 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:29.130
 undercover we selected this and here already 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.220
 we have our paper and it's worth 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.550
 perfectly and we have here as you can 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.070
 see some advantages worth of very rank 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.740
 high for example in unlock the 5 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.060
 understand this would be the 53 that would be 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.400
 invisible 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.590
 ok and some networks as you can see 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.140
 this window already has it by default already 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.030
 has unlocked our character and is 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.740
 drag for example also worth 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.040
 and by default we have 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.129

 first that is always unlocked 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.410
 with respect because we have selected
