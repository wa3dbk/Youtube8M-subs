make a knot and hot glue that top so
just<00:01:31.180> tie<00:01:31.960> this<00:01:32.020> quickly

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.020 

can<00:01:36.090> also<00:01:36.240> instead<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.810> using<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.109> hot<00:01:37.259> glue<00:01:37.289> gun

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
can also instead of using a hot glue gun

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.349 
can also instead of using a hot glue gun
somehow<00:01:39.030> tie<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.079> headband<00:01:40.649> I<00:01:41.359> don't

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.649 
but I think this will work supposed to a
hot<00:03:09.189> glue<00:03:09.400> dries<00:03:09.670> it's<00:03:09.969> really<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.239> melted

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659
