00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.540
 if you have recently installed windows 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.059
 8 on your computer is taking 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.950
 difficulty there to share your 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.690
 internet 3g 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.470
 I searched about it on the internet and 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.600
 I discovered that Microsoft took the option 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.260
 you are creating on a network and doc 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.740
 on your computer as we did in the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.740
 set 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.540
 sharing your internet with others 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.540
 devices 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.750
 you can see we do not have the option to create 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.329
 a haddock network 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.360
 it makes it very difficult to whom the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.660
 mobile tablets and video games that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.180
 connects to the internet 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.250
 then on microsoft's website 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.039
 they are saying that everyone who is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.340
 using eight, but note that there is no 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.410
 plus the option to create a haddock network the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.899
 our notebook to share the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.619
 internet connection with other 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:13.049
 devices and here below they cite 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.600
 a process you 're doing to activate 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.320
 this network and doc on the computer 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.110

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.490

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.280
 sharing the internet 3g of the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:44.040
 My notebook was using this 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:47.640

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.190
 computer 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.480
 after you restart your computer 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.410
 you need to connect your internet 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.580

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.110
 means you are sharing the 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.050
 internet in my case here I came 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.210

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:31.670
 I choose her here I'll choose the option 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:37.110
 Hi, I'm going to share with the hifi 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:40.650
 and here is the type of network authentication 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.150
 if you want to protect your network there you 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.280
 you may be putting this first option 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.850
 in capturing as wpa2 third to second 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.280
 option is an unprotected open network 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:04:01.140
 and the third is wpp has two types of 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.330
 protection of the way I put the network 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:09.570

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:13.590
 between graffiti and xbox does not recognize 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.530
 so I put it open without password 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.200
 it is important to note that if you 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.970
 choose one of these two options to 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.950
 first or third 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.440
 you will have to automatically put 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:30.070
 a password of at least eight digits 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.920
