I'm gonna try something a little
different<00:00:06.359> as<00:00:06.810> far<00:00:06.839> as<00:00:07.140> drinks<00:00:07.589> go<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:07.799> didn't

different as far as drinks go I didn't

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.060 
different as far as drinks go I didn't
try<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.429> Jones<00:00:08.790> soda<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:10.200> flavor<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.740> blue

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
try a Jones soda and the flavor is blue

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.390 
try a Jones soda and the flavor is blue
bubblegum<00:00:11.670> soda<00:00:12.000> so<00:00:12.630> that's<00:00:12.840> definitely

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
bubblegum soda so that's definitely

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.709 
bubblegum soda so that's definitely
quite<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> bit<00:00:14.610> different<00:00:15.000> from<00:00:15.150> most<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
quite a bit different from most of the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.450 
quite a bit different from most of the
more<00:00:16.020> popular<00:00:16.230> flavors<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.160> see<00:00:17.340> out

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
more popular flavors that we see out

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.460 
more popular flavors that we see out
there<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:18.390> hey<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.960> looks<00:00:19.109> interesting

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
there but hey it looks interesting

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.040 
there but hey it looks interesting
hopefully<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.520> tastes<00:00:20.880> good<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.330> figure<00:00:21.810> why

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
hopefully it tastes good I figure why

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.689 
hopefully it tastes good I figure why
not<00:00:22.080> give<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> shot<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.039> guess<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.460> blue

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
not give it a shot I guess the blue

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.519 
not give it a shot I guess the blue
color<00:00:23.970> bottle<00:00:24.420> kind<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.750> jumped<00:00:25.080> out<00:00:25.170> at<00:00:25.320> me<00:00:25.350> at

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
color bottle kind of jumped out at me at

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.040 
color bottle kind of jumped out at me at
the<00:00:25.619> store<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.460> decided<00:00:27.240> especially<00:00:27.869> since

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the store so I decided especially since

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.359 
the store so I decided especially since
I've<00:00:28.170> been<00:00:28.230> doing<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.710> many<00:00:28.769> root<00:00:29.099> beers<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
I've been doing so many root beers and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.640 
I've been doing so many root beers and
cream<00:00:29.670> sodas<00:00:30.060> lately<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> figured<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.990> should

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
cream sodas lately I figured I should

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.770 
cream sodas lately I figured I should
switch<00:00:31.949> things<00:00:32.219> up<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.520> bit

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
switch things up a bit

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.450 
switch things up a bit
so<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.410> those<00:00:34.530> who<00:00:34.680> don't<00:00:35.010> know<00:00:35.100> much<00:00:35.399> about

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
so for those who don't know much about

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.260 
so for those who don't know much about
Jones<00:00:36.059> soda<00:00:36.559> originally<00:00:37.559> started<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.520> Western

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
Jones soda originally started in Western

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.440 
Jones soda originally started in Western
Canada<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:40.379> Vancouver<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> believe<00:00:41.460> now<00:00:42.239> its

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
Canada in Vancouver I believe now its

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.630 
Canada in Vancouver I believe now its
headquarters<00:00:43.219> headquartered<00:00:44.219> down<00:00:44.370> in

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
headquarters headquartered down in

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.510 
headquarters headquartered down in
Seattle<00:00:45.210> Washington<00:00:46.129> one<00:00:47.129> thing<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.489> I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
Seattle Washington one thing that I

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
Seattle Washington one thing that I
notice<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> lot<00:00:49.050> of

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
notice is that it's in a lot of

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.490 
notice is that it's in a lot of
Starbucks<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.460> find<00:00:50.940> Jones<00:00:51.239> sodas<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:52.289> least

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
Starbucks you find Jones sodas at least

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.840 
Starbucks you find Jones sodas at least
the<00:00:52.590> ones<00:00:52.739> I've<00:00:52.920> been<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.489> think<00:00:53.699> that

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the ones I've been to so I think that

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.160 
the ones I've been to so I think that
probably<00:00:54.059> has<00:00:54.360> something<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:54.899> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
probably has something to do with it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.869 
probably has something to do with it
being<00:00:55.410> based<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> Seattle<00:00:56.550> Washington

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
being based out of Seattle Washington

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.670 
being based out of Seattle Washington
Starbucks<00:00:57.780> being<00:00:57.989> based<00:00:58.230> out<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.440> Seattle

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
Starbucks being based out of Seattle

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.740 
Starbucks being based out of Seattle
Washington<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.270> kind<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
Washington so you have kind of a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.160 
Washington so you have kind of a
connection<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.629> interesting

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
connection there so one interesting

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.109 
connection there so one interesting
thing<00:01:04.199> about<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.519> see<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.939> photo

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
thing about it is if you see the photo

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.080 
thing about it is if you see the photo
here<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.680> they<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.250> something<00:01:08.729> where

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
here on it they have something where

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
here on it they have something where
people<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.990> send<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.470> their<00:01:10.619> photos<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
people can send in their photos if you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.429 
people can send in their photos if you
like<00:01:11.580> Jones<00:01:11.850> soda<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.450> if<00:01:12.900> they<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
like Jones soda and if they like the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.469 
like Jones soda and if they like the
picture<00:01:13.799> they'll<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.270> their

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
picture they'll use it on one of their

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.260 
picture they'll use it on one of their
bottles<00:01:15.869> which<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> kind<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.439> neat<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.090> as<00:01:18.090> far

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
bottles which is kind of neat and as far

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.160 
bottles which is kind of neat and as far
as<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.509> ingredients<00:01:19.170> go<00:01:19.909> nothing<00:01:21.170> very

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
as the ingredients go nothing very

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
as the ingredients go nothing very
different<00:01:22.740> from<00:01:22.950> most<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.360> out

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
different from most of what we see out

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.350 
different from most of what we see out
there<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:25.080> uses<00:01:25.799> cane<00:01:26.070> sugar<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.210> does

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
there it uses cane sugar but it does

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.870 
there it uses cane sugar but it does
have<00:01:27.540> some<00:01:27.780> preservatives<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.590> an

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
have some preservatives and an

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.960 
have some preservatives and an
artificial<00:01:30.320> coloring<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.220> guess

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
artificial coloring in there so I guess

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.950 
artificial coloring in there so I guess
in<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.840> way<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.110> uses<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.640> little<00:01:35.960> bit

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
in one way it uses it's a little bit

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
in one way it uses it's a little bit
more<00:01:37.170> natural<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.040> uses<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.880> cane

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
more natural in that it uses the cane

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
more natural in that it uses the cane
sugar<00:01:39.600> instead<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.140> high-fructose<00:01:40.530> corn

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
sugar instead of the high-fructose corn

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.200 
sugar instead of the high-fructose corn
but<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.430> does<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.759> all<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.090> other

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
but it does have all the other

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.999 
but it does have all the other
preservatives<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.960> all<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:43.860> you're

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
preservatives and all that so if you're

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.560 
preservatives and all that so if you're
looking<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.490> something<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:44.939> purely

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
looking for something that's purely

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.160 
looking for something that's purely
natural<00:01:46.170> probably<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.750> so<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:49.049> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
natural probably not for you so on to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.200 
natural probably not for you so on to
the<00:01:49.259> important<00:01:49.710> part

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
the important part

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.880 
the important part
let's<00:01:51.210> see<00:01:51.540> what<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.780> looks<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.229> let's<00:01:52.710> see

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
let's see what it looks like let's see

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.880 
let's see what it looks like let's see
what<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.100> tastes<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:54.570> as<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.710> see

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
what it tastes like and as you can see

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.069 
what it tastes like and as you can see
from<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> bottle<00:01:56.579> top<00:01:56.790> here<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.689> screw-on

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
from the bottle top here it's a screw-on

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:16.460 
from the bottle top here it's a screw-on
and<00:01:58.640> we<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.729> a

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.170 

and<00:02:17.470> another<00:02:17.769> kind<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.310> interesting<00:02:18.610> thing

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
and another kind of interesting thing

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.520 
and another kind of interesting thing
that<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.620> see<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.830> they<00:02:21.519> have<00:02:21.750> little<00:02:22.750> fortunes

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
that I see is they have little fortunes

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.089 
that I see is they have little fortunes
in<00:02:23.800> here<00:02:24.040> I'm<00:02:24.610> not<00:02:24.670> sure<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:26.440> focus<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.980> really

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
in here I'm not sure the focus is really

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.160 
in here I'm not sure the focus is really
good<00:02:27.340> enough<00:02:27.489> but<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.760> says<00:02:27.940> an<00:02:28.209> unexpected

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
good enough but it says an unexpected

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.039 
good enough but it says an unexpected
windfall<00:02:29.410> will<00:02:30.160> be<00:02:30.310> yours<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:31.330> that's<00:02:31.720> kind<00:02:31.989> of

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
windfall will be yours so that's kind of

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.990 
windfall will be yours so that's kind of
funny<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.380> that's<00:02:32.590> kind<00:02:32.769> of<00:02:32.830> neat<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.280> don't

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
funny and that's kind of neat you don't

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.339 
funny and that's kind of neat you don't
often<00:02:34.180> see<00:02:34.330> fortunes<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.930> caps<00:02:38.170> of

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
often see fortunes on the the caps of

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.449 
often see fortunes on the the caps of
bottles<00:02:38.799> so<00:02:40.110> here's<00:02:41.110> what<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.319> looks<00:02:41.530> like<00:02:41.739> you

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
bottles so here's what it looks like you

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.180 
bottles so here's what it looks like you
can<00:02:42.610> probably<00:02:42.880> tell<00:02:43.209> just<00:02:43.510> like<00:02:44.260> when<00:02:44.620> we<00:02:44.950> saw

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
can probably tell just like when we saw

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.729 
can probably tell just like when we saw
in<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.370> bottle<00:02:45.730> it's<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.060> blue<00:02:46.540> green<00:02:47.230> color<00:02:47.650> to

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
in the bottle it's a blue green color to

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.990 
in the bottle it's a blue green color to
it<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:49.150> can<00:02:49.299> see<00:02:49.329> it's<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:51.400> can<00:02:51.549> see<00:02:51.760> through

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
it you can see it's you can see through

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.890 
it you can see it's you can see through
it<00:02:52.030> fairly<00:02:52.420> easily<00:02:52.900> here<00:02:55.680> smelling<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:57.900> smells

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
it fairly easily here smelling it smells

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.960 
it fairly easily here smelling it smells
very<00:02:59.110> sweet<00:03:00.450> almost<00:03:02.069> cream<00:03:03.069> soda<00:03:03.370> type<00:03:03.730> flavor

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
very sweet almost cream soda type flavor

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:13.710 
very sweet almost cream soda type flavor
I'd<00:03:04.269> say<00:03:04.989> initially<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:13.000> yeah<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.299> is<00:03:13.510> kind

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
I'd say initially and yeah that is kind

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.680 
I'd say initially and yeah that is kind
of<00:03:13.750> what<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:14.639> my<00:03:15.639> initial<00:03:16.000> thought<00:03:16.209> is<00:03:16.239> that<00:03:16.540> it

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
of what I my initial thought is that it

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.849 
of what I my initial thought is that it
does<00:03:16.870> taste<00:03:18.299> very<00:03:19.299> similar<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.290> cream<00:03:20.590> soda

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
does taste very similar to a cream soda

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.970 
does taste very similar to a cream soda
I'd<00:03:21.160> say<00:03:21.400> even<00:03:22.319> though<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.440> coloring<00:03:23.859> is

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
I'd say even though the coloring is

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:34.470 
I'd say even though the coloring is
different<00:03:31.500> yeah<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:32.739> it's<00:03:32.889> it's<00:03:33.220> okay<00:03:34.209> so<00:03:34.269> far

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
different yeah so it's it's okay so far

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.800 
different yeah so it's it's okay so far
I'm<00:03:35.470> not<00:03:35.530> quite<00:03:36.010> sure<00:03:36.090> if<00:03:37.090> I'm<00:03:37.269> gonna<00:03:37.450> like<00:03:37.780> it

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
I'm not quite sure if I'm gonna like it

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.319 
I'm not quite sure if I'm gonna like it
a<00:03:38.250> lot<00:03:39.250> but<00:03:40.799> it's<00:03:41.799> not<00:03:42.160> bad<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:43.030> far

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
a lot but it's not bad so far

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.530 
a lot but it's not bad so far
but<00:03:43.989> not<00:03:44.700> really<00:03:45.700> what<00:03:45.880> I<00:03:45.910> thought<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.420> would

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
but not really what I thought it would

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.650 
but not really what I thought it would
be<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.720> guess<00:03:47.019> it's<00:03:47.470> not<00:03:47.680> quite<00:03:47.980> as<00:03:48.160> different

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
be I guess it's not quite as different

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.589 
be I guess it's not quite as different
from<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.780> existing<00:03:49.989> sodas<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.709> I'm<00:03:50.799> used<00:03:51.010> to

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
from the existing sodas that I'm used to

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.960 
from the existing sodas that I'm used to
but<00:03:52.599> that's<00:03:53.049> okay<00:03:53.380> I'll<00:03:53.650> have<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.220> little<00:03:54.700> more

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
but that's okay I'll have a little more

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.879 
but that's okay I'll have a little more
but<00:03:55.180> I'll<00:03:55.269> finish<00:03:55.420> off<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.840> bottle<00:03:56.230> I'll<00:03:56.680> see

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
but I'll finish off the bottle I'll see

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.530 
but I'll finish off the bottle I'll see
what<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.069> think<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.639> I'll<00:03:57.880> get<00:03:58.060> back<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.420> you<00:03:58.480> in

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
a chance to finish up the soda just a

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.270 
a chance to finish up the soda just a
reminder<00:04:04.690> this<00:04:04.959> was<00:04:05.139> a<00:04:05.169> Jones<00:04:05.530> soda<00:04:05.950> the

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
reminder this was a Jones soda the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.949 
reminder this was a Jones soda the
flavor<00:04:06.519> was<00:04:06.760> blue<00:04:07.090> bubble<00:04:07.540> gum

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
flavor was blue bubble gum

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.830 
flavor was blue bubble gum
and<00:04:08.919> here<00:04:09.280> are<00:04:09.340> my<00:04:09.370> final<00:04:09.760> thoughts<00:04:09.970> on<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.329> if

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
and here are my final thoughts on it if

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.240 
and here are my final thoughts on it if
you<00:04:10.959> remember<00:04:11.260> when<00:04:11.380> I<00:04:11.410> was<00:04:11.620> having<00:04:11.889> my<00:04:12.010> first

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
you remember when I was having my first

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.190 
you remember when I was having my first
hip<00:04:12.519> I<00:04:12.640> thought<00:04:12.849> it<00:04:12.970> really<00:04:13.120> smelt<00:04:13.659> like<00:04:13.780> and

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
hip I thought it really smelt like and

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.020 
hip I thought it really smelt like and
had<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.680> little<00:04:14.890> bit<00:04:15.010> of<00:04:15.189> a<00:04:15.250> taste<00:04:15.489> similar<00:04:15.790> to

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
had a little bit of a taste similar to

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.280 
had a little bit of a taste similar to
cream<00:04:16.299> soda<00:04:16.630> and

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
cream soda and

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.020 
cream soda and
and<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.440> really<00:04:17.740> felt<00:04:17.980> that<00:04:18.070> throughout<00:04:18.550> but

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
and I really felt that throughout but

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.780 
and I really felt that throughout but
one<00:04:19.750> thing<00:04:20.140> that<00:04:20.170> I<00:04:20.350> really<00:04:20.680> noticed<00:04:20.890> was<00:04:21.760> that

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
one thing that I really noticed was that

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.210 
one thing that I really noticed was that
there<00:04:22.090> was<00:04:22.210> a<00:04:22.240> bit<00:04:22.480> of<00:04:22.510> a<00:04:22.660> sour<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.500> tart

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
there was a bit of a sour and tart

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.520 
there was a bit of a sour and tart
aftertaste<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.390> almost<00:04:25.960> like<00:04:26.230> the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
aftertaste to it almost like the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.990 
aftertaste to it almost like the
aftertaste<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.310> get<00:04:27.490> when<00:04:27.640> you're<00:04:27.760> drinking

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
aftertaste you get when you're drinking

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.360 
aftertaste you get when you're drinking
a<00:04:28.390> lemonade<00:04:28.840> and<00:04:29.080> that's<00:04:29.830> really<00:04:30.100> not

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
a lemonade and that's really not

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.490 
a lemonade and that's really not
something<00:04:30.820> I'd<00:04:30.940> expect<00:04:31.390> from<00:04:31.480> this<00:04:31.810> given<00:04:32.470> the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
something I'd expect from this given the

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.560 
something I'd expect from this given the
name<00:04:32.770> blue<00:04:33.130> bubble<00:04:33.490> gum<00:04:33.670> given<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.330> bright

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
name blue bubble gum given the bright

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.630 
name blue bubble gum given the bright
blue<00:04:34.900> color<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:35.290> it<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.740> thought<00:04:36.310> it<00:04:36.430> would<00:04:36.520> be

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
blue color of it I thought it would be

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.350 
blue color of it I thought it would be
something<00:04:36.880> that<00:04:37.060> would<00:04:37.240> be<00:04:37.390> more<00:04:37.630> sweet

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
something that would be more sweet

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.630 
something that would be more sweet
really<00:04:40.360> more<00:04:41.200> of<00:04:41.230> a<00:04:41.410> candy<00:04:41.890> flavor<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.490> it

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
really more of a candy flavor to it

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.170 
really more of a candy flavor to it
whereas<00:04:43.480> this<00:04:43.690> reminded<00:04:44.320> me<00:04:44.380> more<00:04:44.770> of<00:04:45.180> again

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
whereas this reminded me more of again

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.530 
whereas this reminded me more of again
the<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:47.050> flavor<00:04:47.350> of<00:04:47.500> lemonade<00:04:48.070> at<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.340> end

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
the the flavor of lemonade at the end

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.090 
the the flavor of lemonade at the end
again<00:04:49.540> mixed<00:04:50.080> with<00:04:50.200> cream<00:04:50.470> soda<00:04:50.800> so<00:04:50.980> it's

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
again mixed with cream soda so it's

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.800 
again mixed with cream soda so it's
almost<00:04:51.250> like<00:04:51.460> they<00:04:51.700> took<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:51.970> two<00:04:52.270> flavors<00:04:52.570> of

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
almost like they took the two flavors of

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.590 
almost like they took the two flavors of
those<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.320> mixed<00:04:53.560> them<00:04:53.710> together<00:04:53.860> so<00:04:54.700> overall

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
those and mixed them together so overall

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.960 
those and mixed them together so overall
it<00:04:56.170> wasn't<00:04:56.410> bad<00:04:56.740> tasting<00:04:57.220> just<00:04:57.430> really<00:04:57.820> not

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
it wasn't bad tasting just really not

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.630 
it wasn't bad tasting just really not
what<00:04:58.180> I<00:04:58.210> was<00:04:58.720> expecting<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.830> if<00:05:00.040> you're<00:05:00.220> if

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
what I was expecting so if you're if

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.880 
what I was expecting so if you're if
you're<00:05:00.790> buying<00:05:01.000> this<00:05:01.360> based<00:05:01.660> on<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.680> name

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
you're buying this based on the name

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.440 
you're buying this based on the name
blue<00:05:03.190> bubblegum<00:05:03.670> and<00:05:03.850> you<00:05:03.910> think<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:04.240> want

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
blue bubblegum and you think you want

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.500 
blue bubblegum and you think you want
something<00:05:04.780> sweet<00:05:05.290> and<00:05:05.740> fun<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:06.400> candy<00:05:07.300> like

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
something sweet and fun and candy like

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.390 
something sweet and fun and candy like
it's<00:05:08.170> probably<00:05:08.590> not<00:05:08.710> going<00:05:08.890> to<00:05:08.980> give<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.220> what

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
it's probably not going to give you what

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.950 
it's probably not going to give you what
you're<00:05:09.550> expecting<00:05:10.090> but<00:05:10.540> if<00:05:10.660> you're<00:05:10.810> just

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
you're expecting but if you're just

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.390 
you're expecting but if you're just
looking<00:05:11.140> for<00:05:11.470> something<00:05:11.650> with<00:05:11.890> a<00:05:11.920> little<00:05:12.160> bit

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
looking for something with a little bit

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.770 
looking for something with a little bit
different<00:05:12.430> from<00:05:12.940> what's<00:05:13.180> out<00:05:13.300> there<00:05:13.330> I<00:05:13.570> think

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
different from what's out there I think

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.780 
different from what's out there I think
this<00:05:14.050> is<00:05:14.200> definitely<00:05:14.530> different<00:05:14.860> for<00:05:15.370> most<00:05:15.550> of

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
this is definitely different for most of

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.510 
this is definitely different for most of
the<00:05:15.880> popular<00:05:16.330> sodas<00:05:16.690> out<00:05:16.840> there<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:17.590> it<00:05:18.340> could

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
the popular sodas out there so it could

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.370 
the popular sodas out there so it could
be<00:05:18.550> worth<00:05:18.790> a<00:05:18.940> try<00:05:19.210> for<00:05:20.050> that

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
be worth a try for that

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.710 
be worth a try for that
I<00:05:20.410> don't<00:05:21.010> think<00:05:21.070> overall<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:22.000> flavor<00:05:22.360> was

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
I don't think overall the flavor was

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.690 
I don't think overall the flavor was
something<00:05:23.170> that<00:05:23.380> I<00:05:23.650> was<00:05:23.860> really<00:05:24.100> terribly

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
something that I was really terribly

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.450 
something that I was really terribly
excited<00:05:25.270> about<00:05:25.510> I<00:05:25.750> might<00:05:26.590> have<00:05:27.070> one<00:05:27.280> of<00:05:27.310> these

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
excited about I might have one of these

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.310 
excited about I might have one of these
now<00:05:27.760> and<00:05:27.790> then<00:05:28.180> but<00:05:28.570> it<00:05:28.720> definitely<00:05:28.870> wouldn't

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
now and then but it definitely wouldn't

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.650 
now and then but it definitely wouldn't
be<00:05:29.410> something<00:05:29.740> that<00:05:29.890> I<00:05:29.920> regularly<00:05:30.280> buy<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.240> I

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
be something that I regularly buy and I

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.080 
be something that I regularly buy and I
don't<00:05:31.930> think<00:05:32.110> it's<00:05:32.230> a<00:05:32.470> matter<00:05:32.650> of<00:05:32.830> just<00:05:33.160> John's

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
don't think it's a matter of just John's

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.090 
don't think it's a matter of just John's
soda<00:05:34.390> brand<00:05:34.720> I<00:05:34.840> think<00:05:34.870> it's<00:05:35.170> just<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:36.070> the

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
soda brand I think it's just the the

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.430 
soda brand I think it's just the the
overall<00:05:36.820> flavor<00:05:37.120> in<00:05:37.390> general<00:05:37.810> I'm<00:05:38.080> not<00:05:38.110> sure

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
overall flavor in general I'm not sure

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.920 
overall flavor in general I'm not sure
it's<00:05:38.620> something<00:05:38.860> that<00:05:39.040> I'd<00:05:39.310> like<00:05:39.600> tell<00:05:40.600> a<00:05:40.630> lot

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
it's something that I'd like tell a lot

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.620 
it's something that I'd like tell a lot
of<00:05:41.170> really<00:05:41.530> once<00:05:41.950> in<00:05:42.100> a<00:05:42.190> while<00:05:42.370> but<00:05:42.790> not<00:05:43.390> too
