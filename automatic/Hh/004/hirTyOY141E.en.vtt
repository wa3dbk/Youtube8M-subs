keeping<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:32.820> fuller<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:34.310> great<00:01:35.310> addition

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
keeping a little fuller a great addition

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.429 
keeping a little fuller a great addition
to<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.939> meals<00:01:36.119> because<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.689> helped<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.990> lot<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
to the meals because it helped a lot the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.710 
to the meals because it helped a lot the
city<00:01:38.130> eating<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.400> same<00:01:38.549> thing<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.600> I've

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
city eating the same thing that I've

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.490 
city eating the same thing that I've
eaten<00:01:39.869> free<00:01:40.110> eaten<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.070> years<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:43.020> think

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
eaten free eaten for years so I think

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.700 
eaten free eaten for years so I think
helped<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> lot

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
helped a lot

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.700 
helped a lot
cardio<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.930> less<00:01:49.079> cardio<00:01:49.470> this

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
cardio we is a little less cardio this

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.990 
cardio we is a little less cardio this
year<00:01:51.829> probably<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.280> surprising<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
year probably little surprising but it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.209 
year probably little surprising but it
was<00:01:54.090> only<00:01:54.270> four<00:01:54.659> times<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.170> four<00:01:55.950> times<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
was only four times the four times a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.230 
was only four times the four times a
week<00:01:56.340> twenty<00:01:56.700> minutes<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> morning

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
week twenty minutes in the morning

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.069 
week twenty minutes in the morning
that's<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.460> it<00:02:00.299> wasn't<00:02:00.570> much<00:02:00.630> cardio

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
that's it and so it wasn't much cardio

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.920 
that's it and so it wasn't much cardio
in<00:02:01.460> but<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.490> believe<00:02:02.909> my<00:02:02.939> cardio<00:02:03.299> spot-on<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
in but I believe my cardio spot-on a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.200 
in but I believe my cardio spot-on a
little<00:02:04.079> better<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.409> year<00:02:04.469> even<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.060> like<00:02:06.060> to
