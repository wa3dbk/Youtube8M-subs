00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
because that's what I had on hand and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.640 
because that's what I had on hand and
you're<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.659> thread<00:01:30.960> your<00:01:30.990> needle<00:01:31.200> and

then tie a knot and how I like to tie my
knot<00:01:34.110> which<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.500> find<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> easiest<00:01:34.890> way<00:01:35.400> is

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
knot which I find the easiest way is

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.640 
knot which I find the easiest way is
wrapping<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> thread<00:01:36.720> around<00:01:37.049> your<00:01:37.380> finger

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
wrapping the thread around your finger

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.190 
wrapping the thread around your finger
twice<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.119> sliding<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> down<00:01:40.020> your

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
twice and then just sliding it down your

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.350 
twice and then just sliding it down your
finger<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:40.860> pulling<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.310> tight<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.909> it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
finger and then pulling it tight and it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.630 
finger and then pulling it tight and it
creates<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:43.500> knot<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.399> cut

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
creates a little knot and you can cut

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.389 
creates a little knot and you can cut
the<00:01:44.939> loop<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> extra<00:01:46.140> step<00:01:46.320> off<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.979> want

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the loop and the extra step off you want

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.880 
the loop and the extra step off you want
to<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.720> when<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.049> comes<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.470> actually

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
sewing the letters all you do is go up

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.910 
sewing the letters all you do is go up
through<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> back<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.299> t-shirt<00:01:54.740> pull<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
thread all the way through and then

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
thread all the way through and then
you're<00:01:58.979> going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.189> want<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.490> go<00:01:59.700> on<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> first

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
one I kind of what halfway on the M

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.130 
one I kind of what halfway on the M
you're<00:02:03.180> going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.570> go<00:02:03.630> all<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:03.990> way

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
you're going to want to go all the way

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.679 
you're going to want to go all the way
to<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.469> top<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.130> M<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.640> push<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> back

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
to the top of the M and push it back

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.510 
to the top of the M and push it back
down<00:02:06.719> through<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
down through the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.490 
down through the
Adam<00:02:07.789> of<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.000> fabric<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.690> then<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:09.289> just

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
Adam of the fabric and then you just

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.570 
Adam of the fabric and then you just
kind<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.769> keep<00:02:10.129> repeating<00:02:10.700> this<00:02:10.879> thinking<00:02:11.840> of

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
kind of keep repeating this thinking of

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.580 
kind of keep repeating this thinking of
wherever<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:13.879> push<00:02:14.750> through<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.260> back<00:02:15.560> of

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
wherever you push through the back of

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.680 
wherever you push through the back of
the<00:02:15.769> fabric<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:16.849> know<00:02:17.090> that's<00:02:17.269> where<00:02:17.540> your

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
the fabric just know that's where your

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.630 
the fabric just know that's where your
thread<00:02:17.989> is<00:02:18.170> going<00:02:18.379> to<00:02:18.440> start<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.069> then

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
thread is going to start and then

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.550 
thread is going to start and then
wherever<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.150> push<00:02:20.420> back<00:02:20.450> down<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
wherever you push back down to the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.710 
wherever you push back down to the
bottom<00:02:21.890> or<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.790> back<00:02:23.060> side<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.540> fabric

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
bottom or the back side of the fabric

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.199 
bottom or the back side of the fabric
that's<00:02:24.560> where<00:02:24.860> your<00:02:25.069> thread<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.610> going<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.030> end

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
that's where your thread is going to end

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.460 
that's where your thread is going to end
so<00:02:26.569> that's<00:02:26.750> where<00:02:26.930> you're<00:02:27.080> going<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.260> leave<00:02:27.440> a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
so that's where you're going to leave a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.550 
so that's where you're going to leave a
mark<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.400> just<00:02:28.640> keep<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:28.849> in<00:02:29.060> mind<00:02:29.500> this<00:02:30.500> is

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
mark so just keep that in mind this is

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.610 
mark so just keep that in mind this is
really<00:02:31.040> simple<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.930> just<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.379> little

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
really simple and it's just a little

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.890 
really simple and it's just a little
time<00:02:33.830> consuming<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.640> guess<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:35.120> would<00:02:35.420> say<00:02:35.450> I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
time consuming I guess I would say I

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.160 
time consuming I guess I would say I
would<00:02:36.349> also<00:02:36.709> recommend<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:38.420> if<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:38.660> was<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.989> do

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
would also recommend like if I was to do

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.960 
would also recommend like if I was to do
this<00:02:39.349> again<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.970> would<00:02:41.780> make<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.470> line<00:02:42.970> closer

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
this again I would make the line closer

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.970 
this again I would make the line closer
together<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.660> left<00:02:44.870> gaps<00:02:45.170> because<00:02:45.560> when<00:02:45.950> I

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
together I left gaps because when I

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.520 
together I left gaps because when I
first<00:02:46.400> looked<00:02:46.760> at<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.090> picture<00:02:47.510> i<00:02:47.780> thought

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
first looked at the picture i thought

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.160 
first looked at the picture i thought
that<00:02:48.739> they<00:02:48.920> were<00:02:49.099> gaps<00:02:49.459> in<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.269> writing<00:02:50.660> and

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
that they were gaps in the writing and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.080 
that they were gaps in the writing and
after<00:02:51.500> looking<00:02:51.799> at<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.190> second<00:02:52.640> time<00:02:52.670> there

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
after looking at it a second time there

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.449 
after looking at it a second time there
were<00:02:53.209> no<00:02:53.360> gaps<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:53.989> it's<00:02:54.620> all<00:02:54.799> preference<00:02:55.040> I

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
were no gaps so it's all preference I

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.970 
were no gaps so it's all preference I
think<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.849> looks<00:02:56.030> good<00:02:56.269> I<00:02:56.569> will<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.959> but<00:02:57.769> yeah<00:02:57.950> I

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980
