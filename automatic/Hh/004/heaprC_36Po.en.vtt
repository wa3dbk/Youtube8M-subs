00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
going to be about me struggling for

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.560 
going to be about me struggling for
about<00:00:07.140> an<00:00:07.410> hour<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.189> half<00:00:08.400> although<00:00:09.179> for

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
about an hour and a half although for

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.600 
about an hour and a half although for
your<00:00:09.690> guests<00:00:09.929> convenience<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.650> sped<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.250> up<00:00:11.400> as

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
your guests convenience I sped it up as

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.450 
your guests convenience I sped it up as
much<00:00:11.670> as<00:00:11.940> Sony<00:00:12.300> Vegas<00:00:12.570> allows<00:00:13.080> me<00:00:13.410> which<00:00:14.160> was

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
much as Sony Vegas allows me which was

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.630 
much as Sony Vegas allows me which was
about<00:00:15.059> an<00:00:15.240> hour-and-a-half<00:00:16.310> condensed<00:00:17.310> to

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
about an hour-and-a-half condensed to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.000 
about an hour-and-a-half condensed to
about<00:00:17.880> eight<00:00:18.119> minutes<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:19.109> that's<00:00:19.560> quite<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
about eight minutes so that's quite a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.519 
about eight minutes so that's quite a
big<00:00:20.400> difference<00:00:20.820> if<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.029> ask<00:00:21.119> me<00:00:21.410> any<00:00:22.410> more

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
big difference if you ask me any more

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.189 
big difference if you ask me any more
than<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.420> footage<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.960> just

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
than that and just the footage is just

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.670 
than that and just the footage is just
none<00:00:26.240> just<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.539> can't<00:00:27.779> be<00:00:27.900> viewed<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.349> pretty

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
none just it can't be viewed it's pretty

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.500 
none just it can't be viewed it's pretty
much<00:00:28.740> garbage<00:00:29.039> if<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.400> goes<00:00:29.730> past<00:00:29.760> what<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.269> did

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
much garbage if it goes past what I did

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.209 
much garbage if it goes past what I did
right<00:00:30.630> now<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.050> max<00:00:31.859> out<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.099> velocity

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
right now I max out the velocity

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.569 
right now I max out the velocity
settings<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.059> i<00:00:33.090> maxed<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:34.340> much<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:35.520> i

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
settings that i maxed out as much as i

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.260 
settings that i maxed out as much as i
could<00:00:35.640> basically<00:00:36.270> scrunch<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:38.270> this

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
could basically scrunch it up so this

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.000 
could basically scrunch it up so this
took<00:00:39.450> me<00:00:39.510> about<00:00:39.809> an<00:00:40.020> hour<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> half<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.890> you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
took me about an hour and a half if you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.500 
took me about an hour and a half if you
join<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> stream<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.850> were<00:00:41.940> watching<00:00:42.360> you

lot<00:00:46.610> it's<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:47.730> too<00:00:47.969> fun<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.329> fall<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.079> not

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
lot it's not too fun to fall it's not

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.680 
lot it's not too fun to fall it's not
too<00:00:49.320> fun<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:50.090> continuously<00:00:51.090> redo<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> same

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
too fun to continuously redo the same

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.200 
too fun to continuously redo the same
thing<00:00:51.870> again<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.199> i<00:00:52.320> tried<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:52.739> much<00:00:52.770> as<00:00:52.980> i<00:00:53.039> can

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
thing again but i tried as much as i can

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
thing again but i tried as much as i can
so<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:55.050> some<00:00:55.260> reason<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.649> seems<00:00:56.219> very

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
so for some reason this seems very

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.090 
so for some reason this seems very
familiar<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.210> me<00:00:57.300> i<00:00:57.329> believe<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.840> map<00:00:58.500> was

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
familiar to me i believe this map was

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.729 
familiar to me i believe this map was
actually<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.730> old<00:00:59.910> GM<00:01:00.300> events<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.410> it
