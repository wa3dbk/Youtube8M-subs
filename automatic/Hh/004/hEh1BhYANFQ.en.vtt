00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:02.610
 Heidrich our one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.299
 Brandenburg against it only with a real Blüthmann to it 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.490
 Midfielder Schulz game conceptions were already in the exhibition 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.609
 clearly the first chance 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.609
 with branch manager 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.359
 from Center Torkamera 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.140
 nice side-puller from 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.759
 Janotta 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.759
 the table-fourth Chemnitz against the 5th 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.150
 and a shot of Heidrich 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 and Chemnitz continues league Heidrich 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.050
 that pleases for that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.000
 at the Canucks at today not there Köhler Vania fourth yellow and doldrums 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.580
 Live yesterday with a pancreatic and ins 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.140
 Hospital was delivered for it on the field Seyfert 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.200
 and Melun 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.680
 and Heidrich who is about the research Qualys directs the next 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.440
 Attack an overflowing 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.440
 not deliver nice pass on wide receiver 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.500
 a working room 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.930
 the whole from the perspective of the other gate camera 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.690
 Also there you can see the nice action of Heidrich 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.930
 the first quarter of an hour was very neat 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.890
 but then 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.590
 but then 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.570
 Hairy midfield Gebolze 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.570
 deny the actions of both teams 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.680
 even a head injury by Jörg Blüthmann after about four 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.440
 Minutes interruption but can continue playing 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.960
 this may already see a taste 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.290
 also the gambling 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.290
 expulsion 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.540
 nothing for a long time 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.540
 in the 35 food 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 but it wanted to be the Chemnitz 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.650
 the Brandenburgers would be happy with a single dot here 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.960
 and spoke up again in the 36 minutes with an attack 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.040
 Janotta 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.069
 and show acts directly 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.469
 he could have been 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.519
 Owner Holger Gliewe 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.399
 to the spot 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.649
 Schulz at home also for the first Brandenburg Gate well it can not 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:18.909
 take 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.059
 Zero to zero 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.029
 The whole was once from the Torkamera 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:27.249
 the Brandenburger defensive concept is an optimal one to hold out 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.719
 we have to lay it down so we have to go through stupid clothes a few times 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.519
 in front of 5818 spectators 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.919
 stayed now and politically in the second half at Brandenburg 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.549
 expected on t 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.549
 and Chemnitz announces itself with a free kick to the 3 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.239
 more space 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.879
 Often, film does not lack much 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.999
 or room would have come 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:54.249
 to doubt 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:58.219
 then Hans Maier Brink reacts his job gave Harald Kramer 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.489
 They should have arrived at the beginning of the year from Sturm Graz 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.640
 and the man has a contract for the first Bundesliga to 2 90 million 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:11.399
 he steers the ball over the crossbar 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.759
 brought the sixth corner for Chemnitz of more reward 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.609
 more information can 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.419
 Hail to the finish 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:25.829
 for the guest 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.879
 The Brandenburg defense probably waited on the Chemnitz Junkers 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.189
 Harald Kramer 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.139
 and Heidrich took a break to his fifth break 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.139
 the season 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.519
 Of course, the mood among the more than 5,000 spectators is justified 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.499
 even in weak phases of Chemnitz they tried to furniture and 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.949
 who reacted again he did not want to lose here in any case 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.159
 bring now 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.770
 Thal and Plate ste 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.709
 for BYD Main 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:54.939
 and referee 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.650
 but the Brandenburg now get problems from their defensive concept 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.369
 Break out 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:02.110
 the lotter with a wide pass 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.810
 but these are then intercepted again and Crema leads the attack 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.810
 the Chemnitz one 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.519
 Fist defense of Zimmer Hayek 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.240
 and again 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.349
 the last 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.349
 on the goal line 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.280
 Everybody knows about Rico Steinmann is not at his best today 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:34.870
 of humility my critic 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.069
 and the Silvie users went out very well 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.139
 User playmaker 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.800
 but a foul on Kramer 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.020
 again Chemnitzer free kick and more reward we already know 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.219
 and room also first was on the winning course 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:53.319
 If the chance of a chance can not be of any use, the Wars can be used from another 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.559
 perspective 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:58.800
 so that should 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.719
 and the Chemnitz in the threesome after five minutes 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:03.559
 it stays with the end 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:07.529
 highly deserved one to zero the Chemnitz the Brandenburg acts 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.529
 certainly not enough for the offensive 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.779
 in the second half without goal and what is worse 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.879
 Kai Heller Heinzlmaier today the 1045 Sweetheart 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.949
 in Chemnitz as coach in office 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:29.779
 no one else
