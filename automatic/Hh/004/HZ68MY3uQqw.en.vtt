love story perfume which I doing that it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.700 
love story perfume which I doing that it
does<00:01:33.030> go<00:01:33.210> with<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.540> theme<00:01:33.570> which<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:33.990> nice<00:01:34.380> but

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
does go with the theme which is nice but

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.499 
does go with the theme which is nice but
I<00:01:34.770> don't<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.340> incra<00:01:35.700> fume<00:01:35.909> samples<00:01:36.299> and

boxes<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.229> think<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:38.220> kind<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> waste

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
because I feel like perfume samples are

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.249 
because I feel like perfume samples are
free<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.390> shouldn't<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:42.720> them<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.049> box

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
free and I shouldn't get them in a box

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.929 
free and I shouldn't get them in a box
