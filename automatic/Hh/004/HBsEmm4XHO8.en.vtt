00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.939
 hi how about how are you all as a result of 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.680
 that the news was known that the king of 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.380
 Spain went to hunt elephants to 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.540
 botswana I have read many comments 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.089
 here on youtube that the Spanish 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.150
 we are torturers and murderers of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.160
 animals and the truth that you can 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.380
 wait to be told if it is treated as 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.140
 you are and you take off people who 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.410
 kills the bulls in a macabre way 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.570
 in the squares not only that but in 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.640
 every city ​​you can find stores 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.410
 mink fur coats or 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.079
 practically hunting is allowed 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.420
 sports almost anywhere in 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.760
 spain look that here on youtube I have 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.679
 He called everything but there was a boy 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.629
 Bolivia that called me a torturer and 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.870
 animal killer just for the simple 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.420
 fact of being Spanish and it makes me funny 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 because for example the bread when it is put 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.440
 hard trophy and I feed the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.719
 fabio trans pigeons are you or could a 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.960
 park where there are swans geese and everything 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.210
 type of anatidae or climb the mountain to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.470
 give it to cows or horses that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.600
 find me 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.790
 for example if between a fly a 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.390
 butterfly at home instead of running 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.910
 to the insecticide to kill them 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.940
 I take it and he freed them so they have another 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.430
 opportunity to live I'm also a partner 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.010
 of the fapas that means fund for the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.990
 protection of wild animals teneis 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.050
 a link to your flight in the definition 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.510
 in case you're interested in what they do 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.460
 they try to preserve what people like 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.330
 King of Spain has been trying to destroy 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.700
 throughout his life and finally in 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.920
 every city and town of Spain every time 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.190
 that there is a bullfight or something worse 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.260
 or fur coat tents open 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.600
 there are many people demonstrating for 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.090
 defend the rights of animals and 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.520
 raise awareness but going back to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.229
 main theme you believe the apologies 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.480
 of the King of Spain for going hunting 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.060
 elephants I do not 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.250
 the king has some image consultants that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.560
 they have told him to apologize for 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.500
 try to hide the decomposition that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.540
 lives the corrupt royal family if the king 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.150
 Don Juan Carlos does not get to break the 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.780
 hip nobody would have known anything 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.150
 and the king would not have apologized to 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.460
 nobody leaving aside the money that 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.490
 It cost the hunt in Africa to me what 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.500
 it really offends me of the king who is the 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.560
 highest state authority and in 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.900
 theory the example to follow is that it commands 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.400
 animals for pleasure and he does not care 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.680
 these are in danger of extinction 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.300
 because while he went to hunt elephants 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.370
 he also went years ago to hunt bears 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.710
 apart from knowing all the preserves 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.810
 hunting in Spain hopefully some 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.760
 politician someday have two fingers of 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.590
 front and call a referendum to 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.100
 choose if the Spanish people want 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.380
 monarchy or not 12 million euros to 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.020
 year costs us all Spaniards 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.170
 keep this family of vividores and 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.670
 corrupt people who have no absolute respect 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.380
 for life and the plan 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.690
 In which we live 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.050
 good without more thanks for coming up 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.260
 here and see you in the next video 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.260
