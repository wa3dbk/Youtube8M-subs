00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:09.250
 and what I believe is the following 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:12.580
 is this control that apparently is a 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.830
 normal control a color difference 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.510
 but these are the controls they want from 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.740
 them that are the firing controls 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:23.760
 fast then what happens about these 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.840
 controls obviously 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.770
 they have the particularity that they are 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.850
 internally modified have a 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.470
 Special plague which makes some 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.250
 dispares for example I do not know with the mode 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.250
 in war 3 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.910
 the guns shoot them much faster 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.150
 a charger or so there is a charger 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.320
 normal of any weapon who 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.320
 like an assault rifle 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:56.070
 normal it takes about three seconds in 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.879
 shoot from all the charger home to 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.600
 elaborate a second and a half already and good 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.159
 in their moment they happen to occupy 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.470
 it lights up by pressing on the lt and the 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.140
 search button 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.900
 there turn on the fourth player that wants 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.400
 say that the shooting mode control 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.970
 fast is already activated and it is switched off 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.340
 same way as we change in a good way 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.370
 first obviously we light the way that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.920
 we want it is already on and with the button 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.290
 search 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.479
 I'm changing the modes for example 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.900
 that first mode is for the high for the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.590
 halo 3 to the rays can now play the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.320
 last heat the master in saved in the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.260
 butterfield 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.630
 the loja loja logo of games that come 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.260
 quickly to memory already then well 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.270
 we are changing 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.970
 so 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.640
 There are 12 modes 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.530
 I would do it again the truth that they are 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.570
 13 because the last mode is re 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.340
 programmable already then when this 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.580
 turn off the control is in the last 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.910
 so what 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.640
 who were occupying 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.450
 So what happened when I turned off the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.650
 console 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.650
 I'm going to pay for mine 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.870
 so they can see how they want 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.030
 remains on the fourth player and 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.310
 than to remind you that the mode 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.569
 that they occupied but I what I do for 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.970
 who does not want to perform in the week is 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.740
 they give for battery and pulled out the thorn 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.120
 no more 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.430
 and ready 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.370
 and I play again to put the way that 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.319
 I eat more, it suits me 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.599
 one at first it cost me 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.549
 get used to it a bit because in terms of 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.959
 the games and the modes but as the 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.900
 truth that I am more fanatic of the way in 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.489
 ward I'm used to millÃ¡s 10 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.239
 months memory the ways that I need 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.739
 so good that's all 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.579
 practically so that they can see it 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.579
 how it is used and 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.030
 of a quick shot and to see that 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.830
 exactly the same only when 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.280
 which is modified and therefore does not come 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.680
 in the original package but it's in 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.720
 perfect state I what you see 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.050
 I have tried all my products are 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.330
 they are tested and anything 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.890
 they have a guarantee so well 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.140
 boy I hope you liked this 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.720

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.600
