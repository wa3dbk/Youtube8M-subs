00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
that if she Oh clamor so it was really a

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.460 
that if she Oh clamor so it was really a
surprise<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:29.210> then<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.720> phenomenon<00:01:30.290> it

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
surprise and then the phenomenon it

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.620 
surprise and then the phenomenon it

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
think it's really good I think that

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.830 
think it's really good I think that
women<00:01:34.640> have<00:01:35.060> been<00:01:35.150> wanting<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.540> see<00:01:35.690> these

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
they went crazy and I think that should

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.540 
they went crazy and I think that should
show<00:01:39.740> magazine<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:41.890> designers<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:43.130> people

was<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:45.710> close<00:01:45.980> I<00:01:46.250> think<00:01:46.700> that<00:01:46.820> always<00:01:47.000> will<00:01:47.270> be

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
was so close I think that always will be

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.240 
was so close I think that always will be
a<00:01:47.390> place<00:01:47.630> for<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.170> skinny<00:01:48.410> girls<00:01:48.590> also<00:01:48.920> in<00:01:49.160> the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.590 
a place for the skinny girls also in the

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
industry but i think that there's time

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.060 
industry but i think that there's time
that<00:01:50.810> there<00:01:50.930> should<00:01:51.080> be<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.230> place<00:01:51.440> also<00:01:51.680> for

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
that there should be a place also for

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:35.260 
that there should be a place also for
the<00:01:52.160> curvy<00:01:52.430> women<00:01:52.550> as<00:01:52.820> well
