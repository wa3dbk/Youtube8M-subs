00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.490
 nba generation we continue to close 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.830
 the promises of our basketball today you 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.370
 We present a Cordovan of 21 years old 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.720
 it has a huge future 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.550
 MatÃ­as Bortolin and keeps his vision 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.530
 I even know very young very 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.280
 Skinny but has some conditions 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.800
 very young innate marked superlative 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.360
 difference with the rest he had his 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.850
 category and the most category wins and you 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.789
 there were girls I did not know him 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.309
 I thought it was 20 years ago I heard that 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.230
 came from the second league of italy that 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.420
 had played in nothing austria that did not 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.789
 had played in league I said this is going to 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.329
 come and go to eat bench like crazy 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.730
 nevertheless in the same tuning that 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.180
 bruce and they're not practically playing 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:57.570
 as Greater Antilles has a talent 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.700
 huge because they are four of two 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.320
 seven meters that have potential for 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.670
 play both back and front 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.379
 because he has a lot of game knowledge 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.480
 passes well the ball takes good reading 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.460
 can well jump them down can play 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.670
 with another big player who is playing 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.520
 deep but still does not have that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.530
 natural or polished ability to open up to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.500
 pull naturally but it 's something that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.220
 it improves the shot is a foundation that 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.250
 it can be improved with a lot of time 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.369
 it would be good to stand out in the league 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.170
 Argentina will win a definitive place and 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.210
 permanent between the two in the selection 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.950
 go play europe and a tooth 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.810
 then it would be nice if it could be 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.940
 in the next draft is to play the league 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.220
 there can be many doors in can 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.620
 show enough we have nothing to 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.930
 the selection and apart from there 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.390
 for the whole world he can have a 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.150
 place on a computer that has a second 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.950
 round 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.240
 for next year that the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.290
 eyes on rumors that were looking for videos 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.290
 I asked a lot for myself 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.360
 has talent has touch to define 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.599
 with both hands differently 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.200
 this or point is the size you have to 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.230
 improve your physique is missing a lot is the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.379
 physical 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.209
 to be able to learn how to make a 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.860
 special work working with 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.159
 nutritionists with a physical program 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.810
 specific with him so I think if 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.950
 continue with habits with their habits that 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.940
 is having now is going to be 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.900
 physically ready you have to load the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.590
 kilo but 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.030
 when judy meana in usa things like 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.840
 makes you train but will not have 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.370
 problems 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.200
 physically it is a game that is 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.000
 evolving a lot and has a 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.939
 knowledge of the game that in which 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.900
 I think the black one is appreciated every time 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:58.680
 more generates a little emotion and fear 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.720
 for knowing that I will be there and I can 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.930
 get to be with so many monsters the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:09.769
 sport and regenerate much better 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.769
 Although fear motivates you to prepare
