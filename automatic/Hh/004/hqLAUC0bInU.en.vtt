00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.400 

okay<00:00:02.820> I'm<00:00:03.000> going<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.330> go<00:00:03.449> over<00:00:03.480> how<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.049> set<00:00:04.350> up

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
okay I'm going to go over how to set up

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.730 
okay I'm going to go over how to set up
and<00:00:04.799> tune<00:00:05.460> your<00:00:05.640> Sidewinder<00:00:06.270> machine<00:00:06.740> first

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
and tune your Sidewinder machine first

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.520 
and tune your Sidewinder machine first
off<00:00:09.950> with<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> needle<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.809> like<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.929> put<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.320> little

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
off with a needle I like to put a little

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.310 
off with a needle I like to put a little
gradual<00:00:14.070> bend<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.880> I've<00:00:15.389> always<00:00:15.929> done<00:00:16.139> that

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
gradual bend in it I've always done that

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.960 
gradual bend in it I've always done that
so<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> set<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.890> up<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.070> where<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.760> should

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
so I set it up so where that it should

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.050 
so I set it up so where that it should
be<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.210> Center<00:00:18.770> once<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.859> put<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> gentle<00:00:20.580> Bend

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
be on Center once you put a gentle Bend

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.849 
be on Center once you put a gentle Bend
throughout<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.570> needle<00:00:21.869> especially<00:00:22.680> right

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
throughout the needle especially right

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:32.670 
throughout the needle especially right
at<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.980> very<00:00:23.010> tip<00:00:23.400> there<00:00:24.980> okay

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.330 

I<00:00:33.780> use<00:00:34.780> two<00:00:35.050> rubber<00:00:35.260> bands<00:00:37.740> and<00:00:38.740> you<00:00:38.890> connect<00:00:39.280> I

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
I use two rubber bands and you connect I

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.800 
I use two rubber bands and you connect I
like<00:00:39.490> the<00:00:39.610> black<00:00:39.820> rubber<00:00:40.030> bands<00:00:40.270> I<00:00:40.510> seem<00:00:40.720> to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
like the black rubber bands I seem to

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.810 
like the black rubber bands I seem to
have<00:00:40.930> a<00:00:40.960> lot<00:00:41.140> of<00:00:41.410> pretty<00:00:42.310> good<00:00:42.489> amount<00:00:42.700> of

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
have a lot of pretty good amount of

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.880 
have a lot of pretty good amount of
tension<00:00:43.030> on<00:00:43.210> them<00:00:43.390> I<00:00:43.570> put<00:00:44.200> it<00:00:44.290> on<00:00:44.410> in<00:00:44.560> this<00:00:44.680> back

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
tension on them I put it on in this back

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.200 
tension on them I put it on in this back
screw<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.050> front<00:00:47.290> screen<00:00:47.970> okay

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
screw to the front screen okay

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.170 
screw to the front screen okay
now<00:00:52.200> sometimes<00:00:53.489> after<00:00:54.489> a<00:00:54.520> month<00:00:54.879> or<00:00:55.000> so<00:00:55.150> of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
now sometimes after a month or so of

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.810 
now sometimes after a month or so of
using<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.110> machine<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.980> stroke<00:00:57.309> length<00:00:57.580> will

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
using the machine the stroke length will

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.729 
using the machine the stroke length will
grow<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.030> little<00:00:58.270> bit<00:00:58.410> ideally<00:00:59.410> it<00:00:59.500> should<00:00:59.530> be

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
grow a little bit ideally it should be

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.890 
grow a little bit ideally it should be
at<00:00:59.860> about<00:01:00.070> three<00:01:00.309> point<00:01:00.580> five<00:01:00.790> three<00:01:01.570> point

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
at about three point five three point

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.880 
at about three point five three point
two<00:01:02.050> millimeters<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:05.440> way<00:01:05.560> you<00:01:05.619> check

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
two millimeters in the way you check

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.580 
two millimeters in the way you check
that<00:01:05.950> is<00:01:06.399> set<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.970> needle<00:01:07.240> flush<00:01:08.080> in<00:01:08.259> the<00:01:08.380> tube

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
that is set the needle flush in the tube

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.480 
that is set the needle flush in the tube
tip<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.390> extend<00:01:10.390> it<00:01:10.479> out<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.930> use<00:01:11.350> calipers<00:01:12.040> but

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
tip and extend it out I use calipers but

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.590 
tip and extend it out I use calipers but
you<00:01:12.610> can<00:01:12.759> use<00:01:12.910> a<00:01:12.940> metric<00:01:13.390> ruler<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:14.200> measure

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you can use a metric ruler and measure

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.139 
you can use a metric ruler and measure
this<00:01:16.600> one<00:01:16.869> is<00:01:17.140> right<00:01:18.130> at<00:01:18.340> three<00:01:18.640> point<00:01:18.910> two

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
this one is right at three point two

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.999 
this one is right at three point two
millimeters<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:22.320> they<00:01:23.320> varies<00:01:23.649> like<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:23.979> a

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
millimeters and they varies like that a

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.920 
millimeters and they varies like that a
sweet<00:01:24.250> spot<00:01:24.520> with<00:01:24.670> each<00:01:24.820> machine<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.780> it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
sweet spot with each machine and it

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.740 
sweet spot with each machine and it
varies<00:01:26.229> depending<00:01:26.920> on<00:01:27.490> on<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.030> timing<00:01:28.300> inside

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
varies depending on on the timing inside

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.020 
varies depending on on the timing inside
it<00:01:29.340> okay<00:01:30.720> if<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:31.810> want<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.020> change<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.440> stroke

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
it okay if you want to change the stroke

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.469 
it okay if you want to change the stroke
let's<00:01:34.030> just<00:01:34.210> first<00:01:34.570> let's<00:01:35.100> set<00:01:36.100> this<00:01:36.220> up<00:01:36.430> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.039 

always<00:01:40.479> want<00:01:40.690> to<00:01:40.720> put<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.960> red<00:01:41.200> down<00:01:43.049> you

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
always want to put the red down you

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.660 
always want to put the red down you
pretty<00:01:44.320> get<00:01:44.500> away<00:01:44.710> it<00:01:44.890> will<00:01:45.040> tip<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.369> little<00:01:45.490> bit

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
pretty get away it will tip a little bit

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.460 
pretty get away it will tip a little bit
softer<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:48.400> like<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.510> tune<00:01:49.750> these<00:01:49.960> at<00:01:50.229> about

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
softer I like to tune these at about

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.969 
softer I like to tune these at about
five<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.010> a<00:01:51.040> half<00:01:51.100> fold<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:53.500> now<00:01:53.650> it's<00:01:53.860> at

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
five and a half fold right now it's at

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.260 
five and a half fold right now it's at
five<00:01:54.189> and<00:01:54.369> half<00:01:54.460> volts<00:01:54.790> and<00:01:54.909> have<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.030> little

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
five and half volts and have a little

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.440 
five and half volts and have a little
bit<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.420> snap<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.869> it<00:01:56.939> before<00:01:57.939> I<00:01:58.119> go<00:01:58.270> over<00:01:58.330> the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
bit of snap to it before I go over the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.429 
bit of snap to it before I go over the
stroke<00:01:58.750> link<00:01:58.990> this<00:01:59.680> back<00:01:59.740> screw<00:02:00.369> right<00:02:00.580> here

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
stroke link this back screw right here

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.830 
stroke link this back screw right here
controls<00:02:02.439> the<00:02:02.650> spring<00:02:02.950> tension<00:02:03.420> as<00:02:04.420> well<00:02:04.630> set

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
controls the spring tension as well set

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.270 
controls the spring tension as well set
screw<00:02:05.020> on<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.200> side<00:02:05.439> that<00:02:05.470> I'll<00:02:05.979> loosen

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
screw on the side that I'll loosen

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.570 
screw on the side that I'll loosen
before<00:02:06.640> I<00:02:06.670> start<00:02:06.880> messing<00:02:07.180> with<00:02:07.270> it

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.570 

see<00:02:11.180> turn<00:02:11.990> in<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.410> gets<00:02:12.920> quieter

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
see turn in it gets quieter

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.940 
see turn in it gets quieter
so<00:02:13.790> it's<00:02:13.880> hitting<00:02:14.060> softer<00:02:14.660> right<00:02:14.840> there<00:02:15.080> back

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
so it's hitting softer right there back

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.230 
so it's hitting softer right there back
it<00:02:16.100> out<00:02:16.210> starts<00:02:17.210> hitting<00:02:17.420> harder<00:02:22.090> I'm<00:02:23.090> going

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
it out starts hitting harder I'm going

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.880 
it out starts hitting harder I'm going
to<00:02:23.300> turn<00:02:23.450> down<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.840> show<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.020> maybe<00:02:24.680> this

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
to turn down and show you maybe this

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.760 
to turn down and show you maybe this
will<00:02:25.010> do<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:26.660> little<00:02:26.870> spring<00:02:27.170> tensions<00:02:27.560> are

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
will do it to little spring tensions are

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.330 
will do it to little spring tensions are
telling<00:02:28.070> me<00:02:28.130> really<00:02:28.310> choppy<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.800> turn<00:02:31.070> it<00:02:31.160> in

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
telling me really choppy and turn it in

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.910 
telling me really choppy and turn it in
sounds<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.390> lot<00:02:32.510> smoother<00:02:32.930> something<00:02:33.740> else

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
sounds a lot smoother something else

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.920 
sounds a lot smoother something else
I'll<00:02:34.100> make<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.430> sound<00:02:34.580> choppy<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:35.840> the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
I'll make it sound choppy is that the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.880 
I'll make it sound choppy is that the
stroke<00:02:36.170> link<00:02:36.470> gets<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.950> own<00:02:37.130> which<00:02:37.580> oh<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:38.890> just

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
stroke link gets to own which oh I just

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.410 
stroke link gets to own which oh I just
lengthen<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.520> stroke<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.030> now<00:02:41.270> it's

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
lengthen the stroke and now it's

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.140 
lengthen the stroke and now it's
challenge<00:02:41.660> or<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.870> stopping<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.700> it's

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
challenge or you stopping and it's

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.720 
challenge or you stopping and it's
really<00:02:44.450> loud<00:02:44.570> a<00:02:47.710> good<00:02:48.710> long<00:02:48.920> stroke<00:02:49.310> link

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
really loud a good long stroke link

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.240 
really loud a good long stroke link
I<00:02:49.760> mean<00:02:50.210> if<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.840> are<00:02:51.380> using<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.800> from<00:02:52.010> putting

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
I mean if you are using it from putting

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.490 
I mean if you are using it from putting
14<00:02:53.150> whiners<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.810> whatnot

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
14 whiners and whatnot

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.390 
14 whiners and whatnot
it's<00:02:54.950> getting<00:02:55.160> pretty<00:02:55.190> good<00:02:55.610> but<00:02:56.450> still<00:02:56.570> it's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
it's getting pretty good but still it's

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:08.260 
it's getting pretty good but still it's
getting<00:02:58.400> pretty<00:02:58.550> hard<00:02:58.820> right

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.560 

so<00:03:09.270> sit<00:03:09.930> down<00:03:10.490> in<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.610> lower<00:03:11.790> pulse<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.330> five

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
so sit down in the lower pulse like five

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.960 
so sit down in the lower pulse like five
and<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.780> half<00:03:12.960> volts<00:03:13.170> or<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:13.580> is<00:03:14.580> where<00:03:14.850> it's

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
and a half volts or so is where it's

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.580 
and a half volts or so is where it's
going<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.150> be<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.300> little<00:03:15.540> easier<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.230> tune<00:03:16.470> it

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
going to be a little easier to tune it

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.030 
going to be a little easier to tune it
and<00:03:16.740> felt<00:03:17.070> what's<00:03:17.190> going<00:03:17.460> on<00:03:18.740> now<00:03:19.740> as<00:03:19.890> the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
and felt what's going on now as the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.290 
and felt what's going on now as the
stroke<00:03:20.250> length<00:03:20.460> is<00:03:20.580> too<00:03:20.820> short<00:03:21.090> show<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:23.300> no

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
stroke length is too short show you no

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.110 
stroke length is too short show you no
sound<00:03:24.570> both<00:03:24.660> stuttery<00:03:25.580> now<00:03:26.580> if<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.850> want<00:03:27.060> to

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
sound both stuttery now if you want to

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.590 
sound both stuttery now if you want to
always<00:03:27.300> sort<00:03:27.540> stroke<00:03:27.930> link<00:03:29.090> all<00:03:30.090> we<00:03:30.360> have<00:03:30.480> to

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
always sort stroke link all we have to

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.160 
always sort stroke link all we have to
do<00:03:31.520> counteract<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:33.420> release<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.930> spring

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
do counteract that is release the spring

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.440 
do counteract that is release the spring
tension<00:03:34.350> on<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.650> back<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.000> can<00:03:36.060> bring<00:03:36.330> it

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
tension on the back and you can bring it

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.570 
tension on the back and you can bring it
back<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.020> have<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.230> short<00:03:37.590> stroke

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
back and you can have a short stroke

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.720 
back and you can have a short stroke
soft<00:03:39.030> hitting<00:03:39.360> machine<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:41.100> that's<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.430> little

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
soft hitting machine and that's a little

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.370 
soft hitting machine and that's a little
harder<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:43.070> little<00:03:44.070> harder<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.989> found<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.200> for

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
harder a little harder I found that for

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.100 
harder a little harder I found that for
shading<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:47.160> kind<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.820> like<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.030> short<00:03:48.480> stroke<00:03:48.840> it

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
shading I kind of like a short stroke it

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.910 
shading I kind of like a short stroke it
hits<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.410> little<00:03:49.650> hard<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:54.230> usually<00:03:55.230> do<00:03:55.709> them<00:03:55.860> a

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
hits a little hard I usually do them a

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.500 
hits a little hard I usually do them a
little<00:03:56.040> different<00:03:56.580> but<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:56.970> mean<00:03:57.120> they<00:03:57.239> can<00:03:57.390> be

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
little different but I mean they can be

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.930 
little different but I mean they can be
tuned<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.930> do<00:03:58.170> that

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
tuned to do that

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.340 
tuned to do that
now<00:04:01.940> if<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.150> bearing<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.570> word<00:04:03.720> goes<00:04:03.840> bad<00:04:04.080> or

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
now if the bearing that word goes bad or

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.410 
now if the bearing that word goes bad or
if<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.560> start<00:04:04.739> like<00:04:05.160> smelling<00:04:05.520> a<00:04:05.670> smoky<00:04:06.090> scent

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
if you start like smelling a smoky scent

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.140 
if you start like smelling a smoky scent
smell<00:04:07.170> coming<00:04:07.560> out<00:04:07.800> from<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.070> machine<00:04:08.400> more

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
smell coming out from the machine more

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.500 
smell coming out from the machine more
than<00:04:09.300> likely<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.989> bearing<00:04:10.320> got<00:04:10.500> smoked<00:04:11.510> I've

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
than likely the bearing got smoked I've

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.229 
than likely the bearing got smoked I've
fixed<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:13.110> issue<00:04:13.410> just<00:04:14.100> recently<00:04:14.580> with<00:04:15.209> a

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
fixed this issue just recently with a

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.729 
fixed this issue just recently with a
different<00:04:15.600> lubrication<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.380> bearings

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
different lubrication and the bearings

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.870 
different lubrication and the bearings
that<00:04:17.220> doesn't<00:04:17.549> gravitate<00:04:18.030> out<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.419> dry<00:04:18.660> up

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
that doesn't gravitate out and dry up

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.090 
that doesn't gravitate out and dry up
but<00:04:20.880> basically<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.660> take<00:04:22.410> off<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.770> motor<00:04:23.010> and

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
but basically to take off the motor and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.030 
but basically to take off the motor and
the<00:04:23.400> chin<00:04:23.700> to<00:04:23.910> check<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.600> bearing<00:04:24.810> you<00:04:25.680> loosen

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
the chin to check the bearing you loosen

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.740 
the chin to check the bearing you loosen
up<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:26.250> little<00:04:26.520> screw<00:04:26.729> here<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.510> holds<00:04:27.720> the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
up this little screw here that holds the

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.190 
up this little screw here that holds the
front<00:04:27.990> rubber<00:04:28.140> band<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:30.630> out<00:04:30.780> comes<00:04:31.020> the

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
front rubber band and out comes the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.520 
front rubber band and out comes the
motor<00:04:31.820> kick<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.940> bearing<00:04:33.270> off<00:04:33.450> just<00:04:34.350> like

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
motor kick the bearing off just like

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.680 
motor kick the bearing off just like
that<00:04:35.690> now<00:04:37.580> if<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.640> catch<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.150> before<00:04:39.360> it's

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
that now if you catch it before it's

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.219 
that now if you catch it before it's
premature

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
premature

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.780 
premature
you<00:04:40.680> can<00:04:40.800> always<00:04:40.979> clean<00:04:41.190> out<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.490> bearing

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
you can always clean out the bearing

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.250 
you can always clean out the bearing
with<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:41.970> carburetor<00:04:42.690> cleaner<00:04:42.930> or<00:04:43.200> something

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
with a carburetor cleaner or something

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.380 
with a carburetor cleaner or something
and<00:04:43.770> then<00:04:44.070> we<00:04:44.190> leave<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.520> with<00:04:44.669> try<00:04:44.940> flow<00:04:45.210> or

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
and then we leave it with try flow or

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.360 
and then we leave it with try flow or
super<00:04:45.720> lubra<00:04:46.110> or<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.430> silicone<00:04:47.430> living<00:04:47.940> panel

super lubra or a silicone living panel
now<00:04:50.370> when<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.669> put<00:04:50.820> it<00:04:50.910> back<00:04:51.030> in<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:52.260> can<00:04:52.380> see

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
now when you put it back in you can see

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.540 
now when you put it back in you can see
the<00:04:52.680> cam<00:04:53.750> how<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:55.140> lobe<00:04:55.380> is<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:56.280> want<00:04:56.460> it

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
the cam how the lobe is you want it
