some<00:00:55.020> more<00:00:55.320> fencing<00:00:55.770> up

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.980 

ouch

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.040 

you<00:01:17.990> can<00:01:18.140> see<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:19.180> size<00:01:20.180> of<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.450> thorns<00:01:20.840> on

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:50.870 

next<00:01:28.370> to<00:01:28.460> my<00:01:28.610> phone

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.030 

so<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:52.000> can<00:01:52.150> see<00:01:52.299> here<00:01:52.570> it's<00:01:52.689> just<00:01:52.930> packed

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.740 

which<00:01:57.040> is<00:01:57.190> surprising<00:01:57.729> because<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:57.970> can't

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
which is surprising because you can't

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.789 
which is surprising because you can't
see<00:01:58.930> them<00:01:59.049> when<00:01:59.170> they're<00:01:59.290> green<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.530> didn't

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
see them when they're green I didn't

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.920 
see them when they're green I didn't
think<00:01:59.950> there<00:02:00.040> were<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.549> many<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.780> now

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
think there were this many but now

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.380 
think there were this many but now
they're<00:02:02.110> all<00:02:02.229> turning<00:02:02.880> they<00:02:03.880> really<00:02:04.149> stand

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
they're all turning they really stand

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:35.540 
they're all turning they really stand
out

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.720 

they<00:02:36.550> are<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.760> little<00:02:37.060> work<00:02:37.240> as<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:38.730> remnants

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
they are a little work as the remnants

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.640 
they are a little work as the remnants
of<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.000> flower<00:02:40.270> stays<00:02:40.990> on<00:02:41.170> them<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.620> have

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
of the flower stays on them so you have

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.290 
of the flower stays on them so you have
to<00:02:41.770> pick<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.130> off<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.700> stem<00:02:45.970> doesn't

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
to pick that off and the stem doesn't

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.820 
to pick that off and the stem doesn't
come<00:02:46.450> off

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:59.070 

but<00:02:51.460> you<00:02:51.580> can<00:02:51.730> see<00:02:55.380> how<00:02:56.380> juicy<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.010> ice<00:02:58.080> and

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
but you can see how juicy the ice and

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.660 
but you can see how juicy the ice and
soft<00:02:59.530> edible<00:02:59.950> chewable<00:03:00.490> seats<00:03:01.740> nice<00:03:02.740> mild

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
soft edible chewable seats nice mild

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:11.760 
soft edible chewable seats nice mild
flavor<00:03:09.330> which<00:03:10.330> reminds<00:03:10.750> me<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.110> Robin<00:03:11.440> hasn't

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
flavor which reminds me the Robin hasn't

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.490 
flavor which reminds me the Robin hasn't
been<00:03:12.600> saying<00:03:13.600> too<00:03:13.810> much<00:03:14.020> because<00:03:14.200> I've<00:03:14.380> been

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
been saying too much because I've been

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.620 
been saying too much because I've been
keeping<00:03:14.830> them<00:03:14.890> full<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:15.760> maybe<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.240> should<00:03:16.300> just

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
keeping them full so maybe I should just

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.960 
keeping them full so maybe I should just
feed<00:03:16.840> him<00:03:16.900> when<00:03:17.080> he's<00:03:17.170> hungry<00:03:17.320> but<00:03:17.790> let's<00:03:18.790> go

feed him when he's hungry but let's go

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.340
