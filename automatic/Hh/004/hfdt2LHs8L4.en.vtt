it one of the advantages with the Delta
machine<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.400> we're<00:00:14.549> showing<00:00:14.730> here<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
machine that we're showing here is the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.720 
machine that we're showing here is the
modularity<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.260> flexibility<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.520> what

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
modularity and the flexibility so what

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.460 
modularity and the flexibility so what
we<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:17.970> do<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.990> way<00:00:19.109> it's<00:00:19.289> set<00:00:19.439> up

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
we can do with this the way it's set up

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.890 
we can do with this the way it's set up
now<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.800> could<00:00:20.310> add<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.820> flexo<00:00:21.420> or<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.689> could

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
now you could add a flexo or you could

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.509 
now you could add a flexo or you could
take<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> flexographic<00:00:22.650> printer<00:00:23.039> off<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.460> at

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
take the flexographic printer off and at

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.800 
take the flexographic printer off and at

reasons that we looked at purchasing
this<00:02:10.140> equipment<00:02:10.590> because<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.280> ability<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
this equipment because the ability to to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.940 
this equipment because the ability to to
run<00:02:12.690> as<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> standalone<00:02:13.349> unit

run as a standalone unit
was<00:02:14.099> also<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> tremendous<00:02:15.599> value<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.230> our<00:02:16.349> side

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
was also a tremendous value on our side

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.970 
was also a tremendous value on our side

the flexibility and module design in the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.119 
the flexibility and module design in the
Delta<00:02:20.400> was<00:02:20.700> key<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.629> us<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.170> was<00:02:22.530> something

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
Delta was key to us it was something

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.470 
Delta was key to us it was something
