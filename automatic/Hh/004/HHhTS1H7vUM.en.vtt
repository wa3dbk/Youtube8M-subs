think they're going to go back up

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.849 
think they're going to go back up
because<00:02:53.690> i've<00:02:53.930> seen<00:02:54.109> a<00:02:54.139> little<00:02:54.410> sneak<00:02:54.620> peek

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
because i've seen a little sneak peek

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.539 
because i've seen a little sneak peek
from<00:02:55.579> a<00:02:55.670> rune<00:02:56.030> sharks<00:02:56.389> video<00:02:56.660> i<00:02:57.400> behold<00:02:58.400> of

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
from a rune sharks video i behold of

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.420 
from a rune sharks video i behold of
millions<00:02:58.819> our<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.329> you<00:02:59.419> can<00:02:59.660> use<00:03:00.190> bandos<00:03:01.190> and

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
millions our and you can use bandos and

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.120 
millions our and you can use bandos and
stuff<00:03:01.609> in<00:03:01.760> there<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.709> i'm<00:03:03.709> guessing<00:03:03.919> it's

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
stuff in there so i'm guessing it's

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.949

everything from glacials but I might
sell<00:03:07.760> them<00:03:07.940> if<00:03:08.180> they<00:03:09.079> rise<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:09.680> much<00:03:09.980> due<00:03:10.669> to
