00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.000

 city a heroic people the shout return is 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.859
 and then the youtube on duty beauty like 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.689
 Brazil is old 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.249
 the first thing a guy is entered 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.679
 It was matheus and the guys stayed 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:29.470
 fighting there I do not know who went to 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.960
 now that this map of Brazil but this 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.580
 flag but then congratulations guys now 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.850
 flight to infinity and besides defining the 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.270
 Because I buy jetpack because I 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.710
 I saw there in the description that is faster né 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.720
 What is this video about? 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.380
 video has not been good so far so far 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.550
 now does prepares is then a 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.640
 update that I will always be 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.579
 doing on the map of the people that is this 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.840
 map he is doing who did yesterday 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.200
 it's on, right? 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.500
 So this little house, who looks cool, dude. 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.850
 shock was a girl who entered randon 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.520
 the guys think they know they killed 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.170
 tamires but I do not know if she is 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.060
 subscribed to my channel then try to find 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.229
 she there because I liked the expensive house 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.119
 Good people, kitchen, have a walk here. 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.710
 that you can not think up 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.060
 You can not enter, you have to take the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.859
 Blocks here to enter 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.179
 she put winning up here was 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:27.249
 cute 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.679
 Now that I'm gone, guys, it's much more. 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:32.560
 easy to do things but had 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.939
 forgetful that I can not do anything 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.539
 also underneath that I have low 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.819
 map 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.139
 you can not build anything down too 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.619
 I'm clicking here with the left button 

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:43.509
 You can not build anything, so it's kind of 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.959
 so things underground we go 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.810
 to have to make a walk is kind to pretend 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:53.229
 it is thus argued that this building 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.149
 here is a garage in the basement gives 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.389
 To do it but it gives more work to us. 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.429
 will have to pretend to have floors and such 

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.999
 and this one is going to take a garage here from 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.670
 side 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:05.380
 but gives to do because Mr. ladder 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.170
 I want it to be spiral 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.460
 I'll put it in the edition there now for you 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.010
 see 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.100
 How do I want it to be the stepladder? 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.630
 to give an idea that it's sub soil gives 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.670
 an idea of ​​what kind has subway there in 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.630
 Low on I want to make a city well. 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.000
 crazy 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.560
 You are seeing some pictures of a 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.510
 idea to leave 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.310
 about doing subway hoital gives to us 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.980
 make a deal so a strong group 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.490
 an underpass an entrose 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:37.240
 down the street or not, I did not do it 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.430
 but the guys already showed in the already proved that 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.830
 You know how to do the street, it's not difficult for us. 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.790
 street is after all a city that 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.850
 It has to be right. 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:50.440
 and here this ladder goes up here turns to the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.480
 right and will going up to inspire 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.910
 then the first floor from here to 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.800
 to send people make another ladder 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.690
 this side here're seeing that sense 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.360
 we make sense otherwise it will 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.520
 making giant buildings up to and 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.320
 tapering up and down 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.660
 making a tower at last people have a 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.610
 antenna over a very punk city is 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.170
 well time ya know 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.960
 talking about engineering 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.160
 architecture like this part here you 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.570
 also commented taking the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.880
 making this mapim 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.770
 Then do not come and pay me everything here. 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.440
 happen if they come up with fucking ideas 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.880
 leave with the ideas of the hour of a map 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.790
 so then what do we do what 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.970
 people do this part is a two three 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.770
 four five six with six blocks and this 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.600
 stayed with 4 only this stayed with two 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.850
 blocks more then here we invent 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.370
 some thing but with a 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.440
 caretaker here because then we 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.760
 I'll just let it go, I 'm just leaving it 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.500
 to see how you're going to stay but it's a 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.780
 building where you will cover 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.820
 Portinha and everything else. 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.070
 Other thing I want to do is a building 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:57.040
 Here is a building here is another here 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.470
 science does it or does it over here so 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.380
 and makes a bridge between the two buildings 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.770
 There's a lot of it in gta gta4 who plays 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.570
 gta4 in the city of having four 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.450
 Can we do this building? 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.180
 here a little tip to another building there 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.390
 beauty, the guys here I go 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.430
 hunt some maps here mainly one 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.690
 I played there the other day, which is a 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.020
 city guys what they did 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.910
 jets 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.030
 There was upstairs just want to make it like that. 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.180
 a sea breeze the giant ship and type gives 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.590
 to climb up stairs and down 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.169
 a crazy fight arrives at the aircraft 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.500
 gives aircraft to enter and also gives a 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:41.409
 Good crap continuing our video 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.229
 this is the good example of one of a 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.090
 map that attempted to make a city is not 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.220
 but you could see that the map did not 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.039
 It was very well built so kind 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.800
 no streets left the blocks of 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.750
 grass on the floor everything but some 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.250
 Take care of things and if that plane 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.169
 that the idea that I told you about 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.599
 the plane to make a jet plane that 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.370
 then up by stairs you get there 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.220
 and that's a part of the map too. 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.110
 a very crazy plane also something else 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.780
 what you should do is a map that you can 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.659
 search for the break force that has to me 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.300
 I call the Pope, I call football where I go. 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:18.310
 bring this map to you here a 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.139
 Average gameplay in it so you can see how 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.590
 It's cool, they made football history . 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.389
 complete however choosing this map 100% 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.759
 It's too big to make a stadium. 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.130
 football as if it were a stadium in the 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.740
 city still leave the stadium 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.349
 great playable understood, it looks cool 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.580
 you can leave a diffusion that makes the 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:41.060
 subsoil leaves 11 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.740
 miguézim so low so the stadium and 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.629
 put a rifle to a sport that is 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.409
 melting the bomb under the stage 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.879
 so now you are seeing a map there 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.449
 that I just wanted to bring to 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:56.090
 You see it's aport that it's a map. 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.789
 that has in mw 2 and now has to download 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.500
 for free not mw3 we're talking about koff 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.300
 declares 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.490
 It's very cool, the way they did it. 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.699
 a type airplane I hate this white block 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:12.949
 because he is very bright and such but the 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:14.900
 miguelzinho that they gave to make the 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.449
 of ours that of law that of 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.030
 Rosana the wheels of the airplane that legal 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.440
 they made it known that in the 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.819
 strong group and will do anything 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.710
 on the map, right? 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:27.289
 So that's it folks I want to make a 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.210
 city with several buildings on this map 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.050
 You can also get an idea of ​​what I 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.509
 I want 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.560
 the photos I put of some 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:39.310
 Stuff there, a picture I think of gta is 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.840
 how I want it to be the the 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.430
 passing the ladder so low 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.440
 underground and everything else 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.020
 you have an idea and for when 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.039
 you come join us to help 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.389
 build a map you already know why 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:54.830
 how is the project because now 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.629
 We have a project working on it. 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.639
 of a project to be very cool map 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:59.779
 who knows how to enter the big rankings 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.550
 force it 

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:05.509
 now this map is what you are seeing 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.210
 is called the English grid grid on the 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.860
 who wants this map you should already have 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.560
 guessed at who has not seen this film the 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.270
 Thunder movie, that's cool, I 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.430
 I liked the way they used the pipes. 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.379
 these pipes that have on the side that 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.050
 You did not see there, I liked the way. 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:24.440
 that they used the ale pipes that's how they 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.150
 I also want to do it on our map in 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.190
 some buildings and such 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.930
 in some buildings you can give 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.089
 idea that there is a same city building 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.400
 using these pipes there, that's it folks 

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:37.490
 Our video stays here please. 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.599
 click liked favorite the video only helps

 very 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:42.440
 do not do it only on the big channels 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.449
 space in the small also old 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.819
