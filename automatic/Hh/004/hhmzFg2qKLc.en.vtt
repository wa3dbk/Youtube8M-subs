00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.660
 boy sheep written look i found 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.490
 new super cool keyboard and sire 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.680
 which the company presented the news by whom 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.070
 vitex of type b 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.769
 in 2013 really kidding of course 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.630
 there is such a strange growth in the back 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:32.349
 the form 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:35.140
 tablet called iconia w3 here 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.580
 such an 8-inch tablet under 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.610
 running windows 8 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.960
 And we do not have 8 rt normal 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.820
 full windows 8 because they knit 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.659
 built on an intel atom processor 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:54.070
 spirit i 90 tu 1 whole 80 hertz marking 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:59.170
 him z 2760 screen resolution of 1280 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.890
 800 points I would say that we have grain 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.290
 especially not visible everything works well 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.409
 quickly the only problem is this 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.549
 the tablet is just that 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.229
 software under it is specific let's say 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.049
 here's a special application store 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.509
 This is quite a bit but in the plus of course in 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.409
 the fact that you can put the usual 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.079
 x86 and applications so here is the top button 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:31.280
 turn this one to be able to hook which 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:31.280
 all this here so here attached here 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.340
 pits further 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.090
 port microusb and with micro beaten 30 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.450
 micro-hdmi on the opposite end 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.030
 audio jack 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.299
 nest for charging here this i'm not very 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.320
 I love when you have to use 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.970
 specific charger it 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.940
 be-be-be fu fu, you can't do that 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.539
 guys roll that you do two 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.259
 the speaker on the top is a slot for 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.390
 micro sd card up to 32 gigabytes and 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.780
 actually the main memory of the gadget 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.810
 maybe also 32 gigabytes or 64 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.060
 well, and besides there is a divided 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.120
 2 and volume control and general 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.100
 nothing more so much how exactly this 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.739
 a piece weighs not told a city of about 500 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.810
 grams here the German boys drove 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:26.069
 for a while 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.810
 ipad mini compare here as this 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.019
 everything looks well, of course ipad significantly 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.610
 thinner, more stylish and made of metal in 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.790
 Unlike what is guys 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.920
 unlike here this device 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.630
 which only mows under the metal on themselves 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:46.010
 it's plastic don't flatter yourself guys 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:49.160
 here and the camera and not some kind of she 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.910
 as many as 2 megapixel dudes and in front 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.860
 also a 2-megapixel how are you pretty 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.560
 still 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.500
 strange i would say 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.690
 what about prices 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.710
 and the youngest model of 30 with two gigs 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.400
 will cost 330 euros 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:12.940
 over six with four gigs of 380 euros and 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.730
 here is such a foot with which 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.730
 it is generally quite convenient to type 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.200
 you have interesting what I typed so 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.170
 Here is the tape that can be really convenient 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.069
 typing along the way is a keyboard about 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.520
 13-inch laptop if we like then 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.060
 something like this 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.100
 she connects everything using bluetooth 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.989
 here is bluetooth at 0 here I don't know 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.140
 what bluetooth in one button 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.550
 power on and special connect button 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.900
 there are such funny things 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.549
 which are put forward 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.720
 I don't know what they do at all 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.970
 do not change the landing at all like this 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.680
 and here is extremely 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.989
 here should be kept like this and here 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.989
 Everything is stored here two batteries format 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.989
 3a 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.319
 I do not remember the rock did not say it costs 79 euros 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.190
 Here is such an additional accessory to 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.940
 him 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:21.959
 but somehow I do not know 8-inch tablet 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.460
 by itself yes not bad but for 330 euros not 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.410
 I know in my opinion a bit too much, but with this one 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:33.960
 keyboard but it turns out that side 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.400
 The type of laptop is generally rather strange 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.340
 form factor is what i can say about 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.020
 this sorry i have a jetlag tomorrow i 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.880
 I'll be back to normal and will broadcast 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.950
 or more meaningful things 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.790
 on mobile dot ru exhibition computex 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.790
