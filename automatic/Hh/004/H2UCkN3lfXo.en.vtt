ironically<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.690> agencies<00:00:58.109> seem<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.590> just

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
ironically the agencies seem to be just

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.189 
ironically the agencies seem to be just
as<00:00:59.010> slow<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.609> clients<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.239> change<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.140> I

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
as slow as the clients to change and I

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.869 
as slow as the clients to change and I
think<00:01:01.410> that's<00:01:01.559> because<00:01:01.710> unless<00:01:02.670> you've<00:01:02.850> had

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
think that's because unless you've had

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.299 
think that's because unless you've had
involvement<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.719> direct<00:01:04.049> response<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:05.189> may

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
involvement with direct response you may

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
involvement with direct response you may
not<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.610> had<00:01:05.820> exposure<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.510> accountable

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
not have had exposure to accountable

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.649 
not have had exposure to accountable
media<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.159> methodology<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.210> makes

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
media so the methodology that makes

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.010 
media so the methodology that makes
direct<00:01:09.930> response<00:01:10.260> work<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:11.220> unfamiliar

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
direct response work is just unfamiliar

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.420 
direct response work is just unfamiliar
so<00:01:13.020> now<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.650> finally<00:01:13.830> there's

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so now here we are finally there's

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.390 
so now here we are finally there's
measurable<00:01:14.939> programs<00:01:15.420> available<00:01:16.159> to<00:01:17.159> most

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
measurable programs available to most

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.429 
measurable programs available to most
marketers<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.210> people<00:01:18.960> still<00:01:19.140> can't<00:01:19.320> make
