00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.330 
how but I have a theory about it this
way<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:40.970> said<00:02:41.299> yes<00:02:41.480> because<00:02:41.769> like<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.920> seat<00:02:43.129> a

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
way I said yes because like the seat a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.580 
way I said yes because like the seat a
lamp<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.849> transformative<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:44.989> pull<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
lamp is transformative you pull the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.089 
lamp is transformative you pull the
chain<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:46.129> it<00:02:46.909> turns<00:02:47.090> into<00:02:47.349> like<00:02:48.349> so<00:02:48.950> there<00:02:49.069> is

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
chain and it turns into like so there is

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.550 
chain and it turns into like so there is
actually<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.940> large<00:02:50.269> area<00:02:50.510> behind<00:02:50.720> logic
