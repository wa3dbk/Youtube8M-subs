00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.210
 this is the so here I will show 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:27.890
 difference between the game and the game 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:33.830
 paid for example have only who you are and 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:39.290
 revolution ex-santos 7 raiders nobody 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:44.510
 come a long way to son by the name 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:47.540
 it's English challenges or what 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.330
 It may be good, this game is an adventure of 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.879
 real-time action good the beautiful day to 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.860
 nessi another login in my case and is 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.000
 something missing on this title screen each 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.280
 producer name 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.870
 as it is her name is edson and 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.900
 Hudson 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.790
 This is because these 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.790
 usually the people take the product 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.390
 originated games and executed the names of 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.590
 games 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.320
 type as soon as spain arrives from 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.010
 clown time to stop the training rolled the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.670
 what is this 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.670
 technologists 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.729
 they are still here from the train back 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:32.840
 up Princess léia of Yosemite Sam 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:36.390
 here but this is not easy because it was O's 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.100
 Okay, you're not reading the way today. 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.840
 to the end and full of enemies of the most 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.569
 possible if you had a car that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.880
 skip the training imagine you travel 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:45.869
 train and nothing luxury for a car by 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.149
 up the workout 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.159
 great the village in this game at least 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.950
 For me it's the cufflinks of 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.189
 attacks are fun and this confuses a 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.219
 A little but okay, it took shape 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.610
 bhola and amusing ie will fix 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.610
 that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:14.370
 the drug is this is fish passing by 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.290
 I think this should not happen that way. 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.140
 game is difficult but wanting a lot of time 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.750
 You can reach the end and fall again. 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.579
 of the train they fled in the next phase in 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.040
 Chronic game changes looking very much like 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.650
 the gene heaven fto you kill them some 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.810
 powers that of serious thug and if the thing 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.970
 Sweetest I 've Ever Seen In You Type Game 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.819
 kill an enemy he troops a knife 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.319
 all the time rafael imagines you dying 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.540
 looking for life and you kill a 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:44.790
 enemy is not good at all 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:48.410
 the item that also appeared earthquake of 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.410
 succor macedo host 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:04.790
 the theater is what we take bodies and get 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.980
 means to take a knife in them you stay 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.870
 stronger and faster so one of the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.870
 skulls that protects the dancing caves ' 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.890
 inside the cave you need to pass 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.750
 by the gamers and get the item talking 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.390
 seems easy but considering that your 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.439
 Leap is shit and has that fire son. 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.170
 from montillo 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:25.780
 That's not what you talk about, you die if you fall. 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.280
 very high 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.870
 perfect taking the local stops of the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.579
 cave to do a check point 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.560
 so it's always good to get into them and 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.010
 pick up the items advancing more in the game and 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.030
 passing through your huge scare map 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.319
 small davi slack medium online crafting 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.840
 big garden what is not so big 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.030
 so but wow is a sign the bastard 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.829
 You will always find yourself trapped between the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.319
 trees or mountains the enemies in the 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.849
 more advanced areas are the same 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.430
 but besides being smarter and 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.959
 persistent duggan full ratio of these 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.519
 little roses that are immortal that 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.099
 You can only kill both power-up. 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.629
 So the only way to get away, though. 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.560
 will only accumulate the number of enemies to 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:09.650
 your drug glue or pee 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.810

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.190

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.150

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:53.700
 It's okay, the drug was also the 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:53.700

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.430

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.620
 if you liked the video I did not like it 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.569
 underneath favorite and spread it to the galley 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.669
 this helps a lot because it makes more 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.979
 people know the important ones to me 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.779
