00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
was Larry Moore and Wallace and I think

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.740 
was Larry Moore and Wallace and I think
they<00:00:18.480> debate<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:20.210> don't<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.269> suffered

or what would any time like I've said
before<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.300> looks<00:00:27.480> like<00:00:27.539> somebody<00:00:27.960> might

going to get them off the field that's

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.010 
going to get them off the field that's
the<00:00:32.640> key<00:00:32.820> thing<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.149> do<00:00:33.359> especially<00:00:33.539> with<00:00:33.960> kids

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
on or off the field even mess with that

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.130 
on or off the field even mess with that
and<00:00:38.749> we<00:00:39.749> feel<00:00:39.929> really<00:00:40.170> strongly<00:00:40.440> about<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
and we feel really strongly about that

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.500 
and we feel really strongly about that
we<00:00:43.140> try<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.589> simulate<00:00:44.030> some<00:00:45.030> scrimmage

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
we try to simulate some scrimmage

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.399 
we try to simulate some scrimmage
tighter<00:00:45.989> game<00:00:46.440> tight<00:00:46.859> situations<00:00:47.639> today<00:00:48.409> we

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
tighter game tight situations today we

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:50.869 
tighter game tight situations today we
kind<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.679> amped<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.280> pressure<00:00:50.519> a<00:00:50.699> little

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
kind of amped up the pressure a little

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.299 
kind of amped up the pressure a little
bit<00:00:51.499> intensified<00:00:52.499> things<00:00:52.799> a<00:00:52.920> little<00:00:53.069> bit

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
bit intensified things a little bit

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.459 
bit intensified things a little bit
added<00:00:53.729> some<00:00:53.909> more<00:00:54.420> crowd<00:00:54.719> noise<00:00:55.019> some<00:00:55.289> more

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
added some more crowd noise some more

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.979 
added some more crowd noise some more
music<00:00:56.059> tried<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.179> create<00:00:57.389> a<00:00:57.449> little<00:00:57.690> bit<00:00:57.809> more

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
music tried to create a little bit more

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.099 
music tried to create a little bit more
chaos<00:00:58.409> to<00:00:58.679> see<00:00:58.859> how<00:00:59.010> guys<00:00:59.219> would<00:00:59.729> react<00:01:00.109> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
chaos to see how guys would react I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.799 
chaos to see how guys would react I
thought<00:01:01.679> it<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:01.979> it<00:01:02.339> was<00:01:02.549> a<00:01:03.059> pretty<00:01:03.569> average

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
thought it was it was a pretty average

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.870 
thought it was it was a pretty average
practice<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.190> anticipated

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
practice but that's what I anticipated

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.990 
practice but that's what I anticipated
going<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:07.860> our<00:01:08.010> first<00:01:08.310> time<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.790> in

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
going in it's our first time really in

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.640 
going in it's our first time really in
this<00:01:09.180> environment<00:01:09.570> where<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.350> amp

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
this environment where we really amp

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.530 
this environment where we really amp
things<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.520> think<00:01:11.910> it<00:01:11.970> was<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.120> really<00:01:12.330> good

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
things up I think it was a really good

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.970 
things up I think it was a really good
learning<00:01:12.570> experience<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.440> us<00:01:13.740> I'm

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
learning experience for us I'm

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.330 
learning experience for us I'm
encouraged<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:15.900> satisfied<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.950> don't

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
encouraged I'm not satisfied I don't

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.740 
encouraged I'm not satisfied I don't
think<00:01:17.370> any<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.730> us<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.000> satisfied<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.690> i

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
think that there's a lot of guys that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
think that there's a lot of guys that
are<00:01:20.790> encouraged<00:01:21.480> we<00:01:21.660> needed<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> go<00:01:22.140> through

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
are encouraged we needed to go through

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.610 
are encouraged we needed to go through
this<00:01:22.650> today<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.930> we<00:01:24.930> need<00:01:25.050> to<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.350> through<00:01:25.500> it

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
this today and we need to go through it

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.990 
this today and we need to go through it
a<00:01:25.680> few<00:01:25.710> more<00:01:26.040> times<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.520> know<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.700> need<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
a few more times you know we need to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.630 
a few more times you know we need to
keep<00:01:27.180> increasing<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.440> intensity<00:01:28.890> increasing

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
keep increasing the intensity increasing

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.730 
keep increasing the intensity increasing
the<00:01:29.730> chaos<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.230> can<00:01:31.380> learn<00:01:31.500> how<00:01:31.560> to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the chaos so that we can learn how to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.940 
the chaos so that we can learn how to
function<00:01:32.360> efficiently<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:34.110> poise<00:01:34.470> with

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
function efficiently with poise with

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.510 
function efficiently with poise with
composure<00:01:35.720> staying<00:01:36.720> confident<00:01:37.520> stand

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
composure staying confident stand

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.430 
composure staying confident stand
relaxed<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.240> when<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.840> Heat's<00:01:40.050> on<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
relaxed and when the Heat's on and

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.110 
relaxed and when the Heat's on and
that's<00:01:40.890> part<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.520> being<00:01:41.580> a<00:01:41.790> good<00:01:41.940> football

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
that's part of being a good football

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.060 
that's part of being a good football
team<00:01:42.330> is<00:01:42.960> being<00:01:43.230> able<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.560> do<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:43.980> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
team is being able to do that and the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.340 
team is being able to do that and the
only<00:01:44.220> way<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.840> simulate<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.080> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
only way that you can simulate that is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.510 
only way that you can simulate that is
to<00:01:46.470> come<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.770> here<00:01:46.800> on<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.100> practice<00:01:47.220> field

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
to come out here on the practice field

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.610 
to come out here on the practice field
and<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.510> it<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> way<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:48.930> try<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> do<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.470> today

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
and do it the way we try to do it today

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.890 
and do it the way we try to do it today
or<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.370> games<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.180> we're<00:01:51.300> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.480> do<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.750> as

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
or in games so we're going to do that as

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.080 
or in games so we're going to do that as
much<00:01:52.050> as<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.159> think<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.670> got<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.850> lot

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
much as you can so I think we got a lot

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.510 
much as you can so I think we got a lot
out<00:01:54.120> of<00:01:54.300> today<00:01:54.980> obviously<00:01:55.980> there's<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.250> lot<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
out of today obviously there's a lot of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.990 
out of today obviously there's a lot of
things<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.970> we<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.240> correct

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
things that we have to correct

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.310 
things that we have to correct
think<00:01:59.180> it's<00:01:59.300> a<00:01:59.390> bit<00:01:59.570> of<00:01:59.660> a<00:01:59.720> wake-up<00:01:59.900> call<00:02:00.110> for

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
think it's a bit of a wake-up call for

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.440 
think it's a bit of a wake-up call for
some<00:02:00.710> guys<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.790> that's<00:02:02.000> not<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.210> bad<00:02:02.420> thing

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
some guys and that's not a bad thing

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.260 
some guys and that's not a bad thing
it's<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.500> good<00:02:03.680> thing<00:02:06.610> shorter<00:02:07.610> practice<00:02:08.030> so

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
it's a good thing shorter practice so

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.830 
it's a good thing shorter practice so
far<00:02:08.509> as<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.690> know<00:02:08.750> yeah<00:02:09.470> was<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:10.070> was<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.729> was<00:02:10.880> it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
far as I know yeah was it was it was it

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.260 
far as I know yeah was it was it was it
was<00:02:11.990> probably<00:02:12.710> almost<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.250> nap<00:02:13.400> our<00:02:13.580> children

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
was probably almost a nap our children

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.530 
was probably almost a nap our children
we<00:02:14.900> cut<00:02:15.110> out<00:02:15.230> some<00:02:15.440> things<00:02:16.030> we<00:02:17.030> wanted<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.510> just

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
we cut out some things we wanted it just

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.449 
we cut out some things we wanted it just
like<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.900> said<00:02:18.110> increase<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.560> intensity<00:02:19.250> in

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
like I said increase the intensity in

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.050 
like I said increase the intensity in
certain<00:02:19.850> in<00:02:20.090> certain<00:02:20.300> situations<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:22.310> really

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
certain in certain situations and really

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.540 
certain in certain situations and really
focus<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:23.660> particular<00:02:24.260> parts<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.950> in-game

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
focus on particular parts of in-game

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.880 
focus on particular parts of in-game
like<00:02:25.820> situations<00:02:26.590> part<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.740> do<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.930> know

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
like situations part of that do you know

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.270 
like situations part of that do you know
we<00:02:31.220> did<00:02:31.670> not<00:02:31.820> cut<00:02:32.060> out<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.720> was<00:02:33.470> a

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
we did not cut out that was a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.320 
we did not cut out that was a
pre-planned<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:36.760> thought<00:02:37.760> about<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.300> know

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
pre-planned I thought about you know

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.420 
pre-planned I thought about you know
maybe<00:02:38.690> shortened<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.260> down<00:02:39.320> but<00:02:39.860> thatís<00:02:40.190> don't

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
maybe shortened it down but thatís don't

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
maybe shortened it down but thatís don't
think<00:02:40.580> that's<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.820> right<00:02:40.910> thing<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.270> do<00:02:41.420> right

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
think that's the right thing to do right

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.610 
think that's the right thing to do right
now<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.780> think<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.020> right<00:02:42.200> thing<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.470> do<00:02:42.590> is

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
now I think the right thing to do is

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.100 
now I think the right thing to do is
just<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.980> keep<00:02:43.190> pushing<00:02:43.520> pushing<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.840> pushing

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
just to keep pushing pushing and pushing

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.510 
just to keep pushing pushing and pushing
and<00:02:45.290> keep<00:02:45.470> pushing<00:02:45.950> we're<00:02:46.190> going<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.370> keep

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
and keep pushing we're going to keep

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.020 
and keep pushing we're going to keep
pushing<00:02:46.930> sermon<00:02:47.930> sister<00:02:48.290> Esther<00:02:49.030> sermons

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
pushing sermon sister Esther sermons

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.650 
pushing sermon sister Esther sermons
yeah<00:02:50.900> sermons<00:02:51.830> we<00:02:52.790> saw<00:02:53.270> him<00:02:53.360> out<00:02:53.450> here<00:02:53.570> with

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
yeah sermons we saw him out here with

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.430 
yeah sermons we saw him out here with
the<00:02:53.720> castle<00:02:54.200> again<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:55.780> they<00:02:56.780> did<00:02:56.959> an<00:02:57.050> x-ray

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
the castle again and they did an x-ray

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.220 
the castle again and they did an x-ray
and<00:02:57.620> he<00:02:57.709> has<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.890> break<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:58.730> it's<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.090> I'm<00:03:00.050> not

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
and he has a break and it's it I'm not

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.470 
and he has a break and it's it I'm not
going<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.470> try<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.680> get<00:03:00.860> into<00:03:01.010> those<00:03:01.480> broken

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
going to try to get into those broken

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.600 
going to try to get into those broken
bones<00:03:02.780> yes<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.590> he's<00:03:03.650> going<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.070> have<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.430> have

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
bones yes and he's going to have to have

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.420 
bones yes and he's going to have to have
surgery<00:03:04.910> on<00:03:05.299> that<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.049> it's<00:03:06.709> unlikely<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.280> will

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
surgery on that so it's unlikely it will

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.650 
surgery on that so it's unlikely it will
be<00:03:07.580> with<00:03:07.760> us<00:03:07.790> for<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.120> rest<00:03:08.269> of<00:03:08.420> spring

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
be with us for the rest of spring

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.600 
be with us for the rest of spring
although<00:03:09.170> there's<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.040> chance<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.459> he<00:03:10.580> could

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
although there's a chance that he could

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.220 
although there's a chance that he could
back<00:03:10.970> late<00:03:11.209> next<00:03:11.420> week<00:03:11.540> with<00:03:11.840> one<00:03:12.049> of<00:03:12.140> those

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
back late next week with one of those

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.330 
back late next week with one of those
big<00:03:12.620> clubs<00:03:12.980> on<00:03:14.350> he<00:03:15.350> practiced<00:03:15.890> with<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.220> on

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.640 
big clubs on he practiced with it on
Tuesday<00:03:16.880> but<00:03:17.780> they<00:03:17.959> felt<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.470> best

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
Tuesday but they felt like the best

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.020 
Tuesday but they felt like the best
thing<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.920> do<00:03:19.040> because<00:03:19.160> he<00:03:19.370> had<00:03:19.459> some<00:03:19.700> swelling

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
thing to do because he had some swelling

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.270 
thing to do because he had some swelling
on<00:03:20.690> his<00:03:20.810> hand<00:03:21.110> underneath<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.680> cast<00:03:21.920> as<00:03:22.160> they

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
on his hand underneath the cast as they

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.949 
on his hand underneath the cast as they
need<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.580> cut<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.880> cast<00:03:23.120> back<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.690> they<00:03:23.750> cut

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
need to cut the cast back and they cut

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.229 
need to cut the cast back and they cut
the<00:03:24.080> cast<00:03:24.320> back<00:03:24.650> he<00:03:25.160> wasn't<00:03:25.489> protected<00:03:25.970> they

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
the cast back he wasn't protected they

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.550 
the cast back he wasn't protected they
had<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.450> cut<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.720> pep<00:03:26.900> cast<00:03:27.170> back<00:03:27.380> because<00:03:27.530> of

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
had to cut the pep cast back because of

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.560 
had to cut the pep cast back because of
swelling<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:28.280> we<00:03:28.400> can't<00:03:28.640> we<00:03:29.209> can't<00:03:29.420> have

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
swelling and so we can't we can't have

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.410 
swelling and so we can't we can't have
him<00:03:29.660> out<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:29.810> that<00:03:30.110> situation<00:03:30.610> did<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:31.760> get

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
him out in that situation did you get

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.970 
him out in that situation did you get
any<00:03:32.630> clarity<00:03:33.049> at<00:03:33.140> all<00:03:33.320> for<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.590> quarterback

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
any clarity at all for the quarterback

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.160 
any clarity at all for the quarterback
situation<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:34.670> didn't<00:03:35.510> because<00:03:35.660> I<00:03:35.989> was

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
situation I didn't because I was

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.490 
situation I didn't because I was
watching<00:03:36.560> everything<00:03:36.799> you<00:03:37.130> know<00:03:37.310> I<00:03:37.340> mean<00:03:37.850> I

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
watching everything you know I mean I

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.289 
watching everything you know I mean I
don't<00:03:39.500> know<00:03:39.860> that<00:03:40.070> even<00:03:40.250> null<00:03:40.549> did<00:03:40.850> you<00:03:41.180> know

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
don't know that even null did you know

eyes on on one particular position you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.119 
eyes on on one particular position you
know<00:04:03.060> there's<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:03.359> much<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:03.870> much<00:04:03.930> going<00:04:04.379> on<00:04:04.439> do

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129

you<00:04:05.219> make<00:04:05.370> much<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.760> interception<00:04:07.700> from

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
you make much of the interception from

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.059 
you make much of the interception from
what<00:04:08.879> standpoint<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.659> mean<00:04:10.109> that<00:04:10.319> would<00:04:10.950> you

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
what standpoint it mean that would you

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.319 
what standpoint it mean that would you
think<00:04:11.219> of<00:04:11.400> them<00:04:11.549> or<00:04:11.700> what<00:04:11.819> we<00:04:11.909> what<00:04:12.090> is<00:04:12.209> your

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329

thought<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:13.049> interceptions<00:04:13.620> throughout

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
thought on the interceptions throughout

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.120 
thought on the interceptions throughout
the<00:04:14.510> cause<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:16.079> thought<00:04:16.349> that<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.739> distance<00:04:16.979> of

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
the cause I thought that the distance of

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.529 
the cause I thought that the distance of
players<00:04:17.340> made<00:04:17.549> some<00:04:17.699> pretty<00:04:17.820> good<00:04:18.000> plays<00:04:18.269> I

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
players made some pretty good plays I

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.729 
players made some pretty good plays I
thought<00:04:18.720> couple<00:04:19.199> would<00:04:19.380> probably<00:04:19.620> not<00:04:19.709> very

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
thought couple would probably not very

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.680 
thought couple would probably not very
good<00:04:20.070> foot<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.549> know<00:04:20.639> balls<00:04:21.060> thrown<00:04:21.479> but<00:04:21.630> I

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
good foot you know balls thrown but I

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.740 
good foot you know balls thrown but I
got<00:04:21.840> at<00:04:21.989> once<00:04:22.139> again<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:23.210> lot<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.330> times<00:04:24.539> when

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
got at once again a lot of times when

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.540 
got at once again a lot of times when
there's<00:04:25.020> an<00:04:25.080> interception<00:04:25.500> we<00:04:25.860> all<00:04:26.009> we<00:04:26.520> all

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550

including<00:04:27.330> myself<00:04:27.479> we<00:04:28.020> assume<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.470> it's<00:04:28.919> a

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
including myself we assume that it's a

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.159 
including myself we assume that it's a
poor<00:04:29.250> throw<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.970> sometimes<00:04:30.720> it's<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.990> bad

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
poor throw and sometimes it's a bad

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.350 
poor throw and sometimes it's a bad
route<00:04:31.470> sometimes<00:04:32.400> it's<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.639> good<00:04:32.849> break<00:04:33.120> by<00:04:33.330> a

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
route sometimes it's a good break by a

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.930 
route sometimes it's a good break by a
defender<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.800> then<00:04:35.099> sometimes<00:04:35.520> it's<00:04:35.669> a<00:04:35.759> bad

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
defender and then sometimes it's a bad

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.120 
defender and then sometimes it's a bad
throw<00:04:36.180> so<00:04:36.960> just<00:04:37.259> like<00:04:37.410> you<00:04:37.650> know<00:04:37.770> as<00:04:37.889> Chris

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
feel like you know over the course of

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.360 
feel like you know over the course of
the<00:05:34.490> next<00:05:34.730> we<00:05:35.390> have<00:05:35.540> six<00:05:36.380> practices<00:05:36.560> that<00:05:37.130> I

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
the next we have six practices that I

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.920 
the next we have six practices that I
think<00:05:37.880> over<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.090> course<00:05:38.180> of<00:05:38.480> the<00:05:38.540> next<00:05:38.690> six

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
think over the course of the next six

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.000 
think over the course of the next six
practices<00:05:39.140> will<00:05:39.530> start<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:39.830> see<00:05:39.860> some

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
practices will start to see some

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.060 
practices will start to see some
separation<00:05:40.640> remove<00:05:41.060> an<00:05:41.150> amp<00:05:41.420> of<00:05:41.570> the<00:05:41.720> pressure

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
separation remove an amp of the pressure

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.680 
separation remove an amp of the pressure
when<00:05:43.070> we<00:05:43.220> create<00:05:43.580> more<00:05:43.790> situational<00:05:44.510> football

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
when we create more situational football

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.240 
when we create more situational football
you<00:05:45.410> know<00:05:45.470> more<00:05:46.040> emphasis<00:05:46.430> on<00:05:46.580> third<00:05:46.850> downs

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
you know more emphasis on third downs

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.520 
you know more emphasis on third downs
more<00:05:49.250> live<00:05:49.490> situations<00:05:50.300> when<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.170> do<00:05:51.320> that

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
more live situations when you do that

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.890 
more live situations when you do that
they'll<00:05:52.100> be<00:05:52.130> separation<00:05:52.640> so<00:05:53.030> I<00:05:53.120> you<00:05:53.180> know<00:05:53.330> like

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
they'll be separation so I you know like

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.360 
they'll be separation so I you know like
