00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.980 

in<00:01:05.799> my<00:01:06.549> opinion<00:01:06.850> you<00:01:07.180> should<00:01:07.210> never<00:01:07.570> make<00:01:07.810> an

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
in my opinion you should never make an

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.859 
in my opinion you should never make an
omelet<00:01:08.350> with<00:01:08.530> less<00:01:08.860> than<00:01:09.100> two<00:01:09.549> eggs<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
omelet with less than two eggs the

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.660 
omelet with less than two eggs the
Pierce<00:01:11.170> would<00:01:11.350> never<00:01:11.530> do<00:01:11.740> this<00:01:11.890> but<00:01:11.950> I<00:01:12.159> added

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
Pierce would never do this but I added

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.929 
Pierce would never do this but I added
some<00:01:12.880> milk<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.930> mine<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.409> of<00:01:15.070> course<00:01:15.100> I<00:01:15.549> warmed

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
some milk to mine and of course I warmed

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.460

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
up my oil stove set to medium and then I

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.580

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
to the different corners just so that

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.029 
to the different corners just so that
it'll<00:02:03.640> cook<00:02:03.880> evenly<00:02:04.299> here's<00:02:05.289> a<00:02:05.409> hardest<00:02:05.830> part

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039
