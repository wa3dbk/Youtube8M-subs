00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.700
 hi everyone and put his coves 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.410
 if I hope you all have very good 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.300
 today little video 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.849
 not necessarily on trials even if I'm going 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.529
 launch a circle replay to make it the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.750
 game addresses of the last dlc here 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.359
 like that you have something under 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.189
 the eyes a little video for you 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.570
 announce two three little things that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.699
 are happening to me 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.960
 which made me good anyway 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.590
 you know it youtube 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.120
 I really slowed the dose I 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.590
 damn really calm down the thing and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.489
 all because because because 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.540
 now I do a lot of other things 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.969
 and youtube and youtube in the final youtube 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.559
 in the end it's something that is a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.760
 little bit passed for me even though I 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.700
 continue it always makes me very 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.750
 pleasure to offer you some videos 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.730
 basically actually on trials 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.170
 or on hairston from time to time and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.690
 even on heroes of the storm it makes me 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.100
 very pleased to offer you 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.870
 I do a lot of play 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.430
 diverse and varied because all that 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.519
 is done is that it gives me everything 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.190
 simply kind even if they are good and 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.180
 all that attracts me more than that after 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.680
 there is something that I love 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.630
 assassin's creed where you know it but 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.009
 it does not come out all the same every 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.630
 four mornings so to propose you 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.950
 videos above is not necessarily the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.070
 easiest thing to find 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.680
 always is it that right now I'm doing 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.270
 minus two videos and that's why 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.680
 that's why it actually suits me 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.299
 to offer you some videos that 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.430
 I did on trials where I propose you 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.299
 just a little track did comment on this 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.740
 that I was doing on my next 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.360
 secondary at the time new match n 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.130
 secondary now but nothing else 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.080
 was more than good that it dates a little bit 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.640
 of water 1 but it suits me because I 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.960
 continue to offer you some tips 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.960
 you have a little bit of content like 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.940
 that my chain does not really die 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.770
 if for a few while 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.119
 a few short moments but he 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.259
 happens that I do not really come out 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.330
 a lot of videos 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.000
 why because I am currently 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.220
 in the process of developing which I took 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.750
 an apartment in toulouse 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.369
 and then and then it's more bruno so 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.299
 there i am fitting i do not know when it's 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.549
 what will come out this video is what she 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.110
 withdraws before during or two three 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.060
 days later I do not know I'm moving on 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.619
 Saturday 21 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.659
 I have the keys the day before I have them 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.479
 keys on friday 20 i am in wood of 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.190
 ferries obviously so it is so 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.450
 everything is done it's a little bit 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.680
 galley at the level of papers and my 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.150
 chain has everything you need to do so 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.470
 I do not necessarily have time for you 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.600
 propose videos in any case what 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.459
 is pretty cool to me is that I 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.020
 am going to hit me a good big fiber to 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.020
 500 mega 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.730
 at the apartment so it'll be mega cool 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.900
 so if I can time stream why 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.850
 nothing but stone glass 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.040
 now I could so that's me 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.160
 is super fun and then to know 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.180
 a little trick is that I'm going 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.670
 return to school gendarmerie le en 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.530
 principle on April 7th since I managed 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.660
 I passed the contest and so he so 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.700
 in the end 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.170
 in the end I go back to school I would have 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.700
 a lot of free weekend is not 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.890
 maybe not all at the beginning ie 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.390
 that roughly the month of April is going to be a 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.280
 little video level shorts even though I'm going 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.510
 to prepare I'm going to do some stuff 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.760
 and everything but I could not react 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.110
 following some comments or other 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.600
 since I would not necessarily have the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.010
 opportunity to answer then 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.190
 normally play every weekend on 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.920
 no no it will go and then I will be I 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.970
 would be affected affected I do not know where 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.440
 according to my ranking so in the end 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.670
 in the end it's pretty bad there is not bad 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.200
 things that thing which link 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.220
 for me and all who this fund who 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.560
 often their orders 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.430
 so it's really nice but I 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.260
 wanted to keep you informed 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.030
 because john's got it 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.850
 interested to know 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.830
 and then and then I think you 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.300
 deserve to know why with a less 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.890
 two videos for those who continue to 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.060
 follow a little bit what I do not do 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.550
 what they say they continue to 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.350
 to suffer from anything even if it has a lot 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.400
 reduced it's true you do not have to 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.480
 not to hide it but hey it's not 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.820
 it's not really something that 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.250
 embarrassment that does not even honestly do that to me 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.720
 seems girl does not really do that 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.550
 do not really bother me in the sense that 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.660
 I continue to please some 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.370
 people and I actually do it from 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.310
 let's eat for my own pleasure it's 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.020
 for that even by doing doing 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.520
 what am I going to do the gendarmerie while 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.050
 that I will still continue to you 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.700
 propose 3.2 three tinkers 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.890
 because because it makes me happy 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.850
 to continue to maintain this chain 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.650
 Youtube 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.640
 and then and then here I am simply 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.700
 think I've pretty much said everything 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.459
 people it was really for you 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.709
 explain a little bit about the situation 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.110
 in passing this dlc does this game of addressed 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.450
 really cool I ranked 20th the 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.310
 people so I was pretty enough enough 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.020
 glad why do not I have 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.480
 mega mega through either because 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.120
 because he loved braid and proud at 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.410
 final it's super disturbing super 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.670
 boring to redo every time 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.170
 but see at least you have some 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.850
 thing on the eyes and it's pretty cool 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.910
 but this is so demo tell me what 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.440
 you think in any case of I know that 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.140
 you have pretty much to appreciate these the 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.310
 video have commented that I did on 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.280
 did it first anyway that I 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.990
 done on on trials it's just a 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.130
 track like that in the end so I speak I 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.720
 think it can be nice if I you 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.970
 find extreme tracks nice or nem 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.470
 ninja level 1 same level 2 why not 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.150
 if I will succeed not too many mistakes and 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.230
 that they are cool I think it can 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.910
 be nice for you to watch them 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.890
 and then at least it continues as I 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.990
 tell them to maintain the 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.010
 youtube channel with trial so it's 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.140
 still a game that suits me 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.240
 so why not 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.000
 simply continue why is 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.050
 what I do not do call of may 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.120
 chain all because I just had more 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.700
 want like me the deal and even if they 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.080
 are good for many but me it's me 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.250
 tries too much and where right now I 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.070
 plays a lot hairston and pink garlic 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.900
 especially at Heroes of the Storm and Co. 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.220
 it's always nice here I hope that 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.720
 this video made you happy I 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.640
 wanted to keep you informed it was 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.410
