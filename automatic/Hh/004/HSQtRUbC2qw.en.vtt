00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
imagine that if you did they would be

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.149 
imagine that if you did they would be
expected<00:02:51.359> unexpected<00:02:51.629> consequences<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.769> so

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
expected unexpected consequences and so

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.610 
expected unexpected consequences and so
forth<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.579> so<00:02:53.670> on<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.599> it's<00:02:55.019> actually<00:02:55.200> mesh

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
forth and so on so it's actually mesh

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.520 
forth and so on so it's actually mesh
really<00:02:56.040> well<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:57.209> I'm<00:02:57.359> really<00:02:58.290> really

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
I think they've said they're finishing

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.349 
I think they've said they're finishing
off<00:03:06.840> walking<00:03:07.409> dead<00:03:07.650> season<00:03:07.859> 2<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.359> they're

going to carry on with wolf among us so

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.149 
going to carry on with wolf among us so
I<00:03:11.280> think<00:03:11.579> we<00:03:11.730> were<00:03:11.819> expecting<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.389> like<00:03:12.540> late

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
I think we were expecting it like late

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.280 
I think we were expecting it like late
fall<00:03:14.159> I<00:03:14.579> think<00:03:15.510> was<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.629> sort<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:15.989> time<00:03:16.139> they

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
fall I think was the sort of time they

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.080 
fall I think was the sort of time they
were<00:03:16.379> aiming<00:03:16.590> for<00:03:16.949> but<00:03:17.430> with<00:03:17.669> telltale

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
were aiming for but with telltale

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.430 
were aiming for but with telltale
there's<00:03:18.299> usually<00:03:18.449> no<00:03:18.810> official<00:03:19.230> release<00:03:19.410> date

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
there's usually no official release date

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.430 
there's usually no official release date
so<00:03:20.010> all<00:03:20.669> I'd<00:03:20.879> say<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.269> keep<00:03:22.139> your<00:03:22.230> eyes<00:03:22.410> on
