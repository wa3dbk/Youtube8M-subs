00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
a dollar anymore the answer is no it's

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.080 
a dollar anymore the answer is no it's
not<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:48.540> silver<00:03:49.540> dollar<00:03:49.900> is<00:03:50.310> worth<00:03:51.310> 12<00:03:51.730> times

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.840 
not a silver dollar is worth 12 times
and<00:03:52.360> maybe<00:03:52.480> more<00:03:52.840> than<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:54.010> paper<00:03:54.220> dollar<00:03:54.550> and

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
and maybe more than the paper dollar and

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.270 
and maybe more than the paper dollar and
of<00:03:55.720> course<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.990> is<00:03:56.320> changing<00:03:56.770> dramatically

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
of course that is changing dramatically

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.820 
of course that is changing dramatically
as<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:58.030> dollar<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.660> paper<00:03:58.900> dollar<00:03:59.200> continues

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
as the dollar the paper dollar continues

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.610 
as the dollar the paper dollar continues
to<00:03:59.980> lose<00:04:00.130> its<00:04:00.370> value<00:04:01.740> its<00:04:02.740> causes<00:04:03.280> inflation

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
to lose its value its causes inflation

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.710 
to lose its value its causes inflation

anybody the power to inflate he will now
you<00:05:29.560> go<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:29.860> dictionary<00:05:30.340> today<00:05:30.729> and<00:05:30.940> you
