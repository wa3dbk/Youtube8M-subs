pretty thick and heavy you're gonna have
to<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:35.120> initially<00:00:36.120> get<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> batter<00:00:36.630> into

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930

to just initially get the batter into
the<00:00:37.079> pan<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.739> then<00:00:37.829> we'll<00:00:38.010> work<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.399> around

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the pan and then we'll work it around

the pan and then we'll work it around
with<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> spatula<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:39.809> bit<00:00:39.930> later<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.579> I'm

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
with a spatula a little bit later so I'm

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.490 
with a spatula a little bit later so I'm
just<00:00:41.879> trying<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.300> disperse<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.079> pretty

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
just trying to disperse this pretty

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:54.800 
just trying to disperse this pretty
evenly<00:00:43.950> here

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.010 

one<00:00:55.810> last<00:00:56.110> little<00:00:56.470> bit<00:00:56.680> of<00:00:56.710> batter<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.780> bundt

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
one last little bit of batter the bundt

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.600 
one last little bit of batter the bundt
pan<00:00:59.230> that<00:00:59.410> we're<00:00:59.530> baking<00:00:59.740> with<00:01:00.070> today<00:01:00.370> is

pan that we're baking with today is

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.730 
pan that we're baking with today is
called<00:01:00.880> the<00:01:01.060> anniversary<00:01:01.930> bundt<00:01:02.200> pan<00:01:02.440> and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
called the anniversary bundt pan and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.210 
called the anniversary bundt pan and
this<00:01:03.160> actually<00:01:03.610> holds<00:01:03.850> up<00:01:04.300> to<00:01:04.480> a<00:01:04.510> 15<00:01:06.690> cupcake

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
this actually holds up to a 15 cupcake

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.490 
this actually holds up to a 15 cupcake
typical<00:01:09.220> cake<00:01:09.430> mixes<00:01:09.850> or<00:01:10.570> bundt<00:01:10.930> recipes<00:01:11.380> are

typical cake mixes or bundt recipes are

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.250 
typical cake mixes or bundt recipes are
going<00:01:11.620> to<00:01:11.680> be<00:01:11.800> 10<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.280> 12<00:01:12.340> this<00:01:13.240> one<00:01:13.450> has<00:01:13.630> extra

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
going to be 10 to 12 this one has extra

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.650 
going to be 10 to 12 this one has extra
high<00:01:14.410> sides<00:01:14.770> on<00:01:15.040> it<00:01:15.070> so<00:01:15.490> your<00:01:16.180> cake<00:01:16.420> gets

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
high sides on it so your cake gets

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.770 
high sides on it so your cake gets
taller<00:01:16.960> if<00:01:17.260> you<00:01:17.410> use<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.620> bigger<00:01:17.860> recipe<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
taller if you use a bigger recipe you

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.780 
taller if you use a bigger recipe you
never<00:01:20.050> want<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.470> fill<00:01:20.650> a<00:01:20.680> bundt<00:01:21.010> pan<00:01:21.280> more<00:01:21.610> than

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
never want to fill a bundt pan more than

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.660 
never want to fill a bundt pan more than
about<00:01:21.970> 3/4<00:01:22.780> from<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.140> top<00:01:23.380> because<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.400> cake

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
about 3/4 from the top because the cake

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.490 
about 3/4 from the top because the cake
does<00:01:24.940> expand<00:01:25.420> as<00:01:25.630> you're<00:01:25.750> cooking<00:01:26.080> it<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.380> you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
does expand as you're cooking it and you

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.350 
does expand as you're cooking it and you
definitely<00:01:26.800> don't<00:01:27.280> want<00:01:27.580> it<00:01:27.670> coming<00:01:27.880> up<00:01:28.150> and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
definitely don't want it coming up and

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.820 
definitely don't want it coming up and
over<00:01:28.510> the<00:01:28.630> sides<00:01:28.869> in<00:01:29.110> your<00:01:29.229> oven<00:01:29.440> or<00:01:29.710> you're

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
over the sides in your oven or you're

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.490 
over the sides in your oven or you're
gonna<00:01:29.950> have<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.160> mess<00:01:30.430> so<00:01:31.270> what<00:01:31.930> I'm<00:01:32.050> doing<00:01:32.350> here

gonna have a mess so what I'm doing here
now<00:01:32.680> is<00:01:32.710> I'm<00:01:33.130> just<00:01:33.160> kind<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.580> spreading<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.060> out

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180

intricately detailed design to it

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.360 
intricately detailed design to it
because<00:02:29.350> sometimes<00:02:29.560> there'll<00:02:29.950> be<00:02:29.980> little

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
because sometimes there'll be little

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.309 
because sometimes there'll be little
pockets<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.180> don't<00:02:31.510> get<00:02:31.750> batter<00:02:32.050> down

pockets that don't get batter down
inside<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.950> them<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:33.550> if<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.670> want<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.090> cake

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
design to turn out perfectly you need to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.050 
design to turn out perfectly you need to
hit<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.340> like<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:37.200> one<00:02:38.200> other<00:02:38.380> little<00:02:38.620> tip

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
hit it like that one other little tip

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.270 
hit it like that one other little tip
sometimes<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:40.930> helpful<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.650> get<00:02:42.100> the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
sometimes that is helpful is to get the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.170 
sometimes that is helpful is to get the
batter<00:02:42.780> started<00:02:43.780> up<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.260> edges<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.800> pan

batter started up the edges of the pan
sometimes<00:02:46.180> bundt<00:02:46.540> cakes<00:02:46.840> will<00:02:47.590> come<00:02:47.800> out

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
sometimes bundt cakes will come out

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.040 
sometimes bundt cakes will come out

looking a little bit flat and they

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.839 
looking a little bit flat and they
didn't<00:02:50.380> start<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.709> creep<00:02:51.069> up<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.310> edges<00:02:51.760> of
