acts of right feature so happens is the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.520 
acts of right feature so happens is the
key<00:03:39.609> that<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:39.790> press<00:03:40.060> just<00:03:40.269> comes<00:03:40.570> on<00:03:40.780> when

looks<00:03:51.370> very<00:03:51.430> nice<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.959> next<00:03:53.379> function<00:03:53.739> is<00:03:53.890> the

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
looks very nice the next function is the

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.240 
looks very nice the next function is the
same<00:03:54.280> as<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.489> last<00:03:55.060> function<00:03:55.269> but<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.590> has<00:03:57.219> a

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
same as the last function but it has a

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.089 
same as the last function but it has a
delay<00:03:57.579> on<00:03:57.700> it<00:03:57.849> so<00:03:58.359> you<00:03:58.450> press<00:03:58.599> it<00:03:58.659> and<00:03:59.099> then

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
delay on it so you press it and then

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:09.990 
delay on it so you press it and then
fades<00:04:00.459> out

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.140

that looks really good actually and then

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.100 
that looks really good actually and then
the<00:04:14.600> last<00:04:14.630> function<00:04:15.110> is<00:04:15.470> just<00:04:16.130> wsd<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.110> arrow

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
the last function is just wsd and arrow

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.929 
the last function is just wsd and arrow
keys

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:20.939 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:25.050 

and<00:04:21.939> we'll<00:04:22.120> move<00:04:22.539> on<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.550> micro<00:04:24.550> ones<00:04:24.759> so

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
and we'll move on to the micro ones so

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:33.089 
and we'll move on to the micro ones so
you<00:04:25.150> hold<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.419> down<00:04:26.909> and<00:04:27.909> then<00:04:31.349> record<00:04:32.349> I<00:04:32.650> mean

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
you hold it down and then record I mean

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.399 
you hold it down and then record I mean
you<00:04:33.610> select<00:04:34.090> which<00:04:34.240> ones<00:04:34.419> you<00:04:34.509> want<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:34.810> then
