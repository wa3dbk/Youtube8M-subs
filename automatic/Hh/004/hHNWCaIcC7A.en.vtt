00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
things are adjustable now I can go in

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.529 
things are adjustable now I can go in
and<00:02:07.860> out<00:02:07.950> wherever<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.879> want<00:02:09.090> these<00:02:09.270> things

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
because they're total

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.770 
because they're total
adjustable<00:02:10.810> they're<00:02:12.000> not<00:02:13.000> actually<00:02:13.210> fixed<00:02:13.690> to

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
adjustable they're not actually fixed to

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.630 
adjustable they're not actually fixed to
the<00:02:13.810> frame<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.710> none<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.130> frame<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.460> glued

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640
