over in the Canary Islands a little bit
earlier<00:00:37.220> last<00:00:37.760> year<00:00:38.000> it<00:00:38.090> was<00:00:38.180> an<00:00:38.270> early

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
bike over here in the states now they've

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.410 
bike over here in the states now they've
done<00:00:43.010> a<00:00:43.070> couple<00:00:43.250> little<00:00:43.460> refinements<00:00:44.059> since

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
done a couple little refinements since

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.640 
done a couple little refinements since
then<00:00:44.629> they<00:00:44.750> made<00:00:44.900> it<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:45.019> little<00:00:45.080> bit<00:00:45.320> easier<00:00:45.590> to

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
then they made it a little bit easier to

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.369 
then they made it a little bit easier to
start<00:00:45.980> which<00:00:46.129> is<00:00:46.160> one<00:00:46.430> of<00:00:46.460> our<00:00:46.610> complaints

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
start which is one of our complaints

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.810 
start which is one of our complaints
it's<00:00:48.379> actually<00:00:49.070> when<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.340> figure<00:00:49.610> it<00:00:49.699> out

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
it's actually when you figure it out

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.700 
it's actually when you figure it out
just<00:00:50.059> like<00:00:50.330> older<00:00:50.930> four-strokes<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.559> can

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
just like older four-strokes you can

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.229 
just like older four-strokes you can
start<00:00:51.949> it<00:00:52.040> right<00:00:52.160> up<00:00:52.370> but<00:00:52.640> if<00:00:53.030> you're<00:00:53.180> just

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
start it right up but if you're just

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.240 
start it right up but if you're just
going<00:00:53.420> to<00:00:53.510> take<00:00:53.839> stabs<00:00:54.140> at<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.559> Kickstarter

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.070 
going to take stabs at the Kickstarter
it<00:00:55.670> can<00:00:55.790> be<00:00:55.910> a<00:00:55.940> little<00:00:56.059> tough<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:56.629> really<00:00:56.960> my

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
it can be a little tough and really my

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.960 
it can be a little tough and really my
only<00:00:57.229> other<00:00:57.440> complaint<00:00:57.890> about<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.519> bike<00:00:58.699> is

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
only other complaint about the bike is

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.219 
only other complaint about the bike is
that<00:00:59.000> it<00:00:59.809> kind<00:01:00.530> of<00:01:00.589> has<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:00.769> like<00:01:01.309> on<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.549> lower

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
that it kind of has a like on the lower

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.899 
that it kind of has a like on the lower
the<00:01:03.229> lower<00:01:03.409> mid-range<00:01:03.799> it's<00:01:04.430> not<00:01:04.670> real

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
the lower mid-range it's not real

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.760 
the lower mid-range it's not real
responsive<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:06.049> got<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.290> ride<00:01:06.440> it<00:01:06.560> kind<00:01:06.740> of

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
responsive you got to ride it kind of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.490 
responsive you got to ride it kind of
above<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.250> but<00:01:07.850> it's<00:01:08.510> where<00:01:08.780> if<00:01:09.110> you're<00:01:09.350> on

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
above that but it's where if you're on

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.020 
above that but it's where if you're on
the<00:01:09.590> motocross<00:01:09.950> track<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.610> you're<00:01:10.700> at<00:01:10.850> least

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
the motocross track and you're at least

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.490 
the motocross track and you're at least
a<00:01:11.180> novice<00:01:11.510> you're<00:01:11.690> going<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.869> be<00:01:11.960> riding<00:01:12.170> above

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
a novice you're going to be riding above

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.719 
a novice you're going to be riding above
that<00:01:12.650> part<00:01:12.920> anyway<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.490> don't<00:01:13.640> really

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
that part anyway so you don't really

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.090 
that part anyway so you don't really
have<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:14.060> worry<00:01:14.240> about<00:01:14.360> it<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:15.470> then<00:01:15.680> once<00:01:15.950> you

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
have to worry about it and then once you

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.890 
have to worry about it and then once you
once<00:01:16.400> you<00:01:16.520> feel<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.119> it<00:01:17.210> doesn't<00:01:17.420> respond

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
once you feel that it doesn't respond

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.480 
once you feel that it doesn't respond
that<00:01:18.080> well<00:01:18.260> you<00:01:18.680> just<00:01:18.860> tend<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.159> ride<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.430> a

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
that well you just tend to ride it a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.310 
that well you just tend to ride it a
little<00:01:19.640> high<00:01:19.820> rpm<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:20.479> then<00:01:20.840> from<00:01:21.080> there<00:01:21.290> on

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
little high rpm and then from there on

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.130 
little high rpm and then from there on
the<00:01:21.799> powers<00:01:22.189> like<00:01:22.549> it's<00:01:22.939> really<00:01:23.479> smooth<00:01:23.810> it

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
the powers like it's really smooth it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.440 
the powers like it's really smooth it
uses<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.159> power<00:01:25.189> well<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:25.909> takes<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.240> long<00:01:26.420> time

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
uses the power well it takes a long time

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.419 
uses the power well it takes a long time
to<00:01:26.689> pull<00:01:26.990> through<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.290> revs<00:01:27.500> which<00:01:28.070> is<00:01:28.250> not

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
to pull through the revs which is not

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.249 
to pull through the revs which is not
meaning<00:01:29.030> it's<00:01:29.179> not<00:01:29.359> responsive<00:01:29.960> it's<00:01:30.079> just

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
meaning it's not responsive it's just

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.510 
meaning it's not responsive it's just
that<00:01:30.409> it's<00:01:30.530> actually<00:01:30.859> working<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.369> getting

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
that it's actually working and getting

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.440 
that it's actually working and getting
traction<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.689> overall<00:01:33.439> it<00:01:34.009> felt<00:01:34.670> really<00:01:34.850> good

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
traction and overall it felt really good

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.810 
traction and overall it felt really good
it<00:01:35.960> doesn't<00:01:36.350> feel<00:01:36.560> fast<00:01:36.890> but<00:01:37.310> it's<00:01:37.429> moving<00:01:37.579> you

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
it doesn't feel fast but it's moving you

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.919 
it doesn't feel fast but it's moving you
around<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.119> track<00:01:38.329> at<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.539> pretty<00:01:38.750> good<00:01:38.869> speed

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
around the track at a pretty good speed

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.310 
around the track at a pretty good speed
it's<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:40.009> kind<00:01:40.189> of<00:01:40.249> motor<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.729> makes<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.090> so

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
it's the kind of motor that makes it so

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.719 
it's the kind of motor that makes it so
you<00:01:42.320> can<00:01:42.409> concentrate<00:01:42.799> on<00:01:42.979> your<00:01:43.219> lap<00:01:43.369> times

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
you can concentrate on your lap times

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.279 
you can concentrate on your lap times
and<00:01:44.030> you're<00:01:44.119> not<00:01:44.240> having<00:01:44.539> to<00:01:44.600> fight<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:45.170> know

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
and you're not having to fight you know

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:46.480 
and you're not having to fight you know
the<00:01:45.380> power<00:01:45.590> delivery<00:01:46.009> or<00:01:46.070> anything

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
the power delivery or anything

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.789 
the power delivery or anything
suspension<00:01:47.390> wise<00:01:47.570> it's<00:01:47.810> got<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.200> new<00:01:48.469> Kayaba

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
suspension wise it's got the new Kayaba

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.899 
suspension wise it's got the new Kayaba
fork<00:01:49.219> in<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.700> sack<00:01:49.969> shock<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:51.249> it's<00:01:52.249> it's

fork in the sack shock and it's it's

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.209 
fork in the sack shock and it's it's
pretty<00:01:53.240> good<00:01:53.359> you<00:01:53.539> know<00:01:53.600> usually<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.829> Huskies

pretty good you know usually the Huskies
have<00:01:55.340> always<00:01:55.490> been<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:55.819> little<00:01:56.030> funny<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.630> this
