a supercharger this happens to be a
centrifugal<00:00:23.730> supercharger<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
centrifugal supercharger and the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.890 
centrifugal supercharger and the
installation<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.039> very<00:00:26.130> invasive<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.720> you

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
installation is very invasive if you

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.060 
installation is very invasive if you
look<00:00:28.050> at<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> layout<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.740> engine

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
look at the layout of this engine

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.230 
look at the layout of this engine
compartment<00:00:29.550> you'll<00:00:29.670> see<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.970> they<00:00:30.060> move

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
compartment you'll see that they move

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.520 
compartment you'll see that they move
the<00:00:30.359> battery<00:00:30.650> cut<00:00:31.650> all<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> heat<00:00:32.040> shields<00:00:32.430> out

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
the battery cut all the heat shields out

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.569 
the battery cut all the heat shields out
install<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.710> large<00:00:34.920> intercooler

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
install this large intercooler

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.150 
install this large intercooler
and<00:00:35.809> cut<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> core<00:00:37.140> support<00:00:37.559> accordingly

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and cut the core support accordingly

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.229 
and cut the core support accordingly
it's<00:00:39.000> very<00:00:39.270> invasive<00:00:40.160> in<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.399> end<00:00:41.550> you're

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
it's very invasive in the end you're

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.869 
it's very invasive in the end you're
picking<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:42.930> maybe<00:00:43.260> 40<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.160> 50%<00:00:44.610> more

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
picking up maybe 40 to 50% more

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.950 
picking up maybe 40 to 50% more
horsepower<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.129> some<00:00:47.129> more<00:00:47.280> torque<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.629> is

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
horsepower and some more torque but is

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.229 
horsepower and some more torque but is
it<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.890> enough<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> Jeep<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.059> weighs

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
it really enough for a Jeep that weighs

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.990 
it really enough for a Jeep that weighs
7,000<00:00:52.020> pounds<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:53.039> has<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.460> work<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.850> high

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
7,000 pounds that has to work at high

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.709 
7,000 pounds that has to work at high
altitude<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.829> mountain<00:00:56.370> passes<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
altitude on on mountain passes and for a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.439 
altitude on on mountain passes and for a
lot<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.289> lot<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> owners<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
lot for a lot of owners it's not so the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.260 
lot for a lot of owners it's not so the
true<00:01:00.600> solution<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.520> to<00:01:02.520> go<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.820> larger

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
true solution is to go to a larger

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.140 
true solution is to go to a larger
displacement<00:01:03.660> v8<00:01:04.199> engine<00:01:04.640> v8<00:01:05.640> engines<00:01:06.000> with

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
displacement v8 engine v8 engines with

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270 
displacement v8 engine v8 engines with
larger<00:01:06.450> displacement<00:01:06.920> inherently<00:01:07.920> are<00:01:08.070> more

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
larger displacement inherently are more

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.580 
larger displacement inherently are more
efficient<00:01:08.700> under<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.689> heavy<00:01:09.960> load<00:01:10.229> then<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
efficient under a heavy load then a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.270 
efficient under a heavy load then a
smaller<00:01:10.920> engine<00:01:11.460> would<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:13.100> turning<00:01:14.100> at

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
smaller engine would be turning at

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.090 
smaller engine would be turning at
higher<00:01:14.430> rpms<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.439> we're<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> remove

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
higher rpms so we're going to remove

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.260 
higher rpms so we're going to remove
this<00:01:17.960> supercharger<00:01:18.960> system<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.820> install<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
this supercharger system and install a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
this supercharger system and install a
6.2<00:01:22.140> liter<00:01:22.470> v8<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:24.290> one<00:01:25.290> part<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> process

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
6.2 liter v8 and one part of the process

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.830 
6.2 liter v8 and one part of the process
is<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> restore<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.509> vehicle

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
is going to be to restore the vehicle

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.170 
is going to be to restore the vehicle
back<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.259> way<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.380> was<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:30.030> may

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
back to the way it was and that may

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.520 
back to the way it was and that may
sound<00:01:30.420> odd<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.960> we're<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.409> an

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
sound odd that we're going to do an

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.990 
sound odd that we're going to do an
engine<00:01:31.799> swap<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.220> actually<00:01:32.520> bring<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> Jeep

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
engine swap and actually bring the Jeep

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
engine swap and actually bring the Jeep
back<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.420> its<00:01:33.600> stock<00:01:33.780> condition

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
back to its stock condition

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.039 
back to its stock condition
but<00:01:35.100> that's<00:01:35.250> actually<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.670> case<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.240> it's

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
but that's actually the case that it's

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.749 
but that's actually the case that it's
always<00:01:37.350> better<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.920> lead<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> vehicle<00:01:38.579> as

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
always better to lead the vehicle as

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
always better to lead the vehicle as
original<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.540> possible<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.320> least

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
original as possible with the least

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
original as possible with the least
amount<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.799> modifications<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.549> possible

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
amount of modifications as possible

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.660 
amount of modifications as possible
because<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.259> manufacturer<00:01:43.890> did<00:01:44.070> design<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
because the manufacturer did design it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.170 
because the manufacturer did design it
to<00:01:44.700> operate<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.450> condition<00:01:47.000> things<00:01:48.000> like

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to operate in that condition things like

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.410 
to operate in that condition things like
heat<00:01:48.420> shielding<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.939> actually<00:01:51.149> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
heat shielding this this is actually a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.929 
heat shielding this this is actually a
module<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.170> called<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> gateway<00:01:52.890> module<00:01:53.820> or

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
module it's called the gateway module or

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
module it's called the gateway module or
the<00:01:53.970> total<00:01:54.659> integrated<00:01:54.899> power<00:01:55.140> module<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the total integrated power module and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.190 
the total integrated power module and
there's<00:01:56.520> there's<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> computer<00:01:57.630> inside<00:01:57.960> this

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
there's there's a computer inside this

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.380 
there's there's a computer inside this
at<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> bottom<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.579> now<00:01:59.700> exposed<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
at the bottom that is now exposed to

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.959 
at the bottom that is now exposed to
heat<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.979> when<00:02:01.979> exposed<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.490> heat<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:02.850> have

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
heat and when exposed to heat they have

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.590 
heat and when exposed to heat they have
a<00:02:03.000> high<00:02:03.320> failure<00:02:04.320> rate<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:06.119> want<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> put

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
a high failure rate so we want to put

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.680 
a high failure rate so we want to put
the<00:02:06.689> original<00:02:06.780> heat<00:02:07.200> shields<00:02:07.500> back<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.860> place

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
the original heat shields back in place
