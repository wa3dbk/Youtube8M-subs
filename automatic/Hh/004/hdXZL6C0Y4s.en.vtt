the power locks these are definitely

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.560 
the power locks these are definitely
much<00:02:02.280> better<00:02:02.310> compared<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.119> some<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.420> your

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
much better compared to some of your

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.840 
much better compared to some of your
lower<00:02:03.810> end<00:02:04.079> stuff<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.189> stitching<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.610> it's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
lower end stuff the stitching on it's

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.059 
lower end stuff the stitching on it's
still<00:02:06.259> okay<00:02:07.259> there<00:02:07.560> can<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.740> some

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
still okay there can be some

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.369 
still okay there can be some
improvements<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.700> stitching<00:02:09.270> again<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.229> think

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
improvements in stitching again I think

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.589 
improvements in stitching again I think
they<00:02:10.560> mass-produced<00:02:11.160> these<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.330> quality

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
they mass-produced these so the quality

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.390 
they mass-produced these so the quality

has a very nice broken-in feel so the
glove<00:03:18.709> is<00:03:18.859> not<00:03:19.010> stiff<00:03:19.370> at<00:03:19.489> all<00:03:19.609> I<00:03:19.940> like<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.870> a

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
glove is not stiff at all I like that a

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.710 
glove is not stiff at all I like that a
lot<00:03:21.019> about<00:03:21.379> that<00:03:21.669> it<00:03:22.669> does<00:03:22.849> does<00:03:23.389> have<00:03:23.569> good

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
lot about that it does does have good

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.759 
lot about that it does does have good
thumb<00:03:23.930> positioning<00:03:25.180> good<00:03:26.180> wrist<00:03:26.389> protection

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
thumb positioning good wrist protection

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.530 
thumb positioning good wrist protection
if<00:03:27.769> you<00:03:27.919> do<00:03:28.069> want<00:03:28.489> more<00:03:28.790> risk<00:03:29.000> protection<00:03:29.150> or

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
if you do want more risk protection or

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.089 
if you do want more risk protection or
for<00:03:29.569> using<00:03:29.930> these<00:03:29.989> gloves<00:03:30.199> primarily<00:03:30.799> for

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
for using these gloves primarily for

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.159 
for using these gloves primarily for
sparring<00:03:31.480> then<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.540> would<00:03:32.690> probably<00:03:32.930> recommend

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
sparring then I would probably recommend

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.199 
sparring then I would probably recommend
getting<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.739> lace-up<00:03:34.459> versions<00:03:34.790> but<00:03:35.000> these

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
getting the lace-up versions but these

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.539 
getting the lace-up versions but these
these<00:03:35.810> velcro<00:03:36.349> versions<00:03:36.829> are<00:03:36.949> nice<00:03:37.129> if<00:03:37.340> you're

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
these velcro versions are nice if you're

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.059 
these velcro versions are nice if you're
using<00:03:37.730> it<00:03:37.940> for<00:03:37.970> both<00:03:38.290> sparring<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.470> bag<00:03:39.799> work

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
using it for both sparring and bag work

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.289 
using it for both sparring and bag work
and<00:03:40.250> mitt<00:03:40.400> work<00:03:40.579> so<00:03:40.760> it's<00:03:40.909> a<00:03:40.940> good<00:03:41.090> all-around

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
and mitt work so it's a good all-around

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.599 
and mitt work so it's a good all-around
glove<00:03:41.870> again<00:03:42.290> it's<00:03:42.620> compact<00:03:43.099> so<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.400> doesn't

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
glove again it's compact so it doesn't

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.670 
glove again it's compact so it doesn't
feel<00:03:43.699> too<00:03:44.090> bulky<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:45.049> when<00:03:45.169> you<00:03:45.260> put<00:03:45.409> it<00:03:45.500> up<00:03:45.590> to

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
feel too bulky so when you put it up to

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.319 
feel too bulky so when you put it up to
your<00:03:45.769> face<00:03:45.979> you<00:03:46.040> can<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:46.819> can<00:03:46.970> really<00:03:47.060> tuck

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
your face you can you can really tuck

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.879 
your face you can you can really tuck
your<00:03:47.479> elbows<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.109> it<00:03:48.590> doesn't<00:03:48.709> feel

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
your elbows in and it doesn't feel

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.599 
your elbows in and it doesn't feel
uncomfortable<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:51.199> punching<00:03:51.650> part

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
uncomfortable the the punching part

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.460 
uncomfortable the the punching part
about<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.970> when<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.180> hitting<00:03:53.510> making<00:03:54.019> contact

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
about it when you hitting making contact

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.000 
about it when you hitting making contact
it<00:03:54.949> makes<00:03:55.159> a<00:03:55.250> good<00:03:55.400> pop<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:56.690> foam<00:03:57.650> is<00:03:57.799> probably

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
it makes a good pop the foam is probably

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.699 
it makes a good pop the foam is probably
a<00:03:58.069> layered<00:03:58.310> foam<00:03:58.669> I<00:03:58.909> can't<00:03:59.229> really<00:04:00.229> tell<00:04:00.530> by

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
a layered foam I can't really tell by

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.649 
a layered foam I can't really tell by
pushing<00:04:00.979> down<00:04:01.099> on<00:04:01.459> it<00:04:01.609> it's<00:04:01.819> not<00:04:01.879> too<00:04:02.150> soft<00:04:02.419> not

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
pushing down on it it's not too soft not

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.240 
pushing down on it it's not too soft not
too<00:04:02.720> firm<00:04:03.109> so<00:04:03.739> it's<00:04:03.859> kind<00:04:04.010> of<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.129> good

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
too firm so it's kind of a good

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.580 
too firm so it's kind of a good
compromise<00:04:04.639> between<00:04:04.909> both<00:04:05.389> it<00:04:06.199> does<00:04:06.349> offer

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
compromise between both it does offer

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.050 
compromise between both it does offer
great<00:04:06.919> protection<00:04:07.069> so<00:04:07.639> when<00:04:07.760> you're<00:04:07.909> hitting

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
great protection so when you're hitting

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.420 
great protection so when you're hitting
the<00:04:08.209> bag<00:04:08.419> you<00:04:09.379> don't<00:04:09.530> get<00:04:09.620> sore<00:04:09.889> knuckles<00:04:10.280> or

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
the bag you don't get sore knuckles or

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.860 
the bag you don't get sore knuckles or
your<00:04:10.519> wrist<00:04:10.729> doesn't<00:04:11.030> get<00:04:11.120> really<00:04:11.329> sore<00:04:11.540> or

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
your wrist doesn't get really sore or

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.390 
your wrist doesn't get really sore or
shedding<00:04:12.139> or<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.680> don't<00:04:12.769> get<00:04:12.919> any<00:04:13.040> tennis

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
shedding or you don't get any tennis

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.309 
shedding or you don't get any tennis
elbow<00:04:13.519> a<00:04:13.699> lot<00:04:13.879> of<00:04:13.970> time<00:04:14.120> I<00:04:14.449> know<00:04:14.930> there's<00:04:15.139> a<00:04:15.169> lot

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
elbow a lot of time I know there's a lot

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.689 
elbow a lot of time I know there's a lot
of<00:04:15.409> guys<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.650> talk<00:04:15.889> to<00:04:16.070> sometimes<00:04:16.489> when<00:04:16.609> they

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
of guys I talk to sometimes when they

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:17.949 
of guys I talk to sometimes when they
hit<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:16.909> bag<00:04:17.120> they<00:04:17.299> end<00:04:17.570> up<00:04:17.659> getting

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
hit the bag they end up getting

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.800 
hit the bag they end up getting
tendonitis<00:04:18.489> because<00:04:19.489> all<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.120> impact<00:04:20.510> over

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
tendonitis because all the impact over

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.120 
tendonitis because all the impact over
years<00:04:21.019> ends<00:04:21.320> up<00:04:21.410> putting<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.709> lot<00:04:21.859> of<00:04:21.889> pressure

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
years ends up putting a lot of pressure

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.520 
years ends up putting a lot of pressure
on<00:04:22.250> their<00:04:22.430> elbow<00:04:22.730> for<00:04:23.660> making<00:04:23.900> impact<00:04:24.169> so<00:04:24.380> this

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
on their elbow for making impact so this

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.100 
on their elbow for making impact so this
glove<00:04:24.770> is<00:04:24.800> really<00:04:25.070> nice<00:04:25.250> in<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.550> respect<00:04:26.110> one

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
glove is really nice in that respect one

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.690 
glove is really nice in that respect one
thing<00:04:27.260> I<00:04:27.320> also<00:04:27.470> noticed<00:04:27.830> with<00:04:28.250> some<00:04:28.550> of<00:04:28.639> the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
thing I also noticed with some of the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.370 
thing I also noticed with some of the
ever<00:04:28.850> glass<00:04:29.120> gloves<00:04:29.450> is<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.780> they<00:04:29.930> tend<00:04:30.200> to

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
ever glass gloves is that they tend to

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.650 
ever glass gloves is that they tend to
curve<00:04:30.800> downwards<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.430> little<00:04:31.639> bit<00:04:31.790> and<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.419> think

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
curve downwards a little bit and I think

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.060 
curve downwards a little bit and I think
the<00:04:32.780> reason<00:04:33.050> they<00:04:33.139> do<00:04:33.200> that<00:04:33.320> is<00:04:33.530> so<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.889> they

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
the reason they do that is so that they

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.440 
the reason they do that is so that they
make<00:04:34.250> sure<00:04:34.430> when<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.669> make<00:04:34.850> contact<00:04:35.030> with<00:04:35.330> the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
make sure when you make contact with the

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.510 
make sure when you make contact with the
bag<00:04:35.720> you're<00:04:36.320> landing<00:04:36.560> on<00:04:36.770> your<00:04:36.950> on<00:04:37.190> your<00:04:37.310> front

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
bag you're landing on your on your front

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.960 
bag you're landing on your on your front
knuckles<00:04:38.050> right<00:04:39.050> here<00:04:39.260> rather<00:04:39.590> than<00:04:39.970> hitting

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
knuckles right here rather than hitting

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.060 
knuckles right here rather than hitting
the<00:04:41.210> bag<00:04:41.389> and<00:04:41.660> in<00:04:41.840> your<00:04:41.990> fingers<00:04:42.620> landing<00:04:42.950> and

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
the bag and in your fingers landing and

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.800 
the bag and in your fingers landing and
then<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.250> end<00:04:43.400> up<00:04:43.550> tweaking<00:04:44.330> your<00:04:44.419> wrist<00:04:44.630> over

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
then you end up tweaking your wrist over

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.690 
then you end up tweaking your wrist over
or<00:04:45.230> doing<00:04:45.800> one<00:04:45.950> of<00:04:45.980> those<00:04:46.130> with<00:04:46.370> your<00:04:46.520> wrist

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
or doing one of those with your wrist

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.310 
or doing one of those with your wrist
and<00:04:46.850> then<00:04:46.970> now<00:04:47.090> you<00:04:47.150> get<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:47.389> fracture<00:04:48.050> in<00:04:48.169> your

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
and then now you get a fracture in your

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.350 
and then now you get a fracture in your
wrist<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:49.100> one<00:04:49.430> thing<00:04:49.580> I<00:04:49.669> notice<00:04:49.940> about<00:04:50.030> that

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
wrist so one thing I notice about that

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.260 
wrist so one thing I notice about that
is<00:04:50.510> almost<00:04:51.260> curves<00:04:52.130> your<00:04:52.310> hand<00:04:52.580> for<00:04:52.970> you<00:04:53.120> the

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
is almost curves your hand for you the

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.240 
is almost curves your hand for you the
way<00:04:53.389> that<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.810> glove<00:04:54.050> is<00:04:54.169> designed<00:04:54.530> it<00:04:55.040> might

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
way that the glove is designed it might

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.920 
way that the glove is designed it might
take<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.490> couple<00:04:55.520> of<00:04:55.880> rounds<00:04:56.240> to<00:04:56.270> get<00:04:56.510> used<00:04:56.750> to

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
take a couple of rounds to get used to

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.590 
take a couple of rounds to get used to
but<00:04:57.229> I<00:04:57.530> can<00:04:58.190> see<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.520> benefit<00:04:58.910> of<00:04:58.940> it<00:04:59.180> making

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
but I can see the benefit of it making

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.390 
but I can see the benefit of it making
you<00:04:59.870> lie<00:05:00.260> on<00:05:00.470> your<00:05:00.590> your<00:05:00.889> knuckles<00:05:01.220> rather

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
you lie on your your knuckles rather

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.250 
you lie on your your knuckles rather
than<00:05:01.669> lining<00:05:02.360> on<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.510> front<00:05:02.750> of<00:05:02.780> your<00:05:02.930> hand

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
than lining on the front of your hand

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.770 
than lining on the front of your hand
so<00:05:03.520> very<00:05:04.520> nice<00:05:04.639> glove<00:05:04.910> they're<00:05:05.180> very

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
so very nice glove they're very

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.060 
so very nice glove they're very
comfortable<00:05:06.020> they're<00:05:06.410> a<00:05:06.440> little<00:05:06.620> bit<00:05:06.830> more<00:05:06.860> on

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
comfortable they're a little bit more on

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.620 
comfortable they're a little bit more on
the<00:05:07.130> expensive<00:05:07.669> side<00:05:07.700> I<00:05:07.850> think<00:05:08.030> they<00:05:08.300> go<00:05:08.450> for

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
the expensive side I think they go for

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.050 
the expensive side I think they go for
like<00:05:08.889> $149<00:05:09.889> full<00:05:10.160> price<00:05:10.370> if<00:05:10.610> you<00:05:10.700> can<00:05:10.820> get<00:05:10.940> them

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
like $149 full price if you can get them

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.719 
like $149 full price if you can get them
on<00:05:11.150> discount<00:05:11.570> even<00:05:11.810> better<00:05:12.560> so<00:05:12.979> might<00:05:13.610> be

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
on discount even better so might be

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.129 
on discount even better so might be
worthwhile<00:05:13.940> away<00:05:14.389> tour<00:05:14.600> if<00:05:14.720> you<00:05:14.810> can<00:05:14.930> find

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
worthwhile away tour if you can find

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.650 
worthwhile away tour if you can find
