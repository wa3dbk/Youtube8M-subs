00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.690 
played the games I played a guitar hero
first<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.559> what<00:00:14.040> did<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.190> think<00:00:14.340> about<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
first and what did you think about the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.269 
first and what did you think about the
new<00:00:14.730> control<00:00:15.210> scene<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.660> thought<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:17.100> was

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
new control scene I thought that it was

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.160 
new control scene I thought that it was
nice<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.699> no-fail<00:00:18.029> mode<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.510> because<00:00:18.960> I

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
nice at no-fail mode was on because I

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.960 
nice at no-fail mode was on because I
immediately<00:00:19.590> was<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> worst<00:00:20.580> at<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
immediately was just the worst at it

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.420 
immediately was just the worst at it
that<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:22.050> ridiculously<00:00:22.800> steep<00:00:23.220> learning

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
that is a ridiculously steep learning

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.250 
that is a ridiculously steep learning
curve<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:24.420> if<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.689> haven't<00:00:24.900> played<00:00:25.050> it

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
curve one if you haven't played it

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.540 
curve one if you haven't played it

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
really game in a while and then do

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.730 
really game in a while and then do

time at the very very beginning but I

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.639 
time at the very very beginning but I
feel<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.600> picked<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:42.989> pretty<00:00:43.050> okay

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
once it starts going back and forth

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.700 
once it starts going back and forth
between<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.840> black<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.050> white<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.530> like

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710

feel like such an asshole but I've

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.819 
feel like such an asshole but I've
invested<00:03:00.540> like<00:03:00.750> thousands<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.350> dollars<00:03:01.620> on

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829

downloadable content fittings right but

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.210 
downloadable content fittings right but
I<00:03:04.140> can<00:03:04.320> understand<00:03:04.709> someone<00:03:04.829> who<00:03:05.010> really

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
I can understand someone who really

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.280 
I can understand someone who really
likes<00:03:05.459> like<00:03:06.150> rock<00:03:06.329> band<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.630> stuff<00:03:06.810> who

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
likes like rock band and stuff who

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.690 
likes like rock band and stuff who
doesn't<00:03:07.680> think<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.190> that's<00:03:08.370> worth<00:03:08.549> that

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
doesn't think that that's worth that

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.280 
doesn't think that that's worth that
amount<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.970> money<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.690> being<00:03:09.840> able<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.109> pay

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
amount of money and being able to pay

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.849 
amount of money and being able to pay
for<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.739> pass<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:12.000> really<00:03:12.329> a<00:03:12.359> great<00:03:12.420> idea<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.170> know

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
for a pass is really a great idea I know

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.650 
for a pass is really a great idea I know
a<00:03:13.890> lot<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.130> people<00:03:14.190> probably<00:03:14.400> think<00:03:14.700> off<00:03:14.880> there

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
a lot of people probably think off there

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.569 
a lot of people probably think off there
they<00:03:15.840> go<00:03:15.870> again<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.560> think<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.370> an

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
they go again I think this is an

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.830 
they go again I think this is an
instance<00:03:17.790> where<00:03:17.910> even<00:03:18.630> though<00:03:18.690> it's

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
instance where even though it's

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.360 
instance where even though it's
temporary<00:03:19.410> getting<00:03:19.680> access<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.040> everything

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
temporary getting access to everything

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.270 
temporary getting access to everything
makes<00:03:20.970> sense<00:03:21.060> we<00:03:21.930> also<00:03:22.109> played<00:03:22.410> rock<00:03:22.680> band<00:03:22.709> for

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
makes sense we also played rock band for

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.650 
makes sense we also played rock band for
today<00:03:23.640> yeah<00:03:23.940> what'd<00:03:24.209> you<00:03:24.239> think<00:03:24.390> about<00:03:24.510> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
today yeah what'd you think about the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.229 
today yeah what'd you think about the
the<00:03:25.380> solo<00:03:25.739> mode<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.160> what's<00:03:26.340> big<00:03:26.549> here<00:03:27.000> at<00:03:27.090> e3

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
the solo mode is what's big here at e3

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.230 
the solo mode is what's big here at e3
what<00:03:27.660> do<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.780> think<00:03:27.900> about

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
I think that Harmonix is handsome and

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.380 
I think that Harmonix is handsome and
talented<00:03:32.350> big<00:03:32.800> Chester<00:03:33.190> it's<00:03:34.000> way<00:03:34.210> better

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.810 
when I finally tried to play it I played
the<00:04:23.800> darkness<00:04:24.130> I<00:04:24.280> believe<00:04:24.520> in<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.640> thing<00:04:24.670> called

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820
