00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
just take some time this goes really

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440 
just take some time this goes really
fast<00:01:43.799> now<00:01:44.549> some<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> these<00:01:45.000> aren't<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.390> to

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
fast now some of these aren't going to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.090 
fast now some of these aren't going to
fit<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.990> I'm<00:01:46.049> gonna<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.649> cut<00:01:46.890> them<00:01:47.009> in

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.770 
for them to fit in my food processor
into<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> hole<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.159> I'm<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.240> kind<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.509> making

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
into the hole so I'm just kind of making

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.760 
into the hole so I'm just kind of making
it<00:01:57.869> easier<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.399> won't<00:01:59.759> fit<00:01:59.850> together<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.590> all

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it easier this won't fit together so all

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.460 
it easier this won't fit together so all
of<00:02:01.920> them<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.520> be
