shows you this is the clip and it shows
you<00:02:31.250> right<00:02:31.400> here<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:32.739> it's<00:02:33.739> not<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.310> hole

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
you right here that it's not this hole

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.149 
you right here that it's not this hole
it's<00:02:35.750> not<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:36.170> hole<00:02:36.379> right<00:02:36.409> here<00:02:36.620> it's<00:02:37.010> the

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
it's not this hole right here it's the

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.460 
it's not this hole right here it's the
second<00:02:37.610> hole<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.659> just<00:02:38.870> install<00:02:39.319> it

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
second hole and you just install it

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.860 
second hole and you just install it
right<00:02:39.680> there<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.849> it<00:02:41.060> looks<00:02:41.239> like<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.599> once

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
right there and it looks like that once

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.190 
right there and it looks like that once
you<00:02:41.959> install<00:02:42.349> it<00:02:42.379> so<00:02:43.750> I'll<00:02:44.750> show<00:02:44.959> you<00:02:45.019> how<00:02:45.170> easy

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
you install it so I'll show you how easy

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.349 
you install it so I'll show you how easy
it<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:46.090> take<00:02:47.090> this<00:02:47.920> like<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.609> longer

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
it is take this like this the longer

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.069 
it is take this like this the longer
edge<00:02:51.040> goes<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.430> left<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.879> the<00:02:52.970> machine<00:02:53.299> and

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
edge goes to the left of the machine and

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:00.119 
edge goes to the left of the machine and
again<00:02:54.500> it's<00:02:54.709> right<00:02:55.129> near<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.810> back<00:02:58.659> that's<00:02:59.659> it

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
again it's right near the back that's it

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.360 
again it's right near the back that's it
so<00:03:01.129> that's<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.760> clip<00:03:02.000> right<00:03:02.329> there<00:03:03.370> right

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
so that's the clip right there right

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.300 
so that's the clip right there right
there<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:05.150> just<00:03:05.359> pop<00:03:05.629> that<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.290> that's<00:03:07.010> it

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
there you just pop that in and that's it

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.879 
there you just pop that in and that's it
and<00:03:08.239> let's<00:03:08.510> say<00:03:08.659> I<00:03:08.690> put<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:11.889> accurate

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
and let's say I put the the accurate

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.539 
and let's say I put the the accurate
thing<00:03:13.099> that<00:03:13.250> we<00:03:13.370> used<00:03:13.549> to<00:03:13.670> use<00:03:13.870> right<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:14.900> there

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
thing that we used to use right in there

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.670 
thing that we used to use right in there
and<00:03:16.549> it's<00:03:16.700> ready<00:03:16.989> so<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.079> doesn't<00:03:18.379> throw<00:03:18.500> that

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
and it's ready so it doesn't throw that

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.759 
and it's ready so it doesn't throw that
air<00:03:18.829> anymore<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:19.489> in<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:19.669> meantime<00:03:20.739> before<00:03:21.739> I

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
air anymore so in the meantime before I

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.270 
air anymore so in the meantime before I
even<00:03:21.859> knew<00:03:22.160> about<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.549> freedom<00:03:22.849> clip<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:24.280> want

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
even knew about the freedom clip I want

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.970 
even knew about the freedom clip I want
to<00:03:25.430> work<00:03:25.699> around<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:26.599> not<00:03:27.109> you<00:03:27.620> know<00:03:27.680> have

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
to work around it and not you know have

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.439 
to work around it and not you know have
to<00:03:28.160> use<00:03:28.370> their<00:03:28.730> brain<00:03:29.919> carry<00:03:30.919> cups<00:03:31.299> when<00:03:32.299> you

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
to use their brain carry cups when you

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.580 
to use their brain carry cups when you
buy<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:34.299> system<00:03:35.299> it<00:03:35.540> comes<00:03:35.780> with<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.049> couple

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
buy this system it comes with a couple

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.599 
buy this system it comes with a couple
of<00:03:37.720> samples<00:03:38.720> like<00:03:39.199> this<00:03:39.470> this<00:03:39.799> is<00:03:39.980> green<00:03:40.340> tea

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
of samples like this this is green tea

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.300 
of samples like this this is green tea
so<00:03:41.569> around<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.019> edge<00:03:42.139> this<00:03:42.739> is<00:03:42.799> what<00:03:43.190> it's

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
so around the edge this is what it's

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.759 
so around the edge this is what it's
looking<00:03:43.669> for<00:03:43.780> what<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:44.930> could<00:03:45.199> do<00:03:45.440> while

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
looking for what you could do while

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
come in is cut a little piece of the

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.589 
come in is cut a little piece of the

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
superglue it right to that square where

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.469 
superglue it right to that square where
I<00:04:09.139> installed<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.680> freedom<00:04:10.010> clip<00:04:10.220> so<00:04:11.120> this<00:04:11.269> way

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:11.479 
I installed the freedom clip so this way

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.240 
I installed the freedom clip so this way
when<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:11.989> fold<00:04:12.229> the<00:04:12.440> piece<00:04:12.680> down<00:04:12.949> and

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
when you fold the piece down and

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.939 
when you fold the piece down and
actually<00:04:13.819> can<00:04:14.150> read<00:04:14.479> this<00:04:14.900> part<00:04:15.229> no<00:04:15.829> matter

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
actually can read this part no matter

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.099 
actually can read this part no matter
what<00:04:16.340> type<00:04:16.579> of<00:04:16.609> k-cup<00:04:17.419> you<00:04:17.570> put<00:04:17.810> in<00:04:17.930> there<00:04:18.079> or

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
because it'll read this
