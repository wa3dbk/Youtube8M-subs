00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
this particular style just because I

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.990

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
icon now this one I'm going to throw on

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.890 
icon now this one I'm going to throw on
there<00:02:51.340> when<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.519> want<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.300> know<00:02:52.390> maybe<00:02:52.570> make

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
there when I want to you know maybe make

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.140 
there when I want to you know maybe make
it<00:02:52.930> stand<00:02:53.320> out<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.590> little<00:02:53.830> more<00:02:54.100> whatnot<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:54.880> a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
it stand out a little more whatnot so a

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.509 
it stand out a little more whatnot so a
little<00:02:55.630> bit<00:02:55.720> on<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> frame<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.980> frame<00:02:57.160> itself

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
little bit on the frame the frame itself

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.160 
little bit on the frame the frame itself
is<00:02:57.760> actually<00:02:58.090> very<00:02:58.330> similar<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
is actually very similar to the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.740 
is actually very similar to the
fuel-cell<00:02:59.950> frame<00:03:00.459> as<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.060> guys<00:03:01.209> can<00:03:01.420> see<00:03:01.600> in

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
fuel-cell frame as you guys can see in

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.259 
fuel-cell frame as you guys can see in
the<00:03:01.870> cutout<00:03:02.110> right<00:03:02.230> here<00:03:02.709> kind<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:04.180> know

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
the cutout right here kind of you know

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.000 
the cutout right here kind of you know
it<00:03:04.450> mirrors<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.080> way<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.410> feel<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:05.800> has

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
it mirrors the way that the feel so has

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.890 
it mirrors the way that the feel so has
it<00:03:06.190> it's<00:03:06.580> just<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.910> little<00:03:07.269> bit<00:03:07.420> bigger<00:03:07.630> right

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
it it's just a little bit bigger right

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.930 
it it's just a little bit bigger right
here<00:03:08.290> because<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.010> main<00:03:09.160> difference<00:03:09.580> is<00:03:09.730> this

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
here because the main difference is this

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.600 
here because the main difference is this
is<00:03:10.000> what<00:03:10.690> Oakley<00:03:11.050> calls<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.530> shield<00:03:11.920> lens<00:03:12.220> which

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
is what Oakley calls a shield lens which

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.520 
is what Oakley calls a shield lens which
is<00:03:12.820> one<00:03:13.150> complete<00:03:13.600> lens<00:03:13.930> instead<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.410> two

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
is one complete lens instead of two

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.199 
is one complete lens instead of two
individual<00:03:15.040> lenses<00:03:15.400> which<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.030> would<00:03:16.180> find

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
individual lenses which you would find

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.069 
individual lenses which you would find
in<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.570> fuel-cell<00:03:16.930> now<00:03:18.660> it's<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.690> really<00:03:19.930> nice

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
in the fuel-cell now it's a really nice

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.080 
in the fuel-cell now it's a really nice
fit<00:03:20.440> let<00:03:20.980> me<00:03:21.070> go<00:03:21.190> ahead<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.400> try<00:03:21.640> these<00:03:21.700> on<00:03:21.940> so

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
fit let me go ahead and try these on so

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.370 
fit let me go ahead and try these on so
you<00:03:22.150> guys<00:03:22.299> can<00:03:22.450> see<00:03:22.570> what<00:03:22.660> they<00:03:22.780> look<00:03:22.959> like<00:03:22.989> so

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
you guys can see what they look like so

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.680 
you guys can see what they look like so
as<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.340> guys<00:03:24.430> can<00:03:24.610> see<00:03:24.670> they<00:03:25.030> have<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.239> really

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690

as you guys can see they have a really
nice<00:03:25.810> wrap<00:03:26.170> on<00:03:26.410> them<00:03:26.590> they<00:03:26.739> wrap<00:03:26.920> all<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.370> way

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
nice wrap on them they wrap all the way

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.000 
nice wrap on them they wrap all the way
around<00:03:27.570> now<00:03:28.570> this<00:03:28.900> is<00:03:29.110> it's<00:03:29.680> going<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:29.920> be

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
around now this is it's going to be

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.100 
around now this is it's going to be
similar<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.640> antics<00:03:31.209> if<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.570> guys<00:03:31.690> are<00:03:31.989> if

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
um in the sense of you know as a life

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.600 
um in the sense of you know as a life
style<00:03:50.140> frame<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.890> know<00:03:50.980> it's<00:03:51.130> not<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.340> sports

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
style frame you know it's not a sports

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.640 
style frame you know it's not a sports
specific<00:03:52.090> frame<00:03:52.269> so<00:03:52.510> it's<00:03:52.630> it's<00:03:53.260> not<00:03:53.470> going<00:03:53.590> to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
specific frame so it's it's not going to

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.900 
specific frame so it's it's not going to
be<00:03:53.769> something<00:03:54.070> that<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.280> could<00:03:54.400> use<00:03:54.459> for

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
be something that you could use for

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.340 
be something that you could use for
running<00:03:55.030> or<00:03:55.450> biking<00:03:55.630> or<00:03:55.959> anything<00:03:56.110> like<00:03:56.290> that
