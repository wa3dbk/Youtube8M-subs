00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.730
 Hello, you understand 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.619
 cosmetology last edition i 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.420

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.970
 nasolabial contour surgery 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.669
 folds 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.759
 this procedure can be called magic 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.820
 because immediately after it a wrinkle 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.670
 just disappears and the person is getting younger 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.399
 I hope in other words just in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.950
 the conditions of the beauty parlor can 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.270
 make the effect like plastic 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.280
 operations without rehabilitation period 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.460
 Now we turn to the procedure and you all 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.510
 see for yourself so we start with the inspection 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.070
 our girl of 37 is worried about her 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.880
 wrinkles of the nasolabial area between the eyebrows 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.240
 already such a good wrinkle laid down and 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.729

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.310

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.250
 proceeded comfortably we will apply anesthesia 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.250
 First, we process the necessary zones. 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.710
 and apply anesthetic as anesthesia 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.710
 we use ella 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.470
 create a greenhouse effect with 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 film 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.710
 and so our client to lie down for about 15-20 minutes 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.870
 until we have anesthesia work i 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.790
 I want to tell you about the filler which 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.130
 we chose 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.430
 we will use the filler perfect dr 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.070
 mdif is france production 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.800
 I really like to work with perfect 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.680
 and since it is very plastic and with it 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.330
 very easy to work it resolves 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.920
 completely leaves behind 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.800
 no trace 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.820
 absolutely safe here means 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.860
 contains hyaluronic acid 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.840
 stabilized and dissolve it 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.840
 starts in about six eight 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.370
 months that is, the effect you have enough for 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.000
 half a year it just took us 20 minutes 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.000
 remove times these new 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.770
 feel the skin replaced 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.850
 so take filler filler in 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.390
 individually packaged 1 syringe 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:09.410
 used by one person here 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.530
 milliliter completely sterile 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.530
 packaged 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.800
 Now before your eyes happen 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.540
 magic 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:50.190
 these wrinkles are deep enough now 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.190
 just disappear 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.640
 since we already wrinkled one wrinkle 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.130
 Now you can compare one such 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.310
 redness now after injection but not 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.280
 runs literally in half an hour 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.400
 here now this wrinkle break is 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.070
 by tomorrow it will pass too 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.800
 Now immediately what can be seen that is 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.280
 relief look here pass all u 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.220
 we donâ€™t have a meeting right away 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.090
 crease and if you compare here here before 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.300
 The hall is obvious here a wrinkle is just already 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.790
 hall and he disappeared now we see only 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.360
 wrinkle strip and because skin 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.970
 got used to being in that position a 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.950
 the recess itself is no longer that is 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:57.050
 strip from the wrinkles she will break up 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:59.830
 about a day and proceed 2 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.830
 wrinkles 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.559
 feel 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.559
 here 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.080
 the drug is injected intradermally therefore not 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.630
 Tupi there first 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.630
 can't hurt anyone 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:36.750

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.750

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:45.430
 so now I offer more here 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.820

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.220
 here the hall form already begins 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:58.350
 the hall begins to form naturally 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:58.350
 fix it just a little bit 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:13.280

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.280
