there's<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.399> lot<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> areas<00:01:54.479> where<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
there's a lot of areas where we have to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.740 
there's a lot of areas where we have to
 over<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> trim<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.939> pretty

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
 over on the trim we have to pretty

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.350 
 over on the trim we have to pretty
much<00:01:57.899> caulk<00:01:58.140> every<00:01:58.619> seam<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.939> what<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
much caulk every seam and what the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.469 
much caulk every seam and what the
does<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.079> seals<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:02.579> craps<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.270> gaps

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
does is it seals the craps and the gaps

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.780 
does is it seals the craps and the gaps
and<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.380> flexible<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.100> dries<00:02:05.399> into<00:02:05.670> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
and it's flexible and dries into a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.380 
and it's flexible and dries into a
rubber<00:02:06.500> so<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.680> makes<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.129> water<00:02:08.429> tight<00:02:08.520> and

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
rubber so it makes it water tight and

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.440 
rubber so it makes it water tight and
when<00:02:10.099> surface<00:02:11.099> wants<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.459> crack<00:02:11.760> is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
when surface wants to crack is

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.619 
when surface wants to crack is
a little<00:02:12.720> bit<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.959> flex<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.599> will

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
a little bit of a flex to it so it will

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.820 
a little bit of a flex to it so it will
resist<00:02:16.110> cracking<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:19.260> we're<00:02:19.379> using<00:02:19.560> all

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
resist cracking and we're using all

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.309 
resist cracking and we're using all
latex<00:02:20.340> products<00:02:20.760> which<00:02:21.540> as<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.870> mentioned

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
latex products which as I mentioned

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.880 
latex products which as I mentioned
before<00:02:23.060> drive<00:02:24.060> rubbery<00:02:24.569> in<00:02:24.840> flexible<00:02:27.890> attempt

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
before drive rubbery in flexible attempt

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:46.880 
before drive rubbery in flexible attempt
not<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.340> crack<00:02:29.580> as<00:02:29.730> much<00:02:29.910> as<00:02:30.060> oil<00:02:44.989> okay<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.739> now

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
not to crack as much as oil okay so now

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.380 
not to crack as much as oil okay so now
I'm<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.099> gonna<00:02:47.220> put<00:02:47.489> down<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.760> gun

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
I'm just gonna put down the gun

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.350 
I'm just gonna put down the gun

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.929 

now<00:03:35.319> as<00:03:35.500> I'm<00:03:35.650> as<00:03:35.950> I'm<00:03:36.159> doing<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:36.489> I<00:03:36.640> noticed

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
now as I'm as I'm doing this I noticed

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.699 
now as I'm as I'm doing this I noticed
that<00:03:37.060> there's<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.360> crack<00:03:38.140> running<00:03:38.379> along<00:03:38.680> here

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
that there's a crack running along here

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.740 
that there's a crack running along here
and<00:03:39.610> that's<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.879> kind<00:03:40.060> of<00:03:40.120> crack<00:03:40.329> that<00:03:40.360> needs

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
and that's the kind of crack that needs

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.050 
and that's the kind of crack that needs
to<00:03:40.840> be<00:03:40.870> caught<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.970> just<00:03:43.299> go<00:03:43.450> ahead<00:03:45.030> apply<00:03:46.030> a

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
to be caught so just go ahead apply a

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:56.610 
to be caught so just go ahead apply a
little<00:03:46.390> bit<00:03:46.540> here<00:03:46.780> there<00:03:48.870> as<00:03:49.870> needed<00:03:55.620> just

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
little bit here there as needed just

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.220 
little bit here there as needed just
kind<00:03:56.860> of<00:03:56.890> wiping<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.400> over<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:58.030> surface<00:03:58.239> you

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
kind of wiping it over the surface you

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.930 
kind of wiping it over the surface you
always<00:03:59.440> want<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.680> lot<00:03:59.829> of<00:03:59.950> bead<00:04:00.129> pull<00:04:00.700> on<00:04:00.760> the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
always want a lot of bead pull on the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.880 
always want a lot of bead pull on the
side<00:04:01.439> but<00:04:02.439> try<00:04:03.189> to<00:04:03.250> meet<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.670> wall<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:05.650> tends

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
side but try to meet the wall that tends

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:15.809 
side but try to meet the wall that tends
to<00:04:06.040> crack<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.459> most<00:04:14.129> to<00:04:15.129> run<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.340> bead<00:04:15.579> right

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
to crack the most to run a bead right

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:26.939 
to crack the most to run a bead right
down<00:04:16.139> corner<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:25.690> when<00:04:25.780> you<00:04:25.870> fix<00:04:26.110> this<00:04:26.320> it'll

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
down corner so when you fix this it'll

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.240 
down corner so when you fix this it'll
stay<00:04:27.130> fixed<00:04:28.320> this<00:04:29.320> makes<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.650> big<00:04:29.860> difference

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
stay fixed this makes a big difference

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.370 
stay fixed this makes a big difference
in<00:04:30.400> your<00:04:30.520> final<00:04:30.820> paint<00:04:31.030> job<00:04:31.240> because<00:04:32.080> as<00:04:32.229> you

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
in your final paint job because as you

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.590 
in your final paint job because as you
can<00:04:32.500> see<00:04:32.740> when<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.430> seams<00:04:33.699> and<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.300> cracks

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
can see when the seams and the cracks

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.100 
can see when the seams and the cracks
tend<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.080> disappear<00:04:35.729> everything<00:04:36.729> looks

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
tend to disappear everything looks

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.219 
tend to disappear everything looks
brand-new

the defects or the damage it looks like

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.990 
the defects or the damage it looks like
we're<00:04:44.680> done<00:04:44.830> with<00:04:45.070> this<00:04:45.190> step<00:04:45.490> now<00:04:45.669> we're<00:04:45.910> just

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
we're done with this step now we're just

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.400 
we're done with this step now we're just
gonna<00:04:46.120> have<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.389> let<00:04:46.570> this<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.139> dry

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
gonna have to let this and dry

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.150 
to set up I like to let it dry overnight
so<00:04:52.539> that<00:04:52.810> when<00:04:53.229> it<00:04:53.320> dries<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.740> doesn't<00:04:54.010> shrink

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
so that when it dries it doesn't shrink

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.680 
so that when it dries it doesn't shrink
and<00:04:54.460> create<00:04:54.669> more<00:04:54.789> cracking<00:04:55.120> so<00:04:55.419> you<00:04:55.479> want<00:04:55.630> to

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
and create more cracking so you want to

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.600 
and create more cracking so you want to
let<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:55.840> dry<00:04:56.050> completely<00:04:56.470> before<00:04:57.039> you<00:04:57.310> go<00:04:57.430> on

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
let it dry completely before you go on

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.770 
let it dry completely before you go on
to<00:04:57.699> your<00:04:57.849> next<00:04:57.970> step<00:04:58.120> which<00:04:58.389> is<00:04:58.419> going<00:04:58.539> to<00:04:58.660> be

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
to your next step which is going to be

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.080 
to your next step which is going to be
the<00:04:58.870> paint
