00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
going to get together to me about

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.170 
going to get together to me about
bringing<00:00:25.859> technology<00:00:26.070> how<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:26.670> could<00:00:27.000> bring

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
bringing technology how we could bring

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.259 
bringing technology how we could bring
technology<00:00:27.420> better<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.230> our<00:00:28.380> schools<00:00:29.240> to<00:00:30.240> be

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
technology better to our schools to be

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.690 
technology better to our schools to be
more<00:00:30.570> efficient<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.949> say<00:00:32.130> if<00:00:32.189> they<00:00:32.550> could

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
more efficient and to say if they could

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.190 
more efficient and to say if they could
bring<00:00:32.820> technology<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.780> kids<00:00:33.989> could<00:00:34.140> learn

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
bring technology in so kids could learn

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.690 
bring technology in so kids could learn
better<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.710> they<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.040> save<00:00:35.219> money<00:00:35.370> there

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
better and they can save money there

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.069 
better and they can save money there
then<00:00:35.969> there<00:00:36.120> would<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.270> more<00:00:36.450> resources<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
then there would be more resources to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.979 
then there would be more resources to
reinvest<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> classroom<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.809> they've

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
reinvest in the classroom and so they've

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.389 
reinvest in the classroom and so they've
been<00:00:40.020> meeting<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.530> their<00:00:40.649> own<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.129> all<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
been meeting on their own and all of a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.639 
been meeting on their own and all of a
sudden<00:00:41.430> became<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.120> big<00:00:42.329> uproar<00:00:42.809> about<00:00:42.960> they

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
sudden became this big uproar about they

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.440 
sudden became this big uproar about they
were<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:44.010> off<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.430> reform<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.300> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
were going off to reform all of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.709 
were going off to reform all of
Education<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.879> point<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.480> wasn't

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
Education and the point is is I wasn't

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.350 
Education and the point is is I wasn't
even<00:00:48.870> aware<00:00:48.989> their<00:00:49.350> meeting<00:00:50.030> because<00:00:51.030> again

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
even aware their meeting because again

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.760 
even aware their meeting because again
they<00:00:51.539> were<00:00:51.629> doing<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.140> their<00:00:52.289> own<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.590> say

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
they were doing this on their own to say

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.580 
they were doing this on their own to say
they<00:00:53.010> were<00:00:53.070> bringing<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.370> new<00:00:53.550> ideas<00:00:54.590> well

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
they were bringing up new ideas well

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.260 
they were bringing up new ideas well
first<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.980> all<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.820> idea<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.090> pretty

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
first of all I think the idea is pretty

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.889 
first of all I think the idea is pretty
good<00:00:58.430> isn't<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.670> good<00:00:59.789> idea<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.239> say<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.750> use

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
good isn't a good idea to say can we use

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.380 
good isn't a good idea to say can we use
technology<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.649> improve<00:01:02.100> performance<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
technology to improve performance in a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.509 
technology to improve performance in a
classroom<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:04.680> could<00:01:04.890> make<00:01:05.070> us<00:01:05.250> more

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
classroom that could make us more

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.310 
classroom that could make us more
efficient<00:01:05.970> than<00:01:06.119> safe<00:01:06.330> hours<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.200> we

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
efficient than safe hours that then we

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.380 
efficient than safe hours that then we
could<00:01:07.439> reinvest<00:01:07.890> more<00:01:08.189> right<00:01:08.460> classroom<00:01:09.090> I

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
could reinvest more right classroom I

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.590 
could reinvest more right classroom I
think<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:10.350> pretty<00:01:10.470> cool<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.450> think<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.540> got

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
think that's pretty cool I think it got

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.270 
think that's pretty cool I think it got
too<00:01:12.810> caught<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.590> how<00:01:13.860> they<00:01:14.070> were<00:01:14.130> doing

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
too caught up and how they were doing

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.770 
too caught up and how they were doing
things<00:01:14.610> they<00:01:14.790> were<00:01:14.850> doing<00:01:14.909> some<00:01:15.240> mediums<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
things they were doing some mediums and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.810 
things they were doing some mediums and
game<00:01:15.930> together<00:01:16.110> yeah<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.130> wasn't<00:01:17.430> aware<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.640> all

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
game together yeah I wasn't aware of all

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.880 
game together yeah I wasn't aware of all
that<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> think<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.530> best<00:01:19.710> answer

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
that is you so I think the best answer

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.330 
that is you so I think the best answer
is<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.939> concepts<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.720> good<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.009> I'm

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
is is the concepts really good so I'm

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.740 
is is the concepts really good so I'm
actually<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.880> take<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.150> concept<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
actually going to take that concept and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.330 
actually going to take that concept and
go<00:01:24.840> talk<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> state<00:01:25.470> superintendent<00:01:25.830> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
go talk to the state superintendent to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.520 
go talk to the state superintendent to
say<00:01:26.490> why<00:01:26.729> don't<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.840> more<00:01:28.110> official

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
say why don't we make that more official

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
say why don't we make that more official
go<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> state<00:01:29.610> superintendent<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.420> state

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
go to the state superintendent the state

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.289 
go to the state superintendent the state
board<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.990> say<00:01:31.200> hey<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.369> that's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.000> good<00:01:33.150> enough

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
board to say hey if that's a good enough

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.730 
board to say hey if that's a good enough
idea<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:34.079> should<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.320> talking<00:01:34.470> about

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
idea I think we should be talking about

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.740 
idea I think we should be talking about
doing<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.400> schools<00:01:35.700> while<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:36.479> make<00:01:36.630> it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
doing that in schools while we make it

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.999 
doing that in schools while we make it
official<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> state

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
official and have the state
