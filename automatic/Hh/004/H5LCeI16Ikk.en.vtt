00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
same time they come in twos and if your

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.850 
same time they come in twos and if your
doctor<00:00:39.629> doesn't<00:00:39.989> know<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.199> you<00:00:40.530> might<00:00:40.680> want

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
doctor doesn't know that you might want

doctor doesn't know that you might want
to<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.070> second<00:00:41.399> opinion<00:00:41.430> here's<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.210> good

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
to get a second opinion here's a good

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.540 
to get a second opinion here's a good
way<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> want<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.489> know
