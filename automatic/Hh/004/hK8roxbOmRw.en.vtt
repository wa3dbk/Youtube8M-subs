 and launched into the air timeless verses 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.000
 stylish homes and pulled barriers 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.920
 generationals I shoot the world 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.989
 talking through some cables and a 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.420
 missive to eternity to save me 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.430
 to fall prisoner in the arms of the routines 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.680
 that the weights of passive slut do not 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.780
 have holding corners since it is the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.460
 rhymes the clothes that I feel best 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.280
 brings me closer to the essence that is not 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.160
 for sale it appears to be the freedom of 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.010
 to be and to be without being nothing but being me 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.839
 to find the goal on the road does not matter 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.760
 if safi will not be a nice memory of 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.350
 my perfect imperfection when my light and 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.659
 I have gone 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.390
 and at this moment I'm alive it seems 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.040
 lie but it is true is true if not 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.350
 I appreciate this I do not know when I'll do it 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.960
 how long I will live and how long 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.030
 will pass the dead I worry more about the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.729
 fact of not seeing rain that of leaving 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.040
 a nice corpse I want my 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.110
 body is part of the beautiful bar or that 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.869
 they hit me they were a bed with pencil and 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.180
 role to be dismissed with laughter and a 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.729
 modem would make my old man resist a 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.890
 my poetry that my brothers are all 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.330
 together that my nephew are playing and 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.880
 running and my mother watching them and 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.679
 smiling that what surrounds me is not 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.110
 flashes of flowers what I want in my 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.929
 velorio is a revelry of animators that 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.840
 they sing to life that new ones come 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:51.649
 connections when I get my farewell I know 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.750
 I'll be fine even if I ask him to be my 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.049
 exile when death wins me I know that 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.360
 I'll be fine because I know I'll always be 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.280
 how is my brother aridane that's why 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.890
 he became aware that I am now alive 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.409
 I'm alive yes because live is here 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.489
 you can hear it with you 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.319
 notice in your skin vibrate because it is 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.750
 while the minute hand accelerates his walk 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.360
 as if in a hurry to get to some 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.580
 place points without enjoying every stop 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.459
 needed to be able to dedicate a 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.709
 minute to the hour hand 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.930
 toxic kisses sweet lips healthy my 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.269
 loneliness and fill my everything with nothing 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.060
 grievances neighborhoods have my muse 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.900
 crossed my rage unleashed and moved my 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.140
 pillow I know that this search 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.500
 that I had to find because to be 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.849
 lost in life was greater chopped than 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.410
 it can happen to be fine as long as 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.530
 looking at your neighbor when 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.900
 rhythm there will be this divine link with the 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.079
 present when the eyes of the people 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.569
 I find myself sorry I do not cure your 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.340
 sickness or calm your hunger with my 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.819
 banal words 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.379
 I only give light to my darkness when it launched 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.379
 timeless verses
