00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.460 
tournament I think that the tournament
is<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> testament<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> work<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.350> we've

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
is a testament to the work that we've

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.359 
is a testament to the work that we've
done<00:00:25.680> as<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.490> club<00:00:26.939> with<00:00:27.090> our<00:00:27.210> Academy<00:00:27.660> program

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
done as a club with our Academy program

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.830 
done as a club with our Academy program
the<00:00:29.369> majority<00:00:29.820> these<00:00:29.910> boys<00:00:30.179> I've<00:00:30.449> had<00:00:30.630> since

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the majority these boys I've had since

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.160 
the majority these boys I've had since
they<00:00:31.019> were<00:00:31.080> United<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.099> ten<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:33.329> two<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
they were United and you ten and two to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.930 
they were United and you ten and two to
go<00:00:34.320> down<00:00:34.469> than<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.489> win<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> tournament

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
go down than it is and win a tournament

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.049 
go down than it is and win a tournament
as<00:00:36.270> prestigious<00:00:36.660> as<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.640> means<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.910> have

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
as prestigious as it means that you have

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.030 
as prestigious as it means that you have
to<00:00:39.180> put<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.719> work<00:00:39.899> beforehand<00:00:40.739> going

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to put a lot of work beforehand going

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.790 
to put a lot of work beforehand going
into<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> think<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.050> largely<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
into that so I think this is a largely a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.680 
into that so I think this is a largely a
testament<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.030> work<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.360> we've<00:00:45.450> done

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690

has through the Academy program visa and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.459 
has through the Academy program visa and
how<00:00:48.300> many<00:00:48.480> teams<00:00:48.780> are<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.350> are<00:00:49.379> some

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
how many teams are in and what are some

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.049
