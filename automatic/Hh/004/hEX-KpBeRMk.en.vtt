I'd<00:01:48.510> like<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.780> use<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.170> self<00:01:49.410> sculpting

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
I'd like to use it the self sculpting

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.400 
I'd like to use it the self sculpting
gel<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.310> define<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> curl<00:01:51.120> so<00:01:52.020> what<00:01:52.170> I'm<00:01:52.260> gonna

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
gel to define the curl so what I'm gonna

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.260 
gel to define the curl so what I'm gonna
do<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.770> actually<00:01:53.010> run<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.670> through<00:01:53.880> her<00:01:54.030> hair

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
do is actually run that through her hair

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
bit in my hand and go through and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.380 
bit in my hand and go through and
scrunch<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.290> into<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.070> hair<00:02:02.700> from<00:02:03.000> root<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
scrunch it into the hair from root to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.469

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
to take and define all the curls for you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.340 
to take and define all the curls for you
without<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.970> ending<00:02:12.180> up<00:02:12.420> with<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.630> big<00:02:12.930> ball<00:02:13.290> of

without it ending up with a big ball of
fuzz<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.980> your<00:02:14.010> hands<00:02:15.170> what<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.260> want<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.500> do

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
fuzz on your hands what you want to do

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.230 
fuzz on your hands what you want to do
is<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.860> want<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.040> make<00:02:17.220> sure<00:02:17.250> what<00:02:17.940> side

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
is you want to make sure what side

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.930 
is you want to make sure what side
you're<00:02:19.200> you're<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.950> where<00:02:20.220> your<00:02:20.370> hair<00:02:20.610> and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
you're you're you where your hair and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.550 
you're you're you where your hair and
actually<00:02:21.480> part<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> way<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.380> want

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
actually part it the way that you want

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.199 
actually part it the way that you want
to<00:02:22.650> argue<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:23.100> this<00:02:23.250> way<00:02:23.459> or<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.730> other<00:02:23.820> way

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
to argue it this way or the other way

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.150 
to argue it this way or the other way
either<00:02:24.630> way<00:02:24.840> works<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.620> go<00:02:28.800> through<00:02:29.010> and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
either way works so I go through and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.300 
either way works so I go through and
scrunch<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.300> way<00:02:30.420> through<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.959> hair

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
scrunch it all the way through the hair

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.979 
scrunch it all the way through the hair
getting<00:02:32.310> all<00:02:32.489> those<00:02:32.640> curls<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.270> stand<00:02:33.540> out<00:02:33.720> for

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
getting all those curls to stand out for

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.979 
getting all those curls to stand out for
you<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:35.040> then<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.310> take<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.580> diffuser<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.810> make

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
you and then I take a diffuser and make

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.470 
you and then I take a diffuser and make
sure<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.560> diffuser<00:02:38.070> here<00:02:38.459> has<00:02:38.880> teeth<00:02:39.269> in

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
sure that the diffuser here has teeth in

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.030 
sure that the diffuser here has teeth in
it<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:39.989> actually<00:02:40.170> set<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.739> hair

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
it so you can actually set the hair

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.729 
it so you can actually set the hair
inside<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.790> allow<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.810> hair<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.080> curl<00:02:43.500> around

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
inside and allow the hair to curl around

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.949 
inside and allow the hair to curl around
each<00:02:44.070> one<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.910> way<00:02:45.090> you're<00:02:45.239> going<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.480> get<00:02:45.630> no

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
each one that way you're going to get no

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.770 
each one that way you're going to get no
separation<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.680> curl<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:50.360> lifting<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.510> hair

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
separation of curl and lifting the hair

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.530 
separation of curl and lifting the hair
and<00:02:52.049> setting<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:52.980> inside<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.880> blow-dryer<00:02:54.510> and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
and setting it inside the blow-dryer and

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.600 
and setting it inside the blow-dryer and
lift<00:02:55.230> at<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.470> root<00:02:55.769> area<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:56.040> little<00:02:56.220> bit<00:02:56.340> as

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
lift at the root area a little bit as

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.910 
lift at the root area a little bit as
you<00:02:56.640> blow<00:02:57.120> drying<00:02:57.450> that's<00:02:58.350> going<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.680> give<00:02:58.799> you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
you blow drying that's going to give you

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.039 
you blow drying that's going to give you
volume<00:02:59.130> at<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.459> root<00:02:59.760> area<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.330> also<00:03:00.840> give

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
volume at the root area and also give

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.229 
volume at the root area and also give
you<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> lot<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.440> separation<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.549> curl<00:03:02.970> and

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
you a lot of separation of curl and

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.840 
you a lot of separation of curl and
definition<00:03:04.200> when<00:03:05.010> you're<00:03:05.130> dry<00:03:05.400> in<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.670> hair

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
definition when you're dry in the hair

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.100 
definition when you're dry in the hair
you<00:03:05.970> want<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.269> make<00:03:06.420> sure<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.900> don't

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
you want to make sure that you don't

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.080 
you want to make sure that you don't
move<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.560> too<00:03:07.799> much<00:03:08.010> inside<00:03:08.459> there<00:03:08.700> or<00:03:08.910> you're

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
move it too much inside there or you're

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.640 
move it too much inside there or you're
going<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.269> end<00:03:09.390> up<00:03:09.510> with<00:03:09.660> separation<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.350> curl

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
going to end up with separation of curl

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.250 
going to end up with separation of curl
as<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.610> see<00:03:11.820> I'm<00:03:11.940> lifting<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.540> up<00:03:12.810> putting

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
as you can see I'm lifting it up putting

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.320 
as you can see I'm lifting it up putting
the<00:03:13.470> dryer<00:03:13.799> in<00:03:14.040> there<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.310> allowing<00:03:14.820> all<00:03:15.150> the

the dryer in there and allowing all the
ends<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.900> get<00:03:15.989> dry<00:03:16.290> first<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:17.310> then<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.580> will<00:03:17.850> go

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
ends to get dry first and then I will go

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.509 
ends to get dry first and then I will go
back<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.239> actually<00:03:18.780> use<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.200> top<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.860> lift

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
back and actually use the top and lift

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.860 
back and actually use the top and lift
it<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:20.850> show<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.180> how<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.480> can<00:03:21.630> get<00:03:21.720> the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
it and show you how you can get the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.360 
it and show you how you can get the
height<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.260> can<00:03:22.350> either<00:03:22.560> go<00:03:22.650> upside<00:03:22.950> down<00:03:23.160> to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
height you can either go upside down to

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.490 
height you can either go upside down to
get<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.610> height<00:03:23.790> or<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.870> actually<00:03:25.230> lift

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
get the height or you can actually lift

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.610 
get the height or you can actually lift
it<00:03:25.709> up<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.100> get<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.940> height<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.390> way<00:03:27.620> the
