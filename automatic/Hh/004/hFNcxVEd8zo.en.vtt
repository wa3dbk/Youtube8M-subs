00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.610
 hello to all we find ourselves 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.410
 today for a new episode of 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.810
 the app of the week i'm going to you 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.730
 present intel ring an application 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.189
 very smart who will manage for you 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.109
 all types of sounds ie if 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.820
 you are in rendezvous at the cinema your 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.390
 phones and in your pocket or on 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.000
 a desk 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.129
 well the application will take care of 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.550
 adjust the volume according to your 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.170
 needs 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.519
 so I'm going to show you how it is 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.110
 go first you have this page 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.900
 you can enable or disable a 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.449
 such wing here here so you have the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.280
 volume of your phone is here you 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.710
 have the ability to actually activate a 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.559
 delay simply for example you 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.059
 are at the cinema you have a session that 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.879
 lasts two hours you place on two 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.260
 hours and in fact simply the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.690
 phone will go into mode 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.869
 silent for two hours to no 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.729
 not to disturb you during your session 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:07.250
 then you also have a tab 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.930
 ambient noise so in which he 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.730
 will have to pass during the installation of 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.770
 the application since it will be necessary to calibrate 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.150
 in fact the ambient noise you b you 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.820
 place your phone in a room 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.340
 noiselessly and your phone 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.500
 simply placed on a flat surface 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.630
 without the microphone being covered by 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.680
 something and you calibrate it are 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.330
 simply so that afterwards 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.270
 the application then recognize themselves the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.400
 boils the ambient noise to adjust the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.170
 saddlery depending on that 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.850
 then it's here that's going 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.250
 mainly in the settings you 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.760
 can enable or disable the detection of 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.260
 ambient noise 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.670
 that is to say that it will leave 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.350
 the application detects and the noise 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.990
 ambient that I wanted 10 for then 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.070
 adapt the ringtone ie 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.150
 you are in a room where there is 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.630
 a lot of noise and good ringing 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.630
 will sound very loud and vice versa you 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.700
 can therefore adjust the noise when the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.710
 phone is outside of your pocket 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.570
 like these so the noise of the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.390
 ringtone you can do the same 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.190
 just when your phone is 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.610
 in your pocket you can also 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.110
 whether or not to adjust the sound volume 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.789
 notifications 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.490
 if you activate the meeting mode it is in 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.970
 simply makes activating a 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.950
 beep 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.569
 when you are on an appointment you are at 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.410
 to say that you're going to have to simply 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.800
 place your TVs 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.240
 a phase down on the table on your 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.520
 office 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.330
 and if you receive a call or a 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.090
 notification 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.830
 the phone will not ring but will give 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.140
 only a little beep for you 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.560
 inform about this modification of this 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.390
 call 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.750
 here and here you can adjust the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.030
 volume of this beep and finally here you 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.390
 have an auto oppenheimer that's 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.520
 simply a possibility that when 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.570
 you activate by the volume buttons of 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.610
 your phone 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.800
 silent mode and well it'll launch 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.750
 automatically the homepage for 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.180
 set a silence period then you 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.830
 show what this is so we are 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.250
 here so anywhere on your 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.680
 phone 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.020
 we lower the volume we will put it under 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.710
 silent and as you see 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.190
 the application will launch automatically 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.270
 and you can adjust like this so the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.310
 delay simply 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.570
 here I think I went around 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.190
 this little application very 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.510
 smart so I advise you to 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.080
 install it if you need a 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.220
 application that manages for you the sound of 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.290
 your phone and it's always 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.120
 pleasure to have applications that 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.190
 take care of you for work 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.470
