00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 and then we're going to get to the last 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.620
 part of our video and the repair of 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:15.089
 Glass turbo is changed here 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.070
 these two channels here can see him 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.580
 Here , the glass passes 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.109
 I cleaned this little thing that this filter 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.800
 I learned here with plastic strap that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.160
 wires 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.160
 is're not getting there came plastic 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.449
 I put the trim to good 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.260
 that was missing 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:39.840
 You can see all plastic 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.070
 and most important here in the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.250
 elevator 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 are seeing lubricate here congraf 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.690
 passes the finger on the grease and passes here is 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.899
 another thing 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:57.210
 has this setting here that sets the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:00.149
 garrison here and here 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.119
 justice here is right here is the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:10.860
 trim on this side of this here 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:14.369
 adjust the glass elevator here and here 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.470
 Right there it's down there too back there 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.240
 both to thwart these three adjust to the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.360
 Front channel here this trim 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.340
 White has there that I did not think to 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.250
 to sell new I had to take an iron 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 Old and good, let's see the glass rising 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.340
 come on 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.870
 oh that crazy laughter elite was top 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.860
 OK 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.940
 knowing the player 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.960
 Oh I shined ben there and here's a 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.350
 screw that adjusts and it also 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.600
 So you adjust to the slope. 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.180
 part here is grease with oil 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.270
 lubricant and this track has're here 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:20.130
 lubricated when you 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:25.860
 lower where it has been rising for more 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.160
 far here once you show 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.160
 reflection 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.380
 before he made a scratching noise 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.920
 the terrible noise 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.670
 The same engine here is original. 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.210
 Look at the speed that the bass is now and the 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.210
 speed goes up 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.530
 It was very good, I 'll be very happy. 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:03.090
 even though we managed to do this 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:05.450
 repair and with very cool will not go up 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.450
 again 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.280
 Going to life was very bad before. 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.280
 It's very cool 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:25.530
 then just let it off again that the 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:28.260
 Car beauty then just to resume. 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.580
 let's briefly state what happened 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.770
 done in that car 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:40.470
 We changed the trim rubber 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:43.080
 external external eyelash us 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.460
 lubricated whole glass with silicone 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.150
 It's going to be half for now. 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.410
 greasy but that 's good it has to 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.720
 made rubber a little overweight because she 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.390
 It's new with rain this time it goes 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.540
 Come out here, it's a little dirt. 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.480
 this rubber inside was smeared 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.120
 That's her too, she's new. 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.920
 even to the two original tas are 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:13.140
 originals purchased at fiat 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.690
 even after that garrison there it went 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.440
 clean and tight 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:24.570
 This screw here and here 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:28.020
 have been adjusted the whips was the prize 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.920
 stuck here tava released this cable here from 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.510
 engine ok 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.610
 I put a plastic strap here because 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.440
 They were going to make a loud noise. 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.430
 it makes more noise very soft 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.500
 These actuators move the elevator. 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.660
 okay but it was not necessary to touch it 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.540
 is not even if you do not have the 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.930
 If I do not move here, that's the 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.420
 let go of the glass 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.170
 you lean forward and pull 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.520
 up 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:59.310
 hence the video came out here and here as I already 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.260
 I said before regulate that garrison that 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.500
 have behind it is equal to the front only 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.590
 that it is much less effect to quit after 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.010
 just do the cleaning and lubrication here 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.080
 from that part here that the elevator 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:18.400
 another detail that I have to show 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:21.280
 You guys have this eraser down here. 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.600
 it serves to end the stroke in the glass 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.490
 when he comes down here but does not 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.199
 the kind she beat 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.009
 You can see that it has a marquinha. 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:33.789
 lytha she hits that eraser and makes 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:36.400
 which glass down only the plastics 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.680
 It's gotta get well stretched so much. 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.419
 not to get water into the door 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.270
 We go there inside the door. 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.289
 It was also good now it does not have any more 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.500
 dirt 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:53.199
 These trainings, he's there. He's down there. 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:54.729
 The military finger is such a bloody thing. 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.970
 It has to be well unlocked here. 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:00.130
 clean because there is no water she falls 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.650
 by the glass flows through this plastic 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:07.810
 They come here and she has to get out of here 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:10.830
 so it is very important that these 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.979
 here are not 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.500
 obstructed but no more is that 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:22.389
 we were able to achieve total success and 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:27.330
 of glass and expects that in 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:27.330
 soon there will be news and in the channel
