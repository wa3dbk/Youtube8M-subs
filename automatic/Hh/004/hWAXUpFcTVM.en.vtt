00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
you'd like the types of Pokemon work a

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.610 
you'd like the types of Pokemon work a
little<00:04:58.760> differently<00:04:59.270> in<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.510> TP<00:04:59.930> tzg<00:05:00.770> as<00:05:00.890> well

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
little differently in the TP tzg as well

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.980 
little differently in the TP tzg as well
if<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:03.830> look<00:05:04.010> at<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.310> weakness<00:05:04.990> resistance

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
if you look at the weakness resistance

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.990 
if you look at the weakness resistance
and<00:05:06.200> retreat<00:05:06.710> costs<00:05:07.070> down<00:05:07.190> here<00:05:09.220> this<00:05:10.220> card

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
and retreat costs down here this card

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.430 
and retreat costs down here this card
when<00:05:11.570> it<00:05:11.630> attacks<00:05:12.140> it<00:05:12.680> is<00:05:13.160> always<00:05:13.790> a

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
when it attacks it is always a

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.960 
when it attacks it is always a
water-type<00:05:15.440> attack<00:05:15.920> no<00:05:16.310> matter<00:05:16.340> if<00:05:16.760> the

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
water-type attack no matter if the

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.960 
water-type attack no matter if the
attack<00:05:17.660> requires<00:05:18.140> water<00:05:18.890> type<00:05:19.250> energies<00:05:19.730> or

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
attack requires water type energies or

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.950 
attack requires water type energies or
not<00:05:20.270> that<00:05:20.810> differs<00:05:21.260> a<00:05:21.290> little<00:05:21.410> from<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.830> games

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
not that differs a little from the games

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.660 
not that differs a little from the games
because<00:05:23.960> each<00:05:24.140> move<00:05:24.440> has<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:24.770> specific<00:05:25.460> type

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
because each move has a specific type

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.690 
because each move has a specific type
here<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.330> card<00:05:26.930> in<00:05:27.080> general<00:05:27.590> has<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:27.800> type<00:05:28.130> so

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
here the card in general has a type so

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.660 
here the card in general has a type so
if<00:05:28.760> you're<00:05:28.910> facing<00:05:29.210> a<00:05:30.520> pokémon<00:05:31.520> like

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
if you're facing a pokémon like

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.870 
if you're facing a pokémon like
Charmeleon<00:05:32.330> that<00:05:32.540> is<00:05:32.660> weak<00:05:32.960> in<00:05:33.430> water<00:05:34.430> type

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
Charmeleon that is weak in water type

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.250 
Charmeleon that is weak in water type
Pokemon<00:05:36.010> weak<00:05:37.010> against<00:05:37.460> it<00:05:37.630> you<00:05:38.630> attack<00:05:38.990> with

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
Pokemon weak against it you attack with

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.930 
Pokemon weak against it you attack with
jump<00:05:39.770> on<00:05:39.950> even<00:05:40.280> though<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:40.460> doesn't<00:05:40.640> require

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
jump on even though it doesn't require

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.220 
jump on even though it doesn't require
any<00:05:41.270> water<00:05:42.200> energy<00:05:42.560> cards<00:05:43.190> to<00:05:43.580> attack<00:05:44.230> it'll

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
any water energy cards to attack it'll

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.020 
any water energy cards to attack it'll
still<00:05:45.620> do<00:05:45.800> two<00:05:46.040> times<00:05:46.280> damage<00:05:46.820> to<00:05:47.150> Charmeleon

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
still do two times damage to Charmeleon

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.820 
still do two times damage to Charmeleon
so<00:05:50.030> that's<00:05:50.180> just<00:05:50.360> a<00:05:50.450> little<00:05:50.510> summary<00:05:50.960> on<00:05:51.290> the

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
so that's just a little summary on the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.460 
so that's just a little summary on the
differences<00:05:52.310> in<00:05:52.490> types<00:05:52.880> between<00:05:53.390> the<00:05:53.510> TCG<00:05:54.200> and

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
differences in types between the TCG and

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.820 
differences in types between the TCG and
the<00:05:54.650> actual<00:05:54.950> games<00:05:55.250> again<00:05:56.090> there<00:05:56.330> are<00:05:56.540> 10<00:05:57.050> TCG

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
the actual games again there are 10 TCG

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:05.880 
the actual games again there are 10 TCG
types<00:05:58.160> and<00:05:58.570> many<00:05:59.570> more<00:06:00.520> types<00:06:01.520> in<00:06:01.880> the<00:06:02.030> game<00:06:02.330> I

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.690 

believe<00:06:06.890> there<00:06:07.100> are<00:06:08.110> 19<00:06:09.110> types<00:06:10.040> in<00:06:10.370> the<00:06:10.460> game

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
believe there are 19 types in the game

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.100 
believe there are 19 types in the game
and<00:06:11.030> only<00:06:11.810> ten<00:06:12.410> types<00:06:12.770> in<00:06:13.100> the<00:06:13.730> TCG<00:06:14.390> another

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
and only ten types in the TCG another

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.310 
and only ten types in the TCG another
thing<00:06:15.380> that<00:06:15.500> I<00:06:15.530> wanted<00:06:15.860> to<00:06:15.920> mention<00:06:16.160> is<00:06:17.320> there

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
thing that I wanted to mention is there

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.440 
thing that I wanted to mention is there
are<00:06:18.440> things<00:06:18.620> called<00:06:18.800> Delta<00:06:19.520> species<00:06:19.970> Pokemon

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
are things called Delta species Pokemon

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.300 
are things called Delta species Pokemon
out<00:06:20.480> there<00:06:20.870> I<00:06:21.020> have<00:06:21.350> a<00:06:21.380> video<00:06:21.740> called<00:06:22.070> a<00:06:22.160> rare

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
out there I have a video called a rare

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.290 
out there I have a video called a rare
pokemon<00:06:22.850> cards<00:06:23.240> Delta<00:06:23.630> species<00:06:24.110> and<00:06:24.520> all<00:06:25.520> of

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
pokemon cards Delta species and all of

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.570 
pokemon cards Delta species and all of
those<00:06:26.570> cards<00:06:27.560> have<00:06:27.770> the<00:06:27.800> Pokemon<00:06:28.280> in<00:06:28.430> the

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
those cards have the Pokemon in the

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.180 
those cards have the Pokemon in the
shiny<00:06:29.060> version<00:06:29.720> and<00:06:29.930> whatever<00:06:30.470> color<00:06:30.890> their

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
shiny version and whatever color their

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.430 
shiny version and whatever color their
shiny<00:06:31.520> version<00:06:32.000> is<00:06:32.150> they<00:06:32.600> tried<00:06:32.870> to<00:06:32.900> match<00:06:33.200> up

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
shiny version is they tried to match up

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.610 
shiny version is they tried to match up
that<00:06:33.620> color<00:06:33.890> to<00:06:34.640> a<00:06:34.669> type<00:06:35.330> of<00:06:35.360> energy<00:06:35.720> so<00:06:36.410> you'll

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
that color to a type of energy so you'll

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.680 
that color to a type of energy so you'll
see<00:06:36.890> a

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
see a

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.220 
see a
Charizard<00:06:38.350> for<00:06:38.770> example<00:06:39.250> it's<00:06:40.240> shiny<00:06:40.720> version

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
Charizard for example it's shiny version

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.610 
Charizard for example it's shiny version
is<00:06:41.410> black<00:06:42.130> in<00:06:42.520> color<00:06:42.580> so<00:06:43.330> it<00:06:43.480> is<00:06:43.630> a<00:06:43.840> darkness

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
is black in color so it is a darkness

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.590 
is black in color so it is a darkness
card

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
card

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.000 
card
those<00:06:46.600> aren't<00:06:46.840> Fayette<00:06:47.200> cards<00:06:47.560> that's<00:06:47.800> just

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
those aren't Fayette cards that's just

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.450 
those aren't Fayette cards that's just
the<00:06:48.130> way<00:06:48.250> they<00:06:48.400> did<00:06:48.460> it<00:06:48.640> with<00:06:48.790> Delta<00:06:49.240> species

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
the way they did it with Delta species

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.130 
the way they did it with Delta species
so<00:06:51.460> I<00:06:51.490> hope<00:06:51.730> you<00:06:51.880> found<00:06:52.060> this<00:06:52.270> video<00:06:52.840> very
