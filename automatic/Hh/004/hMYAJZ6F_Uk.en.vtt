00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
fifth biggest country in the world so

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.260 
fifth biggest country in the world so
this<00:02:39.070> hundreds<00:02:39.550> of<00:02:39.610> countries<00:02:39.790> in<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> world

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
is the fifth biggest but it is the

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.740 
is the fifth biggest but it is the
smallest<00:02:43.180> continent<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.530> um<00:02:45.390> we're<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.660> only

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
smallest continent so um we're the only

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.710 
smallest continent so um we're the only
country<00:02:47.110> that's<00:02:47.530> also<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.860> continent<00:02:48.550> and

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
country that's also a continent and

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.660 
country that's also a continent and
we're<00:02:49.720> also<00:02:49.870> an<00:02:50.140> island<00:02:50.620> but<00:02:50.950> Antarctica<00:02:51.310> is

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
we're also an island but Antarctica is

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.620 
we're also an island but Antarctica is
also<00:02:51.970> an<00:02:52.060> island<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:53.549> here<00:02:54.549> is<00:02:54.820> Australia

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630

also an island so here is Australia
here's<00:02:56.049> Tasmania<00:02:56.739> then<00:02:57.610> up<00:02:57.910> here<00:02:58.200> here's

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
here's Tasmania then up here here's

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.520 
here's Tasmania then up here here's
Queensland<00:03:00.480> here's<00:03:01.480> New<00:03:01.720> South<00:03:01.930> Wales<00:03:01.989> and
