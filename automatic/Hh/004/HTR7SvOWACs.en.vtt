way we already see that mean October's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.200 
way we already see that mean October's
the<00:01:13.619> QB<00:01:13.950> which<00:01:14.130> means<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> boss<00:01:14.670> battles<00:01:15.090> are

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the QB which means the boss battles are

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
the QB which means the boss battles are
back<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.689> was<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> best

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
back and I was like one of the best

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.410 
back and I was like one of the best
things<00:01:17.130> about<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.640> storm<00:01:17.909> games<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.330> my

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
things about the storm games in my

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.990 
things about the storm games in my
opinion<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> epic<00:01:19.860> boss<00:01:20.280> battles<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
opinion is the epic boss battles and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.609 
opinion is the epic boss battles and
generations<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.630> took<00:01:21.810> them<00:01:21.960> out<00:01:22.080> because<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
generations they took them out because I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.770 
generations they took them out because I
guess<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:23.850> supposed<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> game<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
guess I just supposed to be a game of

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.060 
guess I just supposed to be a game of
bridge<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.960> gap<00:01:25.229> between<00:01:25.259> two<00:01:25.830> games

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
bridge the gap between two games

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
bridge the gap between two games
whatever<00:01:26.340> but<00:01:26.659> I'm<00:01:27.659> surprised<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.470> it's

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
whatever but I'm surprised that it's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.789 
whatever but I'm surprised that it's
coming<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.159> 2013<00:01:29.840> which<00:01:30.840> probably<00:01:31.350> means

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
coming out in 2013 which probably means

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.020 
coming out in 2013 which probably means
if<00:01:32.040> they<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.369> boss<00:01:32.520> battles<00:01:32.880> they've

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
if they have the boss battles they've

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.340 
if they have the boss battles they've
been<00:01:33.180> working<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.750> game<00:01:33.930> maybe<00:01:34.140> they

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
been working on this game maybe they

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.530 
been working on this game maybe they
were<00:01:34.439> working<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.970> generations<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> this

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
were working on generations and this

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.240 
were working on generations and this
game<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:36.869> something<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.680> thought<00:01:38.100> they

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
game or something because I thought they

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.710 
game or something because I thought they
would<00:01:38.280> take<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.759> two<00:01:39.000> years<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.600> we

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
would take like two years and we

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
would take like two years and we
wouldn't<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.140> seen<00:01:40.350> storm<00:01:40.770> 3<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> while

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
wouldn't have seen storm 3 for a while

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.139
