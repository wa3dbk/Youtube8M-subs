this off the off the cardboard it's

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.880 
this off the off the cardboard it's
thicker<00:00:57.559> than<00:00:57.710> I<00:00:57.860> want<00:00:58.160> it<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.370> be<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:58.789> I<00:00:58.820> split

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
thicker than I want it to be so I split

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.490 
thicker than I want it to be so I split
split<00:01:00.890> that<00:01:01.070> into<00:01:01.340> two<00:01:02.110> so<00:01:03.110> they<00:01:03.230> have<00:01:03.469> a

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
split that into two so they have a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.430 
split that into two so they have a
little<00:01:03.800> finer<00:01:04.160> tail<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.570> I'll<00:01:05.750> set<00:01:06.020> this<00:01:06.229> on

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
little finer tail and I'll set this on

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.260 
little finer tail and I'll set this on
top<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:10.720> take<00:01:11.720> some<00:01:11.990> wraps<00:01:12.289> down<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:14.000> about

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
top and take some wraps down to about

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.820 
top and take some wraps down to about
the<00:01:14.509> barb<00:01:15.160> and<00:01:16.160> then<00:01:16.490> I'll<00:01:16.990> wrap<00:01:17.990> it<00:01:18.259> back<00:01:18.530> up

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
the barb and then I'll wrap it back up

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.059 
the barb and then I'll wrap it back up
to<00:01:19.039> where<00:01:19.190> I<00:01:19.220> started<00:01:19.310> my<00:01:19.940> thread<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:21.009> then<00:01:22.009> I

to where I started my thread and then I

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.790 
to where I started my thread and then I
can<00:01:22.280> remove<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.789> tag<00:01:23.060> now<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.080> body<00:01:24.319> for<00:01:24.649> this

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
and I'll take one final look at it to

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.890 
and I'll take one final look at it to
make<00:03:33.640> sure<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.150> it's<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.450> right<00:03:35.550> volume<00:03:36.900> if

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
make sure that it's the right volume if

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.530 
make sure that it's the right volume if
it's<00:03:38.140> too<00:03:39.510> too<00:03:40.510> thick<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:41.110> can<00:03:42.150> select<00:03:43.150> some

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
it's too too thick you can select some

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.770 
it's too too thick you can select some
strands<00:03:43.930> out<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.380> there<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:45.540> also<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.630> make

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
strands out of there and also to make

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.780 
strands out of there and also to make
sure<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:48.450> you've<00:03:49.450> removed<00:03:49.540> any<00:03:50.020> of<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.790> tips

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790

sure that you've removed any of the tips
and<00:03:51.910> made<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.120> turn<00:03:52.570> themselves<00:03:52.810> around<00:03:56.040> then

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
and made a turn themselves around then

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.100 
and made a turn themselves around then
I'll<00:03:57.160> set<00:03:57.460> this<00:03:57.640> on<00:03:57.850> top<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.300> I<00:03:58.600> want<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.990> go

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
I'll set this on top and I want it to go

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.420 
I'll set this on top and I want it to go
about<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.620> length<00:03:59.950> of<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.880> overall<00:04:00.970> body<00:04:02.430> and

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
about the length of the overall body and

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
about the length of the overall body and
I'll<00:04:03.700> take<00:04:04.080> two<00:04:05.080> turns<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.860> then<00:04:06.820> pull<00:04:07.150> down

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.180 

that<00:04:10.450> will<00:04:10.660> flare<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:14.170> hair<00:04:14.410> I'll<00:04:14.830> make<00:04:15.040> sure
