00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello together today I have one 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.569
 tutorial for you and a soft one 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.670
 caprice i have one for myself 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.099
 software variants make- up because of me 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.780
 not all these photos on instagram 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.000
 so good for everyday life 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.100
 So if you take away the evening goes well 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.630
 any event on any one 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.730
 celebration 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.640
 Nevertheless , that would be this instagram 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.859
 Variations are much too hard for me, therefore 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.170
 I did the whole bit softer 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.029
 you can still see what a cut 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.940
 But grief is not that exaggerated 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.880
 like on all these famous photos 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.370
 if you are interested then stay 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.420
 But that's the way I am now the cabbage 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.940
 carlisle one of manhattan, though 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.670
 such a nice reading color I'll 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.370
 which now use as a base there is also 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.340
 These nix donators these very thick 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.980
 Pens in the paint way for example 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 memorial they are very practical 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 take care also to use as a base and then 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.619
 you have such a very bright color on the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.990
 But they also work well here 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.119
 if you with the pen right on 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.880
 song hurts then you can too 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:17.119
 a finger to a very generous 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.750
 and then matches the finger here so 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.750
 works even better 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.810
 I repeat this process now 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.440
 Do not forget the Danish angle 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.590
 so that does not slip into the wrinkles 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:47.429
 I'll just eyeshadow now 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.429
 give over it 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:06.849
 It is important to always look beautiful 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:09.129
 also a bit in the eye always so 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:12.220
 Now we come to the part what one 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:15.870
 battle praised mind namely the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.239
 caprice I'll be such a nice one now 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.349
 taking chocolate color is indeed 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.660
 The color instead and dark from the nose 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.970
 cosmetics palette can palette again 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.310
 I ran you around calling the infobox 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.920
 if you want to take along on trips 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.310
 the palette is good because there are many 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.769
 contain different shades and it 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.129
 are also immediately included colors 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.440
 That's why I always find it very good 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.510
 also travel sometimes when the looks too 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.980
 make-up then you do not have so much 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.599
 take along then you have different 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.930
 platforms and different 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.750
 I have so much love for myself 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.540
 a brush I think that could mean 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.099
 Trasch or point in gold I am 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.609
 not sure in any case, see the sun 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.609
 out 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.840
 Now let's take a blender brush 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.840
 and blind the whole thing 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.810
 Although I take back as a 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.520
 brush and go a very nice dark 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.520
 red purple color 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.080
 Now we come to the most important part 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.280
 Now we have to be pretty precise 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.360
 work 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:45.320
 I sit out here to make small 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.320
 points follow main class 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.549
 Now you are finally painting in 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.909
 my palm off because I 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.879
 I forgot to take handkerchiefs 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:09.230
 and it blends easily 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.230
 the same brush 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:19.229
 Now I'll take that again 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.389
 eyeshadow both with me the bright one 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.789
 paint applied and go completely 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.260
 easily over this place where the 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.360
 to meet both drivers 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.490
 We can not blind too much 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.060
 otherwise our caprice will disappear 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.289
 effects 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.080
 Now I will be my eyeliner 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.080
 pull and apply artificial eyelashes 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.680
 so while the eyelashes are drying 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.990
 I make the rest and that I take 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.789
 again this art deco color have the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.220
 also shown in the last tutorial 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.900
 The color is really very nice 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.490
 I will now at the bottom 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.490
 Apply eyelash wreath 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.770
 I use the whole with 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.770
 bahamarama 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.669
 I give the weapon lines one 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.520
 black kajalstift us was as always 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:45.219
 from yves rocher the kohl cabbage stick 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.219
 raise again in hand inner surface 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.789
 now the eyelashes are showered and 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.129
 Although with it's fix completely artificial 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.229
 eyelashes then wear it 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.990
 these zigzag movements do 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.680
 so that the artificial eyelashes 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.999
 stick my own 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:14.779
 also the hip comes a jud 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:16.250

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:18.710
 I will still have my lips 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.689
 subsequently with such a p2 cabbage 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.689
