artifact<00:03:10.569> is<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.750> little<00:03:11.110> darker<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:13.980> an<00:03:14.980> idea

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
artifact is a little darker so an idea

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.729 
artifact is a little darker so an idea
like<00:03:16.120> has<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> little<00:03:16.840> bit<00:03:16.959> more<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.410> gold

like has a little bit more of a gold
shimmer<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.680> that's<00:03:20.950> what<00:03:21.989> they<00:03:22.989> both

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
shimmer to it so that's what they both

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.800 
shimmer to it so that's what they both
look<00:03:23.500> like<00:03:23.709> but<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.220> idea<00:03:24.579> like<00:03:25.060> is<00:03:25.209> from<00:03:25.510> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
look like but this idea like is from the

look like but this idea like is from the
new<00:03:26.079> collection

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.429
