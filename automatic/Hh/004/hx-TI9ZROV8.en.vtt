00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.030
 or not 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.519
 very good to all guys that such as 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.379
 You are welcome to this new video in 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.120
 this new and the estuary that is a 6 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.500
 virus but we never see them very 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.780
 technical of more than all my impressions 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.449
 personal about this intuitive I hope 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.500
 you like it and well let's start in the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.029
 first point to touch is the appearance 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.250
 physical what you see when you do not touch 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.230
 I suppose that hand tub what is the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.080
 size a big size can be said 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 which is a fablet 5 + 5 inches something that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.950
 it has not been very usual in the past 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.329
 iphones had been a bit small in 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.670
 comparison with terminals with android 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.750
 high-end and lara that to me as 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.579
 you have gone before came from a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.989
 Accomplish one and you're a little more 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.250
 managed was the subject of the tablets 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.949
 so it was not a problem for me 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.690
 get used to this screen but 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.670
 I guess you guys watching one with 5s 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.289
 an iphone 5 or so if it's going to be a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.420
 little problem but it is to be formed 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.989
 I say you have a week or two they are going to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.829
 drink 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.289
 perfectly if you have a problem 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.609
 it also depends on the hand they have if 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.780
 is very large or if it is too small to put 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.789
 the issue in women while it has 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.989
 been a bit more complicated but I did not 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.820
 I would say the men and to add 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 pretty fast good the second point 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.929
 I want to touch the design theme 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.369
 to me personally I find it very nice 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:13.740
 but there are people who will find it horrible 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.539
 ugly or normal or very beautiful also like 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.490
 this, as I said, is subjective 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.170
 is not so much that reality is pretty or 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.179
 Ugly is sincerely something you see 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.590
 to me as I said it seems nice to me there is a 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.899
 tradition I like less other subjects 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.909
 like everything but now that the theme of 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.170
 depressive design nito and a point that 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.759
 also highlight is the theme of the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.380
 ergonomics I feel that a lot is missing 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.479
 Ergonomics this iphone as you can see is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.520
 for the subject of the lock button to 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.109
 me is a little up the nor the place of 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.659
 attack is where the top is 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.130
 now or of room not without because as 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.920
 you can see here if I put my hands 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.469
 as I usually use my iphone I get 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.869
 to the button I say the finger reaches me to the 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.729
 height of the sim slot and the object of 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.319
 be a lot of finger to reach her and 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.810
 that is also something that needs to be corrected 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.700
 also theme of the frames a theme that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.979
 frontally the top part of that 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.479
 speaker for the call the camera there 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.509
 a lot of space and that can honestly 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.829
 trim to remove weight to the device 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.229
 that sincerely like the aluminum 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.759
 Yes although some times also 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.319
 subject that is totally flat by the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.000
 back no longer any curve 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.950
 that you will have a good grip on the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.720
 hand the weakest part like for example 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.910
 Uruguay that is not very round but 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.989
 it also has a little round is for 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.720
 so that your hand fits perfectly 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.640
 on the phone and if we have already high 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.989
 nothing more than everything and a one more vote 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.300
 light touch that the battery theme 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.220
 is entering more to the hardware issue are 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.170
 two thousand 215 milliamps not bad memory 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.060
 I realize that the issue of 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.700
 tablets between bigger ones are hand you 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.200
 flame and you can get in and obviously like 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.269
 although it is more screen also that 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.280
 You must have to consume battery 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.900
 the truth that to me for example that 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.400
 be of iphones even if I wake up 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.950
 more or less every day like at 9 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.290
 in the morning and I go to bed like at 12 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.760
 1 and that battle I have a 30 or until 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.500
 a 25 battery project the relationship 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.269
 incredible head face and I when I 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.040
 get up off the charging socket is me 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.510
 I charge it at night more or less than 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.640
 that I lie down until I get up 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.019
 then it connected and two of time it reaches me 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.360
 no problem all day until it 's already 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.030
 you have left looking at the battery digit and 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.860
 that's something that with 15 and 17 could 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.690
 do had to drop babies daily 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.190
 more or less as at 6 and had 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.620
 half percent and then in charge to 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.890
 that will lift the wings 10 or 12 of the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.540
 night 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.519
 They will honestly ask themselves what is the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.870
 strongest point or the most radical point 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.230
 when switching from an iphone 5 to that one 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.379
 example 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.030
 the abbot had evidently never had 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.069
 an experience without a crown and the theme of 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.629
 the battery and a flame the whole subject of 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.010
 software I've always had it with the 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.129
 today the first day I buy it 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.159
 solved at this point 1.2 with 8.1 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.019
 points 2 forgiveness and put immediately 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.150
 serial brick law honestly do not even use it 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.420
 ni albert park trainer abel a boxing 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.560
 and comfortable two hours tells the hellville 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.390
 then I will comment on the software 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.040
 is with gamer and for example the light of the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.900
 king to live and that came the integrated with 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.400
 the software what yes the 12 times to 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.019
 home button you go to the screen 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.849
 slightly I thought I was going to 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.769
 use but it has saved me since many 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.959
 uncomfortable times to get to the 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.519
 part above that the vrac if I use it 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.500
 It seems a very good success on the part of 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.359
 I support implementing those functions and not 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.090
 honestly and tax with one hand 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.410
 would be the theme of the touch of a theme that 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.450
 the truth in telecinco is if I failed 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.430
 very much but not very much but more or 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.680
 minus two out of five is not silent and 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.289
 the truth that if what goes very much to each 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.760
 that's how it is for this and I have to say 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.130
 that since I have the iPhone 6 plus not 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.840
 I'm not even once and according to me 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.050
 had had a technical improvement by 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.759
 part of apple that bought a better touch 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.590
 fast so I really do not know what they have 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.720
 done but also at least as 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.789
 better the theme of the screen as I already 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.430
 I said a 5 inch screen a fabri 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.110
 fully full hd has a good color 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.240
 a good shine do not have first 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.039
 conclusion that was that under the sun the 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.710
 screen a bit like he discovered a 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.270
 little bit and it did not look really good from 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.669
 the iphone 5 screen always what 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.750
 I have my automatic so when I'm 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.680
 we sell for a single document the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.050
 shine and you will see that I do not have my 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.460
 problem and seeing the letters for example 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.470
 a web page 'www so perfectly 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.780
 I can be under the sun and from the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.889
 far 6 blues screen good after 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.509
 we have the side of an audio that the 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.009
 true that people who play a lot that 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.199
 he listens to a lot of music and headphones and 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.030
 videos on youtube a lot in the wta 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.680
 that will leave a lot like me the truth 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.479
 which has very good audio 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.120
 High quality shower a stereo audio 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.919
 listen very loudly also that something that is 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.150
 a point to value and the truth that no 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.120
 had no problem if he loses points 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.430
 playing and that is has not passed the 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.830
 horizontal tops the speakers with the 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.460
 fingers something you have to find the 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.840
 way for the speakers but good 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.030
 part of that I honestly did not have 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.640
 no listens very well and 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.640
 perfect on this topic we do not have the 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.520
 camera the 8 megapixel camera a 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.260
 camera that little improvement of 5 of its 6 if 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.030
 it is true that having the screen more 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.860
 great is good at least they have the 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.590
 impression that it's a bit better but 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.750
 sincerely there has not been if you eat a lot 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.610
 better in that the front camera like 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.070
 I think it's 1.2 megapixels which 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.110
 I remember it looks very good and well there's no 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.320
 a lot to say in the camera we do not have 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.470
 the price the price I think is already a 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.300
 hardest point to decide whether to buy 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.160
 this iphone or not this depends more or 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.990
 less of the economic issue but good if 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.880
 you have the money will also depend on 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.990
 what device come and if what I have 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.120
 said in the video or has been convinced 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.370
 to change to this iphone rose 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.020
 then but this video is used I know 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.480
 that I do not do much video like that 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.680
 reviews and so if you like it then if 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.710
 they want me to do more about others 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.810
 exclusive as diverse cell phones 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.820
 high-end or so theater made so no 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.200
 say goodbye melo and I do not say I'm going to 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.440
 do but I have it in mind the least 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.670
 If you ask me many, why not? 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.770
 keep in mind to do it in step 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.360
 some videos of tasting difference not 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.759
 forget to like it if you liked commenting 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.500
 in this video also with those 20 for 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.590

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.430
 good and match we all see each other videos 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.430
 goodbye
