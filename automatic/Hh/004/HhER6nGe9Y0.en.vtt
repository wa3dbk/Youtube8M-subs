00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
also this is my setup at right now with

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.029 
also this is my setup at right now with
my<00:00:49.410> interface<00:00:50.090> usually<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:52.010> like<00:00:53.010> my

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
my interface usually I have like my

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.529 
my interface usually I have like my
runescape<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.789> side<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> screen<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
runescape on one side of the screen and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.790 
runescape on one side of the screen and
YouTube<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> other<00:00:55.199> that's<00:00:55.469> why<00:00:55.620> it's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
YouTube on the other that's why it's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.830 
YouTube on the other that's why it's
pretty<00:00:56.160> narrow<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:57.059> my<00:00:57.180> screens<00:00:57.449> pretty<00:00:57.690> now

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
pretty narrow like my screens pretty now

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.360 
pretty narrow like my screens pretty now
I<00:00:57.870> could<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.320> full<00:00:58.590> screen<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
I could have it full screen but it

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.189 
I could have it full screen but it
restricts<00:01:00.210> me<00:01:00.329> from<00:01:00.359> doing<00:01:00.690> other<00:01:00.809> things<00:01:00.899> on

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
restricts me from doing other things on

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.920 
restricts me from doing other things on
my<00:01:01.230> computer<00:01:01.829> which<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.219> don't<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.930> you

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
bit of trouble with the tackle actually

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.080 
bit of trouble with the tackle actually
the<00:02:56.110> branch<00:02:56.560> chats<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.860> bit<00:02:57.010> dead<00:02:57.220> right<00:02:57.430> now<00:02:57.459> so

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
the branch chats a bit dead right now so

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.570 
the branch chats a bit dead right now so
not<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.110> lot<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.320> people<00:02:59.620> are<00:02:59.770> compiling<00:03:00.190> and

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
not a lot of people are compiling and

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.449 
not a lot of people are compiling and
calling<00:03:01.300> out<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.900> tackle<00:03:02.350> so<00:03:02.860> I've<00:03:03.070> got<00:03:03.250> four

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
calling out the tackle so I've got four

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.030 
calling out the tackle so I've got four
out<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.640> six<00:03:04.230> hopefully<00:03:05.230> we<00:03:05.620> can<00:03:05.740> find<00:03:05.890> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
out of six hopefully we can find the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.550 
out of six hopefully we can find the
last<00:03:06.190> two<00:03:06.430> in<00:03:07.270> three<00:03:07.600> minutes<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.410> that's

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
last two in three minutes so that's

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.090 
last two in three minutes so that's
pretty<00:03:08.860> cutting<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.790> pretty<00:03:09.820> fine<00:03:10.440> hmm<00:03:11.440> maybe

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
pretty cutting it pretty fine hmm maybe

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.920 
pretty cutting it pretty fine hmm maybe
that's<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.940> think<00:03:13.510> slim<00:03:14.910> 11<00:03:15.910> I'm<00:03:16.510> not<00:03:16.660> sure<00:03:16.720> if

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
that's I think slim 11 I'm not sure if

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.060 
that's I think slim 11 I'm not sure if
that's<00:03:17.050> for<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.610> river<00:03:18.610> one<00:03:18.810> let's<00:03:19.810> see<00:03:20.110> hmm

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
that's for the river one let's see hmm

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.040 
that's for the river one let's see hmm
yes<00:03:21.519> okay<00:03:22.000> we<00:03:22.180> got<00:03:22.330> one<00:03:22.450> more<00:03:22.480> at<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.780> beach

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
which is that was way far up anyway this

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.310 
which is that was way far up anyway this
is<00:03:27.790> probably<00:03:27.970> really<00:03:28.120> boring<00:03:28.570> off<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.050> didn't

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320
