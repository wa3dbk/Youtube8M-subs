00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
kick and you'll do the the spin ball

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.279 
kick and you'll do the the spin ball
while<00:00:17.699> you're<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:17.910> there<00:00:18.000> still<00:00:21.140> second<00:00:22.140> one

while you're in there still second one
is<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.890> double<00:00:23.789> spin<00:00:24.029> ball

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.910

all right input the pro move right is
hit<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.040> ground<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:42.250> one<00:00:42.489> a<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:43.840> to<00:00:43.960> pause

right<00:00:44.800> after<00:00:45.129> that<00:00:45.280> last<00:00:45.460> kick<00:00:45.790> before<00:00:46.000> you<00:00:46.269> do

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
right after that last kick before you do

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.530 
right after that last kick before you do
the<00:00:46.570> spin

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.120 

this<00:00:55.540> one<00:00:55.720> there's<00:00:55.930> you<00:00:56.320> just<00:00:56.470> have<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.710> learn

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
this one there's you just have to learn

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.180 
this one there's you just have to learn
the<00:00:57.310> timing<00:00:57.640> between<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:58.000> two<00:00:58.150> punches<00:00:59.190> well

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
the timing between the two punches well

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.740 
the timing between the two punches well
there's<00:01:01.060> four<00:01:01.240> parts<00:01:01.540> part<00:01:01.840> 1<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:03.160> 2<00:01:03.690> part<00:01:04.690> 3

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
there's four parts part 1 or 2 part 3

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.160 
there's four parts part 1 or 2 part 3
and<00:01:05.260> then<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:05.590> start<00:01:05.830> part<00:01:06.070> 4<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.900> on<00:01:08.050> the

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
and then you start part 4 just on the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.580 
and then you start part 4 just on the
time<00:01:08.350> in<00:01:08.500> between<00:01:08.530> part<00:01:09.010> 3<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:09.520> part<00:01:10.030> 4<00:01:10.270> I<00:01:10.590> just

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
time in between part 3 and part 4 I just

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.560 
time in between part 3 and part 4 I just
practicing<00:01:12.130> one<00:01:12.340> punch<00:01:12.610> right<00:01:13.150> after<00:01:13.480> the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
practicing one punch right after the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.160 
practicing one punch right after the
other<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.920> learning<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.630> shortest

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
other and learning the the shortest

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.820 
other and learning the the shortest
timing<00:01:20.590> between<00:01:20.980> the<00:01:21.730> two<00:01:21.910> punches<00:01:22.830> not

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
timing between the two punches not

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:37.410 
timing between the two punches not
double<00:01:24.220> punches<00:01:24.550> but<00:01:25.450> single<00:01:25.810> punches<00:01:36.420> this

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
double punches but single punches this

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.300 
double punches but single punches this
one<00:01:37.600> I'm<00:01:38.290> not<00:01:38.470> mistaken<00:01:38.619> it's<00:01:39.040> been<00:01:39.160> a<00:01:39.190> while

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
one I'm not mistaken it's been a while

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.620 
one I'm not mistaken it's been a while
since<00:01:39.460> I've<00:01:39.640> done<00:01:39.670> it's<00:01:40.000> easier<00:01:40.300> if<00:01:40.420> you're

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
since I've done it's easier if you're

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.930 
since I've done it's easier if you're
not<00:01:41.140> at<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.350> wall<00:01:41.590> but<00:01:41.770> near<00:01:42.040> it<00:01:42.130> so<00:01:42.640> that<00:01:42.790> the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
not at a wall but near it so that the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.749 
not at a wall but near it so that the
double<00:01:43.270> spin<00:01:43.479> will<00:01:43.690> connect

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.280 

thank<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.659> pret<00:01:51.899> learn<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
thank for this one just pret learn the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.840 
thank for this one just pret learn the
pro<00:01:52.530> move<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.310> should<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.520> able<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
pro move and you should be able to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.520 
pro move and you should be able to
complete<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.270> combo<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:55.200> too<00:01:55.380> much

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
complete this combo with not too much

complete this combo with not too much
trouble<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.539> what<00:02:03.720> gives<00:02:03.840> me

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
trouble this one is what gives me

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.510 
trouble this one is what gives me
trouble<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.860> down<00:02:05.070> punch

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
trouble because of the down punch

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.880 
trouble because of the down punch
followed<00:02:05.970> by<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.119> spin<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.679> to<00:02:07.770> be

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
followed by the spin you just have to be

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.160 
followed by the spin you just have to be
super<00:02:08.160> fast<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:09.300> make<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.630> connect<00:02:12.170> that's

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
super fast to make that connect that's

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.559 
super fast to make that connect that's
all<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.349> can<00:02:13.560> say<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.739> just<00:02:14.209> practice<00:02:15.209> your

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
all I can say is just practice your

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:26.150 
all I can say is just practice your
speed<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:22.260> one<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:23.060> usually<00:02:24.060> start<00:02:24.390> off<00:02:25.160> with

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
speed this one I usually start off with

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.780 
speed this one I usually start off with
my<00:02:26.280> back<00:02:26.519> at<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> wall<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.640> make<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
my back at a wall so that I can make the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:38.300 
my back at a wall so that I can make the
last<00:02:30.000> part<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.360> combo<00:02:30.630> easier<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.830> for

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
last part of the combo easier and for

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.789 
last part of the combo easier and for
his<00:02:38.430> tip<00:02:38.640> one<00:02:42.260> at<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.350> end<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.620> comma

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
his tip one at the end of the comma

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.080 
his tip one at the end of the comma
you're<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.190> have<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> knife<00:02:44.519> followed<00:02:45.060> by

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
you're going to have a knife followed by

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.410 
you're going to have a knife followed by
spin<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:46.580> haven't<00:02:47.580> got<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.849> timing<00:02:48.090> for<00:02:48.390> that

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
spin I haven't got the timing for that

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.180 
spin I haven't got the timing for that
down<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.870> an<00:02:48.959> exact<00:02:49.290> science<00:02:49.500> all<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.040> say

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
down to an exact science all I can say

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.310 
down to an exact science all I can say
it's<00:02:50.340> practice<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.970> you're<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.079> want

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
it's practice it you're going to want

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.009 
it's practice it you're going to want
Green<00:02:53.250> Lantern<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.880> as<00:02:54.450> high<00:02:54.720> up<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:54.989> the

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
need to let him follow just a little bit

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:42.550 
need to let him follow just a little bit
longer<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:31.490> that<00:03:31.520> that<00:03:31.820> knife<00:03:32.330> does<00:03:32.690> connect
