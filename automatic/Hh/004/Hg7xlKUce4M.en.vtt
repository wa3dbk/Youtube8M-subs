00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
but you know there's everything is here

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.340 
but you know there's everything is here
now<00:01:23.380> in<00:01:23.740> terms<00:01:24.039> of<00:01:24.249> food<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:24.789> in<00:01:24.999> music<00:01:25.420> the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
now in terms of food and in music the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.859 
now in terms of food and in music the
only<00:01:26.469> difference<00:01:26.979> is<00:01:27.249> historically<00:01:27.999> we

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
only difference is historically we

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.319 
only difference is historically we
haven't<00:01:29.200> been<00:01:29.409> able<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.740> get<00:01:30.069> our<00:01:30.369> films<00:01:30.999> and

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
haven't been able to get our films and

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.099 
haven't been able to get our films and
art<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:31.990> think<00:01:32.679> that<00:01:32.799> that's<00:01:32.979> still<00:01:33.280> a<00:01:33.340> huge<00:01:33.819> gap

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
art I think that that's still a huge gap

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.899 
art I think that that's still a huge gap
and<00:01:35.109> an<00:01:35.530> opportunity<00:01:36.249> and<00:01:36.460> that<00:01:36.549> was<00:01:36.729> really

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
and an opportunity and that was really

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.940 
and an opportunity and that was really
the<00:01:37.030> impetus<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.840> meaning<00:01:38.289> founding<00:01:38.770> a

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
the impetus of meaning founding a

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.529 
the impetus of meaning founding a
Caribbean<00:01:39.579> and<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.939> Flatbush<00:01:40.299> World

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
Caribbean and the Flatbush World

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.109 
Caribbean and the Flatbush World

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
film and and we still I would say that's

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:47.039 
film and and we still I would say that's
our<00:01:45.069> strongest<00:01:45.520> program<00:01:46.030> but<00:01:46.539> now<00:01:46.749> we've
