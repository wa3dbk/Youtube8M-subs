early<00:00:23.329> in<00:00:23.419> our<00:00:23.480> careers<00:00:23.900> we<00:00:24.140> worked<00:00:24.380> both<00:00:24.589> as

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:24.829 
early in our careers we worked both as

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.669 
early in our careers we worked both as
trauma<00:00:25.159> surgeons<00:00:25.759> as<00:00:26.140> intensive<00:00:27.140> care<00:00:27.319> unit

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679

physicians as general surgeons and as

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.099 
physicians as general surgeons and as
minimally<00:00:31.519> invasive<00:00:31.609> surgeons<00:00:32.539> and<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:32.960> we

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:33.109 
minimally invasive surgeons and so we

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:35.680 
minimally invasive surgeons and so we
had<00:00:33.320> a<00:00:33.350> broad<00:00:33.769> base<00:00:34.160> of<00:00:34.190> experience<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:35.180> over

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
had a broad base of experience and over

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.479 
had a broad base of experience and over
the<00:00:35.780> years<00:00:36.079> we've<00:00:36.320> honed<00:00:36.620> our<00:00:36.769> skills<00:00:36.829> and

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
the years we've honed our skills and

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
they're well weight loss patients need a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.340 
they're well weight loss patients need a
safety<00:01:07.700> net<00:01:07.910> and<00:01:08.300> what<00:01:08.360> we<00:01:08.480> try<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.780> do

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
safety net and what we try to do

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.810 
safety net and what we try to do
everything<00:01:09.800> in<00:01:09.890> our<00:01:09.980> power<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.610> be<00:01:10.790> that

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
everything in our power to be that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.240 
everything in our power to be that
safety<00:01:11.330> net<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:11.900> when<00:01:12.110> they<00:01:12.230> lose<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.800> weight

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
safety net so when they lose the weight

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.730 
safety net so when they lose the weight
they<00:01:13.700> don't<00:01:14.000> regain<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.660> weight<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.140> they

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
they don't regain the weight and they

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.860 
they don't regain the weight and they
add<00:01:15.950> both<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.670> quantity<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.540> quality

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
add both the quantity and the quality

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.600 
add both the quantity and the quality
for<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.410> long<00:01:18.590> term<00:01:18.860> with<00:01:19.190> weight<00:01:19.400> loss

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
for the long term with weight loss

for the long term with weight loss
surgery<00:01:20.030> we<00:01:20.180> see<00:01:20.390> our<00:01:20.510> patients<00:01:20.720> every<00:01:21.290> three

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
the center from the ground up so we said

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.820 
the center from the ground up so we said
