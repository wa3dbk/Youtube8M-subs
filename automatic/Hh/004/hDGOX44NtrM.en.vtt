00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
has this problem as you can even give

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.350 
has this problem as you can even give
you<00:00:38.970> there's<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.860> squeaky<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.360> inside

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
you there's a lot of squeaky it's inside

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.400 
you there's a lot of squeaky it's inside
it's<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.040> tap<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:44.700> cracked<00:00:45.270> yet<00:00:45.540> but

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
it's not the tap is not cracked yet but

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.960 
it's not the tap is not cracked yet but
looks<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.739> that's<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> way<00:00:47.370> strong<00:00:47.730> he's

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
looks like that's the way strong he's

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.770 
looks like that's the way strong he's
getting<00:00:48.329> soft<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> pretty<00:00:49.559> soon<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.100> fully<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
getting soft and pretty soon is fully to

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.389 
getting soft and pretty soon is fully to
crack<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.470> what<00:00:52.680> we're<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.950> to<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.190> we're

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
crack so what we're going to do we're

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.780 
crack so what we're going to do we're
going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.719> reinforce<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.140> bottom<00:00:55.350> by<00:00:55.920> making

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
going to reinforce the bottom by making

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.660 
going to reinforce the bottom by making
some<00:00:56.969> holes<00:00:57.260> then<00:00:58.260> inject<00:00:58.890> these<00:00:59.100> foam<00:00:59.399> but

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
some holes then inject these foam but

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.490 
some holes then inject these foam but
it's<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.210> very<00:01:00.270> very<00:01:00.840> strong<00:01:01.200> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
it's going to get very very strong and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.880 
it's going to get very very strong and
so<00:01:02.280> that's<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> give<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.930> strength

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so that's going to give it the strength

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.849 
so that's going to give it the strength
so<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.309> does<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.759> have<00:01:06.450> any<00:01:06.659> distress<00:01:07.499> in<00:01:07.740> it

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:07.859 
so it does not have any distress in it

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.489 
so it does not have any distress in it
that<00:01:08.579> it<00:01:08.729> will<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:08.999> collapse<00:01:09.479> later<00:01:09.929> on<00:01:10.259> and

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:10.499 
that it will not collapse later on and

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:13.580 
that it will not collapse later on and
crack<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.249> so<00:01:11.939> once<00:01:12.569> we're<00:01:12.810> done<00:01:13.020> we'll<00:01:13.350> show

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
crack and so once we're done we'll show

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.239 
crack and so once we're done we'll show
you<00:01:13.619> how<00:01:14.039> looks<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:16.200> we'll<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.189> you

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:17.249 
you how looks like and we'll see you

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.629 
you how looks like and we'll see you
soon

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:17.639 
soon

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:19.819 
soon
so<00:01:18.240> now<00:01:18.420> we're<00:01:18.689> done<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:18.899> this<00:01:19.200> project<00:01:19.439> and

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
so now we're done with this project and

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.980

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.529 
let me show you this is the white and we
cuffed<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.799> all<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.130> around<00:01:31.459> and<00:01:32.459> what<00:01:33.179> you<00:01:33.299> see

down at the bottom is the slip resistant

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.109 
down at the bottom is the slip resistant
map<00:01:35.999> you<00:01:36.299> cannot<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> very<00:01:37.139> good<00:01:37.499> because

map you cannot see it very good because

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.870 
map you cannot see it very good because
the<00:01:39.119> color<00:01:39.359> blends<00:01:39.869> perfectly<00:01:40.139> the<00:01:40.590> same<00:01:40.880> but

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the color blends perfectly the same but

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:53.850
