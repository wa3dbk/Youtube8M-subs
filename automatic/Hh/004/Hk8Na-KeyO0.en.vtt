00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
gave the idea of the universe that's a

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.249 
gave the idea of the universe that's a
really<00:01:46.179> tough<00:01:46.389> one<00:01:46.450> it's<00:01:46.749> kind<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.020> like<00:01:47.139> this

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
listen to the fans a lot of it was kind

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.440 
listen to the fans a lot of it was kind
of<00:01:53.229> we<00:01:53.710> had<00:01:53.859> all<00:01:53.950> these<00:01:54.069> modes<00:01:54.340> like<00:01:54.609> WB<00:01:55.030> rivals

of we had all these modes like WB rivals

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.090 
of we had all these modes like WB rivals
exhibition<00:01:55.960> title<00:01:56.289> matches<00:01:56.439> career<00:01:56.859> and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
exhibition title matches career and

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.039

telephone booth apparently I

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.020 
telephone booth apparently I
see<00:04:18.530> this<00:04:18.650> recently<00:04:19.040> because<00:04:19.220> this<00:04:19.610> game<00:04:19.820> so

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
see this recently because this game so

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.280 
see this recently because this game so
big<00:04:20.270> so<00:04:20.420> we<00:04:20.480> work<00:04:20.630> on<00:04:20.690> different<00:04:20.960> areas<00:04:21.020> but

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
big so we work on different areas but

big so we work on different areas but
yeah<00:04:21.710> I<00:04:21.740> think<00:04:21.830> it's<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.490> fans<00:04:22.670> kind<00:04:22.910> of

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
yeah I think it's a the fans kind of

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.170 
yeah I think it's a the fans kind of
wanted<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.300> like<00:04:23.360> last<00:04:23.840> year<00:04:24.730> or<00:04:25.730> in<00:04:25.970> years

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
wanted it like last year or in years

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.060 
wanted it like last year or in years
past<00:04:26.420> we'd<00:04:26.660> have<00:04:26.780> these<00:04:26.870> cool<00:04:27.170> like<00:04:27.470> cutscenes

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
past we'd have these cool like cutscenes

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.560 
past we'd have these cool like cutscenes
happen<00:04:28.490> or<00:04:28.610> little<00:04:28.820> areas<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.450> rotor

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
happen or little areas of rotor

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.550 
happen or little areas of rotor
estimating<00:04:29.960> but<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.110> can<00:04:30.200> really<00:04:30.350> couldn't

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
estimating but you can really couldn't

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.410 
estimating but you can really couldn't
replay<00:04:30.860> them<00:04:31.010> so<00:04:31.490> now<00:04:31.640> I<00:04:31.670> think<00:04:31.850> we<00:04:32.030> tied<00:04:32.300> it

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
replay them so now I think we tied it

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.660 
replay them so now I think we tied it
into<00:04:32.570> one<00:04:32.960> of<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.110> storylines<00:04:33.410> that<00:04:33.830> will<00:04:33.950> be

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
into one of the storylines that will be

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.420 
into one of the storylines that will be
renamed<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:35.180> remain<00:04:36.020> nameless<00:04:36.260> but<00:04:37.040> what

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
renamed that remain nameless but what

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.220 
renamed that remain nameless but what
you<00:04:37.490> do<00:04:37.610> is<00:04:37.640> you<00:04:37.850> go<00:04:38.000> into<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.510> telephone
