00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
haven't collapsed Aquarius the end of it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.899 
haven't collapsed Aquarius the end of it
whenever<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.830> see<00:01:17.070> him<00:01:17.130> outside<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
whenever I see him outside of the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
whenever I see him outside of the
commentary<00:01:18.330> box<00:01:18.360> he's<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> bar

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
commentary box he's just is it the bar

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.640 
commentary box he's just is it the bar
so<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:20.580> exactly<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.030> good<00:01:21.270> good<00:01:22.080> start<00:01:22.350> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
so it's not exactly a good good start I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.289 
so it's not exactly a good good start I
don't<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.729> they'll<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.119> much

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
don't know if they'll have that much

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.450 
don't know if they'll have that much
energy<00:01:24.570> from<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.080> yeah<00:01:25.470> I'd<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.040> need<00:01:26.159> meat

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
energy from that yeah I'd you need meat

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.219

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
for protein normally don't use do you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.200 
for protein normally don't use do you
know<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.710> Joe<00:01:29.250> could<00:01:29.729> be<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.060> with

know what I think Joe could be in with

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.880 
know what I think Joe could be in with
very<00:01:30.450> good<00:01:30.600> chance<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.170> getting<00:01:31.320> good<00:01:31.680> time

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
very good chance of getting good time
