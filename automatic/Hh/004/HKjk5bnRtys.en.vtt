00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.389 

all<00:00:01.260> right<00:00:01.410> I<00:00:01.439> wasn't<00:00:01.680> gonna<00:00:01.770> do<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.250> video

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
all right I wasn't gonna do this video

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.539 
all right I wasn't gonna do this video
but<00:00:02.850> I<00:00:03.510> just<00:00:03.659> scraped<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.920> algae<00:00:05.250> off<00:00:05.370> the

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
but I just scraped the algae off the

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.430 
but I just scraped the algae off the
class<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.120> it's<00:00:06.569> kind<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.930> perfect<00:00:07.109> time

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
class so it's kind of the perfect time

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.419 
class so it's kind of the perfect time
to<00:00:07.529> do<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:07.740> because<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.980> can<00:00:08.069> actually<00:00:08.309> see

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
to do it because you can actually see

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.970 
to do it because you can actually see
what<00:00:08.580> I'm<00:00:08.639> talking<00:00:08.940> about<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:10.200> put<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.710> a

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
what I'm talking about so I put in a

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.509 
what I'm talking about so I put in a
maxi<00:00:11.490> jet<00:00:11.730> 900<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.019> back<00:00:13.349> left<00:00:13.559> corner<00:00:14.009> you

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
maxi jet 900 in the back left corner you

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.880 
maxi jet 900 in the back left corner you
can<00:00:14.549> see<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:14.940> up<00:00:15.059> there<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.410> reason<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.680> did

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
can see it up there and the reason I did

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.590 
can see it up there and the reason I did
that<00:00:16.920> was<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.279> increase<00:00:17.580> some<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.359> flow

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
that was to increase some of the flow

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.019 
that was to increase some of the flow
and<00:00:18.750> circulation<00:00:18.840> through<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> tank<00:00:19.880> get<00:00:20.880> rid

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
and circulation through the tank get rid

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.050 
and circulation through the tank get rid
of<00:00:21.119> some<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.480> dead<00:00:21.689> spots<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.939> since<00:00:23.939> I'm

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
of some of the dead spots and since I'm

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.730 
of some of the dead spots and since I'm
only<00:00:24.180> running<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:24.570> cancer<00:00:25.109> filter<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> really

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
only running one cancer filter I really

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.349 
only running one cancer filter I really
wanted<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.160> push<00:00:26.840> all<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.900> particulate

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
wanted it to push all that particulate

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.380 
wanted it to push all that particulate
back<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.779> intake<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:32.099> much<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.940> could<00:00:33.000> so

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
back to the intake as much as I could so

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.549 
back to the intake as much as I could so
running<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.320> sponge<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:36.230> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.290> see

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
running a sponge on this one you can see

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.369 
running a sponge on this one you can see
it<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:38.149> and<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.300> mean<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.510> makes<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.230> big

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
it there and I mean it makes a big

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.049 
it there and I mean it makes a big
difference<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.829> feel<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.219> every<00:00:41.489> two<00:00:41.670> days<00:00:41.820> or

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
difference I feel like every two days or

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.700 
difference I feel like every two days or
so<00:00:42.239> I'm<00:00:42.450> squeezing<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.170> thing<00:00:43.379> out<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
so I'm squeezing that thing out and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
so I'm squeezing that thing out and
there's<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.100> ton<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:45.270> know<00:00:45.360> goos<00:00:45.660> it's

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
there's a ton of you know goos it's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.459 
there's a ton of you know goos it's
coming<00:00:46.079> out<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.030> I've<00:00:48.030> got<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.469> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
coming out of it so I've got the the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.860 
coming out of it so I've got the the
flow<00:00:49.710> head<00:00:49.980> pointing<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.390> front<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
flow head pointing at the front of the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.020 
flow head pointing at the front of the
glass<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.280> trying<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.000> trying

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
glass so I'm trying to do is I'm trying

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.450 
glass so I'm trying to do is I'm trying
to<00:00:54.270> create<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.410> return<00:00:55.770> circulation

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
to create this this return circulation

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.680 
to create this this return circulation
over<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.690> intake<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> plants<00:01:00.600> are

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
over to the the intake the plants are

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.740 
over to the the intake the plants are
swaying<00:01:01.199> nicely<00:01:01.649> which<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.280> really<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
swaying nicely which I really like and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.140 
swaying nicely which I really like and
since<00:01:04.229> I've<00:01:04.379> put<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.830> I'm<00:01:05.549> not<00:01:05.760> getting<00:01:06.000> all

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
since I've put it in I'm not getting all

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.950 
since I've put it in I'm not getting all
of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.479> stuff<00:01:07.290> building<00:01:07.770> up<00:01:07.890> down<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.960> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
of the stuff building up down it the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.800 
of the stuff building up down it the
substrate<00:01:10.439> level<00:01:11.119> so<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> mean<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.540> see

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
substrate level so I mean you can see

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.899 
substrate level so I mean you can see
how<00:01:14.780> much<00:01:15.780> flow<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.470> kicking<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.610> mean

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
how much flow it's kicking out I mean

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.190 
how much flow it's kicking out I mean
that<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> fish<00:01:18.360> are<00:01:18.479> swimming<00:01:18.600> against<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that the fish are swimming against it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.050 
that the fish are swimming against it
there<00:01:19.350> look<00:01:19.560> they're<00:01:19.770> enjoying<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
there look they're enjoying it and the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.810 
there look they're enjoying it and the
plants<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.479> moving<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.530> typically<00:01:23.009> with

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
plants are moving and typically with

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.219 
plants are moving and typically with
these<00:01:24.000> plants<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.600> where<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> lot

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
these plants this is where I get a lot

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770 
these plants this is where I get a lot
of<00:01:25.380> buildup<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.920> between<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> roots<00:01:26.780> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
of buildup in between the roots and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.890 
of buildup in between the roots and
things<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.479> seeing<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
things like that and I'm not seeing it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.380 
things like that and I'm not seeing it
so<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.650> great<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.720> come<00:01:34.020> around<00:01:34.140> here

so it's great so you come around here

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.859 
so it's great so you come around here
check<00:01:36.390> out<00:01:36.509> what's<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.100> intake

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
check out what's going on at the intake

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.280 
check out what's going on at the intake
there<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.110> proof<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.920> concept<00:01:42.110> see<00:01:43.110> all<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
there it is proof of concept see all the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.080 
there it is proof of concept see all the
circulation

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.180 

the<00:01:46.540> circulating<00:01:47.049> particular<00:01:47.680> going<00:01:47.860> into

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
the circulating particular going into

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.120 
the circulating particular going into
the<00:01:48.280> filter<00:01:49.200> awesome<00:01:50.200> that's<00:01:50.500> exactly<00:01:50.979> what<00:01:51.100> I
