evolutionary biology scientists have

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.470 
evolutionary biology scientists have
gathered<00:00:25.410> data<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.310> size<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.820> brains<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
gathered data on the size of brains and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.290 
gathered data on the size of brains and
testicles<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.320> bats<00:00:28.650> they<00:00:29.400> discovered<00:00:29.970> that

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
clackers and vice versa because brains

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.270 
clackers and vice versa because brains

during growth a bat that develops a big

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.750 
during growth a bat that develops a big
brain<00:00:40.980> will<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.399> small<00:00:41.730> testicles<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:43.760> back

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
brain will have small testicles and back

with a small brain will have large
testicles<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:49.620> question<00:00:50.010> I'd<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
testicles the question I'd like to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.910 
testicles the question I'd like to
answer<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.180> that's<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.020> same<00:00:52.290> applied<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
answer is that's the same applied to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.819 
answer is that's the same applied to
brainiacs<00:00:58.820> obviously<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.239> does<00:01:00.770> just<00:01:01.770> like

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
brainiacs obviously it does just like

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.650 
brainiacs obviously it does just like
you<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> know<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.640> mine<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.329> summaries

now it's time to see what's hot in my

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.280 
now it's time to see what's hot in my

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
professional origami master but I don't

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.420 
professional origami master but I don't
seem<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.200> be<00:01:20.320> able<00:01:20.410> to<00:01:20.740> fold<00:01:20.980> a<00:01:21.100> piece<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.280> paper

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
seem to be able to fold a piece of paper

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.300 
seem to be able to fold a piece of paper
in<00:01:21.760> half<00:01:22.090> more<00:01:22.480> than<00:01:22.600> seven<00:01:23.050> times<00:01:23.250> why<00:01:24.250> is

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
in half more than seven times why is

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.420 
in half more than seven times why is
this<00:01:24.640> well<00:01:25.570> Paul<00:01:25.870> let<00:01:26.590> me<00:01:26.740> explain<00:01:29.400> take<00:01:30.400> a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
this well Paul let me explain take a

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.910 
this well Paul let me explain take a
piece<00:01:30.700> of<00:01:30.729> paper<00:01:31.000> fold<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:32.020> in<00:01:32.170> half<00:01:32.200> then<00:01:32.890> fold

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
piece of paper fold it in half then fold

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.340 
piece of paper fold it in half then fold
it<00:01:33.340> in<00:01:33.460> half<00:01:33.490> again<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.270> keep<00:01:34.450> going<00:01:34.690> you'll

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
it in half again and keep going you'll

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.620 
it in half again and keep going you'll
find<00:01:35.650> that<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:35.920> is<00:01:36.040> actually<00:01:36.280> impossible<00:01:37.090> to

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
find that it is actually impossible to

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.270 
find that it is actually impossible to
fold<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:37.990> in<00:01:38.080> half<00:01:38.110> more<00:01:38.680> than<00:01:38.800> seven<00:01:39.250> times

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
fold it in half more than seven times

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.600 
fold it in half more than seven times
and<00:01:40.030> that's<00:01:40.840> because<00:01:41.110> of<00:01:41.340> exponential<00:01:42.340> growth

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
and that's because of exponential growth

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.600 
and that's because of exponential growth
when<00:01:43.479> you<00:01:43.600> fold<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:43.990> once<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.680> doubles<00:01:45.190> in<00:01:45.340> size

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
when you fold it once it doubles in size

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.300 
when you fold it once it doubles in size
when<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.509> fold<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.840> again<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.590> doubles<00:01:48.009> again

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
when you fold it again it doubles again

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.570 
when you fold it again it doubles again
and<00:01:48.610> so<00:01:49.060> on<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.930> larger<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.410> gets<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:51.130> faster

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
and so on the larger it gets the faster

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.810 
and so on the larger it gets the faster
it<00:01:51.700> grows<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:53.320> if<00:01:53.440> it<00:01:53.560> was<00:01:53.830> possible<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.490> fold

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
it grows but if it was possible to fold

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.340 
it grows but if it was possible to fold
a<00:01:54.940> piece<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.150> paper<00:01:55.330> more<00:01:55.750> than<00:01:55.810> seven<00:01:55.990> times

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
a piece of paper more than seven times

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.249 
a piece of paper more than seven times
how<00:01:57.280> thick<00:01:57.700> could<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.090> get<00:01:59.970> well<00:02:00.970> after<00:02:01.330> seven

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
how thick could it get well after seven

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.260 
how thick could it get well after seven
folds<00:02:02.710> it's<00:02:02.920> about<00:02:03.220> one<00:02:03.670> point<00:02:03.880> six

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
folds it's about one point six

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.770 
folds it's about one point six
centimeters<00:02:05.020> thick<00:02:05.670> after<00:02:06.670> eight<00:02:06.880> it's<00:02:07.240> three

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
centimeters thick after eight it's three

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.620 
centimeters thick after eight it's three
point<00:02:08.050> two<00:02:08.320> centimeters<00:02:09.040> thick<00:02:09.420> let's<00:02:10.420> see

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
point two centimeters thick let's see

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:20.710 
point two centimeters thick let's see
what<00:02:10.750> happens<00:02:11.140> when<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.410> keep<00:02:11.590> going

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.460 

we're<00:02:21.720> only<00:02:21.870> 14<00:02:22.590> folds<00:02:23.070> in<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:24.170> already<00:02:25.170> it

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
we're only 14 folds in and already it

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.140 
we're only 14 folds in and already it
too<00:02:25.770> thick<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.490> Brainiac<00:02:26.910> to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
too thick for this Brainiac to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.340 
too thick for this Brainiac to
demonstrate<00:02:28.910> after<00:02:29.910> 50<00:02:30.240> fold<00:02:30.480> your<00:02:30.930> piece<00:02:31.170> of

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
demonstrate after 50 fold your piece of

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.070 
demonstrate after 50 fold your piece of
paper<00:02:31.560> would<00:02:31.890> actually<00:02:32.310> be<00:02:32.490> more<00:02:32.760> than<00:02:33.080> 150

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
paper would actually be more than 150

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.500 
paper would actually be more than 150
million<00:02:34.440> kilometers<00:02:35.250> thick<00:02:35.520> which<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
million kilometers thick which is the
