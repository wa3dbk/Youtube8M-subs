Sordell Bolton Sordell non-english let's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.700 
Sordell Bolton Sordell non-english let's
see<00:02:23.460> how<00:02:23.520> much<00:02:23.670> goes<00:02:23.880> for<00:02:24.090> he<00:02:24.240> goes<00:02:24.420> for<00:02:24.750> about

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
see how much goes for he goes for about

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.700 
see how much goes for he goes for about
1.3<00:02:26.370> k<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:26.970> if<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:28.110> were<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.260> get<00:02:28.380> them<00:02:28.500> for

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
1.3 k so if you were to get them for

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.050 
1.3 k so if you were to get them for
about<00:02:28.830> okay<00:02:29.220> then<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.550> can<00:02:29.670> probably<00:02:29.820> sell
