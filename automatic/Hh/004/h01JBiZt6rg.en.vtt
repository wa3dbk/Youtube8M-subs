homogeneous people think of them as one

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.330 
homogeneous people think of them as one
thing<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> look<00:01:16.979> through<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
thing but if you look through the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.070 
thing but if you look through the
estrine<00:01:17.880> gradient<00:01:18.390> there<00:01:18.600> are<00:01:18.690> multiple

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
estrine gradient there are multiple

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080 
estrine gradient there are multiple
habitat<00:01:19.560> types<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.520> most<00:01:20.550> obvious

habitat types the most obvious

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.330 
habitat types the most obvious
difference<00:01:21.510> is<00:01:21.660> water<00:01:21.960> depth<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> depth

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
difference is water depth but the depth

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.100 
difference is water depth but the depth
of<00:01:23.490> water<00:01:23.640> determines<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> way<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
of water determines the way that the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.510 
of water determines the way that the
system<00:01:25.290> functions<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.160> have<00:01:26.280> very

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
have sea grasses and you also have

have sea grasses and you also have
oyster<00:01:45.600> reefs<00:01:46.880> it's<00:01:47.880> important<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> study

oyster reefs it's important to study

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.290 
oyster reefs it's important to study
estuaries<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.500> several<00:01:49.979> reasons<00:01:50.399> first<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
foremost they're a really important area

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.310 
foremost they're a really important area
for<00:01:53.660> productivity<00:01:54.660> and<00:01:54.840> processing

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.040 
materials in aquatic systems in general
to<00:01:59.130> understand<00:01:59.670> what's<00:02:00.090> going<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.600> estuary

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
to understand what's going on in estuary

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.779 
to understand what's going on in estuary
is<00:02:01.200> essential<00:02:01.800> to<00:02:02.220> understand<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
is essential to understand the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.249 
is essential to understand the
connection<00:02:03.270> between<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.600> land<00:02:03.929> and<00:02:04.170> the

connection between the land and the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.410 
connection between the land and the
water<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.610> we<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:05.850> study<00:02:06.209> these

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
water so if we don't study these

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.510 
water so if we don't study these
processes<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.200> see<00:02:07.350> how<00:02:07.500> they're<00:02:07.679> working<00:02:07.830> we

processes and see how they're working we
won't<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:08.970> things<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:09.660> are

is an important thing to understand and

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.199 
is an important thing to understand and
know<00:03:40.139> because<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.799> lot<00:03:41.040> removing<00:03:41.940> nitrogen

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.180 
know because a lot removing nitrogen
from<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.629> system<00:03:43.049> is<00:03:43.230> something<00:03:43.889> that<00:03:44.040> people

from a system is something that people

from a system is something that people
want<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.699> happen<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.660> people<00:03:45.959> pay<00:03:46.139> a

of significant value to people we're

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and where it occurs it's very important

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.150 
and where it occurs it's very important
because<00:04:03.900> there<00:04:04.139> are<00:04:04.169> certain<00:04:04.500> places<00:04:04.980> within
