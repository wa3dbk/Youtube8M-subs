00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
open it up next you will see that the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.630 
open it up next you will see that the
lift<00:01:52.110> gate<00:01:52.260> itself<00:01:52.740> will<00:01:53.010> only<00:01:53.130> go<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
lift gate itself will only go to the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.000 
lift gate itself will only go to the
height<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.820> had<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.300> set<00:01:54.450> at<00:01:54.600> there<00:01:54.840> boom<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
height you had it set at there boom and

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.790 
height you had it set at there boom and
it<00:01:56.190> stops<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:57.840> you're<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> shorter<00:01:58.380> person

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
it stops so if you're a shorter person
