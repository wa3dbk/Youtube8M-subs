00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.880
 that all the goals or the goal are met 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.440
 that they propose and good the second thing that 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.389
 I want to talk in this video is what is 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.529

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.970
 I used to always climb always 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.609
 They will be ready at 6 a.m. at 6 p.m. 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.980
 Mexico time and the best part of all is that 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.080
 there will be gifts in all the videos 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.910
 I would love to give you an ipad in my 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.369
 each video but obviously you can not 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.620
 but in each video they will give themselves arséne 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.540
 a few videos in others maybe not 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.910
 so many but I'll try to always be 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.050
 more than one app and that is of a price not 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.969
 so low 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.610
 for example in this video I will give away not 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.340
 one or two but five copies of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.620
 games or apps of the price of 13 pesos or 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.289
 a dollar like angry birds tiny wings 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.329
 network speed or whatever it is depending 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.370
 the one who chooses who wins it and so 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.649
 like today in all the videos I will give away 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.390
 apps and in one or another maybe it 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.550
 give away physical things so they have 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.090
 to be aware of each video that is 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.799
 rise in case one day does not rise 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.750
 videos will be given on facebook and 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.060
 twitter so are also pending 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.619
 on those social networks and follow me there 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.200
 also because from time to time though 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.579
 I do not have to give any, that is to say that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.259
 is not a day when I did not upload the video 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.659
 I will also be giving away in those 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.819
 social networks so stay tuned 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.829
 and good to win one of the 5 apps 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.659
 remains of today, they should only give 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.700
 like to this video and leave a comment 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.560
 with the app they want to win is 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.780
 They write to say anything but 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130
 contain the name of the app and so 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.530
 enter the contest to the maximum 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.179
 comment to the day and the winner will 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.610
 will announce at the end of the next video 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.739
 Wednesday and so will everyone else 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.360
 videos and every week 

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:47.429
 I'm going to say the winner of the week 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.170
 passed in each video that is to say the 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.629
 Wednesday of next week I'll say the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.369
 Wednesday of this and Friday 

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:55.530
 of the next Friday of this one not 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.840
 I think it 's easy to understand that and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.539
 good and this would be all I hope that you 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.819
 like this idea of ​​giving away apps or games 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.129
 always there are going to be games 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.379
 more expensive and that are always pending 

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:08.940
 and well I hope and support videos 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:13.700
 guide ways since that is the only way to 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.700
 do it and well a happy 2003 to all
