00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
instead of pad but flash that just like

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.389 
instead of pad but flash that just like
we<00:01:54.630> did<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.990> wrong<00:01:55.259> file<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.219> one

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
we did with the wrong file and this one

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.789 
we did with the wrong file and this one
really<00:01:56.549> shouldn't<00:01:56.850> take<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.060> long<00:01:57.119> at<00:01:57.420> all

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
really shouldn't take that long at all

really shouldn't take that long at all
when<00:01:58.799> that's<00:01:58.979> done<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.520> hit<00:01:59.729> reboot

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
when that's done you can hit reboot

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.090 
when that's done you can hit reboot

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
system and the first time you boot this

system and the first time you boot this
rom<00:02:02.310> up<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.670> going<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.880> take<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> few<00:02:03.240> minutes

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
so don't freak out when startup doesn't

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.910 
so don't freak out when startup doesn't
happen<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:05.700> quickly<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:06.210> usual<00:02:06.799> I've<00:02:07.799> already

go through all that initial setup stuff

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.750 
go through all that initial setup stuff
now<00:02:15.570> this<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.780> truly<00:02:16.230> sent<00:02:16.500> six<00:02:16.890> not<00:02:17.550> some

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
now this is truly sent six not some

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.520

piecemeal<00:02:18.120> work<00:02:18.330> around<00:02:18.690> or<00:02:18.840> something<00:02:19.020> so

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
piecemeal work around or something so

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.320 
piecemeal work around or something so
you<00:02:19.560> get<00:02:19.800> everything<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.550> all<00:02:20.670> new<00:02:20.850> HTC

went<00:03:04.080> with<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.380> grid<00:03:04.620> view<00:03:04.800> rather<00:03:05.100> than<00:03:05.220> the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
went with this grid view rather than the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.040 
went with this grid view rather than the
vertical<00:03:05.820> scrolling<00:03:06.090> which<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.600> pretty<00:03:06.780> cool

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
vertical scrolling which is pretty cool

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.650 
vertical scrolling which is pretty cool
and<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:08.400> notification<00:03:08.970> tray<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.360> pretty

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
and the notification tray is pretty

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.180 
and the notification tray is pretty
similar<00:03:09.870> as<00:03:10.170> well<00:03:10.530> as<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.770> quick<00:03:10.920> settings

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
similar as well as the quick settings

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.310 
similar as well as the quick settings
tiles<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.480> settings<00:03:12.870> looks<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.140> lot<00:03:13.260> different

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
tiles but settings looks a lot different

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.490
