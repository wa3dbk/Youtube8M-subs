00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.590
 It is true that the day yesterday 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.239
 elimination shouted to the four winds 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.350
 that the one who was leaving combat was the 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.440
 Chinese 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.320
 look at anyone or with santi shout to Chinese 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.230
 you know it but first of all I want 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.720
 tell you one thing 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.800
 what's your name and I want first of all I want 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.820
 say that when I came in all the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.300
 competencies in most 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.300
 competitions 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:28.330
 this if they do not adopt the position of the jury 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:30.100
 it is difficult to continue with the front 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.720
 they tell you things you do not then 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.240
 from her and before mom you know 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.860
 I am always charges or I am pranksters and 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.660
 somehow or other I consider to 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.100
 all my colleagues the fact that you've 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.440
 entered reaction to the competition not 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.490
 it means that I do not want you 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.500
 Of course I love you because these 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.790
 you fight a family I want me to 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.700
 understand combat is a family and 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.740
 which is why any of us 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.240
 it's going to hurt that one of our 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.510
 competitors with our partners with 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.170
 our brothers go except that no 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.170
 happened in your case 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.479
 perfect 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.679
 Another question pandera you think better than 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.899
 Chinese are not in the same 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.250
 conditions here there is no one better than 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.870
 who wants to excel in a 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.910
 competition simply comes practice and 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.380
 about that area in the competition 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.000
 what circulate in social networks 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.850
 who have abandoned the competition for 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.250
 that, on the contrary, I did not feel very 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.600
 sure to say the screen and I saw it 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.340
 nervous now like everything 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.100
 there were suspensions that day but I 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.200
 like to ask the Chinese because the 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.300
 yesterday and you know it is more but 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.680
 that today in the morning I felt that 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.420
 He was commissioned to remind him of many people 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.410
 I thought you should have gone 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.700
 when that is when that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.350
 possibility 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.750
 the answer is immediate to you the 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.850
 public saves you and those who come to 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.560
 final are those people who do not 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.840
 knows the public and that they did not add the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.070
 amount of necessary points you feel 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.070
 calm with what happened yesterday 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.390
 as panther said this yesterday we were 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.610
 the four almost the final and nobody here 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.159
 will give resentment to anyone this one thing is 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.349
 the competition here we are all friends and 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.629
 although it is true I was saved by the 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.700
 public all this I was very nervous 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.709
 in particular, the competences 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.420
 principle is more talked with panther 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.690
 before starting the church competition 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.980
 is all hands half and I sweat 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.079
 hands because we are all nervous 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:38.670
 because of this depends our our 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:38.670
 stay however for the boat 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.800
 200 points because I think that if 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.440
 you tell him there in co to adopt the 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.920
 The jury's position would also ask 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.540
 fighters who also think of 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.120
 that we are sworn and that 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.540
 We deserve respect but I do not defend 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.000
 nobody but as they ask to be a jury 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.850
 also you respect the position of 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.560
 sworn that we have forgiveness this one 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.370
 but she is a great friend of mine I respect and 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.710
 I respect your position but unfortunately 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.330
 the lord and in co 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.610
 I want to put in please when you were 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.130
 here he behaved very badly with many 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:23.220
 people and one of which is that I am 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.030
 he is talking to me he did not behave 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.310
 how I had to do earrings now 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.960
 that has little time in combat is 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.020
 he loves you because he is a correct person 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:45.990
 and if right which in its in its moment 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:48.330
 it did not happen putting a little bit more 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.610
 which I think is a 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.230
 It's very difficult for me, sir, to be 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.260
 sitting there asking more questions to 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.670
 we 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.030
 but unfortunately we went 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.830
 invited by the production because 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.750
 we wanted to come here today in 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.520
 who wanted to sit here but 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.380
 that invites us to the 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.510
 production and an exercise was coming 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.950
 seeing I understand I understand but 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.690
 unfortunately sir in quota that 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.700
 is that he laughs inside because because 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.070
 he is not wanted by at least my 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.390
 dear then flag that you can 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.920
 a much more intelligent person and 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.280
 know how to handle the situation has your 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.280
 position 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:32.090
 I swear I try to do it but I 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.090
 Waves will run cynicism
