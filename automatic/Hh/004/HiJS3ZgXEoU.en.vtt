00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.190
 Care and contact the day after 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.410
 has the tsg and trainer markus gisdol 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.600
 with the 3 3-draw against Schalke 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.350
 04 already the best application for you 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.570
 submitted 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.190
 an insane turbulent and high 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.119
 exciting catching up against royal blue 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.500
 who went into the half-time break with 1 to 3 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.690
 second half time just a lot much 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.699
 Getting access early was a lot 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.220
 more aggressive overall and have easy 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.870
 not shown that a good offensive 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.940
 always must be called that so also behind 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.579
 then ultimately you stand because we have 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.930
 nevertheless dominant offensive also very much 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.910
 stood well back that was 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.170
 actually maybe not the best 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.130
 Half the time you have so far in the season 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.620
 have played 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.730
 we had that feeling anyway 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.620
 what else is the connection again 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.540
 had made with this 1 gates 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.770
 yes then it has now also runs in 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.300
 The 2 somehow pure eaten then too 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.890
 again with the second against the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.969
 second goal still scored 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.280
 the feeling that the game also 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.350
 can win what approached him 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.170
 but the tsg-goal ratio remains 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.389
 balanced 18 to 18 the second most 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.789
 shot gates of the league and the 

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:17.420
 second most goals just want 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.100
 show in our playing style and he 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.770
 plays a lot of things in front of all things 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.719
 turn second half and have shown 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.189
 It is easy and so our art and 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.029
 Wise as we want to present ourselves 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.799
 and of course the goals hurt us 

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:32.509
 but above all things are looking forward to the 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.310
 many shot gates because that's yes 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.229
 also a great thing if you believe 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.849
 but 18 goals scored in seven 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.319
 playing is also great 

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:41.329
 Award for the team and the 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.159
 are with us usually always synonymous all 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.799
 player involved that we see you 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.399
 also act with very high risk 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.749
 that is beyond question but I believe 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.679
 We are happy to accept this then 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.969
 maybe even a goal 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.439
 but then get in the opposite synonymous one 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.909
 Go ahead because that's it 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.189
 really spectacular again that is 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.200
 again the football is very fun 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.479
 The game against the FC has made fun 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.260
 Schalke was in any case unspectacular 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.650
 it also tsg with a lot of heart and 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.920
 great morality yes i believe record 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.450
 must stand for something special on 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.220
 favorite for many points if not 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.680
 then for a very attractive style of play 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.450
 but as I said the last 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.100
 Years very many philosophies 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.020
 many game systems but i believe in it 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.360
 What we are playing now is the belief 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.360
 I too that with the people with 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.210
 which fans can identify with 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.980
 Team saw the classes though 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.780
 mainly in the second half 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.630
 but it just offers so much 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.230
 who can really go to the gas and 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.230
 but already a lot of fire 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.390
 kindled and great players overall 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.400
 delivered the icing on the cake 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.290
 maybe we missed that then 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.110
 not the fourth goal 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.400
 but to win the game 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.920
 should not be, I hope it is similar 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.650
 then achieve over the season 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.330
 sometime also the late gates 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.030
 a good opportunity to start 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.420
 would be on the eighth day of the visit in 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.420
 mainz
