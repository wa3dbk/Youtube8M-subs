00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.899
 his schedule are well done with 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.780

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:55.520
 a lot of heroin dirt with a 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.739
 cannon here a canvas nothing so that 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.570

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.280
 do my cannon I really like my cannon 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.420
 so I put them in the air because 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.659
 that in fact they are aimed at gunboats 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:11.930
 that the close so here after that we 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.570
 has the critters like the one that has 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.270
 almost killed crel so she stumbled a 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.040
 clown the he telling his mate 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.409
 to his brother so he got caught 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.320
 by the foot there we can see here the 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.330
 mouth so I think the post well 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.470
 done but good with the little trick taki 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.530
