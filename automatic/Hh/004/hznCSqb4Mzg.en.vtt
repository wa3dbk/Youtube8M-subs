well thanks looking for sending up some

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.000 
well thanks looking for sending up some
information<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:03.870> there<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.470> forth<00:01:04.500> but

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
information out there and so forth but

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.010 
information out there and so forth but
one<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> things<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.640> want<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.850> point<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.150> is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
one of the things I want to point out is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.870 
one of the things I want to point out is
that<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.950> notion<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.430> defrag<00:01:11.180> SSDs

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
that the notion to defrag SSDs

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.039 
that the notion to defrag SSDs
traditional<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:15.000> frank<00:01:15.360> certainly<00:01:15.869> should

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
traditional be frank certainly should

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.050 
traditional be frank certainly should
not<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.380> done<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> notion<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.490> SSDs

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
not be done but the notion that SSDs

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
not be done but the notion that SSDs
don't<00:01:18.360> slow<00:01:18.659> down<00:01:18.689> associated<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.830> file<00:01:20.250> and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.830 
clean up space that has been marked as
free<00:02:03.209> such<00:02:03.929> that<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.619> SSD<00:02:05.579> can<00:02:05.849> write<00:02:06.119> data<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
free such that the SSD can write data to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.770 
free such that the SSD can write data to
a<00:02:07.259> free<00:02:07.739> space<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.579> has<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.910> be<00:02:09.030> erased<00:02:09.329> first

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
a free space it has to be erased first

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.860 
a free space it has to be erased first
so<00:02:10.380> that's<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.619> very<00:02:10.739> time-consuming<00:02:11.099> process

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
so that's a very time-consuming process

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.720 
so that's a very time-consuming process
so<00:02:12.870> treadeth<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.890> defriend<00:02:14.220> are<00:02:14.430> actually

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so treadeth and defriend are actually

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.330 
so treadeth and defriend are actually
two<00:02:14.910> different<00:02:15.060> type<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.390> functions

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
two different type of functions

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.380 
two different type of functions
defragmenting<00:02:17.340> or<00:02:17.489> traditional<00:02:17.970> defriend

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
defragmenting or traditional defriend

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.620 
defragmenting or traditional defriend
should<00:02:18.569> not<00:02:18.720> be<00:02:18.930> used<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.799> SSDs<00:02:20.370> but<00:02:20.819> you

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
should not be used on SSDs but you

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.259 
should not be used on SSDs but you
certainly<00:02:21.959> should<00:02:22.349> optimize<00:02:25.910> SSDs<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.150> get

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
certainly should optimize SSDs to get

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.880 
certainly should optimize SSDs to get
the<00:02:27.390> full<00:02:27.630> manufacturers<00:02:28.470> performance<00:02:30.890> as

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
the full manufacturers performance as

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.009 
the full manufacturers performance as
far<00:02:32.129> as<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:32.459> people<00:02:33.239> are<00:02:33.720> saying<00:02:33.930> about

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
far as what people are saying about

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.809 
far as what people are saying about

Windows 7 automatically runs trail
that's<00:02:36.090> true<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:37.109> not<00:02:37.230> something

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
that's true but it's not something

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.569 
that's true but it's not something

that that information out and that's a

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.449 
that that information out and that's a
very<00:03:00.510> time-consuming<00:03:00.840> process<00:03:01.349> so<00:03:02.310> that's

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
very time-consuming process so that's

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.740 
very time-consuming process so that's
something<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.970> our<00:03:03.000> product<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.569> trigger
