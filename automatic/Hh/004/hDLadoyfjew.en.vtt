this<00:01:42.850> has<00:01:42.970> been<00:01:43.119> around<00:01:43.210> since<00:01:43.450> 1998<00:01:44.790> it's

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
this has been around since 1998 it's

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.910 
this has been around since 1998 it's
just<00:01:46.180> had<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.360> middle<00:01:46.869> mid<00:01:47.290> life<00:01:47.560> sort<00:01:47.860> of

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
just had a middle mid life sort of

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.700 
just had a middle mid life sort of
facelift<00:01:48.400> recently<00:01:48.939> but<00:01:49.780> there's<00:01:50.470> something

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
facelift recently but there's something

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.649 
facelift recently but there's something
about<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.040> Alfa<00:01:51.280> isn't<00:01:51.490> there<00:01:51.610> yes<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.240> think

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
about the Alfa isn't there yes I think

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.060 
about the Alfa isn't there yes I think
it<00:01:52.810> seemed<00:01:53.020> very<00:01:53.049> much<00:01:53.350> as<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.560> driver's<00:01:54.040> car

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
it seemed very much as a driver's car

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.830 
it seemed very much as a driver's car
certainly<00:01:54.909> people<00:01:55.090> that<00:01:55.299> I've<00:01:55.390> spoken<00:01:55.630> to

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
certainly people that I've spoken to

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.539 
certainly people that I've spoken to
who've<00:01:56.140> owned<00:01:56.320> them<00:01:56.530> or<00:01:56.650> driven<00:01:56.860> them<00:01:57.070> have

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
who've owned them or driven them have

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.550 
who've owned them or driven them have
said<00:01:57.729> it's<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.939> great<00:01:58.060> car<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.390> drive<00:01:58.540> it's<00:01:59.439> got

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
said it's a great car to drive it's got

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.679 
said it's a great car to drive it's got
a<00:01:59.590> certain<00:01:59.770> style<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.460> it

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
a certain style to it

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.149 
a certain style to it
yeah<00:02:01.689> looks<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.110> nice<00:02:02.229> car<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.650> mean<00:02:02.770> maybe<00:02:02.979> the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
yeah looks a nice car I mean maybe the

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.499 
yeah looks a nice car I mean maybe the
only<00:02:03.280> thing<00:02:03.400> that<00:02:03.700> does<00:02:03.850> perhaps<00:02:04.180> let<00:02:04.390> them

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
only thing that does perhaps let them

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.410 
only thing that does perhaps let them
down<00:02:04.659> is<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.930> build<00:02:05.110> quality<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:07.060> who<00:02:07.210> knows

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
down is the build quality but who knows

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.119 
down is the build quality but who knows
well<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.110> get<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.289> chance<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.619> have<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.739> drive<00:02:08.979> it

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
well you get a chance to have a drive it

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.259 
well you get a chance to have a drive it
and<00:02:09.220> see<00:02:09.310> what<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.489> think<00:02:09.669> in<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.819> road<00:02:10.029> soon

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
and see what you think in the road soon

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.690 
and see what you think in the road soon
and<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.629> final<00:02:11.019> car<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.439> well<00:02:12.249> probably<00:02:12.609> the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
and the final car is well probably the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.330 
and the final car is well probably the
newest<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.359> of<00:02:14.109> the<00:02:14.349> three<00:02:14.529> it's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
newest of the of the three it's

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.940 
newest of the of the three it's
the<00:02:15.400> Audi<00:02:15.550> a4<00:02:15.760> only<00:02:16.750> introduced<00:02:17.200> just<00:02:17.650> over<00:02:17.920> a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
the Audi a4 only introduced just over a

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.130 
the Audi a4 only introduced just over a
year<00:02:18.010> ago<00:02:18.370> would<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.330> reckon<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.750> falls

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
year ago would you reckon to the a falls

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.630 
year ago would you reckon to the a falls
it<00:02:20.410> looks<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.800> beautiful<00:02:21.190> car<00:02:21.370> from<00:02:21.550> the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
it looks a beautiful car from the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.190 
it looks a beautiful car from the
outside<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.209> certainly<00:02:22.510> in<00:02:22.629> terms<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.110> the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
outside and certainly in terms of the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.330 
outside and certainly in terms of the
styling<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.739> does<00:02:23.920> look<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.129> most

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
styling it does look the most

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.740 
styling it does look the most
contemporary<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.030> Alfa<00:02:25.269> Romeo<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:25.629> the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
contemporary the Alfa Romeo is the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.030 
contemporary the Alfa Romeo is the
cheapest<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.260> three<00:02:26.319> cars<00:02:26.739> perhaps

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
cheapest of the three cars perhaps

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.920 
cheapest of the three cars perhaps
unsurprisingly<00:02:27.760> it's<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.030> over<00:02:28.209> 13,000

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
unsurprisingly it's just over 13,000

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.900 
unsurprisingly it's just over 13,000
pounds<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:30.040> sort<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.250> mid<00:02:30.459> price<00:02:30.640> I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.580 
pounds and this is sort of mid price I
mean<00:02:31.030> new<00:02:31.300> this<00:02:31.540> would<00:02:31.690> have<00:02:31.780> been<00:02:31.930> round

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
mean new this would have been round

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.830 
mean new this would have been round
about<00:02:32.769> 21,000<00:02:33.549> pounds<00:02:33.819> this<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> 1.8<00:02:34.660> turbo

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
about 21,000 pounds this is a 1.8 turbo

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.589 
about 21,000 pounds this is a 1.8 turbo
sport<00:02:35.440> it's<00:02:35.590> not<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.860> Quattro<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:37.180> it's<00:02:37.360> a

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
sport it's not the Quattro but it's a

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.420 
sport it's not the Quattro but it's a
year<00:02:37.870> old<00:02:38.080> its<00:02:38.349> Ana<00:02:38.530> fairly<00:02:38.830> high<00:02:38.950> mileage<00:02:39.190> in

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
year old its Ana fairly high mileage in

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.460 
year old its Ana fairly high mileage in
a<00:02:39.519> year<00:02:39.640> about<00:02:39.819> 30,000<00:02:40.660> but<00:02:40.810> now<00:02:40.989> it's<00:02:41.200> dropped

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
a year about 30,000 but now it's dropped

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.680 
a year about 30,000 but now it's dropped
down<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.620> just<00:02:41.830> over<00:02:41.980> 16<00:02:42.400> grand<00:02:42.430> that's<00:02:43.390> quite

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
down to just over 16 grand that's quite

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.720 
down to just over 16 grand that's quite
a<00:02:43.720> good<00:02:43.959> price<00:02:44.260> for<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.590> relatively<00:02:45.160> new<00:02:45.459> car

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
a good price for a relatively new car

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.460 
a good price for a relatively new car
and<00:02:45.970> certainly<00:02:46.330> saving<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:46.870> there<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.200> with

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
and certainly saving in there and with

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.509 
and certainly saving in there and with
the<00:02:47.500> build<00:02:47.709> quality<00:02:47.860> in<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.310> sort<00:02:48.489> of

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
the build quality in that sort of

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.800 
the build quality in that sort of
mileage<00:02:48.849> I<00:02:48.970> wouldn't<00:02:49.209> see<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.510> as<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> problem

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
mileage I wouldn't see that as a problem

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.509 
mileage I wouldn't see that as a problem
be<00:02:50.170> any<00:02:50.290> problem<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.040> course<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:51.340> is<00:02:51.489> a

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
be any problem and of course this is a

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.039 
be any problem and of course this is a
petrol<00:02:51.910> well<00:02:52.209> yes<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.630> other<00:02:52.780> two<00:02:52.930> are

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
petrol well yes the other two are

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.110 
petrol well yes the other two are
diesels<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.680> be<00:02:53.769> interesting<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.819> compare

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
diesels so be interesting to to compare

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.910 
diesels so be interesting to to compare
how<00:02:55.299> they<00:02:55.450> how<00:02:55.810> they<00:02:55.840> drive<00:02:56.140> yes<00:02:56.560> it'll<00:02:56.739> be<00:02:56.829> an

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
how they how they drive yes it'll be an

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.259 
how they how they drive yes it'll be an
industry<00:02:57.190> apart<00:02:57.489> right<00:02:57.610> well<00:02:57.970> let's<00:02:58.120> take

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
industry apart right well let's take

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.020 
industry apart right well let's take
this<00:02:58.329> one<00:02:58.480> out<00:02:58.569> first<00:02:58.720> okay<00:02:59.640> so<00:03:00.640> Jim<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:00.879> don't

drive<00:03:17.470> philosophy<00:03:18.160> for<00:03:18.730> many<00:03:18.879> years<00:03:19.299> or<00:03:19.780> the

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
drive philosophy for many years or the

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.990 
drive philosophy for many years or the
alternative<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.069> is<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.639> have<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.850> full

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
alternative to that is to have the full

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.460 
alternative to that is to have the full
four-wheel<00:03:22.389> driving<00:03:22.660> here<00:03:22.900> from<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.109> Quattro

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
four-wheel driving here from the Quattro

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.949 
four-wheel driving here from the Quattro
now<00:03:23.859> this<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.220> 1.8<00:03:24.760> turbo<00:03:25.359> but<00:03:25.840> it's

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
now this is the 1.8 turbo but it's

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.629 
now this is the 1.8 turbo but it's
front-wheel<00:03:26.200> drive<00:03:26.350> include<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.250> drives<00:03:27.459> well

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
front-wheel drive include it drives well

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.069 
front-wheel drive include it drives well
doesn't<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.150> does<00:03:28.209> yeah<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:28.630> mean<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:28.900> think

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
doesn't it it does yeah I mean I think

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.490 
doesn't it it does yeah I mean I think
for<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.440> most<00:03:29.620> part<00:03:29.889> and<00:03:30.250> rear-wheel<00:03:31.150> drive

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
for the most part and rear-wheel drive

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.660 
for the most part and rear-wheel drive
doesn't<00:03:32.500> really<00:03:32.680> cater<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.220> majority<00:03:33.459> of

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
doesn't really cater to the majority of

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.740 
doesn't really cater to the majority of
driving<00:03:34.030> EBD<00:03:34.450> if<00:03:34.720> it's<00:03:34.900> on<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.079> motorway

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
driving EBD if it's on the motorway

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.270 
driving EBD if it's on the motorway
from<00:03:36.930> where<00:03:37.110> drivers<00:03:37.350> put<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.680> up<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.130> think

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
from where drivers put it up and I think

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.980 
from where drivers put it up and I think
if<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.430> do<00:03:38.550> not<00:03:38.670> bet<00:03:38.850> more<00:03:39.030> interior<00:03:39.330> space<00:03:39.540> as

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
if you do not bet more interior space as

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.020 
if you do not bet more interior space as
well<00:03:40.140> now<00:03:40.740> when<00:03:41.070> this<00:03:41.190> car<00:03:41.430> was<00:03:41.460> new<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.940> would
