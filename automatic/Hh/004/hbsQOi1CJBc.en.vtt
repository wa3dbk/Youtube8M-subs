then we're gonna peel off this heavy
part<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.549> choke<00:02:42.970> stem<00:02:44.640> remember<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:45.760> is

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
part of this choke stem remember this is

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.569 
part of this choke stem remember this is
all<00:02:46.060> part<00:02:46.329> of<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.510> heart<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.159> all<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
all part of the heart so this is all the

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.380 
all part of the heart so this is all the
good<00:02:48.760> part<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.420> artichoke<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.170> eat<00:02:51.390> just

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
good part of the artichoke to eat just

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.339 
good part of the artichoke to eat just
peel<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.750> down<00:02:57.629> you<00:02:58.629> can<00:02:58.780> use<00:02:58.930> your<00:02:59.079> paring

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
peel that down you can use your paring

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.349 
peel that down you can use your paring
knife<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.560> do<00:02:59.799> this<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.250> think<00:03:00.849> it's<00:03:01.030> easier<00:03:01.329> to

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
knife to do this I think it's easier to

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.399 
knife to do this I think it's easier to
use<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.750> with<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.900> vegetable<00:03:02.200> peeler<00:03:04.260> okay<00:03:05.260> we

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
use it with a vegetable peeler okay we

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.259 
use it with a vegetable peeler okay we
get<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.560> down<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.769> its<00:03:06.010> nice<00:03:06.280> light<00:03:06.549> green
