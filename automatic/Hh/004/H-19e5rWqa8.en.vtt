00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.070
 johnny grass vultures are allowed of course 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.500
 another new episode from dr 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.150
 road to life is a small must 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.160
 of course a mole of piles in a series 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.360
 with the designer you probably insist on it 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.310
 and so today the team became the 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.410
 vendor pot on morsi talent team 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.590
 I think defender is just the game 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.360
 on which I can of course pick up the mole 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.680
 because previous episode well only the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.030
 previous good only for that is good 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 everything went well 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.000
 only those on we are not yet on 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.470
 those fucking 25 or 24 plus 3 so I hope 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.359
 that we dive in this episode 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.559
 another crisis pass list and 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.000
 have played pre- life naturally 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.890
 with support only a will today 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.660
 I hope it specialists at a then 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.280
 I hope it might of days 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.390
 will succeed 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.339
 then see the chilling malpie for 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.350
 only the point is if it goes like this it is 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.289
 I do n't want to say I just wanted to say 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.269
 if they start playing like the stoops 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.550
 so walk through the folder then boom 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.409
 don't chill and 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.940
 this surrender does aloud finish these and and 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.409
 is therefore a plus for me because then 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.730
 they had run to where are they 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:21.479
 Well 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:23.430
 the harder they come then yes too bad it 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.140
 house and what we now easily 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.850
 Kille can only target this energy 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.290
 apparently do not feel like it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.320
 they started to drive or run menu 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.670
 Will stand with the camper is so had 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.979
 do not feel like maintenance down to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.119
 but there were details packing there 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.119
 don't grab don't kick don't kick 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:47.930
 this one no more like that color i am 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.540
 really really just not where they are now 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.190
 there so i have to take care guys and too 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.580
 that is something that I am really good at 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:01.320
 must pay attention that I put as little as possible into it 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.000
 because every time and it's a few times 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.530
 happened now this series I'm dying on 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 moments to run 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.620
 So your interest can of course not be fast 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.660
 shoot enough afterwards so I have to get there 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.040
 really pay attention that I just as and if 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.860
 I know for sure that there is none and who is 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:18.150
 otherwise I'm just dead how can I 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.290
 know that it is behind me I thought my 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.330
 teammate for my lap but the van be 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.640

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.480
 bit of a shame now it is behind me again 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.590
