00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
as you can see it's working as a full we

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.920 
as you can see it's working as a full we
were<00:00:21.950> the<00:00:22.950> screen<00:00:23.190> protector<00:00:23.810> fits<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
were the screen protector fits the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.490 
were the screen protector fits the
screen<00:00:25.170> well<00:00:25.440> but<00:00:27.020> there's<00:00:28.020> a<00:00:28.080> bit<00:00:28.200> of<00:00:28.230> space

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
screen well but there's a bit of space

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.139 
screen well but there's a bit of space
left<00:00:28.710> over<00:00:28.890> at<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> bottom<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:34.789> why<00:00:35.789> not<00:00:35.940> in

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
left over at the bottom so why not in

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.059 
left over at the bottom so why not in
use<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.170> full<00:00:37.379> mirror<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.769> we<00:00:37.920> use

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:38.069 
use you have a full mirror that we use

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:42.439 
use you have a full mirror that we use
to<00:00:38.249> see<00:00:38.399> around<00:00:40.699> the<00:00:41.699> idea<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.210> when<00:00:42.359> you

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
to see around the idea is that when you

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.790 
to see around the idea is that when you
turn<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:44.370> screen<00:00:45.019> that<00:00:46.019> all<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> D

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
turn on the the screen that all the D

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.059 
turn on the the screen that all the D
does<00:00:46.979> it<00:00:47.129> come<00:00:47.249> true<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.679> now<00:00:49.859> have<00:00:49.979> two

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
does it come true so I now have two

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:57.799 
does it come true so I now have two
screen<00:00:50.339> on<00:00:51.409> you<00:00:52.409> can<00:00:52.589> see<00:00:56.420> through<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.569> mirror

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
screen on you can see through the mirror

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.039 
screen on you can see through the mirror
but<00:00:58.139> it's<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.579> clearest<00:00:59.989> especially<00:01:00.989> if

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
but it's not the clearest especially if

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.319 
but it's not the clearest especially if
you're<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.260> any<00:01:01.409> kind<00:01:01.709> of<00:01:01.799> price<00:01:02.329> light

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you're in any kind of price light

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:12.880 
you're in any kind of price light

currently that screen is on the full of
brightness<00:01:16.010> if<00:01:16.280> I<00:01:16.400> turn<00:01:16.610> brightness<00:01:17.000> down<00:01:17.180> to

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
brightness if I turn brightness down to

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.230 
brightness if I turn brightness down to
lowest

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
lowest

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.190

I<00:01:31.780> wouldn't<00:01:32.780> recommend<00:01:33.050> putting<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:34.190> mirror

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
I wouldn't recommend putting the mirror

I wouldn't recommend putting the mirror
display<00:01:34.550> onto<00:01:34.850> your<00:01:35.060> Nexus<00:01:35.540> One<00:01:35.690> as<00:01:36.790> well<00:01:37.790> this

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
display onto your Nexus One as well this

display onto your Nexus One as well this
model<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.420> fit<00:01:38.990> isn't<00:01:39.140> excellent<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:42.220> it's

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
model the fit isn't excellent and it's

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.770 
model the fit isn't excellent and it's
you'd<00:01:43.850> increase<00:01:44.180> your<00:01:44.300> brightness<00:01:44.630> which

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
you'd increase your brightness which

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.210 
you'd increase your brightness which
reduces<00:01:45.200> your<00:01:45.350> battery<00:01:45.619> life<00:01:45.800> and<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:48.830> last
