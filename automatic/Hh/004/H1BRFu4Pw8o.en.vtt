00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.320
 I go 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.290
 maybe I come with a video where we are going to 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.990
 do a treatment of 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.260
 then it will depend a bit on the brand that 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.370
 let's use the application method 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.650
 it does not usually vary much 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.040
 I will explain at least the 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.420
 product with which I work in my case 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.539
 I work the treatment 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.870
 by salerm cosmetics 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.379
 these would be the boats this would be the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.010
 number 1 which is the shampoo is with which 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.519
 the client 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.300
 with which he washes his hair and then 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.420
 We have the number 2 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.840
 what is the smoothing cream or what would be 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 the keratin that we are going to apply 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.079
 with this keratin treatment what 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.950
 we get is that the hair has more 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.200
 shine is more hydrated 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.940
 and then also what we got about 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.240
 all of which we have curly hair or 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.390
 the resparado is that when combing 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.150
 we are easier to do well if we 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.430
 we want more curly hair by the 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.620
 hydration that you will have and the product 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.380
 that we apply in a foam or a 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.420
 cream product for rites will fix 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.580
 that curl and the hair will not be left 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.430
 curled or even when we want 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.950
 isolate our hair is going to be a lot 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.380
 easier to do it good I do not roll up 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.869
 more and now here I leave you step by step 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.009
 we do the deals where I already go 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.340
 to take the line we divide the sides 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.130
 we separated the back and we started 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.979
 applying the product 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.079
 and combing what we are not going to apply in 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.079
 excess so that it does not remain then as very 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.869
 dirty the hair once it has 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.670
 applied the product for everything we left 10 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.110
 minutes and we started working on 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.539
 hand-drier 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.149
 if we want volume we will apply volume 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.780
 at the root but leaving all the rest 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.780
 smooth 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.830
 and we started to pass the iron and I 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.530
 I advise the iron to pass it 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.500
 finite wisps to get 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.400
 well to the root and you have to pass five 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.630
 times each strand and in so doing 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.630
 all over your head 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.879
 that 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.870
 d 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.350
 days 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.040
 whole without washing 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:01.370
 the hair neither get wet nor try 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.370
 also avoid holding yourself 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.670
 many times to put 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.650
 Well, when she would arrive at home 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.069
 after all the day that passes the 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.370
 plant above 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.159
 those brands are usually difficult 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.989
 without holding the hair if you hold a lock 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.989
 but hey at least 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.550
 the creatine is going to fix more and they are not going to 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.930
 remain rare waves 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.520
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.520
 and see you soon
