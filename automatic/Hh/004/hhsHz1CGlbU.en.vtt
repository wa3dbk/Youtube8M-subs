00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.379
 Sometimes we do not want to eat so much 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.379
 frying we can make this stew 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.550
 the onion has already been fried for about 23 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.330
 minutes now we are going to add the 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:26.860
 tomato the chopped tomato in pictures 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.420

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.060
 once we add the tomato 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.930
 we stir and let's let this be 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.160
 Cook 2 to 3 minutes more than this one did 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.160
 take a lot of flavor 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.980
 We're frying for about three minutes 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.260
 it's time to rectify the seasoning 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.410
 little friend was missing a little more than 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.690
 salt if you want to give more color 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.300
 you can add it right now 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.849
 I'm adding the potatoes you can 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.260
 use three large potatoes or in my case 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.260
 four medium potatoes 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:17.090
 we are mixing and now is the time to 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.239
 moisturize if we have broth chicken broth 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.190
 beef broth add the broth but 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.949
 As I had it, what I did was to 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.610
 watering him more or less to cover the potatoes 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:30.760
 like a cup and a half of water water 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.760
 boiled 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.270
 let's keep mixing and let's leave 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:41.010
 is cooked over medium heat until 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.010
 the potatoes are almost there 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:49.830
 I have a habit of preparing this 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.830
 dish like this but you can 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.499
 add to the preparation to see if 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.509
 is carrot chopped in boxes I 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:05:00.960
 cry of pomegranate what you wish 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:03.749
 throw him already once the potatoes are in 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.939
 your point we do not have to leave the ones that 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:11.099
 they pick up because otherwise they break down 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:14.009
 let's add parsley or cilantro 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:17.099
 chopped and also a sprig of 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:19.580
 peppermint gives this very good flavor 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.580
 preparation 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:28.039
 they already have another option to prepare 

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:30.309
