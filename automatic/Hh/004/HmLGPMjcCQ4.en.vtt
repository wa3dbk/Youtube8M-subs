I started sewing in 1991 and it wasn't

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.230 
I started sewing in 1991 and it wasn't
because<00:00:08.780> I<00:00:08.930> was<00:00:09.140> making<00:00:09.559> a<00:00:09.769> garment<00:00:10.340> or<00:00:10.700> a<00:00:10.759> home

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
because I was making a garment or a home

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.390 
because I was making a garment or a home
deck<00:00:11.450> project<00:00:11.690> I<00:00:12.139> actually<00:00:12.379> thought<00:00:12.920> I<00:00:13.219> was

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:15.589 
going to make a shirt and then I thought

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.080 
going to make a shirt and then I thought
no<00:00:15.769> if<00:00:16.100> I<00:00:16.219> make<00:00:16.400> this<00:00:16.520> shirt<00:00:16.670> I'm<00:00:16.820> gonna<00:00:16.970> look

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
no if I make this shirt I'm gonna look

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.420 
no if I make this shirt I'm gonna look
too<00:00:17.270> stupid<00:00:17.510> wearing<00:00:17.990> it<00:00:18.140> so<00:00:18.440> as<00:00:18.890> I<00:00:19.279> was

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
too stupid wearing it so as I was

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.670 
too stupid wearing it so as I was
leaving<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:19.850> store<00:00:19.970> I<00:00:20.480> went<00:00:20.750> past<00:00:20.960> a<00:00:21.350> rack<00:00:21.650> of

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
leaving the store I went past a rack of

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.589 
leaving the store I went past a rack of
quote<00:00:22.039> books<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:22.519> I<00:00:23.000> looked<00:00:23.300> at<00:00:23.420> that<00:00:23.449> and

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
quote books and I looked at that and

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.480 
quote books and I looked at that and
thought<00:00:23.689> I<00:00:24.019> could<00:00:24.470> make<00:00:24.800> that<00:00:25.010> because<00:00:25.369> I'm

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
thought I could make that because I'm

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.279 
thought I could make that because I'm
not<00:00:25.609> gonna<00:00:25.789> wear<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:26.359> nobody's<00:00:26.869> gonna<00:00:26.990> see
