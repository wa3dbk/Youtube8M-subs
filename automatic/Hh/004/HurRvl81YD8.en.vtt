00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.860
 It is said that who has coughed does not work 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.620
 doctor but into the theater or ins 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.970
 concert 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.160
 Herbert Blomstedt is a guest and 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.210
 honorary conductor of top orchestras in 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.870
 the whole world 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.810
 he has one opposite easter in the concert 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.420
 tolerant attitude the people we 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.870
 Listening very concentrated in the concert 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.860
 Of course everyone will cough as when 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:17.160
 classified crime 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:20.190
 that disturbs the music, yes, I'm there something 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.240
 a bit more generous, I do not believe anyone 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.400
 Coughs because it makes him fun 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.270
 to keep that up , but it succeeds 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.860
 not always succeeds not so easy 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.790
 he will stop if you do not have one 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.790
 alternative has 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.970
 the alternative is to listen carefully 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.750
 so that you have something different 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.750
 concentrated 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.450
 our mind set up so that when 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.010
 you concentrate on one thing 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.560
 then everything else becomes secondary 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.560
 or five means not feeling 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:32.430
 I know you can handle one with one 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.140
 headache or a pain on the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.849
 foot or where a pain on the stage 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.860
 go 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:44.940
 which one music starts is the 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:49.440
 completely disappear because something different 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.590
 and important things have gotten out of hand and music 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.920
 this possibility and so brutal ours 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.400
 to call attention to 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.380
 that you practically never exist 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.120
 no more 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.760
 that's a wonderful thing 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.459
 herbert lom is one in america 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.100
 born swede as son of one 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.049
 Adventist pastor it connects with 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.049
 the music is a mission 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.989
 I see myself as a herald the 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.890
 music has a message through the music 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.760
 but know god 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:29.910
 even suspecting that they even believe me 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:35.190
 one of the main tasks of the music 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:38.790
 people who have an antenna for it 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.460
 play that there must be something big 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.550
 what little we understand what we do not understand anymore 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:52.020
 can know but that's it 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:55.740
 and the same is as if in shock 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:04:00.390
 This awe for something very big 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:05.210
 what is above us outside of us and the 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:07.890
 but the music can speak to us 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.220
 and there you see a tremendous 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.490
 important embassy herbert lom stands is 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.040
 convinced many artists help 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.280
 with her works the people at her 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.280
 search 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.630
 the classical music is a wonderful one 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.150
 example of this 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:42.790
 because that makes us small because of this 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:46.750
 music is so great and at the same time 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.670
 so in a sense imprecise is that 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.650
 she does not cling to one 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.920
 special truths one then 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.540
 dive through the most important in to 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.900
 he is bringing this to humans 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.560
 feeling awestruck by the big ball 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.560
 to bring the music is daddy 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.560
 excellent 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:40.720
 I think that looks a thought of 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.670
 Hermann Hesse was a great Swiss 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:50.830
 German poet said if all 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:53.790
 church and all priest Mehring like 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.890
 Jesus then became the poets 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:00.060
 superfluous i think of that 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:05.500
 Swedish naturalist poet 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:09.570
 from trimberg a completely different person 1 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:13.360
 1 has a screen 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:19.270
 society was very criticized but he was 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:22.390
 also a search and said in mine 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.570
 I preach plays 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.130
 to bring people truth 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.220
 these are the same as in the bible though 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.930
 many people do not listen anymore 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.320
 in the bible told who understand the 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.669
 not but they may understand 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.830
 play that is well done 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.830
 that's the way it is with my art 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:53.100
 so is classical music too 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.880
 that brings us closer to the people 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:01.170
 feeling for that for the big one and that 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:04.710
 that looks great that's good for them 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:06.390
 like god there are all the biggest ones you have 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.550
 from the god different ideas 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.320
 of course one believe in one 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.240
 personal god the victory around me 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.250
 caring and loving me others can 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.970
 so as not to infect but have 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:20.400
 still looking for god in 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:23.400
 the absolute makes a lot 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.890
 is smarter than all the billions 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:31.200
 of people together and and and the 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:36.600
 Everything created this one 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:40.620
 to look for in the music is all 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:43.370
 actually possible to listen to all open 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.370
 to have
