00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.590
 the private area involved in the skyscraper project is located between the current one 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.750
 magistrate's building and a private condominium in the center of recco in the 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.509
 immediate vicinity of other houses 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.550
 today in that private area of ​​a car park for a few dozen cars 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.550
 of the few non-paying existing at recco 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.460
 in 2006 we had read of a 4-storey skyscraper 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.730
 something has changed 10 floors two basement floors of boxes these are the numbers 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.699
 of the 2009 project 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.600
 it is strange but rich with the passing of time project forecasts tend 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.520
 to prevent food from ever decreasing 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.270
 who benefits 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.370
 a plan for shops i'm not flat of residence when the de facto standard of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.170
 recoil of dwelling with a store floor and four floors for the home 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.970
 the project has never been presented publicly by 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.460
 of the municipal administration 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.210
 the drawings the tables have been exposed publicly on initiative of the committee 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.960
 spontaneous edilgruppo participate here 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.300
 who have collected hundreds of signatures to ask for them to be limited 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.820
 at the height of the skyscraper 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.290
 on the pages of the newspapers great publicity has been made about the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.780
 public compensation 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.930
 It has been explained that there are two plans for social use which would correspond 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.790
 attracts millions of euros of municipal heritage that there are also arcades that 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.000
 private individuals will be given free of charge to the municipality 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.970
 we limit ourselves to observing that this transfer is a convenient custom 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.330
 by private individuals to avoid having to take care of arcade maintenance 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.220
 public that are maintained by the municipality 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.120
 a political choice this the reason for which it was drafted I found one 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.630
 pucco 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.840
 that for that sector I set no limits to the height and wrote the volumes 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.860
 maximum to realize 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.180
 an oversight 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.340
 perhaps but in a document that the specific task of defining the guidelines 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.810
 of urban development 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.030
 the rules that allow private individuals are coded with precision 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.430
 to achieve the maximum useful 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.170
 as we shall see, it is not an isolated case that something strange happens 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.509
 even if there was an oversight, there were two occasions to ask 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.949
 remedy clearly and definitively 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.619
 to attempt to limit the height of the skyscraper, several have been completed 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:18.309
 actions including 2 motion in the municipal council for which they are 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.789
 A few hundred signatures have been collected, the citizens say 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.280
 maybe it was a political choice but let's try to visualize together the 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.189
 result 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.090
 observing the tables of the project it is very difficult to get an idea of ​​that 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:36.139
 that is the impact in the incorrect construction we have tried and here 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.549
 the results 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.489
 icon view of the area before the construction of the skyscraper along 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.489
 via marconi the way of schools 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.729
 and here is the same view after the construction of the skyscraper 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.289
 let's try now to see how the shape of the skyscraper can present itself 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:57.289
 looking at records at some other point of view 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:02.339
 here is the skyscraper as it will likely appear when passing over the bridge of the 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.339
 railroad 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.949
 let's give another call 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.709
 here is another point of view 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.069
 the new panorama of recco with an egg-shaped concrete bell tower 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.529
 record must be quiet as the architect reassures us 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:09.349
 removes days from newspaper pages 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.960
 the environmental impact will not be negative 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.210
 the design foresees a slender construction body 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.669
 the numerical data concerning the height is about 34 meters from the level 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.400
 of the road 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.680
 the eye when I see a small measure object compares it through the mind with 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.809
 the existing 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:31.809
 many things can be said but how can the panorama be said to say 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:33.830
 so it has improved 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.600
 yet the height and grandeur of this skyscraper are small if 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.999
 compared with the towers of the project area xtml 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.999
 this is probably another political choice 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:48.050
 in fact, in the image in the video we have just seen, there is no presence 

00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:50.309
 of the project ex-j ml 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:54.729
 that if it is built as planned it is supported by the current ral 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:55.669
 majority 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.300
 it stood out in the panorama of recco even more clearly together with the skyscraper 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.689
 who knows what administration runs with his heart or not now his signature on 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.939
 convention to confirm the construction of the skyscraper in 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:10.900
 recco center 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.189
 arreco also does not exist housing urgency 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.269
 the residential area is aimed at speculative purposes saturating each area 

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:20.719
 available maximizing volumes 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:23.889
 re with after the war despite some intent 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.249
 it has not been rebuilt in a pleasant way but nowadays without 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.960
 urgent reasons make things worse 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.910
 it is an act that is indelibly linked and supports it starting from 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:35.849
 individual citizens
