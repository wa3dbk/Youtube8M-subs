30fps does not play well you kind of

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.500 
30fps does not play well you kind of
want

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
want

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.690 
want
i<00:02:13.569> er<00:02:13.709> because<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.980> way<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.220> camera<00:02:15.549> moves

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.789 
like I'm very high I'll open up the
medium<00:02:22.750> benchmark<00:02:23.170> here<00:02:23.349> so<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:23.530> can<00:02:23.620> check

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
medium benchmark here so you can check

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.850 
medium benchmark here so you can check
that<00:02:24.010> out<00:02:24.040> as<00:02:24.370> far<00:02:25.090> as<00:02:25.360> video<00:02:25.780> cards<00:02:26.260> you

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
that out as far as video cards you

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.100 
that out as far as video cards you
should<00:02:27.129> really<00:02:27.370> be<00:02:27.610> kind<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.569> hold<00:02:28.959> your

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
should really be kind of hold your

should really be kind of hold your
budget<00:02:29.560> for<00:02:29.769> a<00:02:29.799> little<00:02:29.890> bit<00:02:30.069> because<00:02:30.250> there<00:02:31.120> is

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
budget for a little bit because there is

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.990 
budget for a little bit because there is
something<00:02:31.810> coming<00:02:32.019> soon<00:02:32.319> we<00:02:32.650> have<00:02:33.400> tested<00:02:33.940> it

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
something coming soon we have tested it

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.449 
something coming soon we have tested it
with<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.329> game<00:02:34.599> and<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.319> works<00:02:35.500> well<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.040> hang

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
with this game and it works well so hang

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.470 
with this game and it works well so hang
on<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.610> your<00:02:36.730> budget<00:02:36.940> if<00:02:37.180> you're<00:02:37.299> buying

and you'll find out more as far as cards

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.149 
and you'll find out more as far as cards
that<00:02:43.689> exist<00:02:43.989> now<00:02:44.049> that<00:02:44.530> we<00:02:44.650> would<00:02:44.769> recommend

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
that exist now that we would recommend

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.270 
that exist now that we would recommend
if<00:02:45.370> you're<00:02:45.760> playing<00:02:46.090> at<00:02:46.950> settings<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.250> are

if you're playing at settings that are

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.880 
if you're playing at settings that are
closer<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.970> very<00:02:49.299> high<00:02:49.599> you<00:02:50.200> probably<00:02:50.530> want<00:02:50.769> to

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
closer to very high you probably want to

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.819 
closer to very high you probably want to
look<00:02:51.040> into<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.639> GTX<00:02:52.510> 970<00:02:53.139> as<00:02:53.290> your<00:02:53.440> baseline

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
look into the GTX 970 as your baseline

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.180 
look into the GTX 970 as your baseline
nvidia<00:02:54.250> card<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.480> r9<00:02:56.109> 270x<00:02:56.739> as<00:02:57.040> your

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
baseline AMD card the 285 is a very good

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.420 
baseline AMD card the 285 is a very good
sweet<00:03:01.150> spot<00:03:01.450> performer<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.349> a<00:03:02.680> two<00:03:02.739> thirty<00:03:03.220> to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
sweet spot performer and a two thirty to

fifty<00:03:03.579> dollar<00:03:03.970> price<00:03:04.209> range<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:04.750> i<00:03:04.780> definitely

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
fifty dollar price range so i definitely

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.289 
fifty dollar price range so i definitely
recommend<00:03:05.379> considering<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.250> card<00:03:06.579> as<00:03:06.790> for

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
recommend considering that card as for

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.420 
recommend considering that card as for
nvidia<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:08.290> 970<00:03:08.859> is<00:03:08.920> pretty<00:03:09.099> unbeatable

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
nvidia the 970 is pretty unbeatable

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.479 
nvidia the 970 is pretty unbeatable
right<00:03:09.790> now<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.739> that's<00:03:11.739> really<00:03:11.950> all<00:03:12.159> I<00:03:12.190> can

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
right now and that's really all I can

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.149 
right now and that's really all I can
really<00:03:12.909> speak<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.299> with<00:03:13.659> NVIDIA<00:03:14.109> so<00:03:14.560> that's

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
really speak to with NVIDIA so that's

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.039 
really speak to with NVIDIA so that's
