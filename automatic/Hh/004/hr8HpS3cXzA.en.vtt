 added I hope you are doing well 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.240
 genres for me it's going great like 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.160
 usually and you could see that in 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.460
 background i put you the map stand off 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.750
 filmed via studio mode 1 2 at the earliest 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.070
 that my little background image will be 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.750
 I did not find it fun anymore 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.460
 since in addition we find ourselves for the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.640
 third episode of how to be a good 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.439
 troll hours on black ops 2 on the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.720
 stand-up map of course so 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.340
 it's more of a tutorial with techniques 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 small hiding places and small spots 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.029
 so that you can improve in 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.439
 troll so I hope you will me 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.719
 reward one for my work if he 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.130
 you like my courage years in 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.630
 the comments and really leaving 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.090
 a maximum of green thumb please 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.920
 I hope this tutorial can go beyond 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.780
 1000 marry since here I wanted 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.340
 really show a lot technical 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.200
 many spots and I reveal to you a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.000
 little bit all my troll secrets and 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.500
 it's also because of these videos that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.610
 afterwards a little more trouble in 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.410
 troll online because people 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.120
 start a little bit to know 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.379
 techniques but that's the moment 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.680
 it is for my subscribers that it can you 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.050
 help 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.609
 that's the main thing and then I hope that 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.899
 it will serve you and you will appreciate 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.899
 this video go good video to all 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.930
 2 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.700
 so the first technique in the sleeve 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.780
 datta khel is here you just have 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.700
 to wait until there is an enemy who 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.049
 arrive and then you have more 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.180
 than the troll then it's really a 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.610
 very discreet hiding I put you 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.710
 an opposing view for you to understand that 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.350
 when the enemies arrive in this little 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.939
 angle he does not see me absolutely we 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.939
 really a very interesting hiding place 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.320
 so the second technique she 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.670
 is to turn right directly 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.420
 as soon as you respaud is 1 always in 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.420
 attac handle and you camouflaged actually 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.920
 your character and the cardboard are going to be 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.750
 completely confused one in 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.159
 the other one and the enemies really have 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.600
 no chance to see you then I 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.520
 Just wanted to clarify that this 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.679
 technique is often used in 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.750
 multiplayer so people know it 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.009
 more and more we are doing everything 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.549
 same attention but it remains a 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.549
 good technique 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.319
 so the third technique she is 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.849
 more complicated than the previous two 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.709
 since in fact you will need two 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.500
 assets you do not have on 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.150
 your usual troll ice cream I think about 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.739
 featherweight and extreme conditions for 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.900
 arrive the fastest where I get 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.760
 location and normally you arrive before 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.230
 that the enemies can see you and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.700
 after you are left more than the trolls and 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.800
 so really did the fastest 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.100
 possible with its two strengths it should 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.709
 do it 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:38.019
 this is the last little hideout 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.870
 I know about eating on this 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.790
 map stand off it's near the station 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.560
 of gasoline this technique is really 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.780
 infallible there is no chance that 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.130
 students see no matter which side 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.880
 they arrive so I show you the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.130
 adverse view 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.650
 you arrive here no matter you 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.970
 go left to the right and really 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.120
 no chance that your opponent will 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.120
 must 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.130
 so now I'm going to show you a 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.200
 super technique to make a ninja 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.390
 difuse at the bomb then there are several 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.739
 stamps in the vicinity but I 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.660
 advise you this one since in fact 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.840
 you really have a great angle of view 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.030
 directly on the bomb declemy break 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.769
 just be careful to get up 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.150
 well beside him and not to him 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.069
 block when he's finished laying the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.300
 bomb it otherwise he will realize that there is 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.989
 someone who's right next to the goal is 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.980
 then of the opposing alu it's like that 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.269
 the enemy arrive they look at a small 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.250
 little left around once 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.110
 person or who without security to ask 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.069
 the bomb but he's wrong since during 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.170
 they pose the bomb 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.640
 bah I'm just at his feet annoys me 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.100
 rim allegedly explained defuse the bomb 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.049
 so I'll put you a little clip 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.060
 who was missed online exactly at 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.500
 this place have frankly people 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.110
 I'm tired of waiting there I do not know 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.090
 what he does the hospital guy is there at 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.220
 Stick I go there or I go I go there yes 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.290
 damn i hope he will not see me yes 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.209
 yes yes it will do it that will do it 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:01.920
 go live on stand off 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.920
 we will rock you know we ola songs 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.960
 so to make ninja diffuse to the 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.640
 bomb and that's really not very 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.830
 complicated just enough of rhj is 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.030
 very quickly to this place so if 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.080
 it happens in front of you two of you 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.490
 do not move normally 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.440
 you are likely not to be 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.330
 to kill if it happens to your right 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.670
 then there is really no chance 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.410
 that the nine voices after you know 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.910
 the procedure to follow and you just need to 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.090
 to lie down this is for really the 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.280
 Stealth to be the least possible 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.750
 grid and if we can say that like that of 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.340
 the opposing view did that to the left on 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.650
 see alain offs impossible to see 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.450
 the enemy to - really expect that 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.530
 that the enemies in front troll is so 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.400
 there you pick them up in every 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.900
 corners of the map 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.180
 but it happens very rarely 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.800
 that in some receptions and then that's it 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.250
 after you take a little already aired 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.250
 to his symbols
