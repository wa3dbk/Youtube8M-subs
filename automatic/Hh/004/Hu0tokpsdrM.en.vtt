00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.230 

so<00:00:01.680> I<00:00:01.709> finally<00:00:02.159> got<00:00:02.370> my<00:00:02.429> arduino<00:00:02.909> board

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so I finally got my arduino board

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.849 
so I finally got my arduino board
working<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:04.440> interface<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.160> an<00:00:05.250> SD<00:00:05.400> card

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
working to interface to an SD card

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.280 
working to interface to an SD card
originally<00:00:07.859> had<00:00:08.010> bought<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:09.019> microSD<00:00:10.019> shield

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
originally had bought a microSD shield

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.950 
originally had bought a microSD shield
from<00:00:10.559> sparkfun<00:00:10.980> but<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.969> does<00:00:12.240> not<00:00:12.269> do<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
from sparkfun but that does not do the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.350 
from sparkfun but that does not do the
necessary<00:00:13.170> voltage<00:00:13.889> shift<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.519> convert<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> 5

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
necessary voltage shift to convert a 5

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.779 
necessary voltage shift to convert a 5
volt<00:00:15.389> read<00:00:16.260> we<00:00:16.410> know<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.710> little<00:00:17.010> pin<00:00:17.279> signal

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
volt read we know this little pin signal

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.890 
volt read we know this little pin signal
so<00:00:18.359> 3.3<00:00:18.990> volt<00:00:19.230> used<00:00:19.770> by<00:00:20.039> micro<00:00:20.460> SD<00:00:20.760> card<00:00:21.000> so

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
so 3.3 volt used by micro SD card so

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.390 
so 3.3 volt used by micro SD card so
I've<00:00:22.080> got<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.890> micro<00:00:23.519> SD<00:00:23.550> adapter<00:00:23.910> and

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
I've got here is a micro SD adapter and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.550 
I've got here is a micro SD adapter and
I<00:00:26.400> solder<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.880> some<00:00:27.090> pins<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> back<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
I solder it some pins to the back of it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.150 
I solder it some pins to the back of it
so<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> could<00:00:29.099> plug<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.490> into<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.699> breadboard<00:00:30.090> and

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
so I could plug it into a breadboard and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.889 
so I could plug it into a breadboard and
basically<00:00:32.809> it<00:00:33.809> goes<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.730> like<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:38.570> what<00:00:39.570> helps

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
basically it goes in like so what helps

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.920 
basically it goes in like so what helps
you<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> into<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:40.920> pins<00:00:41.780> so<00:00:42.780> that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
you get it into the right pins so that

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.100 
you get it into the right pins so that
goes<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:44.070> then<00:00:44.219> take<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> micro<00:00:45.539> SD<00:00:45.809> card

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
goes in and then take the micro SD card

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.740 
goes in and then take the micro SD card
and<00:00:46.579> just<00:00:47.579> plug<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.350> top<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:53.750> like

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and just plug it in on the top here like

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.420 
and just plug it in on the top here like
so<00:00:56.120> we've<00:00:57.120> got<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.660> 3.3<00:00:58.350> volt<00:00:58.590> line<00:00:59.129> running

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so we've got the 3.3 volt line running

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.860 
so we've got the 3.3 volt line running
from<00:00:59.550> Arduino<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> back<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
from Arduino down to the back of the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.240 
from Arduino down to the back of the
breadboard<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.739> running<00:01:02.010> through<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
breadboard it's running through a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.929 
breadboard it's running through a
potentiometer<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:03.180> also<00:01:03.960> coming<00:01:04.170> down<00:01:04.409> here

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
potentiometer is also coming down here

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.390 
potentiometer is also coming down here
connecting<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.060> giving<00:01:06.299> podge<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> SD<00:01:07.080> card

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
connecting and giving podge of SD card

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.000 
connecting and giving podge of SD card
I've<00:01:08.400> got<00:01:08.700> some<00:01:09.210> resistors<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:10.010> radioshack

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
I've got some resistors from radioshack

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.039 
I've got some resistors from radioshack
incredibly<00:01:11.880> overpriced<00:01:12.150> there<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> penny

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
incredibly overpriced there a penny

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.289 
incredibly overpriced there a penny
online<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> internet<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.030> five

down here connecting to the ground and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.210 
down here connecting to the ground and
between<00:01:32.850> them<00:01:33.119> I've<00:01:33.360> got<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.710> green<00:01:34.979> wires

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
between them I've got the green wires

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.010 
between them I've got the green wires
coming<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.720> digital<00:01:37.049> pin<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.680> Arduino

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
coming in to the digital pin on Arduino

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.980 
coming in to the digital pin on Arduino
that<00:01:40.020> does<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> voltage<00:01:41.070> shift<00:01:41.600> from<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.780> 5

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
that does the voltage shift from the 5

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.319 
that does the voltage shift from the 5
volt<00:01:43.020> down<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> 3.3<00:01:44.310> volt<00:01:44.490> used<00:01:44.729> by<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.939> SD

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
of course to the ground I've got the as

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.460 
of course to the ground I've got the as
the<00:02:07.140> fat<00:02:08.090> analog<00:02:09.090> logger<00:02:09.420> example<00:02:10.020> loaded<00:02:10.350> up

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the fat analog logger example loaded up

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.690 
the fat analog logger example loaded up
I<00:02:11.090> changed<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.390> sensor<00:02:13.170> count<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:13.890> set<00:02:14.550> of

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
I changed the sensor count to one set of

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.630 
I changed the sensor count to one set of
the<00:02:14.880> three<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.270> thing<00:02:15.570> that<00:02:15.690> had<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:17.220> now<00:02:17.370> let's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
the three a thing that had so now let's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:26.870 
the three a thing that had so now let's
plug<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.360> board<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:19.700> see<00:02:20.700> how<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.000> goes<00:02:25.880> so

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
plug in the board and see how it goes so

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.680 
plug in the board and see how it goes so
do<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.090> power<00:02:27.360> there<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:30.030> think<00:02:30.270> it's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
do that power there and I think it's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.750 
do that power there and I think it's
ready<00:02:32.270> let<00:02:33.270> me<00:02:33.420> open<00:02:34.580> up<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.790> serial<00:02:36.209> monitor

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
ready let me open up the serial monitor

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.690 
ready let me open up the serial monitor
and<00:02:38.760> I'm<00:02:39.000> going<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.209> move<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.450> over<00:02:39.690> here<00:02:40.700> so

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
and I'm going to move that over here so

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.120 
and I'm going to move that over here so
you<00:02:41.850> can<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.450> says<00:02:42.690> type<00:02:43.290> any<00:02:43.560> character

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
you can see it says type any character

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.440 
you can see it says type any character
to<00:02:44.610> start<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.920> what<00:02:47.010> I'm<00:02:47.130> going<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.459> do<00:02:47.580> come

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
to start so so what I'm going to do come

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
to start so so what I'm going to do come
down<00:02:48.600> here<00:02:48.840> type<00:02:49.380> ok<00:02:50.180> center<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:52.830> goes

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
down here type ok center and that goes

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.410 
down here type ok center and that goes
so<00:02:55.470> it's<00:02:55.620> logging<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.190> value<00:02:56.610> coming<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.120> from

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
so it's logging the value coming in from

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.820 
so it's logging the value coming in from
the<00:02:57.480> potentiometer<00:03:00.260> if<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.910> crank<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.030> down

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
the potentiometer if I crank it down

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.720 
the potentiometer if I crank it down
pull<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.040> way<00:03:05.130> down<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.640> zero<00:03:07.400> you'll<00:03:08.400> see

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
pull the way down to zero you'll see

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.520 
pull the way down to zero you'll see
that<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.299> logger<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:10.019> now<00:03:10.290> logging<00:03:10.620> 0<00:03:12.290> if<00:03:13.290> I

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
that the logger is now logging 0 if I

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.650 
that the logger is now logging 0 if I
crank<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.519> all<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.239> way<00:03:15.600> up

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.190 

can<00:03:21.260> see<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.620> logger<00:03:23.470> lying<00:03:24.470> in<00:03:24.650> about<00:03:24.860> 688

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
can see the logger lying in about 688

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.820 
can see the logger lying in about 688
now<00:03:27.200> on<00:03:27.590> our<00:03:27.710> you<00:03:27.860> know<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.900> digital<00:03:29.900> pin<00:03:30.230> the

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
now on our you know the digital pin the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:38.860 
now on our you know the digital pin the
analog<00:03:31.310> pin<00:03:32.530> maps<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:34.580> 02<00:03:35.950> 1023<00:03:36.950> value<00:03:37.870> across

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
analog pin maps the 02 1023 value across

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.070 
analog pin maps the 02 1023 value across
0<00:03:39.650> corresponds<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.490> 0<00:03:40.520> volts<00:03:41.120> 1023

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
0 corresponds to 0 volts 1023

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.770 
0 corresponds to 0 volts 1023
corresponds<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.740> 5<00:03:42.920> volts<00:03:43.210> since<00:03:44.210> I've<00:03:44.450> got<00:03:44.660> it

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
corresponds to 5 volts since I've got it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.990 
corresponds to 5 volts since I've got it
connected<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.320> 3.3<00:03:45.920> line<00:03:46.100> it's<00:03:46.580> not<00:03:46.850> going

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
connected to a 3.3 line it's not going

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.660 
connected to a 3.3 line it's not going
to<00:03:47.090> go<00:03:47.180> up<00:03:47.360> to<00:03:47.540> 10<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.870> 13<00:03:48.230> even<00:03:49.190> when<00:03:49.550> it's

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
to go up to 10 to 13 even when it's

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.930 
to go up to 10 to 13 even when it's
cranked<00:03:49.970> up<00:03:50.060> all<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.420> way<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:53.560> you<00:03:54.560> can<00:03:54.940> see

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
cranked up all the way so you can see

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.640 
cranked up all the way so you can see
that<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.270> as<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:57.920> crank<00:03:58.250> it<00:03:58.400> down<00:03:59.290> you<00:04:00.290> can<00:04:00.440> see

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
that a as I crank it down you can see

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:09.160 
that a as I crank it down you can see
the<00:04:00.770> values<00:04:01.160> change<00:04:07.300> three<00:04:08.300> a<00:04:08.330> few<00:04:08.630> seconds

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
the values change three a few seconds

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.160 
the values change three a few seconds
when<00:04:09.350> it's<00:04:09.710> being<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.070> sampling<00:04:13.600> and<00:04:14.600> then

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
when it's being a sampling and then

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.470 
when it's being a sampling and then
filing<00:04:15.470> sound<00:04:15.950> 0<00:04:18.640> so<00:04:19.640> that's<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.239> setup

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
filing sound 0 so that's the setup

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.040 
filing sound 0 so that's the setup
that's<00:04:21.109> how<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:21.410> got<00:04:21.650> it<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:21.920> work
