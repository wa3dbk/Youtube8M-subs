00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.070
 hello to you again this is a wonderful 2d 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.010
 and today we will talk about one more 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.290
 unknown masterpieces for nintendo and thunder 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.180
 metal storm has developed unknown there 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.310
 takes a and passed his famous park 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.850
 scroll shooter for r-type company 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.040
 epam in 1991 and the game immediately 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.130
 appeared in america and only then a year later 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.690
 in Japan 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.369
 it is likely that we have on the cartridges 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.979
 she never appeared and that neither 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.670
 strange as even in America itself about 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.670
 few knew her 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.310
 but oh well move on to the game on 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.160
 2501 High Technology Story 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.990
 lead humanity deaths and why i 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.240
 not surprised 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.830
 shorter than some cool military laser gun 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.930
 Solberg parts on the planet Pluto 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.149
 created by man to protect against 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.250
 alien invasions their going crazy and 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.870
 begins to destroy the planets of the solar 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.680
 systems and now aimed the side of the earth 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.360
 accordingly to save the planet 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.130
 the earth does not send itself 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.050
 technological robot to here 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.320
 snuck on cyber and stopped the laser 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.320
 gun 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.310
 the plot by the way is quite original before 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.869
 time I want to tell you but how 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.869
 says not a single plot 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.270
 The first thing that strikes you is the graphics. 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.660
 damn but it's really cool all these little ones 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.060
 details animation animation is it at all 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.650
 something not surami and nintendo animation 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.420
 despite being very detailed and 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.490
 sprites are just awesome 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.060
 and this concerns not only the main 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.500
 hero and all the enemies and bosses 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.090
 still very striking so 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.490
 called parallax scrolling 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.050
 this is when the background elements are moving 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.020
 different speed creating effect 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.960
 bulkiness this effect is very rare 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.180
 used in games inflicted as well 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.550
 The device on the console did not support this 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.980
 and programmers had to be cunning with 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.610
 code to achieve this effect but 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.220
 parallax 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.050
 This is generally an interesting topic and somehow 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.050
 I will issue separately in the near future 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.150
 dedicated to this technology 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.250
 as for music she is here too 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.140
 high level although only remembered 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.190
 several tracks in particular from the first 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.190
 third and fifth level 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.480
 but the interesting thing is the gameplay in the game 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.390
 have the ability to control gravity 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.820
 that even now sometimes used in indie 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.040
 games but then it was a breakthrough 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.570
 that is, you had to click on the gamepad 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.250
 up or down + a 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.650
 and the player together with the enemies changed 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.930
 gravity is pretty diversified 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.150
 gameplay and some 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.730
 levels were and logical tasks in terms of 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.739
 where to stand and where to change 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.800
 gravity to go through this or that 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.800
 a place 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.870
 This chip was in one of the level 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.280
 Megamen 5 but there the player could not personally 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.950
 drive gravity 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.930
 yes to them this storm came out for almost two years 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.660
 earlier the game is pretty hardcore by the way 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.250
 but you can pass it at the end of the game you 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.500
 get a password to enable mode 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.060
 expert to be honest i'm not even 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.060
 imagine what's going on in this mode 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.700
 so we continue to exist also 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.500
 some interesting facts about the game 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.240
 when you fight with the boss of the sixth stage 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.220
 in the background you can see a few 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.170
 battleships from the third level r-type 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.170
 who also developed the rm 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.480
 screensaver is only Japanese version 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.990
 games though using cheat device game 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.910
 genies 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.620
 You can see the screen saver and on 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:36.380
 american version true with next 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:38.360
 graphic bugs japanese version in 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.460
 some levels have a little different 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.140
 color palette and end up looking 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.140
 a little brighter with more juicy colors 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.369
 as previously said, the game was not particularly 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:53.139
 known even in america most likely it 

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:54.849
 due to the fact that she came out in one and 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.129
 same time with hits like battle 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.929
 toads batman return of d joker and 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.509
 burgundy space mutants 

00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:03.219
 also maybe it was due to little 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.019
 fame yuri at that time 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:09.759
 so a few more months 

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:11.229
 appeared super nintendo and one of 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.819
 Publishers put the game average 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.829
 five shakes rating 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:18.759
 which is pretty low for me 

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:21.999
 product however nintendo power magazine 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:24.129
 March issue of 1991 released 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.079
 12 page article about the game 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:30.729
 that somehow let know about 

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:32.649
 the existence of a metal storm but still 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.079
 even now the game cannot be seen in 

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:36.969
 one top for nes probably its not for nothing 

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:40.569
 called the most underrated game for 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:42.219
 nintendo well that's all for everyone 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.529
 thanks for watching don't forget to bet 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:46.919
 thumb up and subscribe to the channel before 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.919
 new meetings 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.439
 and
