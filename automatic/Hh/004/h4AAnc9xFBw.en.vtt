00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.709 
actually like that I don't like the
thought<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.430> coming<00:01:56.700> loose<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.149> my<00:01:57.270> lind

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
thought of this coming loose in my lind

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.230 
thought of this coming loose in my lind
falling<00:01:58.170> out<00:01:58.610> another<00:01:59.610> thing<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.180> to

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
falling out another thing just to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.859 
falling out another thing just to
mention<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.780> actually<00:02:01.140> chose<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.649> get<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
mention I actually chose to get the

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.380 
mention I actually chose to get the
wimberley<00:02:03.869> p40<00:02:04.860> linds<00:02:05.579> plate<00:02:06.030> which<00:02:06.360> is

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
wimberley p40 linds plate which is

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.059 
wimberley p40 linds plate which is
actually<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.869> little<00:02:06.960> bit<00:02:07.170> bigger<00:02:07.439> than<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
actually a little bit bigger than the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.600 
actually a little bit bigger than the
recommended<00:02:08.599> p30<00:02:09.979> personally<00:02:10.979> i<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.129> that

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
recommended p30 personally i like that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.750 
recommended p30 personally i like that
it<00:02:11.760> gives<00:02:11.940> me

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
it gives me

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.149 
it gives me
to<00:02:12.879> hold<00:02:13.360> on<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.870> also<00:02:14.230> allows<00:02:14.620> for<00:02:14.980> greater

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
to hold on to it also allows for greater

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.030 
to hold on to it also allows for greater
degree<00:02:18.159> of<00:02:18.189> flexibility<00:02:18.909> of<00:02:19.090> moving<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:20.040> lens

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
degree of flexibility of moving the lens

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.949 
degree of flexibility of moving the lens
forward<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.670> backwards<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.269> this<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.780> mount

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
forward and backwards in this the mount

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.899 
forward and backwards in this the mount
itself<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.860> was<00:02:24.310> just<00:02:24.489> a<00:02:24.549> personal

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
itself so that was just a personal

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.210 
itself so that was just a personal
decision<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.599> I<00:02:25.900> god<00:02:26.200> that's<00:02:26.680> that's<00:02:26.980> why<00:02:27.189> I

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
decision and I god that's that's why I

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.130 
decision and I god that's that's why I
chose<00:02:27.489> to<00:02:27.670> do<00:02:27.849> that<00:02:28.060> either<00:02:28.870> would<00:02:29.079> work

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
chose to do that either would work

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.259 
chose to do that either would work
another<00:02:29.680> feature<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.519> show<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.909> I

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
another feature just to show you that I

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.710 
another feature just to show you that I
like<00:02:31.900> another<00:02:32.230> added<00:02:32.680> bit<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.430> safety<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.420> that

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
like another added bit of safety is that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.369 
like another added bit of safety is that
this<00:02:35.560> comes<00:02:35.860> with<00:02:36.010> these<00:02:37.049> screw<00:02:38.049> and<00:02:38.319> the

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
this comes with these screw and the

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.440 
this comes with these screw and the
front<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.129> back<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.700> what<00:02:39.819> this<00:02:39.970> does<00:02:40.209> is

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
front and the back and what this does is

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.979 
front and the back and what this does is
this<00:02:40.480> actually<00:02:41.260> prevents<00:02:42.299> this<00:02:43.299> from<00:02:43.359> sliding

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
this actually prevents this from sliding

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.190 
this actually prevents this from sliding
off<00:02:44.319> there's<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.790> catches<00:02:46.329> here<00:02:46.629> so<00:02:47.079> if<00:02:47.170> you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
off there's it catches here so if you

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.559 
off there's it catches here so if you
excellent<00:02:47.650> leave<00:02:47.829> this<00:02:48.010> loose<00:02:48.310> they<00:02:49.150> catch<00:02:49.390> up

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
excellent leave this loose they catch up

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.449 
excellent leave this loose they catch up
there<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:49.930> well<00:02:50.140> so<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:51.099> could<00:02:51.310> potentially

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
there as well so that could potentially

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.330 
there as well so that could potentially
save<00:02:52.120> you<00:02:52.420> your<00:02:53.290> investment<00:02:53.980> if<00:02:54.099> you<00:02:54.190> actually

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
save you your investment if you actually

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.490 
save you your investment if you actually
left<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:54.970> loose<00:02:55.389> and<00:02:55.780> had<00:02:55.989> it<00:02:56.139> something

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
left this loose and had it something

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.539 
left this loose and had it something
forward<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.450> overall<00:02:58.450> very<00:02:59.170> impressed<00:02:59.650> it<00:03:00.400> was

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
forward so overall very impressed it was

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.629 
forward so overall very impressed it was
worth<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.420> investment<00:03:01.840> this<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.680> pretty
