squad<00:01:52.500> mates<00:01:52.740> are<00:01:52.950> much<00:01:53.130> more<00:01:53.399> reliable<00:01:53.939> than

squad mates are much more reliable than

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.399 
squad mates are much more reliable than
in<00:01:54.240> other<00:01:54.360> games<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.840> every<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.320> then

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
in other games but every now and then

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.020 
in other games but every now and then
they'll<00:01:55.619> still<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.039> something<00:01:56.340> stupid<00:01:57.000> like

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
they'll still do something stupid like

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
they'll still do something stupid like
go<00:01:57.360> prone<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> middle<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.289> road<00:01:58.500> near<00:01:58.740> an

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
mg in parts of the game you'll take

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.779 
mg in parts of the game you'll take
direct<00:02:01.470> control<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.799> your<00:02:02.009> squad<00:02:02.280> mates<00:02:02.310> as

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
direct control of your squad mates as

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.179 
direct control of your squad mates as
well<00:02:02.970> as<00:02:03.119> giving<00:02:03.330> them<00:02:03.509> orders<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.380> driver<00:02:04.920> get

well as giving them orders to driver get
in<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.549> car<00:02:05.850> right<00:02:06.539> and<00:02:07.110> you'll<00:02:07.470> use<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.799> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
in a car right and you'll use this to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.919 
in a car right and you'll use this to
plan<00:02:08.250> attacks<00:02:08.700> together<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.360> tricks<00:02:09.690> like

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
plan attacks together with tricks like

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.750 
plan attacks together with tricks like
attacking<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.860> Sun<00:02:11.039> behind<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
attacking with the Sun behind you to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.430 
attacking with the Sun behind you to
reduce<00:02:12.030> your<00:02:12.090> enemies<00:02:12.599> visibility<00:02:13.230> even

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
reduce your enemies visibility even

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.500 
reduce your enemies visibility even
later<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.519> use<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.880> map<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.090> command

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
later on you use the map to command

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.530 
later on you use the map to command
several<00:02:15.930> squads<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.830> move<00:02:17.190> 500<00:02:17.580> meters<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.180> our

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
several squads to move 500 meters to our

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.250 
several squads to move 500 meters to our
left<00:02:20.000> you'll<00:02:21.000> also<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.360> controlling<00:02:21.840> armor

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
left you'll also be controlling armor

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.020 
left you'll also be controlling armor
piloting<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> air<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.519> parachute

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
piloting in the air and parachute

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.759 
piloting in the air and parachute
dropping<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:24.840> most<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.230> your<00:02:25.380> time<00:02:25.590> will<00:02:25.739> be

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
dropping but most of your time will be

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.890 
dropping but most of your time will be
spent<00:02:25.980> planning<00:02:26.549> that<00:02:26.670> all-important<00:02:27.569> first

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
spent planning that all-important first

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.259 
spent planning that all-important first
shot<00:02:28.260> which<00:02:28.739> isn't<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.340> easy<00:02:29.580> when<00:02:29.910> bullet

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
shot which isn't so easy when bullet

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.100 
shot which isn't so easy when bullet
drop<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.599> travel<00:02:31.200> timer<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.709> equation

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
drop and travel timer in the equation

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.180 
drop and travel timer in the equation
yeah<00:02:34.110> it's<00:02:34.260> hard<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.470> get<00:02:34.590> used<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.069> know

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
yeah it's hard to get used to you know

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.309 
yeah it's hard to get used to you know
games<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.610> Call<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.030> Duty<00:02:36.420> they<00:02:37.049> picked

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
games like Call of Duty they picked

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.870 
games like Call of Duty they picked
those<00:02:37.500> kind<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.769> realism<00:02:38.130> moments<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.790> then

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
those kind of realism moments and then

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.270 
those kind of realism moments and then
stylize<00:02:39.599> in<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.959> best<00:02:40.200> distance<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.920> also<00:02:41.069> have

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
stylize in a best distance you also have

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.559 
stylize in a best distance you also have
to<00:02:41.370> take<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.549> car<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> always<00:02:41.849> effect<00:02:42.330> into

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
to take the car I always effect into

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.149 
to take the car I always effect into
account<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:44.280> Coriolis<00:02:44.940> effect

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
account the Coriolis effect

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.339 
account the Coriolis effect
not<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> good<00:02:47.939> day<00:02:48.180> yeah<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:49.079> way<00:02:49.170> it's

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
not a good day yeah and that way it's

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.199 
not a good day yeah and that way it's
great<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.739> games<00:02:49.950> like<00:02:50.129> ARMA<00:02:50.459> exists<00:02:51.090> you

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
great that games like ARMA exists you

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.580 
great that games like ARMA exists you
know<00:02:51.299> they're<00:02:51.480> kind<00:02:51.629> of<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.780> pioneers<00:02:52.319> and

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
know they're kind of the pioneers and

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.229 
know they're kind of the pioneers and
figuring<00:02:53.280> out<00:02:53.370> how<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.549> represent<00:02:53.819> real

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
figuring out how to represent real

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.240 
figuring out how to represent real
combat<00:02:54.689> with<00:02:54.870> game<00:02:55.109> mechanics<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.859> interface

combat with game mechanics and interface

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.309 
combat with game mechanics and interface
you'll<00:02:56.909> also<00:02:57.090> be<00:02:57.329> forced<00:02:57.629> to<00:02:57.719> make<00:02:57.870> some<00:02:57.900> hard

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
you'll also be forced to make some hard

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.750 
you'll also be forced to make some hard
decisions<00:02:58.379> on<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.099> fly<00:02:59.250> I'm<00:03:00.060> not<00:03:00.780> sure<00:03:01.109> miles

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
decisions on the fly I'm not sure miles

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.550 
decisions on the fly I'm not sure miles
come<00:03:02.760> on<00:03:02.969> coop<00:03:03.329> you<00:03:03.930> can<00:03:04.079> see<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.349> situation

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
come on coop you can see the situation

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.890 
come on coop you can see the situation
clearly<00:03:05.000> you've<00:03:06.000> got<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.359> make<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.629> call

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
clearly you've got to make this call

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.720 
clearly you've got to make this call
there<00:03:07.680> any<00:03:07.859> chance<00:03:08.159> you<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.370> manually

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
there any chance you can manually

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.399 
there any chance you can manually
detonate<00:03:09.239> without<00:03:09.540> risking<00:03:09.930> civilian

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409

casualties moral choices and games are
so<00:03:13.349> hot<00:03:13.530> right<00:03:13.709> now<00:03:13.769> but<00:03:14.129> as<00:03:14.280> we've<00:03:14.459> seen<00:03:14.670> with
