00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
lights just not for something this big

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.940 
lights just not for something this big
you<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.659> get<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.049> these<00:01:55.110> things<00:01:55.439> one

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
you want to get one of these things one

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.800 
you want to get one of these things one
of<00:01:56.040> these<00:01:56.130> beefy<00:01:57.979> umbrella<00:01:59.450> holder<00:02:00.450> things

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
of these beefy umbrella holder things

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.859 
of these beefy umbrella holder things
I'll<00:02:01.439> have<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> link<00:02:01.770> below<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:03.659> and

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
I'll have a link below to this one and

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.170 
I'll have a link below to this one and
other<00:02:04.560> ones<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> think<00:02:05.009> would<00:02:05.610> work<00:02:05.640> well

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
other ones that I think would work well

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.999 
other ones that I think would work well
but<00:02:06.960> basically<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.500> want<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.829> get<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
but basically you want to just get a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.479 
but basically you want to just get a
beefy<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.179> should<00:02:09.539> be<00:02:09.599> fine

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
beefy one and then that should be fine

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.710 
beefy one and then that should be fine
now<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.670> light<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:12.300> be

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
now this light can be

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.930 
now this light can be
used<00:02:12.840> with<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.770> really<00:02:14.250> strong<00:02:14.310> light<00:02:14.760> like

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
used with a really strong light like

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.240 
used with a really strong light like
this<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> 500<00:02:16.020> watt<00:02:16.170> tungsten<00:02:16.980> bulb

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
this this is a 500 watt tungsten bulb

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.140 
this this is a 500 watt tungsten bulb
and<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.930> better<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:20.160> get<00:02:20.280> better<00:02:20.430> results<00:02:20.580> and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
and the better to get better results and

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.640 
and the better to get better results and
to<00:02:21.390> get<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.540> bit<00:02:21.720> basically<00:02:21.960> a<00:02:22.050> softer<00:02:22.410> light

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
to get a bit basically a softer light

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.860 
to get a bit basically a softer light
you<00:02:22.770> want<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.190> light<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.780> gives<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.050> wide

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
you want a light that gives you a wide

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.750 
you want a light that gives you a wide
beam<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.140> light<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> bare

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
beam of light so like this it's a bare

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.420 
beam of light so like this it's a bare
bulb<00:02:29.970> or<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:31.380> want<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.680> place<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.250> light

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
bulb or you want to just place the light

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.670 
bulb or you want to just place the light
further<00:02:32.670> away<00:02:32.970> from<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.600> what<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.440> can<00:02:34.590> do

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
further away from it and what you can do

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.890 
further away from it and what you can do
with<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.040> actually<00:02:35.130> use<00:02:35.490> it<00:02:35.640> not<00:02:36.570> just<00:02:36.630> as

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
with this is actually use it not just as

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.360 
with this is actually use it not just as
an<00:02:37.020> umbrella<00:02:37.290> but<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> reflector<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.310> you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
an umbrella but as a reflector so you

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.190 
an umbrella but as a reflector so you
could<00:02:38.520> have<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:39.390> umbrella<00:02:39.780> set<00:02:40.110> up

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
could have this umbrella set up

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.670 
could have this umbrella set up
somewhere<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.940> just<00:02:41.940> have<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.480> light<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:43.140> you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
somewhere and just have a light if you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.949 
somewhere and just have a light if you
wanted<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.190> our<00:02:44.400> separate<00:02:44.730> stand<00:02:45.000> or<00:02:45.300> however

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
wanted to our separate stand or however

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.570 
wanted to our separate stand or however
you<00:02:46.170> want<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.350> set<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.590> up<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.220> use<00:02:47.430> this

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
you want to set it up and just use this

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.230 
you want to set it up and just use this
as<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.820> big<00:02:48.180> reflector<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:49.850> this<00:02:50.850> thing<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.209> a

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
as a big reflector and this thing is a

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.370 
as a big reflector and this thing is a
shoot<00:02:51.510> through<00:02:51.660> umbrella<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.170> need<00:02:52.290> to

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
shoot through umbrella so you need to

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.570 
shoot through umbrella so you need to
remember<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.680> some<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.310> light<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.459> going

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
remember that some of the light is going

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.190 
remember that some of the light is going
to<00:02:53.670> get<00:02:53.790> lost<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.420> if<00:02:54.720> you're<00:02:54.810> using<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.170> like

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
to get lost so if you're using it like

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.980 
to get lost so if you're using it like
this<00:02:55.500> as<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.740> bounce<00:02:56.040> bouncing<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:56.880> way<00:02:57.090> then

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
this as a bounce bouncing this way then

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.380 
this as a bounce bouncing this way then
it's<00:02:58.380> going<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.980> some<00:02:59.850> of<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.000> light<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.270> going

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
it's going to some of the light is going

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.720 
it's going to some of the light is going
to<00:03:00.480> get<00:03:00.630> lost<00:03:00.870> going<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.980> way<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.340> then<00:03:02.610> if

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
to get lost going that way and then if

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
to get lost going that way and then if
you're<00:03:02.850> using<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.240> as<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.360> shoot<00:03:03.600> through

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
you're using it as a shoot through

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.240 
you're using it as a shoot through
umbrella<00:03:03.780> with<00:03:04.260> your<00:03:04.380> subject<00:03:04.770> over<00:03:05.010> there

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
umbrella with your subject over there

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.040 
umbrella with your subject over there
then<00:03:05.910> some<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.300> light<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.600> going<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.900> get

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
then some of the light is going to get

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.710 
then some of the light is going to get
lost<00:03:07.230> bouncing<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:08.370> way<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:09.450> isn't

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
lost bouncing this way this isn't

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.230 
lost bouncing this way this isn't
necessarily<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.470> bad<00:03:10.560> thing<00:03:10.830> because<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.880> shoot

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
necessarily a bad thing because a shoot

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.920 
necessarily a bad thing because a shoot
through<00:03:12.570> allows<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:14.100> get<00:03:14.880> much<00:03:15.240> closer<00:03:15.660> to

through allows you to get much closer to

through allows you to get much closer to
your<00:03:16.020> subject<00:03:16.080> your<00:03:16.950> subject<00:03:17.489> could<00:03:17.670> be<00:03:17.850> right

your subject is going to have a really

really soft light on them and then with

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.690 
really soft light on them and then with
a<00:03:27.480> reflective<00:03:28.230> umbrella<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.920> does<00:03:29.340> not

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
that back it does reflect more light

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.479 
further away from the subject you'd have
to<00:03:38.459> be<00:03:38.610> sort<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.690> distance<00:03:40.280> away<00:03:41.280> from

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
to be sort of this distance away from

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.520 
to be sort of this distance away from
them<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.989> light<00:03:43.110> isn't<00:03:43.230> going<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.470> be

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
them and so the light isn't going to be

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.250 
them and so the light isn't going to be
quite<00:03:43.560> as<00:03:43.920> soft<00:03:44.100> because<00:03:44.580> you're<00:03:45.209> not<00:03:45.480> that's

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
quite as soft because you're not that's

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.070 
quite as soft because you're not that's
that<00:03:46.769> close<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.489> umbrella<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.480> that's<00:03:48.959> why

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
that close to the umbrella so that's why

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.660 
that close to the umbrella so that's why
I<00:03:49.110> like<00:03:49.260> shoot<00:03:49.500> through<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:50.100> lose<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.340> little

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
I like shoot through you lose a little

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.850 
I like shoot through you lose a little
bit<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.910> light<00:03:51.150> but<00:03:52.019> not<00:03:52.200> really<00:03:52.410> if<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.709> use

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
bit of light but not really if you use

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.050 
bit of light but not really if you use
it<00:03:53.010> as<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.160> shoot<00:03:53.340> through<00:03:53.519> then<00:03:53.670> technically

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
it as a shoot through then technically

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.310 
it as a shoot through then technically
you're<00:03:54.209> not<00:03:54.239> losing<00:03:54.630> light<00:03:54.810> because<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.170> can

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
you're not losing light because you can

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.750 
you're not losing light because you can
get<00:03:55.410> much<00:03:55.650> closer<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.010> your<00:03:56.160> subject<00:03:56.190> which<00:03:56.640> is

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
get much closer to your subject which is

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.170 
get much closer to your subject which is
lovely<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:58.610> then<00:03:59.610> at<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.760> same<00:03:59.910> time<00:03:59.970> it

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
lovely and and then at the same time it

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.490 
lovely and and then at the same time it
also<00:04:00.299> gives<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.660> option<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.019> use<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.350> as<00:04:01.470> a

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
also gives you the option to use it as a

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.830 
also gives you the option to use it as a
reflective<00:04:02.100> umbrella<00:04:02.400> like<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:02.940> bouncing

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
reflective umbrella like this bouncing

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.890 
reflective umbrella like this bouncing
light<00:04:03.989> back<00:04:04.170> this<00:04:04.530> way<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:05.430> yeah<00:04:06.390> that's<00:04:06.750> why<00:04:06.870> I

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
light back this way so yeah that's why I

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.150 
light back this way so yeah that's why I
went<00:04:07.049> for<00:04:07.170> shoot<00:04:07.440> through<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.680> find<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.010> it's

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
went for shoot through I find that it's

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.090 
went for shoot through I find that it's
the<00:04:08.280> most<00:04:08.430> versatile<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.799> yeah<00:04:10.799> really

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
the most versatile and yeah really

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.280 
which is another reason why I went for
this<00:04:17.060> because<00:04:18.060> they<00:04:18.239> do<00:04:18.330> like<00:04:18.510> soft<00:04:18.720> boxes<00:04:19.080> but

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
this because they do like soft boxes but

this because they do like soft boxes but
