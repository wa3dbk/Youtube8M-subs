00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
she's a lot more in her clamshell so and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.249 
she's a lot more in her clamshell so and
now<00:01:17.369> she<00:01:17.430> has<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:18.270> band<00:01:18.869> holding

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
now she has like a little band holding

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.480 
now she has like a little band holding
her<00:01:19.409> gun<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:19.860> kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.130> cool

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
her gun that's kind of cool

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.740 
her gun that's kind of cool
none<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> other<00:01:21.150> ones<00:01:21.330> thought<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.720> I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
none of the other ones thought that I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.600 
none of the other ones thought that I
thought<00:01:23.420> comes<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.570> pretty<00:01:24.780> easy<00:01:25.490> that's<00:01:26.490> all

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
thought comes all pretty easy that's all

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.469 
thought comes all pretty easy that's all
you<00:01:26.729> got<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> side<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.390> you

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you got to do to the side and then you

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.640 
you got to do to the side and then you
get<00:01:30.630> her<00:01:30.840> out<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.229> then<00:01:31.619> I'll<00:01:31.740> position<00:01:32.040> done

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
get her out and then I'll position done

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.140 
get her out and then I'll position done
I'll<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.860> probably<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:36.000> laid<00:01:36.420> them<00:01:36.689> down

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.280 

so<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.390> see<00:01:42.450> her<00:01:42.659> climb<00:01:42.899> show<00:01:43.079> has<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so as you can see her climb show has a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.469 
so as you can see her climb show has a
lot<00:01:43.530> more<00:01:43.560> she's<00:01:44.490> actually<00:01:44.939> talked<00:01:45.299> with

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
lot more she's actually talked with

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.670 
lot more she's actually talked with
touching<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> top<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> lot

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
touching the top a lot

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.500 
touching the top a lot
so<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.580> guess<00:01:47.790> they<00:01:47.940> were<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.210> trying<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.420> be

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
so I guess they were just trying to be

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.430 
so I guess they were just trying to be
cool<00:01:48.720> different<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:54.630> has<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> strap<00:01:55.230> right

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
cool different it has a strap right

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.600 
cool different it has a strap right
there<00:01:55.500> her<00:01:56.600> waist<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.950> there<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.400> that<00:01:59.550> was

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
glad I got them and the females tend to

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.520 
glad I got them and the females tend to
always<00:04:44.940> be<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> lot<00:04:45.300> harder<00:04:45.539> than<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:46.350> boat

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
always be a lot harder than the boat

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.740 
always be a lot harder than the boat
within<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.039> males<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:47.669> that's<00:04:48.449> because<00:04:48.660> I

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
within the males and that's because I

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.230 
within the males and that's because I
think<00:04:48.810> Bandai<00:04:49.289> feels<00:04:49.560> it's<00:04:49.919> a<00:04:50.010> boys<00:04:50.250> line<00:04:50.610> so

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
think Bandai feels it's a boys line so

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.180 
think Bandai feels it's a boys line so
they<00:04:51.510> definitely<00:04:51.810> gotta<00:04:52.080> make<00:04:52.289> tons<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.919> red

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
they definitely gotta make tons of red

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.250 
they definitely gotta make tons of red
and<00:04:53.490> then<00:04:54.120> they<00:04:54.240> go<00:04:54.389> with<00:04:54.539> the<00:04:54.690> second<00:04:55.080> their

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
and then they go with the second their

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.740 
and then they go with the second their
secondary<00:04:55.830> third<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.639> third<00:04:56.970> primary<00:04:57.330> no

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
secondary third and third primary no

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.500 
secondary third and third primary no

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
problem colors of the show and then they

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.779 
problem colors of the show and then they
always<00:05:00.750> do<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.080> least<00:05:01.530> of<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:02.099> the<00:05:02.370> females
