through the top top through the bottom
so<00:00:33.899> here<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.500> separate<00:00:35.489> my<00:00:35.640> two<00:00:35.700> pieces<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:37.020> my

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
so here I separate my two pieces and my

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.580 
so here I separate my two pieces and my
little<00:00:38.010> hole<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:40.200> I'm<00:00:40.260> taking<00:00:40.410> my

little hole is here so I'm taking my

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.369 
little hole is here so I'm taking my
bottom<00:00:41.160> piece<00:00:41.540> pulling<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.660> right<00:00:43.079> through

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
bottom piece pulling it right through

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.220 
bottom piece pulling it right through
the<00:00:44.280> top<00:00:44.520> piece<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.719> my<00:00:45.809> top<00:00:45.989> piece<00:00:46.200> is

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the top piece and on my top piece is

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
the top piece and on my top piece is
done<00:00:46.590> I'm<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.489> move<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> next<00:00:48.090> one

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
done I'm going to move to the next one

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.189 
done I'm going to move to the next one
take<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> top<00:00:49.379> piece<00:00:50.300> through<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.570> hole<00:00:51.930> in

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
take the top piece through that hole in

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
take the top piece through that hole in
the<00:00:52.500> bottom<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.550> helps<00:00:53.879> move<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the bottom one and that helps move the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.830 
the bottom one and that helps move the
braid<00:00:54.809> forward<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:56.699> then<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.660> continue

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
braid forward and then you just continue

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.810 
braid forward and then you just continue
on<00:01:01.789> top<00:01:02.789> through<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.390> bottom<00:01:03.840> piece<00:01:04.820> hope

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
on top through that bottom piece hope

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.289 
on top through that bottom piece hope
I'm<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.060> blocking<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.570> my<00:01:06.750> big<00:01:06.990> hand

through<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.830> bottom<00:01:17.220> piece<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.820> when<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
through the bottom piece and when you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.060 
through the bottom piece and when you
get<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> corner<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.290> don't<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.740> you

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
get to the corner I don't know if you

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.760 
get to the corner I don't know if you
saw<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.549> first<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.390> had<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> little<00:01:22.350> notch

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
saw that first but I had a little notch

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.390 
saw that first but I had a little notch
cut<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.049> length<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.619> my<00:01:26.340> two

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
cut out here that the length of my two

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.300 
cut out here that the length of my two
pieces<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.450> don't<00:01:28.439> know<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.740> necessary

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
pieces I don't know if that's necessary

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.880 
pieces I don't know if that's necessary
but<00:01:29.610> that's<00:01:29.850> how<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> did<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.380> when<00:01:31.770> you're

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
but that's how I did it so when you're

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.260 
but that's how I did it so when you're
going<00:01:32.070> around<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> corner<00:01:32.729> same<00:01:32.970> thing

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
going around the corner same thing

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.380 
going around the corner same thing
bottom<00:01:33.780> piece<00:01:34.020> through<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.070> top<00:01:35.430> piece<00:01:36.680> and

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
bottom piece through that top piece and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.380 
bottom piece through that top piece and
then<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.840> top<00:01:40.350> piece<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:42.210> other

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
then just that top piece on the other

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.030 
then just that top piece on the other
side<00:01:43.340> up<00:01:44.390> through<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:46.049> bottom<00:01:46.530> piece<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
side up through that bottom piece and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
side up through that bottom piece and
then<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.520> continue<00:01:47.880> along<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:49.110> same

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
then you just continue along the same

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.980 
then you just continue along the same
path<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:52.880> what<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.390> when<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> finish

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
path and what I like to do when I finish

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.170 
path and what I like to do when I finish
a<00:01:55.020> side<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.590> go<00:01:55.770> back<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:55.979> smooth<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.640> out<00:01:56.759> but

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
a side is go back and smooth it out but

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.520 
a side is go back and smooth it out but
um<00:01:59.509> that's<00:02:00.509> my<00:02:00.630> own<00:02:00.750> preference<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.380> wait

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
um that's my own preference you can wait

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.410 
um that's my own preference you can wait
until<00:02:01.680> you're<00:02:01.920> done<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.729> good<00:02:02.939> thing<00:02:03.149> too

until you're done and the good thing too

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.950 
until you're done and the good thing too
is<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.439> make<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> mistake<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.960> really

is if you make a mistake it's really

agreement<00:02:31.780> with<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:33.250> other<00:02:33.400> bloggers<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:34.150> like

agreement with the other bloggers I like

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.210 
agreement with the other bloggers I like
the<00:02:35.170> shorter<00:02:37.140> tabs<00:02:38.140> some<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.680> mine<00:02:38.860> came<00:02:39.100> out

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
the shorter tabs some of mine came out

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.710 
the shorter tabs some of mine came out
longer<00:02:39.520> than<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.910> others<00:02:40.150> some<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.480> them<00:02:40.600> are

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
longer than the others some of them are

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.100 
longer than the others some of them are
shorter<00:02:41.110> for<00:02:41.980> example<00:02:42.600> here<00:02:43.600> are<00:02:43.750> some<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.020> the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
shorter for example here are some of the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.410 
shorter for example here are some of the
longer<00:02:44.560> ones<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:46.810> show<00:02:47.050> you<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:48.820> kind<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.120> hang

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
longer ones to show you to kind of hang

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.060 
longer ones to show you to kind of hang
over<00:02:49.750> like<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.860> first

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
over like this and this is the first

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.190 
over like this and this is the first
time<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.340> wouldn't<00:02:51.640> I've<00:02:51.790> done<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.480> um

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
time I wouldn't I've done this so um

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.440 
time I wouldn't I've done this so um
obviously<00:02:53.739> I'll<00:02:54.400> learn<00:02:54.640> for<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:54.940> future<00:02:55.090> but

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
obviously I'll learn for the future but

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.290 
obviously I'll learn for the future but
those<00:02:55.750> are<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.930> first<00:02:56.230> tabs<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.860> then<00:02:57.610> when

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
those are the first tabs and then when

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.699 
those are the first tabs and then when
you<00:02:58.420> come<00:02:58.600> over<00:02:58.630> this<00:02:59.020> way<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.700> lighting<00:03:01.360> is

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
you come over this way the lighting is

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.420 
you come over this way the lighting is
brilliant

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
brilliant

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.220 
brilliant
you<00:03:03.610> can<00:03:03.790> see<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.420> they're<00:03:04.989> a<00:03:05.020> bit

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
you can see that the they're a bit

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.050 
you can see that the they're a bit
shorter<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.400> just<00:03:06.580> think<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:06.790> looks<00:03:06.970> a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
shorter and I just think it looks a

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.240 
shorter and I just think it looks a
little<00:03:07.180> bit<00:03:07.420> neater<00:03:09.420> top<00:03:10.420> through<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.750> bottom

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
little bit neater top through the bottom

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.820 
little bit neater top through the bottom
bottom<00:03:12.250> through<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.700> top<00:03:13.530> top<00:03:14.530> through<00:03:14.770> the

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
bottom through the top top through the

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.220 
bottom through the top top through the
bottom<00:03:15.220> bottom<00:03:15.730> through<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:15.970> top<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.420> you'll

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
bottom bottom through the top and you'll

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.870 
bottom bottom through the top and you'll
eventually<00:03:17.440> make<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:18.160> all<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.400> way<00:03:18.640> around

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
eventually make it all the way around

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.530 
eventually make it all the way around
promise<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.810> can<00:03:20.500> do<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:21.220> can<00:03:21.250> do<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.540> good

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
promise I can do it you can do it good

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.900 
promise I can do it you can do it good
