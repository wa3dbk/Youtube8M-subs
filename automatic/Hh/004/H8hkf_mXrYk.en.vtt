00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.870
 Well, there is no problem shadow that is common to beginners who are beginners 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:13.240
 About having become 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:17.050
 I would like to talk about the solution . 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.830
 Kedomo I leave shadow It is by default while you are fiddling various 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:26.529
 Like that around two out that tinkering is Rutteyuu things not come out well there 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:30.880
 First of all, here 's the basic part Here you have selected the Rinpa sound from the render panel Render 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:33.230
 At the bottom of the panel there is aca called 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.780
 Write whether it is checked here chan and Shadows 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.070
 Please turn this shadows off and the shadows will disappear 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.840
 I heard shadow is no longer out 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.140
 The shadows will come out if you uncheck the shadows 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.140
 That's right 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:56.350
 This is also a very basic cousin, but next is light 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:01.900
 Have to be able to set the internal medicine dropped or drop the I actually shadow is also in the illumination 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:05.300
 After selecting the lamp and selecting this object data, here 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:11.180
 0 Driveway and delivery vehicles 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:15.710
 When the Yoneda-cho is not a shadow It is a matter of course it is and they've touched by mistake delivered road lit 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:20.390
 Because it is a delivery road, it means that it does not take literally , so it will be this way 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.200
 So this is set to wind called Calculate of roadway in the ray shadow ray tracing 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.870
 Place and will continue to back the shadow in such Fu 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.450
 Well there is still 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:36.900
 8 Actually, it is this Yuka that is receiving this shadow, but the material setting of this floor is also 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:41.590
 Is that Decide is part is that you say Toka do not receive Toka receive the shadow It is there in 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:47.020
 It's here that you won't receive shadows if you touch it by mistake 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.969
 This is the floor material settings panel It's the evening material panel It's a material 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.149
 When I come down the panel all the time 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:57.100
 It is said that the road is normally checked on the reception 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:59.710
 If this is unchecked, I'll set it up again and I 'm going to register at home 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.370
 If you say 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.360
 There will be no shadow 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:10.350
 5 is it means that the floor becomes the setting that is not subject to shadow 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.340
 Please make sure that this is properly checked on your heart receive 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.580
 Shadow There is one more in takes 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.260
 The object of the side that casts this shadow 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.900
 Though it is problem of object of drop side 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.410
 It is drop this shadow to this cube 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.610
 Again here it is a place of material 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:37.170
 This time, it is an option even if it is not a roadway reception 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:42.490
 I'm there is a word Tteyuu tray disabled in the Tteyuu this tray Sable is 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:47.830
 There is related to the fact that it does not enable the trace of the so-called shadow of the play Western 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:53.630
 If you remove the check , this cube will not cast shadows 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:55.880
 Let's do it . It won't drop shadows, so if you check the Sable 8 example 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.250
 By saying 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:04.390
 It is a total of four that this will return and shadow will come back 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:10.960
 In the Render panel, check if Shadows is checked on the road . 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:14.350
 First of all, then whether or not this lighting is a setting light that casts shadows 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.440
 It is necessary to check if it is a light to make 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.240
 Gomez then gomez, this is the floor where this is the floor store 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.290
 Materia where this same Mati is 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.489
 Because there is 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.040
 You can tell if the se part has a check properly 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:34.840
 Is set to receive shadows 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:40.330
 And towards the object to drop the object shadows cast a shadow now 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.019
 In the setting of the option, is it a setting like that that cools down properly ? 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.370
 please ~ 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:47.030
 Here is a confirmation 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:52.610
 Before I got used to it, I wonder what it was like to have done this and what about this? 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.690
 I 'm doing some setups and I 'm out there and I 'm unchecked here and there 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.250
 It will be done 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.280
 It may become the setting that does not appear to buy in less that consciousness 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.390
 If there are no shadows, there are more than 4 places 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.390
 Please check
