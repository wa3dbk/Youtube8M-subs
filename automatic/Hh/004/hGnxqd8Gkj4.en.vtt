00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello dear tankers I want you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.970
 tell about the most interesting German pt 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.290
 level five pieces 3 and give let's 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.950
 we first highlight its merits and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.139
 limitations 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.660
 of the merits I can tell you that 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.000
 this is the maximum speaker speed at 8 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.690
 spins well and you can't 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.570
 whirl and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.730
 unless the sea attacked then from 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.859
 the merits just on and the most accurate gun 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.949
 at its level scatter 033 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.650
 it comes down very quickly only 17 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.600
 seconds 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.500
 breaking through 150 is also possible as a virtue 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.020
 note the damage is so average 135 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.410
 armor she even has 80 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.110
 millimeters in the forehead here in these plates 80 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.039
 here here is only 50 and sew or 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.890
 all and sundry and durability 350 units 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.379
 principle, the average is the same as that of su-85 and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.590
 there we have 30 faces a little behind her 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.230
 320 minus the tank is of course his 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.719
 review just some 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.810
 310 meters and communication range 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.479
 radio station top 415 meters and 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.310
 of course the disadvantage is simply overriding 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.960
 which i like these car then 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.240
 that the engine is right here and me 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.650
 constantly criticizes 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.630
 well and let's go to the battle itself here I 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.850
 on karting club that is basically a keer 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:30.320
 by nastrerivat here you can just gorgeous 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.380
 and now i want to do something 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.150
 go to standard position pt 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.920
 that is, the pebbles now I give it to you 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.470
 fast forward 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.340
 I'm going and take a standard position on 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.340
 pebbles 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.210
 and the accuracy of the guns allows just on 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.930
 super long range shoot and 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.320
 get here please cruz order i 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.090
 I shoot him 143 another rate of fire 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.909
 Of course, the main plus is briefly 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.119
 rate of fire just 4 seconds 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.119
 recharging is so just gorgeous here 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.459
 crossover that trying to leave my she 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.450
 don't hide my exact guns please 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.769
 just projectile after projectile seated well and 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.660
 here I need a question just get and 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.910
 I'm starting to get it here that was mine 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.739
 the mistake is that I rolled out and me 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:34.120
 right there we shoved looking at type t-34 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:37.040
 someone else shoves me and here I am 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.260
 on lt I'm starting to get distracted so he is there 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.010
 highlight poor kv-1 disassemble 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.349
 little by little 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.349
 and here poltos 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.370
 I don't get distracted more precisely, I don't get into it 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.599
 so he rolls on well and here already 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.420
 admit exactly but i'm just an example here 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:02.379
 where did the projectile go I am right on the roof 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.480
 hit the projectile my grandfather okay dick with him 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.230
 fifty dollars 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.010
 we quietly capture the base here there 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.920
 m5 stuart 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:17.220
 t49 and poltos principle, enemies are not very 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.220
 dangerous but here t49 itself is dangerous 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.420
 I spy on them and not 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.310
 not particularly the greyhound did not protrude into 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.310
 this country brand erased I kill him 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:32.110
 actually here's a bucket 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.450
 flashes and the gun just quickly 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.750
 excellent accuracy is reduced we just 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.239
 I waved and started to shoot me a shell 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.579
 behind the projectile and notice all the projectile 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:47.579
 hits the target as not formed 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.579
 funnels whether chon out of the dead end market 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:58.200
 just watching and plowing edic 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:00.740
 and I look now and I am fifty 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.740
 big 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.870
 here look further you there can be there 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:12.379
 it seems to have remained until 49 but then I 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.680
 notice and that she was killed that day on i 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.419
 you start to defend the base 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.210
 because now everything is warming her 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:26.060
 go and vodka in 1 1 immediately hit 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.180
 142 they threw the cap to write it yourself 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.380
 gets for three or four grandson make 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.509
 lucky ticket for three or four here 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:38.000
 well done suck up enemies he has 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.500
 is 85 I'm starting just wild 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.310
 rate of fire they don't even have time 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:49.160
 roll to the base and please here i don't 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.380
 I understand of course to do the ball to 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.340
 there probably did but visible such 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.060
 event is not made 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.370
 at-2 sajin goose did not think that not 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.410
 Kit has cobbled together and let 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.470
 The second projectile is not easy to understand where 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:11.360
 leaves 30 thursday appears i leave 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:13.039
 I miss it sometimes and set it on fire 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.690
 quietly there is lit or please 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:18.010
 the quickest summary i immediately seek 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:22.280
 there are four now 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.280
 capture spit our lives will be shot down what what 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.759
 to tell 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.590
 happens through a long time to show it two 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:36.199
 first missile I miss 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:40.120
 it is not clear where the second and ricochet but 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.120
 met rows of brushes and baby.ru 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.930
 flashes in the bucket she also wants 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.430
 capture does not roll here you see 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.710
 how do we ask ourselves su-100 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.710
 there is nothing more especially interesting 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.990
 will be but anyway I'll show you not 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:01.150
 until the end now from you need to wind up a little 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.070
 We then stood and watched if they go 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.240
 again here is such a type t-34 decided 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:11.110
 I go to attack I agryz 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.910
 miss here he misses or 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.320
 remain bristles there unit of strength 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.950
 miss again 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.190
 This of course still bought on hard we 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.130
 su-100 chasing him 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:27.700
 Of course artayyu why they were engaged in 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.540
 this time here it is on us at all comet 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.630
 did not react 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.760
 t-34 punches standard tires 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:38.440
 8 items works he hit neither 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:41.410
 more in a mask that's it 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.300
 this is not a failure, I am still going to m51 tobacco all 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.780
 disassemble and what I would like cattle 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.050
 in the middle 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:50.770
 that is, the machine fan that is cons 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.360
 In general, very few advantages are one if minus 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.390
 java is so said this review is not whether 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.160
 I will leave the court to you 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.110
 in the hangar 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.570
 because it's just a fomin machine 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.470
 and how there fellow rapper understood 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:07.030
 fan case and here are 3 i think i 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.580
 put the stereo at least some plus 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:13.180
 to the review comes down machine quickly to from 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.370
 an hour first, I would shake disguise all 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.800
 light bulb commander 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:20.169
 second there is of course cleanliness and order 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.890
 the car burns very often engine plate 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:25.840
 and this perk will also be needed 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.880
 virtuoso would also put well just 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.310
 the rest of your choice is goodbye 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.580
 with you was maxim ok nice groups 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.580
 tanks
