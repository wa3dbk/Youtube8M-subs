it's<00:02:12.340> it's<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.610> little<00:02:12.730> convoluted<00:02:13.120> but<00:02:13.570> no

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
it's it's a little convoluted but no

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.940 
it's it's a little convoluted but no

Bond<00:02:15.160> plot<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:16.390> problem<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.080> plot

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
Bond plot the problem is that the plot

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.720 
Bond plot the problem is that the plot
of<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.440> movie<00:02:17.590> doesn't<00:02:18.100> really<00:02:18.460> translate

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
of the movie doesn't really translate

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.370 
of the movie doesn't really translate
well<00:02:19.090> necessarily<00:02:19.569> into<00:02:19.780> an<00:02:19.870> action<00:02:20.200> game

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
well necessarily into an action game

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.559 
well necessarily into an action game
it's<00:02:20.560> kind<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.890> slow-moving<00:02:21.430> kind<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.150> nifty

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
it's kind of a slow-moving kind of nifty

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.390 
it's kind of a slow-moving kind of nifty
little<00:02:22.990> film<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.740> know<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.920> lot<00:02:24.100> of<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.250> lot<00:02:24.370> of

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
little film you know a lot of a lot of

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.090 
little film you know a lot of a lot of
clever<00:02:24.790> dialogue<00:02:25.030> stuff<00:02:25.569> like<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:25.960> so<00:02:26.890> for

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
clever dialogue stuff like that so for

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.550 
clever dialogue stuff like that so for
the<00:02:27.220> game<00:02:27.430> they<00:02:27.670> kind<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.090> hacked<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:29.050> these

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
the game they kind of hacked in these

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.150 
the game they kind of hacked in these
like<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:30.040> lot<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.520> just<00:02:30.730> sort<00:02:30.910> of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
like a lot of just sort of

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.950 
like a lot of just sort of
elongated<00:02:31.610> action<00:02:32.060> sequences<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.720> aren't

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
elongated action sequences that aren't

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.540 
elongated action sequences that aren't
really<00:02:33.080> in<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.740> movie<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.250> fact<00:02:34.430> have

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
really in the movie and in fact have

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.490 
really in the movie and in fact have
rewritten<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.270> lot<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.600> portions<00:02:35.990> of<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.200> movie

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
rewritten a lot of portions of the movie

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.400 
rewritten a lot of portions of the movie
that<00:02:36.770> don't<00:02:37.670> necessarily<00:02:38.120> fit<00:02:38.690> together

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
that don't necessarily fit together

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.440 
that don't necessarily fit together
quite<00:02:39.740> as<00:02:39.980> well

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
quite as well

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.150 
quite as well
it's<00:02:41.450> weird<00:02:41.690> where<00:02:41.990> they<00:02:42.110> cut<00:02:42.350> stuff<00:02:42.620> out<00:02:42.860> and

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
it's weird where they cut stuff out and

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.730 
it's weird where they cut stuff out and
weird<00:02:43.550> where<00:02:43.730> they<00:02:43.820> kept<00:02:44.030> stuff<00:02:44.300> in<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:44.990> you

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
weird where they kept stuff in so you

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.470 
weird where they kept stuff in so you
know<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.400> feels<00:02:46.580> like<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.760> weird<00:02:47.030> balance

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
know this it feels like a weird balance

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.790 
know this it feels like a weird balance
and<00:02:47.600> if<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.690> are<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.930> fan<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.350> movie<00:02:48.650> you

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
and if you are a fan of the movie you

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.710 
and if you are a fan of the movie you
might<00:02:48.980> not<00:02:49.220> like<00:02:49.580> what<00:02:50.000> they<00:02:50.180> did<00:02:50.240> with<00:02:50.600> it

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
might not like what they did with it

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.020 
might not like what they did with it
necessarily<00:02:51.400> from<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.460> gameplay<00:02:52.790> standpoint

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
necessarily from a gameplay standpoint

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.760 
necessarily from a gameplay standpoint
this<00:02:53.390> is<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.570> lot<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:53.960> everything<00:02:54.380> or<00:02:54.500> nothing

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
this is a lot like everything or nothing

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
basically the same you just kind of auto

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.940 
basically the same you just kind of auto
