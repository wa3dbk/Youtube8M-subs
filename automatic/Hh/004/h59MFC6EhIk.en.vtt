00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.100
 ah bah there for a neighboring village one of 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.300
 these predators these refugees in a shelter 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.300
 booked livestock 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.970
 suddenly he burst out panicked 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.330
 villagers flees but they are not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.220
 quite fast 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.850
 the leopard rushes on a man who 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.660
 jump over a wall he rushes 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.660
 all claws out 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.400
 luckily he misses his target and we 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.870
 can not blame the villagers 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.180
 to be afraid and to defend yourself 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.220
 they are scared and they do not want 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.480
 that the neo by the attacks but he 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.600
 would have been better if they had him 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.230
 leave the field free for seeking to 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.690
 escape 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.059
 the beast rushes to the edge of the 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.410
 roof but they end up again 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.410
 face to face with a crowd 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.760
 the outcome of this clash does not 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.610
 no doubt 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.260
 leopard behavior show 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.670
 that they're just looking for a way to 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.840
 escape are then between two houses 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.460
 but a man stands at the end of 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.540
 the driveway and block the only exit 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.500
 accessible 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.939
 the ground and bar snapo was 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.040
 found in a strange environment 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.750
 scary it's typically the kind of 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.189
 situation where a wild animal is 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.189
 likely to attack a man 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.100
 happily instead of attacking the feline 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.100
 find another loophole 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.550
 an empty house on the other end 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.790
 of the year they run to start 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.980
 shelter 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.500
 to see him curl up like this and 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.030
 watch the crowd howling gold it is 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.230
 obvious that this predator is also 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.230
 scared that the villagers 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.310
 finally everyone is healthy 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.190
 and except the leopard is captured and handed 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.650
 at liberty in nature 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.090
 but if it comes back we have to hope that 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.570
 this time the villagers will stay in 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.570
 shelter at home
