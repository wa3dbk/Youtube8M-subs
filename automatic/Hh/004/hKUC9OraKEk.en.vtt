00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
 Beyond five solar masses so very big stars that will be so 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.430
 "So a star, our sun with a solar mass becomes essential 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.849
 unspectacular strengthen that means then influence on the immediate 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.200
 Enviroment so Novartis on the small but also lives much longer and because he 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.719
 this star lives much longer 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.740
 I did not expect anybody much further from his place of origin 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.460
 to have 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.880
 I already told the big stars why life stays short in the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.109
 Near her birth 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.759
 their birthplace while the one star that lives much longer 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.369
 Of course, to move much further from their birthplace 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.829
 so that one finds no connection at all between the 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:32.890
 little star 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.330
 like our sun and the big star 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.520
 ver di and the birthplaces of the city 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.499
 in the way, we actually only know something about it today 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:41.250
 like these 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.450
 Roses stars 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.330
 arise 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.530
 because they change their environment just as incredibly 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.770
 through her life 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.390
 are called the signs of life through their signs of life 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.530
 very much radiation they rain the gas to light up thereby become this 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.000
 Star formation area of ​​wonderful colors visible 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.870
 SID so disturb these gas clouds again by the supernova explosions 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.590
 and all the little stars that have come to be desired are very very 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.680
 a lot of UN apparently 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.460
 but they do in large part 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.060
 solid masses from which one can also see 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.280
 Gas clouds in such 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.119
 in such 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.159
 why such a way again Orion 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.720
 There is a great deal in our Milky Way 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.050
 Overall, one has to say our Milky Way excrete Galaxy year 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.650
 his slices a big slice in the middle of the cross the varnish tables 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.380
 Central area in Brno the gas clouds are only in the disk 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.719
 total of the total mass because the roads is only a tiny part of it 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.189
 still in such gas clouds 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.050
 The Milky Way has developed around ten or so ago 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.360
 eleven billion years ago and in between time she has 80 percent Irek gasmask in 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.580
 Star implemented 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.020
 and today are only 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.420
 between 10 and 20 percent of their total luminous mass 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.000
 in gas clouds 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.660
 and these gas clouds No possess indeed the greatest mass in part of the 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.899
 interstellar medium 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.240
 compressed in areas the agreement of duty year are large 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.909
 and between these gas clouds, the hot interest is Lara Medium 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.539
 that it has temperatures between 10 thousand degrees and a million degrees 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.559
 and that is way too hot and collapsing 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:11.950
 These gas were spoken by me the whole time 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.559
 Evening temperatures are in the range of minus 100 degrees Celsius and lower 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:20.509
 In order for the star to exist, the third star ever to emerge must be the 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:24.329
 Gas cloud from which it has formed much colder yet it must be 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.349
 between - one hundred and fifty in minus 200 degrees Celsius 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.839
 with it the gas 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.119
 The crew does not see any movement energy at all 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.829
 Oppose gravity 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.459
 and there's something going on in Zug 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.439
 These stars should make the gas clouds not just a giant big pile 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.749
 but they are almost always created in multiple systems 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.849
 multiple system means the stars almost never arise alone so it becomes 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.349
 always arise several stars at the same time in a very narrow 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.149
 Surroundings 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.249
 And so you know today that most stars are twin cities 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.609
 that is, there are or multiple systems that is two or three stars 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.059
 Circle around each other 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.700
 and you can imagine 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.349
 that, of course, in such a system that hardly gives a possibility percent that 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.069
 Because all the remnants of a nebula can be created anywhere, planet 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.060
 it can arise 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.450
 would fall on one of the two stars and there would be no 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.659
 Solar system as we imagine 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.829
 so you have to say that for most 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.559
 Stars in the Milky Way 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:20.230
 that hardly gives a possibility 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.170
 to make such systems as the solar system and that's something we do 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.769
 today 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.129
 really learned 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.650
 to discontinue such as our sun is a special feature 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.480
 and possibly also a peculiarity what you their planets 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.480
 As for 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:13.609
 Why
