house I'm not quite done with the

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.250 
house I'm not quite done with the
aquascaping<00:00:24.880> I<00:00:25.150> got<00:00:25.360> a<00:00:25.390> few<00:00:25.689> little<00:00:25.869> spots

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
aquascaping I got a few little spots

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.080 
aquascaping I got a few little spots
that<00:00:26.590> I'm<00:00:26.740> going<00:00:26.920> to<00:00:27.010> figure<00:00:27.730> out<00:00:27.849> what<00:00:27.970> I'm

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
that I'm going to figure out what I'm

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.760 
that I'm going to figure out what I'm
going<00:00:28.240> to<00:00:28.300> do<00:00:28.540> with<00:00:28.810> in<00:00:29.140> these<00:00:29.350> two<00:00:29.740> areas

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
going to do with in these two areas

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.549 
going to do with in these two areas
right<00:00:30.490> here<00:00:30.789> but<00:00:31.449> overall<00:00:31.720> I<00:00:31.869> think<00:00:32.110> it<00:00:32.379> turned

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
right here but overall I think it turned

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.890 
right here but overall I think it turned
out<00:00:32.680> really<00:00:32.949> well

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
out really well

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.760 
out really well
everything<00:00:36.210> recovered<00:00:37.210> just<00:00:37.510> fine<00:00:37.660> no<00:00:38.470> losses

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
everything recovered just fine no losses

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.210 
everything recovered just fine no losses
on<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.309> fish<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:41.050> I'm<00:00:41.140> super<00:00:41.500> stoked<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:41.949> that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
on the fish so I'm super stoked on that

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.740 
on the fish so I'm super stoked on that
I<00:00:43.320> think<00:00:44.320> I<00:00:44.530> really<00:00:44.559> like<00:00:45.090> how<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.149> tank<00:00:46.450> set

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
I think I really like how the tank set

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.440 
I think I really like how the tank set
up<00:00:46.930> now<00:00:47.140> I<00:00:47.579> hid<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.730> sump<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:52.000> schemer

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
up now I hid the sump and the schemer

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.410 
up now I hid the sump and the schemer
and<00:00:52.480> top<00:00:53.320> off<00:00:53.559> container<00:00:54.010> up<00:00:54.250> there<00:00:54.579> so<00:00:55.210> it's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
and top off container up there so it's

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.260 
and top off container up there so it's
not<00:00:55.570> that<00:00:55.840> bad

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
not that bad
