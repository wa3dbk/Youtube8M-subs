 viator and 5 the aviator 15 booster dragon 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.190
 exalted but with the viator yeah that's 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.760
 crazy it's still angry it's simple 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.160
 this is one that ends this terrain that 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.410
 the boosters really beats that dale t 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.690
 with the pick 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.420
 I want to say quite a lot 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.750
 so too - there I bought them on 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.160
 released the price 45 euros in 47 happy 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.330
 that ipad not so it's 3 euros to 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.489
 pretty much the booster so here's what huh 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.720
 and it's true it's gonna be bought there is not so 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.730
 for a long time that I feel of a video 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.930
 an obscure explorer boosters 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.910
 so we were 14 years old confess down I did 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.800
 a special video and where I opened it 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.450
 12 I will not put the video online 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.940
 because unfortunately he was 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.540
 rigged I'm doing a special video for 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.599
 it's just 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.049
 this black desire besides who are rigging 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.170
 their boosters and so I hope 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.030
 that these boosters there are not faked 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.200
 I honestly do not know and I had 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.090
 really need to buy some tastes 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.500
 simple galt is that it was one 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.239
 of the most beautiful series he lacked 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.519
 black and white the eye after after this 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.950
 series there he would have just black and 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.500
 white based emerging power has jetty 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.269
 and then I'll have everything started at 60 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.069
 60% so we'll say so well I'm watching 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.639
 if you're just games show you 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:13.049
 behind the ring is so I hope 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:15.760
 that they are not faked I do not know 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.650
 finally there frankly if his stuff and 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.570
 I will stop lost and boosters 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.579
 like that and I will buy that sub 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.979
 blister or official store kind 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:29.860
 ultra g or others so that's so 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.889
 exalted dragon one of the most beautiful 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.380
 Celine banks exist frankly nothing 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:39.250
 to say that's why I bought it 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.740
 so here I'm trying to see just the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.849
 boost his stuff and because I have 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.260
 always told how there people 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:48.250
 was frankly not everything is good 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.479
 sealed but the other TVs 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.479
 obscure explorers it was the same 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.820
 not expect I 'm just going to compare 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.099
 with boosters that I myself 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.620
 purchased at the journey is the boosters 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.000
 down there like calls from legends 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.909
 just compare a book store to see 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.620
 because frankly he has plenty we know 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:10.060
 to know everything is not frankly 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:16.210
 frankly it's horrible to do it 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:20.199
 end I do not know if it's crazy anyway 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.280
 time when we look bomba way I 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.960
 I'm not going to dwell on that because 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.530
 the video lasted too long for 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.870
 it is interesting 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:32.530
 yeah so here too I 'm doing this 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.810
 little parcel receipt video on Monday 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.960
 or next Tuesday comes the video of 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.470
 two frontier boosters one can 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.330
 hoping that I have a nice pick 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.520
 so here I hope that this little 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.190
 opening of parcels will have pleased you 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.800
 tell your opinion about these boosters 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.690
 if you like the show if it makes you 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.590
 weird we do not see 15 the aviator and 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.479
 not the other illustrations 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.039
 good I can not tell you the crates 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.880
 and the others because I do not know 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:05.229
 I do not know So here say here 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:09.250
