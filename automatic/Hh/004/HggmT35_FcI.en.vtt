se um how do I say it the joints and the
arms<00:01:50.250> are<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.640> bit<00:01:51.030> bigger<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.840> the

arms are a little bit bigger on the

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.120 
arms are a little bit bigger on the
gundam<00:01:53.790> wing<00:01:54.110> releases<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.920> little

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
gundam wing releases and a little

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.880 
gundam wing releases and a little
smaller<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.850> endless<00:01:57.450> waltz<00:01:57.890> releases

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
smaller on the endless waltz releases

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.499 
smaller on the endless waltz releases
but<00:01:59.100> there's<00:01:59.280> still<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.640> same<00:01:59.880> skills<00:02:00.240> that

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
but there's still the same skills that

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.319 
but there's still the same skills that
make<00:02:00.630> sense<00:02:01.399> as<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:03.270> huge<00:02:03.960> huge<00:02:04.530> blades<00:02:05.329> and

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
make sense as this huge huge blades and

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.930 
make sense as this huge huge blades and
those<00:02:06.509> are<00:02:06.869> storable<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.729> they<00:02:08.879> were

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
those are storable just like they were

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.729 
those are storable just like they were
on<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> original<00:02:09.869> version<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.470> figure

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
on the original version of the figure

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.040 
on the original version of the figure
the<00:02:11.550> handles

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
the handles

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
the handles
look<00:02:13.440> down<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:19.050> just<00:02:19.260> plugs<00:02:19.560> into<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
look down and it just plugs into the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.310 
look down and it just plugs into the
back<00:02:20.190> right<00:02:20.670> there<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:23.040> go<00:02:24.020> all<00:02:25.020> around

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
back right there that can go all around

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:38.110 
back right there that can go all around
it<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:25.890> leave

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.590 

actually<00:02:39.120> might<00:02:39.300> be<00:02:39.330> doing<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.990> backwards<00:02:41.600> you

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
actually might be doing it backwards you

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.760 
actually might be doing it backwards you
know<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.750> looks<00:02:42.780> like<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.230> am<00:02:43.350> doing<00:02:43.440> it

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
know it looks like I am doing it

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.880 
know it looks like I am doing it
backwards<00:02:47.060> okay<00:02:48.170> because<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.290> fits<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.680> right

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
backwards okay because it fits in right

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.340 
backwards okay because it fits in right
there<00:02:50.220> better<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.420> way<00:02:54.050> first<00:02:55.050> I've<00:02:55.170> never

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
there better that way first I've never

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.740 
there better that way first I've never
seen<00:02:55.590> them<00:02:55.710> like<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.540> put<00:02:57.690> it

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
seen them like this and you can put it

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.920 
seen them like this and you can put it
in<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.930> site<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:59.130> blades<00:02:59.400> either<00:02:59.730> way<00:02:59.970> to

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
in the site the the blades either way to

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.350 
in the site the the blades either way to
kind<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.170> fit<00:03:01.380> better<00:03:01.590> into<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.460> body<00:03:02.670> part

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
kind of fit better into the body part

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
kind of fit better into the body part
this<00:03:03.990> way<00:03:04.230> as<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.680> can<00:03:04.860> see<00:03:05.100> but<00:03:06.090> um<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:07.230> could

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
this way as you can see but um you could

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.250 
this way as you can see but um you could
do<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.650> either<00:03:07.800> way<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.480> like<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.720> downwards

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
do it either way I like the downwards

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.490 
do it either way I like the downwards
way<00:03:10.820> instead<00:03:12.680> that's<00:03:13.680> how<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:13.890> prefer<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.400> do<00:03:14.670> it

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
and the shoulders I found it best to

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.410

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
just dozens you could manage but it's

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.920 
just dozens you could manage but it's

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
kind of hard in fact this might be the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.410 
kind of hard in fact this might be the
way<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.110> do<00:04:10.470> it

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
custom with its Kate very very cool this

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.879 
custom with its Kate very very cool this
is<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.120> very<00:04:28.150> nice<00:04:28.450> figure<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:29.440> Cape<00:04:29.710> was

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
is a very nice figure the Cape was

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.890 
is a very nice figure the Cape was
especially<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.520> nice<00:04:30.760> detail<00:04:31.300> it's<00:04:31.690> kind<00:04:31.810> of

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
especially a nice detail it's kind of

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.690 
especially a nice detail it's kind of
surprising<00:04:32.050> that<00:04:32.620> they<00:04:32.770> made<00:04:32.980> it<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.340> mean

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
surprising that they made it I mean

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.640 
surprising that they made it I mean
because<00:04:34.600> sometimes<00:04:34.810> they<00:04:35.260> leave<00:04:35.470> out

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
because sometimes they leave out

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.040 
because sometimes they leave out
accessories<00:04:36.460> they're<00:04:36.850> kind<00:04:37.360> of<00:04:37.419> extra<00:04:37.870> you

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
accessories they're kind of extra you

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.330 
accessories they're kind of extra you

only see him with the Cape for a little

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.970

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
while so it's pretty sweet that he had

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.560 
while so it's pretty sweet that he had
it<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:43.110> just<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.230> nice<00:04:44.470> figure<00:04:44.860> overall<00:04:45.610> so<00:04:46.479> if
