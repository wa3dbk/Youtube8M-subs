 I was informed that we were already in normandie already producer for a year 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.320
 On two 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.740
 of the Norman breed, we continued to valorise it through m 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.910
 the creation of the sector 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.080
 already it's a tender meat one because it makes state debts 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.030
 lifting them on the pastures 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.160
 at least six months the program read in his period 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.400
 the middle 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.940
 we release a 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.940
 a certain tenderness one thing is certain 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.790
 flexibility at the town hall 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.960

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.620
 February 22 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.930
 it's not a meeting 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.400
 natural leterme after naturally said 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.660
 that him that period that we will aim 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.910
 April 15 to November 15 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.620
 it's only for 100 m meadow men complement to enter into 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.270
 autumn from September 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.300
 with a corn supplement 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.290
 obvious to beat arras ask let's go back to the isere and finally to 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.870
 their blood periods with mention a complete tomorrow and nice over 30 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.870
 points 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.940
 except rapeseed all foods are produced they are to be made 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.610
 it's important and because the staple diet produced on the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.310
 farm the breeder is able to say exactly what he put to culture this 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.900
 who made him return to his cultures 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.900
 to then give to his friends 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.390
 christophe allard 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.169
 the consumer only his club on his plate 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.849
 in the canton is able to unite 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.810
 it is under study it exceeds what the producer is able to say everything 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.249
 what the animal may have suffered in his life 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.619
 it's still important it's still reassuring compared to everything 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:29.619
 happens when constantly 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.969
 it's not hard to believe it's something you can do 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.759
 it's part of my job as a guide it was not only the best of all 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:38.129
 days
