00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.919
 short tutorial and how to do that 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.599
 I build invisible walls 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.219
 now just a little example 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 wall here we take such a three times 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.279
 Three wall we can do there for each block 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.140
 next to that you want to lie everyone 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:27.150
 so and now we continue here 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.250
 and that all works now 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.520
 as we imagine it because if you 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.040
 here the beats but then the people 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.940
 easy 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.510
 Now we have to do a little trick 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.890
 Apply that to the ladders from the back 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.379
 you can see it here too 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.550
 how it looks from the other side 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:53.120
 so from that side here later that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.350
 you just see the ladder yes we do 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.859
 We have to manage the ladders 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.570
 can watch from behind without that 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.879
 a blog in between is because then 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.220
 By the way, she always goes with glass 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.549
 Do not keep ladders like you do 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.770
 surely not that easy 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.810
 this baking mold will be mine 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.259
 now the wall marked with world 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.970
 that's what you need for editing 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.619
 not really obligatory but if you are 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.840
 larger areas, it is recommended 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.460
 but of course what he really needs 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.180
 is essentials and must be done now 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:32.189
 enter 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:36.979
 / stop was so everything is stopped 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.960
 what groups of items or what 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.040
 Coming blogs or printing plates 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.570
 that will be stopped 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.000
 also very practical if you are very many 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.190
 are items bull has then the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.229
 namely, all disappearing have now 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.820
 we marked the wall and I do that 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.729
 with wild sz 0 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.550
 now you see invisible blocks here 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.110
 we can not get away from another 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.350
 side , it looks like a ladder 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.209
 you can also use them but from 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:15.480
 this page here not yes and then how 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.959
 to allow the double of items 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.080
 o even goes that jobs has died 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.070
 then disappears yes to the did then 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.489
 to allow again 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:31.530
 do her / skopnik - approx 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.940
 and then the whole thing goes again but the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.400
 wall life stand 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.380
 the whole thing then goes on to describe 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:54.900
 what the seal so that cut off now 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:03:00.000
 do not persuade shield stop lay 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.610
 the block off and stop - c and the shield 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.959
 hang here in the air without that 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.860
 behind it a blog is all that can 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.049
 then you just remove it again 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.019
 which the then tee is nothing more 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.879
 left over by the ladders here is this 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.040
 if the stop was c you entered 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.620
 then also the case that all then 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.109
 I can jump you all week 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.579
 show with stop lag there will be just 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.239
 these ladders disappear with stop - c 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.790
 the whole wall disappears 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.049
 so watch out if you break something down now 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.470
 I would not be here right now 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:41.180
 want to beat a leader because 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.180
 otherwise everything is destroyed here 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:49.080
 then what from this tutorial to the 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.080
 next time
