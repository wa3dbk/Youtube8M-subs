00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.910
 Hi, I wanted to make this video 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.070
 that a little different from the others 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.600
 1 because I didn't prepare the other two 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.969
 because I've seen things around 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.690
 it calls better to clarify the title like 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.970
 you saw how they suck you but not 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.339
 it's because I say absolutely not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.080
 you see it is because it is a phrase that is 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.349
 he hears when talking about comics 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.450
 Italians did this Italy not 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.040
 i want to shoot shit it's about people ie 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.840
 it's not that I'm saying if you improved 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.330
 what is a jerk 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.180
 it seems right to clarify things 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:46.680
 that is, it is not I am the supreme 15 and indicates 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.900
 puccini she probably even less than 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.860
 you are never closed because I had this 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.710
 video because something is there anyway 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.320
 because it was one lives a firm of 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.250
 years are underestimated in my opinion 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.310
 not the world on facebook on youtube 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.110
 exaggeratedly there was she cannot 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.509
 underestimate many people you are 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:13.080
 speaking and referring to you reading 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:19.140
 they are manga Italian comics do 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.530
 disgust this Italian has noticed e 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.040
 Italian comics are a heritage 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.740
 Then there is the enviable world 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.770
 I don't believe it at all 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.140

 after the young Italian mouse 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.600
 so then as you've read that I 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.200
 that is if it influences me Italian 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.280
 rightly 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.469

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.160
 third type dog over the years because 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.890
 rightly he being a master of the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.049

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.870
 of all 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.849
 this is also what the Italians did 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.700

 voted with the various Japanese cartoons 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.430

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.219

 first necklace botto is a comic book 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.380
 Italian and I'm blessed a masterpiece 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:39.039
 to show her that they raped him

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.130
 but now that the moral is there 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:01.250
 moral 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.050
 it doesn't matter whether you are a rattle or a 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.699
 peacock 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:15.110
 the important thing is that if he dies less than 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:17.240
