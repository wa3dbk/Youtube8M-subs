00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.740
 being a friend of youtube without jdk esp 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.689
 excuse the hour for inactivity 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.480
 that is in the channel but hey this is not 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.180
 I have had time 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.590
 to take videos all the time that 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.830
 I have, I 'm investing it in the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.750
 campaign is worth good this is not here I'm not going to 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.480
 show what the map is because good 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.059
 here the tracks go down a lot and I tried 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.949
 record from my laptop and on the laptop 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.170
 how do you have windows 8 I do not know what it is 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.600
 was configured on the card 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.910
 video the truth I do not know but it looks very 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.250
 dark the map indeed looks pretty 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.860
 dark though I'm going super wonder 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.930
 on that computer but it's going dark and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.750
 they are going to tell me no manches is the map 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.199
 see the disgust no no no no case in 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.180
 this kind of aspects I do not and I do not 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.030
 I wanted to climb the killed because it looks super 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.240
 dark mega does not have a house although if 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.270
 can appreciate when it happens in 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.829
 in light the things in haiti of the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.810
 They really look great and it's not because I 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.490
 I have done it but the truth is 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.950
 right now I'm working hard on 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.210
 this project so that we can 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.640
 get to what is the objective a mod 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.080
 that jlo 4 although it does not look like that but 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.060
 more or less there we go 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.520
 but hey this is the message 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.340
 not informative and who has not wanted not 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.250
 the map is uploaded because Maria 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.620
 mediafire does not let me just upload it 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.690
 since it reaches 70 percent me the 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.270
 the boot or I get connection error 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.250
 Czech and my connection is good is the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.980
 butt is three megas that good of me 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.690
 connection are 3 megabytes and is the top and 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.310
 it does not have to because the truth I do not understand 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.000
 what happens there but good 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.979
 another thing is that good in the video 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 previous we did not reach the goal of the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.840
 downloads of the map but well they are 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.849
 so I try to get them to try to take out 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.600
 the map so that you do not stay 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.180
 without campaigns 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.360
 I have been told out there how good this 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.490
 they want to make videos of me from my campaign 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.670
 the truth I do not have problems while 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.170
 that they put me the credits in their 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.120
 video for example I'm not saying that 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.160
 in the video mere in the video with the mi 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.800
 name do not have the description of 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.440
 video the truth put my channel there and 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.630
 please put the original link of the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.580
 map not the rest you go to one of 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.900
 your servers either by 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:46.040
 be it mega shifts and salads poseidón 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.900
 macros and there's another one out there fast fast 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.090
 and benaoján the truth I know of their 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.830
 servers but good that's why I 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.780
 I do not want them to upload it because because I 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.120
 I have a download count you 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.130
 they solve their servers is the counting 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.130
 of downloads 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.290
 let's say it goes down and so I will not know or I 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.210
 I will not be able to draw the next map so it's 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.730
 how my system works to an action 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.160
 Not even if there are, for example, around 200 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.950
 or 300 to reach the goal I was born pulled out 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.630
 the map because because they are already very few and 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.030
 Well now I'm going to 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.220
 Render the map again because 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.010
 I could make an error 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.830
 an error of some scenarios and good 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.080
 this time it's time to put back 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.110
 render again the map so that 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.760
 good either everything and then up to here the 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.310
 today's video and it's just a video 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.240
 informative and I already said why I do not show 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.220
 the campaign here but as you can see by 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.560
 example they see me nothing else is for you to 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:49.310
 check how the tracks in this 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.310
 computer option under nothing has 50 me 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.980
 enemy captor captain that if what 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.600
 has prisoner in one of his first 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.340
 expenses and reconciliation 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.590
 the way ship is currently positioned 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.319
 about 300 meters above the other side 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.540
 Of cards 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.849
 and how will we enter the ship if it is in 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.270
 the air the body has given me a rifle not 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.980
 wings 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.540
 helps the gravity sensor that 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.450
 transports troops and supplies from the 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.470
 ship to the surface so we will enter 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.390
 when we enter the ship it could 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.340
 locate the trace signal of the 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.340
 neural implants master keys 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.190
 Come on, come on, there's already put them 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.190
 go by hours 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.650
 we will stay on the high ground 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.419
 on the right so we can examine the 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.419
 position of the pact yes they detect us 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.250
 attention I have detected fixed cannons of 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.690
 Covenant near the next step os 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.190
 I recommend that you use the rifle 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.169
 precision to eliminate the gunners 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.169
 while I ask for reinforcements from the Marines 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.600
 to give us support is the medium object 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.130
 teacher will come 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.320
 remote everyone who can the 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.090
 covenant on fire until today they 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.040
 You know me 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.520
 so we can keep the advantage of the 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.520
 surprises 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.150
 well there is all this truth not 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.220
 I want to exfoliate a lot here since you saw that 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.560
 they lower my flaps on what is in this 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:39.760
 map because because she has the quality 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:43.000
 hd in the bsp textures 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.730
 and that's why they lower me so much and I can not 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.720
 record and less with phrases to buy 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.730
 obviously as it is recording I am going to 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.590
 download more but well, only this 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.480
 it means I already told you because I do not 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.880
 I recorded the map while they just gave 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.400
 account but I hope you like the 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.680
 truth has rosillo if the pelican 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.660
 has errors but this is so 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.990
 while already in the beta is not going to have 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.390
 mistakes I'm going to put more time 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.660
 to the pelican and that's it 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.910
 the strong the game 4 is already here 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.560
 you also need to put the color but 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.200
 already done everything and a few 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.990
 effects that were passed around me but 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.210
 this right now because it's alpha the map is 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.710
 alpha then when it happens not but good 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.060
 this was all I hope you liked 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.620
 the video do not forget to give him there 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.910
 Favorites comment and share the video 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.430
 and if you are not subscribed to the channel 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.410
 subscribe is free I do not charge as 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.960
 some other channels that are out there 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.750
 on youtube they charge the subscription I 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.760
 no and here everything is free all everything 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.040
 everything is free and all these projects 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.420
 I do them for you many have 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.870
 said hey how much are you going to charge for your 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:49.840
 campaign I do not charge all this is free 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.840
 the truth is I 'm not having a 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.930
 income for the campaign this I am 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.280
 doing for pleasure not for so by 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.729
 money and nothing strange I do it for 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.460
 nothing more 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.830
 that's why he has seen problems out there but 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.789
 the truth does not take them into account 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.350
 obviously the taxes that if I'm 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:09.560
 occupying 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:13.490
 so in what is in the motto always 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.430
 I put the credits to those that I 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:19.289
 the owners of the bucks but obviously 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.270
 the track I do not know who it is 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:24.479
 is the problem that I do not know whose is the 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.939
 gun and well I'll have to leave it 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:29.399
 and after that I'll investigate you 

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:30.990
 Now, but this is something else 

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:33.719
 it means that very soon there will be 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.360
 gameplays already halo 4 obviously already the 

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:38.969
 game of halo xbox 4 and of 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.129
 halo reach in xbox live in multiplayer 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:43.379
 so you can see good 

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:46.969
 listen and see how I get angry every time 

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:46.969
 that they kill me damn camper 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.229
 and if you want then too 

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:54.180
 we play the campaign to see that 

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:55.770
 click but I'm not haha 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.029
 well now I say goodbye yes jota 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.909
 that s &amp; p see you in the next 

00:07:57.029 --> 00:08:01.770
 video and on the next map the 

00:07:59.909 --> 00:08:03.749
 silent cartographer and that map me 

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:06.419
 love that it is map I like a lot 

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:09.180
 because they are my favorite because they do not 

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:11.309
 I know I played the trial first and since 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.669
 there I make myself maps and everything always 

00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:13.669
 we are 

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.580
 in the next video chao
