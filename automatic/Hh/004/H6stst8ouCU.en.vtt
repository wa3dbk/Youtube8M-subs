glitch<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:10.050> therefore<00:00:10.469> I'm<00:00:10.740> going<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.010> make

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
glitch so therefore I'm going to make

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.950 
glitch so therefore I'm going to make

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
to do not just in terms of how to do the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.580 
to do not just in terms of how to do the
glitch<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:18.000> what<00:00:18.180> armors<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.750> wear<00:00:18.930> what<00:00:19.289> food

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
in there with the blade master set for

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.069 
in there with the blade master set for
bows<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.730> would<00:00:35.850> recommend<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.360> dragon<00:00:36.750> element

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
bows I would recommend a dragon element

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.020 
bows I would recommend a dragon element
with<00:00:37.230> Pierce<00:00:37.530> arrows<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.309> fire<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.820> pierce

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
with Pierce arrows but fire and pierce

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.200 
with Pierce arrows but fire and pierce
works<00:00:39.270> too<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:40.410> bow<00:00:40.559> guns<00:00:40.829> Pierce<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.879> also

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
works too for bow guns Pierce is also

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030 
works too for bow guns Pierce is also
very<00:00:42.420> effective<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.350> also<00:00:43.500> depends<00:00:43.920> on

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
very effective but it also depends on

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.740 
very effective but it also depends on
what<00:00:44.190> you're<00:00:44.370> willing<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.670> craft<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.329> far<00:00:45.600> as

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
what you're willing to craft as far as

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.660 
what you're willing to craft as far as
weapons<00:00:45.930> go<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:47.070> remember<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
weapons go just remember that the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.209 
weapons go just remember that the
abyssal<00:00:47.969> lagiacrus<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.780> most<00:00:49.110> weak<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.800> dragon

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
abyssal lagiacrus is most weak to dragon

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.850 
abyssal lagiacrus is most weak to dragon
and<00:00:50.399> slightly<00:00:50.730> less<00:00:51.000> weak<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.449> fire<00:00:51.710> just<00:00:52.710> for

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and slightly less weak to fire just for

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.470 
and slightly less weak to fire just for

everyone else in the group as my arrows

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.540 
everyone else in the group as my arrows
tend<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.140> disappear<00:02:43.590> due<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.890> lack<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.280> range

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550

if<00:02:44.760> I'm<00:02:44.910> too<00:02:45.120> far<00:02:45.420> away

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
if I'm too far away

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.080 
if I'm too far away
you<00:02:46.410> can<00:02:46.590> stand<00:02:46.830> wherever<00:02:47.069> feels<00:02:47.489> best<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.850> you

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
you can stand wherever feels best to you

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.059 
you can stand wherever feels best to you
you<00:02:48.360> can<00:02:48.510> also<00:02:48.690> approach<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.380> same<00:02:49.650> area

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
you can also approach this same area

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.380 
you can also approach this same area
from<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.340> opposite<00:02:50.700> direction

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
from the opposite direction

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.970 
from the opposite direction
thus<00:02:51.630> luring<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.170> lagy<00:02:52.380> across<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.830> other

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
thus luring the lagy across the other

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.850 
thus luring the lagy across the other
way<00:02:53.160> also<00:02:53.450> however<00:02:54.450> very<00:02:54.959> few<00:02:55.230> people<00:02:55.380> go<00:02:55.680> that

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
way also however very few people go that

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.210 
way also however very few people go that
way

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
way

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.590 
way
so<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.519> would<00:02:56.640> be<00:02:56.670> best<00:02:56.940> for<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.239> go<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
so it would be best for you to go the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.660 
so it would be best for you to go the
same<00:02:57.810> way<00:02:57.840> everyone<00:02:58.350> else<00:02:58.380> goes<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.250> your<00:02:59.430> team

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
same way everyone else goes on your team

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.729 
same way everyone else goes on your team
which<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.420> way<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.690> just<00:03:00.840> showed<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
which is the way I just showed you the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.500 
which is the way I just showed you the
actual<00:03:02.100> battle<00:03:02.550> technique<00:03:02.970> for<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.269> glitch

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
actual battle technique for this glitch

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.449 
actual battle technique for this glitch
is<00:03:03.690> pretty<00:03:03.900> simple<00:03:04.170> in<00:03:04.500> fact<00:03:04.860> there's<00:03:05.220> hardly

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
is pretty simple in fact there's hardly

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.580 
is pretty simple in fact there's hardly
any<00:03:05.670> technique<00:03:06.120> at<00:03:06.239> all<00:03:06.390> just<00:03:07.080> shoot<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.410> bow

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
any technique at all just shoot the bow

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.530 
any technique at all just shoot the bow
or<00:03:07.920> bow<00:03:08.160> gun<00:03:08.459> or<00:03:08.670> whatever<00:03:08.819> you're<00:03:09.090> using<00:03:09.269> as

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
or bow gun or whatever you're using as

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
long as you're hitting the monster

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.280 
long as you're hitting the monster
you're<00:03:11.190> doing<00:03:11.489> well<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.910> would<00:03:12.720> recommend<00:03:13.140> that

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
you're doing well I would recommend that

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.270 
you're doing well I would recommend that
when<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.799> chance

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
when you have the chance

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.009 
when you have the chance
aim<00:03:14.459> for<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> Leggio<00:03:15.060> Chris's<00:03:15.420> head<00:03:15.600> as<00:03:15.840> you

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
aim for the Leggio Chris's head as you

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.449 
aim for the Leggio Chris's head as you
will<00:03:16.140> obviously<00:03:16.380> be<00:03:16.680> able<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:16.980> put<00:03:17.160> out<00:03:17.310> more

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
will obviously be able to put out more

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.970 
will obviously be able to put out more
damage<00:03:17.880> but<00:03:18.569> only<00:03:19.080> do<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.650> when<00:03:19.799> it's

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
damage but only do it when it's

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.710 
damage but only do it when it's
convenient<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.269> don't<00:03:21.450> want<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.660> be

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
convenient to you you don't want to be

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.170 
convenient to you you don't want to be
aiming<00:03:21.900> your<00:03:22.200> shots<00:03:22.440> constantly<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.670> idea<00:03:24.060> is

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
aiming your shots constantly the idea is

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.910 
aiming your shots constantly the idea is
to<00:03:24.330> hit<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.600> lagiacrus<00:03:24.959> as<00:03:25.230> much<00:03:25.440> as<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.680> can

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
to hit the lagiacrus as much as you can

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.530 
to hit the lagiacrus as much as you can
within<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.250> shortest<00:03:26.670> time<00:03:26.790> possible<00:03:26.970> in
