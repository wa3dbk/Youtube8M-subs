00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
the beast first and this basically is

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.939 
the beast first and this basically is
the<00:00:21.210> reason<00:00:21.660> why<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.840> lack<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.800> go<00:00:22.890> to

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the reason why you lack you can go to

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.420 
the reason why you lack you can go to
options<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.230> basically<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.500> you're<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> 64-bit

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
options and basically if you're a 64-bit

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.050 
options and basically if you're a 64-bit
any<00:00:27.180> run<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> minecraft<00:00:28.460> minecraft<00:00:29.460> basically

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
any run a minecraft minecraft basically

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.900 
any run a minecraft minecraft basically
gives<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.449> 32-bit<00:00:31.260> version<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.859> Java<00:00:32.219> so

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
gives you a 32-bit version of Java so

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.020 
gives you a 32-bit version of Java so

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you're just gonna install the 64-bit

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.440 
you're just gonna install the 64-bit
version<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.310> prove<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.670> work<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.030> open<00:01:18.299> feed

I might lag because I'm using the full
screen<00:02:09.100> recorder<00:02:09.520> which<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.880> not<00:02:10.149> meant<00:02:10.420> for

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
screen recorder which is not meant for

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.260 
screen recorder which is not meant for
gaming<00:02:11.080> so<00:02:12.930> yeah<00:02:13.930> I'm<00:02:14.560> actually<00:02:14.770> running

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
gaming so yeah I'm actually running

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.660 
gaming so yeah I'm actually running
decent<00:02:16.270> for<00:02:16.540> having<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.959> recorder<00:02:17.500> so

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:30.380 

really<00:02:21.670> lagging<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:28.380> let's<00:02:29.380> go<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> minecraft

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
really lagging so let's go to minecraft

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.640

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
now if you want to know how to run good

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.500 
now if you want to know how to run good
on<00:02:32.770> minecraft<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.489> actually<00:02:33.880> very<00:02:34.090> simple

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
on minecraft it's actually very simple

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.610 
on minecraft it's actually very simple
and<00:02:36.270> if<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:38.080> are<00:02:38.340> only<00:02:39.340> for<00:02:40.090> gig<00:02:40.300> again<00:02:41.170> you

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
and if you are only for gig again you

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.470 
and if you are only for gig again you
only<00:02:41.860> can<00:02:43.590> use<00:02:45.510> um<00:02:46.590> 2<00:02:47.590> gigs<00:02:47.830> or<00:02:48.100> maybe<00:02:48.820> 1<00:02:49.090> gig<00:02:49.330> I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
only can use um 2 gigs or maybe 1 gig I
