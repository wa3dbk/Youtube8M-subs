 although I belong to modern art 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.680
 because in my years I am looking for a living but if 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.810

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.659
 devote to modern art which 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.120
 must be conceptual faceless we 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.370
 quite controversial so when i found out

 that such a prize exists I won it 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.200
