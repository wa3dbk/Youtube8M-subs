Christchurch University at Canterbury
and<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.120> study<00:00:06.420> animal<00:00:06.870> cognition<00:00:07.049> that's

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
and I study animal cognition that's

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.240 
and I study animal cognition that's
basically<00:00:08.189> how<00:00:08.490> animals<00:00:09.179> think<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:10.130> at<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
basically how animals think and at the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.379 
basically how animals think and at the
moment<00:00:11.280> I'm<00:00:11.580> doing<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.880> really<00:00:12.059> interesting

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
moment I'm doing a really interesting

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.310 
moment I'm doing a really interesting
experiment<00:00:13.049> it's<00:00:13.889> about<00:00:14.009> detail<00:00:14.490> behavior

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
experiment it's about detail behavior

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.019 
experiment it's about detail behavior
and<00:00:16.320> I've<00:00:16.529> done<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.980> same<00:00:17.130> study<00:00:17.460> with<00:00:17.730> dogs

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
and I've done the same study with dogs

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.510 
and I've done the same study with dogs
with<00:00:18.480> horses<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.140> now<00:00:19.500> today<00:00:19.800> with<00:00:20.160> donkeys

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
with horses and now today with donkeys

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.460 
with horses and now today with donkeys
and<00:00:20.640> with<00:00:20.789> mules<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.539> it's<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.990> really

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
and with mules and it's it's a really

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.200 
and with mules and it's it's a really
interesting<00:00:22.560> story<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.820> original<00:00:24.150> is

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
interesting story the original is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.490 
interesting story the original is
actually<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:24.689> comparative<00:00:25.170> psychology

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
actually from comparative psychology

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.599 
actually from comparative psychology
from<00:00:26.099> developmental<00:00:27.080> psychology<00:00:28.609> basically

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
from developmental psychology basically

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.060 
from developmental psychology basically
you<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.910> an<00:00:30.090> enclosure<00:00:30.990> or<00:00:31.140> room<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.920> you

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
you have an enclosure or room and you

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
you have an enclosure or room and you
put<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> barrier<00:00:32.489> across<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.030> middle<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
put a barrier across the middle with a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.490 
put a barrier across the middle with a
clearly<00:00:34.710> visible<00:00:34.980> gap<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.120> side<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.660> then

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
clearly visible gap on one side and then

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.799 
clearly visible gap on one side and then
you've<00:00:38.040> got<00:00:38.250> something<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.059> animal<00:00:39.420> wants<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
you've got something the animal wants to

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.420 
you've got something the animal wants to
go<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> at<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> other<00:00:40.469> end<00:00:40.710> some<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> owner

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
go to at the other end some of the owner

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.580 
go to at the other end some of the owner
with<00:00:41.700> some<00:00:41.910> food<00:00:42.120> or<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> infant's<00:00:43.469> they

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
with some food or for the infant's they

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.080 
with some food or for the infant's they
had<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> mum<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> other<00:00:44.550> side<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
had the mum on the other side of the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.990 
had the mum on the other side of the
fence<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.950> let<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.640> animal

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
fence and then you just let the animal

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.520 
fence and then you just let the animal
or<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> infinite<00:00:48.690> go<00:00:48.840> around<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> barrier<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
or the infinite go around the barrier a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.819 
or the infinite go around the barrier a
few<00:00:49.800> times<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:51.120> then<00:00:51.719> while<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.110> are<00:00:52.770> being

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
few times and then while they are being

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.260 
few times and then while they are being
brought<00:00:53.250> back<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.730> starting<00:00:54.090> position

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
brought back to the starting position

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.170 
brought back to the starting position
around<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.530> outside<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.760> room

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
around the outside of the of the room

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.959 
around the outside of the of the room
enclosure<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:58.289> actually<00:00:58.440> move<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> gap<00:00:59.100> well

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
enclosure you actually move the gap well

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.970 
enclosure you actually move the gap well
and<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.149> don't<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.870> then<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.710> just

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and I don't see it and then you just

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.520 
and I don't see it and then you just
they<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:03.210> their<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:03.690> asked<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.199> exactly

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
they have their then asked to do exactly

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.219 
they have their then asked to do exactly
the<00:01:04.799> same<00:01:05.299> to<00:01:06.299> go<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.689> other<00:01:06.810> end<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the same to go to the other end of the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.859 
the same to go to the other end of the
room<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> certain<00:01:09.030> age<00:01:09.299> infants

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
room and up to a certain age infants

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.140 
room and up to a certain age infants
will<00:01:10.140> run<00:01:10.920> straight<00:01:11.310> into<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> fence<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
will run straight into the fence and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.390 
will run straight into the fence and
what<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> found<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.110> almost<00:01:13.619> all<00:01:13.950> dogs<00:01:14.189> do

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
what I found is that almost all dogs do

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.330 
what I found is that almost all dogs do
it<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.670> well<00:01:14.700> also<00:01:15.689> spirit<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.770> will<00:01:17.009> follow

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it as well also spirit they will follow

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
it as well also spirit they will follow
the<00:01:17.520> path<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.930> have

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the path they have them they have

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.020 
the path they have them they have
followed<00:01:19.350> before<00:01:19.500> although<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.310> gap<00:01:20.880> is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
followed before although the gap is

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
followed before although the gap is
visibly<00:01:21.479> closed<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.590> new<00:01:22.710> gap<00:01:22.920> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
visibly closed and the new gap is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.190 
visibly closed and the new gap is
exactly<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> same<00:01:23.759> size<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
exactly the same size it's just on the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.289 
exactly the same size it's just on the
other<00:01:25.290> side<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> room<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.490> except<00:01:27.270> for

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
other side of the room that except for

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.319 
other side of the room that except for
once<00:01:27.630> done<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.650> tested<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.310> who<00:01:29.729> had

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
once done you just tested and who had

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.300 
once done you just tested and who had
four<00:01:30.659> repeats<00:01:31.020> through<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> through<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.100> gap

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
four repeats through the through one gap

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
four repeats through the through one gap
we<00:01:32.549> moved<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> gap<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.360> she<00:01:33.689> went<00:01:33.840> straight

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
we moved the gap and she went straight

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.830 
we moved the gap and she went straight
to<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.470> new<00:01:34.650> location<00:01:35.009> which<00:01:35.549> no<00:01:36.479> dog<00:01:36.659> has

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to the new location which no dog has

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.870 
to the new location which no dog has
ever<00:01:37.020> done<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.409> test<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> 20<00:01:38.100> dogs<00:01:38.250> exactly<00:01:38.759> on

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
ever done I test the 20 dogs exactly on

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.969 
ever done I test the 20 dogs exactly on
the<00:01:38.909> same<00:01:39.030> setup<00:01:39.420> they<00:01:40.049> couldn't<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the same setup they couldn't do it the

wearing a problem solving but it

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.930 
wearing a problem solving but it
