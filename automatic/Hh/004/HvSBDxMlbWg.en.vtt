I guess that's a good thing right
it<00:03:44.260> could<00:03:44.409> also<00:03:44.560> be<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:44.829> last<00:03:45.099> ditch<00:03:45.250> effort<00:03:45.639> to

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
it could also be a last ditch effort to

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.759 
it could also be a last ditch effort to
save<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.239> company<00:03:46.389> from<00:03:46.720> its<00:03:46.840> 4.3<00:03:47.439> billion

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
save the company from its 4.3 billion

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.819

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
dollar loss in sales last year or just a

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.319 
dollar loss in sales last year or just a
way<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:50.950> make<00:03:51.189> them<00:03:51.370> more<00:03:51.549> competitive

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
way to make them more competitive

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.119 
way to make them more competitive
either<00:03:52.959> way<00:03:53.079> this<00:03:53.260> could<00:03:53.500> be<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.650> great<00:03:53.920> move

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
either way this could be a great move

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.890
