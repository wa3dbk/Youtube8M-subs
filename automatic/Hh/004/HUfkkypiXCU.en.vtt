00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.700
 hello with kids this species to 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.530
 youtube and in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.570
 one click I decided that it's called classic is 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.490
 widget you can find it so 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.950
 free in the hanjour repository 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.600
 iphone that I'm going to leave now it's good 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.670
 basically what this tweet is 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.760
 implement us multitasking them and 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.100
 Senna I 7 as all of you will know 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.720
 those who have them worth 7 For good 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.940
 the multitasking has changed and there 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.920
 people who do not like you very much are worth those who 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.630
 I include myself as well to return to the 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.239
 multitasking that we had that we had 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.250
 sorry on may 6 the only thing that you have to 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.320
 do is install this click and once 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.390
 with them installed let's go to settings 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.309
 where will we create a small access 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.100
 direct as you see is here so it's 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.800
 widget and you are going to enable the one which then 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.750
 so it has good one or another option 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.820
 ok to configure it but the truth is 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.590
 which is very simple and I'm not going to 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.559
 explain it is worth it once you have done 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.450
 this and we are going to enter our 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.460
 multitasking is worth to see that you have 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.500
 changed and it's back to us 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.390
 it appeared in them 7 is worth everything works 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.189
 exactly the same to erase the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.170
 applications in the background so good 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.750
 we could eliminate them one etc 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.689
 one thing that they have added in this ticket 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.150
 is that if we slide our finger towards 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.820
 the right as you can see appears there 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.500
 one X and without letting go and masters then we 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.360
 gives the option to eliminate all 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.460
 applications that we have open in 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.399
 background the truth is that good 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.200
 this click is great and it's a very good one 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.600
 option for all those people who 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.820
 they do not like yesterday's multitasking much 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.060
 7 to install this tweet the only thing that 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.750
 you have to do is enter cydia 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.750
 wait for it to load 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.100
 and once it's loaded we're going to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.410
 handle that as it is to be down inside 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.650
 to handle we're going to go to sources and we're going 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.880
 to give edit and add and here we go 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.210
 to write the next thing that is repo 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.320
 dot haq 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.320
 debt and font 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.390
 once you did it written you give it to 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.000
 add source and I'm not going to give it 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.560
 because I already have it installed and once 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.690
 that you install will appear here 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.180
 below, as you can see here, also what 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.910
 It makes easy icon is worth once you have 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.010

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.850

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.620

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.310
