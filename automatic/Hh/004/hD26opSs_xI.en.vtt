00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.870
 well now let's look at the function 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.180
 creation of this one for example I have a 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.230
 material see that basic 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.000
 if I do right click I will see 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.289
 the option therefore created in an hour and I 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.609
 will find this option so everything to 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.830
 right also in interface water if 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.060
 in the inspector so if I click months 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.050
 that I have a dialogue so editing of 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.269
 scheider that will appear 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.499
 so when we say created shader there are two 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.269
 opportunities either you leave from a 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.619
 basic masterpieces like here and you 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.749
 go fill the cellars 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.550
 so it should save as caprioling 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:36.770
 of hours either you go outright 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.910
 so use a shader here from the catalog 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.590
 and so when you go to do click 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.370
 right to create in hour or use 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.170
 the button that is at the top 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.730
 you will therefore have the opportunity to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.800
 edit this masterpiece too so that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.410
 it's very useful 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.230
 then how does it work then you 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.780
 are going to have several textures games a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.940
 added to create a complete shader 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.500
 so the first one sighted 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.050
 it's a little preview that will not 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.259
 here one in catalog below then 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.670
 you're going to have diffuse it diffuse that 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.159
 it's just the texture 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.829
 which will be repeated on the surface 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.960
 ok so that's the texture in itself a 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.359
 here next there is the notion of size 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.270
 so what size does the width here 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.969
 of the texture of diffuse 1 m 84 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.770
 what size does the width here one of 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.140
 the preview so like that gives us a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.450
 born idea size you want 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.100
 possibly so for when you 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.800
 put when you ask your the shader 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.630
 directly so on a surface then 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.140
 we'll see then I'll just put 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.850
 to zero like that we'll all watched 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.170
 together we'll see a parameter of 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.360
 reflection so here i'm having a 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.760
 texture of reflection all that is 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 black on this texture does not reflect 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.760
 everything that goes to white reflects 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.810
 so is therefore launched the pure reflection 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.290
 bastard I'll be able to reflect at 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.550
 maximum an embittered that allow me to play 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.260
 do a little nice effect because it 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.060
 allow me to have some white with 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.680
 a lot of gray reflections with a little 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.660
 less glare and black with no 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.850
 reflection so there for example if I put the 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.800
 reflection you will see that the black 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.420
 for example here in June where I 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.770
 do not have any glare yes we see 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.500
 really that there is that screams the 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.640
 bricks that will reflect it's the same 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.260
 for shine if I put a texture 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.130
 everything is black there will be no 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.180
 shine all that is white there 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.230
 will have shine and in between 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.060
 I will be able to play in phase on this 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.890
 factor there so here in this case as 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.380
 there are no textures sava foot is in 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.720
 do all the thinking 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.900
 so that's another possibility 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.400
 then I will have the relief 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.740
 so the relief is like a game of 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.150
 grayscale textures all that 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.350
 is black will give an effect of 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.340
 depth all that is white is going 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.040
 give a relief effect 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.570
 so if I put relief here what it 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.060
 will serve it's going to serve mostly sailboats 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.830
 drew the small asperities on the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.280
 bricks to give a little an appearance of 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.770
 relief 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.239
 to avoid the flat side of the 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.190
 photo material yes so the 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.870
 difference here with and without 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.670
 the texture of normal is a little 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.660
 different it's not like at the level of 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.370
 gray is in rvb 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.900
 ok so that will give directions you 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.540
 can find tutorials on any one 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.090
 heap website on the subject of this 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.350
 called normal normal mapping 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.270
 mapping is normal without them 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.620
 so it's in English and you go 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.660
 so have the opportunity to always 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.370
 not to recreate in fact the relief see that 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.400
 will actually simulate relief shadows 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.320
 on a subject so that gives you 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.550
 an idea in fact of relief based 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.690
 of the direction of light then 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.760
 associated with that you're going to find so 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.040
 the 3d effect then the 3d effect is 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.690
 interesting it goes further than normal 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.100
 mapping makes it the 3d effect it's a bit 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.750
 what is called parallax mapping that 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.730
 will allow you to actually create a 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.690
 true depth aspect so you 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.580
 see that it's actually a texture 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.470
 always the same grayscale all 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.390
 what is black is going to sink all this 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.710
 who is white will come out and so I 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.630
 will be able like that you see create 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.430
 depth so if we look at 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.810
 will have really a shadow here 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.650
 scope that will emerge according to 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.210
 the position of the sun 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.950
 then the small strata that 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.690
 appear here that's not important 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.340
 it will be erased completely in the end 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.350
 it's just for the preview to be 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.610
 always fast here we perceived and see 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.690
 we really have the depth aspect 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.130
 that is to say that there I do not see anymore 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.830
 attached whereas with the facts of normal 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.000
 mapping when I'm going to put the normal 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.980
 see that the toy still remains 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.900
 well visible gold theoretically here the 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.670
 brick should sink where holds 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.650
 so should have a real effect so 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.970
 it is by combining several effects that 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.700
 I will get sent something from 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.080
 much more realistic by mixing all 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.940
 its effects should not be abused 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.310
 more but you will be able to get 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.860
 something much more realistic 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.130
 so mixing the relief the normal and 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.390
 the 3d effect of course if you use 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.580
 not the relief is normal you will already have 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.169
 a depth effect that will create 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.090
 a 3d aspect on the brick 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.930
 so it 's always the same 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.340
 gray level all that is black 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.010
 depth all that is white so 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.990
 elevation we will see an alpha texture 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.150
 all that is black will be hidden all this 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.410
 which is white will be visible ok so that 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.669
 actually allow you to hide 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.470
 particles to geometry if you 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.670
 want 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.170
 then you will be able to do a 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.280
 mirror effect if you wish 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.050
 so it's just going to 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.460
 whenever the texture is duplicated at 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.040
 the next repetition that will reverse 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.510
 the texture so on the horizontal or on 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.250
 the vertical you can flip and 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.330
 possibly also if you 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.100
 so that 's just fine 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.550
 inverted so on the horizontal the 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.660
 texture in itself or on the vertical 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.860
 you have an effect the possibility a 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.090
 added the holidays fresnel the buttocks 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.440
 to brake there we see that it has an effect 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.570
 but obviously did not want right now 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.490
 when you have recorded wichser 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.380
 you will have a fresnel slider that will 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.630
 so allow you to play from 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.720
 control the reflection of matter in 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.460
 function of the orientation of the camera 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.810
 finally uv texture so rush it 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.740
 plated in uv so lifted mac I you 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.970
 remember I had talked about it quickly 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.950
 that's what allows you to tackle by 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.340
 example a face on a character on 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.870
 modeling a character is so 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.920
 a coordinate on the texture is going 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.570
 match a coordinate in 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.280
 3d space so that's what we 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.450
 call him v mapping like you 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.790
 can find tutorials on 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.650
 internet one recovers this parameter there 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.630
 from the modeler if you wish 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.910
 So that's how you go 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.800
 so be able to create a material then 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.730
 you have record under and you 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.470
 so you can save it to 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.240
 hateley format what is a new 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.210
 atlantis format so that corresponds to the 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.500
 park haunting shaders that's how are 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.500
 created the shader in atlantis
