 This way to pull the dirt out. 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.049
 it's from above down to arm to 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.280

 take the end leads to the tip in this 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.610
 Way does not force beauty not to scratch the

 All right, look, take it at the end. 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.770
 the tip let it turn 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.420
 cotton has already appeared alongside 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.870
 another by the same beauty 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.660
 procedure 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.250
 there passed polish beauty furniture 60 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.640

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.590
 very cheap even the name of your cotton 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.880
 same procedure picks up at the end 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.510
 drags right 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:04.120
 Look, this way here, you took it all away. 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:07.870
 this surface that was dirty on top 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.530
 of the film beauty she once took 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.390
 left do not take dry cotton gives 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.320
 here on the side and works with cotton 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.940
 in this position here, beauty, make this 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.540
 here's how it goes 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.390
 in this position to be able to be the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.400
 the excess you left here from 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.060
 looks furniture only looks 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.930
 It's already getting a very nice face, I 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.410
 I got here until the end 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:42.040
 comes we do not use that film gives 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.720
 That 's the one I had there. 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.299
 mentioned here at the beginning this one 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.220
 Do not use this here because this 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.940
 here is going to be all your console is 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.180
 So look at the little cotton you come 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.510
 giving the final finish of the beginning 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.489
 at the end is the cotton dry if the cotton 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.680
 begin to obey because of the excess 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.079
 you change the button because you will not 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.900
 clean the video game every day 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.239
 he will always be on the shelf 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.470
 It's very clean, okay? 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:17.979
 look just did not drain handset beauty and he 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.140
 continue with the perfect film, okay 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.840
 Look, only you are giving to visualize 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.180
 Right there but he will continue 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.430
 circulates perfectly here from the side to 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.650
 same thing you can take advantage of this 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.790
 part here is right where the balls are 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.919
 that the air intake 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.560
 you can then enjoy the same 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.500
 You were kind of damp 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.290
 beauty gives a pass if you have 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.300
 a brush can pass there too 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.880
 that good squishy another brush 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.199
 advice to you just pass the 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.610
 cotton is not only 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.120
 take a little break 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.530
 Look, he's gone. He's going to clean the whole room. 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.840
 surface is right 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.729
 So you 're going through this one in that 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.919
 range always remembering that the 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.690
 cap x I because the video game is yours 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.210
 so how do you know it did not cost 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.950
 cheap to take care of you 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.510
 they make it right here beauty that if not 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.300
 This video is very huge. 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.190
 this part here frontal is certain that 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.320
 the part that we call and gets into 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.039
 the finger here direct procedure is the 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.460
 even a little bit of furniture polish 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.870
 beauty 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.840
 Look, just a little, it's not right . 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.200
 the galley is to brace up and down 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.880
 here then you will simply get 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.520
 pass their mobile phones the way the 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:41.139
 people had taught up there 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:45.010
 Beauty has spent getting some dry cotton 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:47.410
 then removes the excess there from the 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:52.870
 Looks good-looking furniture that's cool 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:54.460
 is getting here look you're taking 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.430
 giving to observe but it will not 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.050
 risk anything and a little bit if you 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.380
 rubbed right side and I'm showing 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.610

 value the product a little and what the 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:49.319
 people used a little bit of cotton 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.629
