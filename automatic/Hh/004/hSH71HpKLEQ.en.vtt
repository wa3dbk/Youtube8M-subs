um oh yeah i guess i should mention the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.430 
um oh yeah i guess i should mention the
animatronics<00:03:49.250> they<00:03:49.489> get<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.700> bit<00:03:50.170> glitchy<00:03:51.170> at

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
animatronics they get a bit glitchy at

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.319 
animatronics they get a bit glitchy at
night<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:52.220> see<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.519> company<00:03:52.910> doesn't<00:03:53.060> shut

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
their servos locking up so you might see

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.890 
their servos locking up so you might see
them<00:03:57.650> wander<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.160> little<00:03:58.250> bit<00:03:58.730> but<00:03:59.359> it's<00:03:59.600> okay

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.360 
of their way okay like I said they can
be<00:04:05.359> glitchy<00:04:05.569> so<00:04:06.109> just<00:04:06.590> try<00:04:06.769> and<00:04:06.829> stay<00:04:07.040> clear<00:04:07.340> of

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
told you but at night this place runs on

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.069 
told you but at night this place runs on
a<00:04:19.489> generator<00:04:20.030> so<00:04:20.299> there's<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.630> limited<00:04:20.959> amount

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
a generator so there's a limited amount

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.379 
a generator so there's a limited amount
of<00:04:21.260> energy<00:04:21.520> there<00:04:22.520> should<00:04:22.729> be<00:04:22.850> a<00:04:22.880> percentage

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
of energy there should be a percentage

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.420 
of energy there should be a percentage
counter<00:04:23.720> next<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.169> time<00:04:24.410> just<00:04:25.039> try<00:04:25.190> not<00:04:25.220> to

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
counter next to the time just try not to

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.279 
counter next to the time just try not to
let<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.610> run<00:04:25.789> out<00:04:25.940> that<00:04:26.900> means<00:04:27.050> using

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
let it run out that means using

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.010 
let it run out that means using
electricity<00:04:27.710> sparingly<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:29.419> lights<00:04:29.690> the
