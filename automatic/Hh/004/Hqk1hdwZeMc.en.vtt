know<00:06:15.280> I<00:06:15.310> think<00:06:15.460> he's<00:06:17.040> clearly<00:06:18.040> someone<00:06:18.730> who

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
know I think he's clearly someone who

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.460 
know I think he's clearly someone who
finds<00:06:19.330> that<00:06:20.280> combination<00:06:21.280> of<00:06:21.370> 70s<00:06:22.000> 80s<00:06:22.570> a<00:06:22.960> real

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
finds that combination of 70s 80s a real

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.730 
finds that combination of 70s 80s a real
romantic<00:06:23.980> glamorous<00:06:24.880> place<00:06:25.810> to<00:06:26.110> mine<00:06:26.350> and

romantic glamorous place to mine and

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.940 
romantic glamorous place to mine and
he's<00:06:26.860> mining<00:06:27.610> the<00:06:27.700> hell<00:06:27.880> out<00:06:28.030> of<00:06:28.060> it<00:06:28.300> you<00:06:28.480> know
