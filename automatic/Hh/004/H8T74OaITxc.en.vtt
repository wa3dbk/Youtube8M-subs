overall the quality's just not the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.840 
overall the quality's just not the
greatest<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.340> need<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> soccer

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.469 
first but once the ball is broken in I
really<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.130> how<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.399> feels<00:01:59.579> it<00:02:00.000> has<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.149> nice

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
really like how it feels it has a nice

great<00:02:04.409> for<00:02:04.590> juggling<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.579> feel

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
great for juggling I just like the feel

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
32 panel design but you can see that

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.479 
32 panel design but you can see that
some<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> panels<00:02:10.739> are<00:02:10.890> slightly<00:02:11.220> more

of<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.040> ball<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.490> mean<00:02:17.970> overall<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.690> does<00:02:18.960> have

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
of the ball I mean overall it does have

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.930 
of the ball I mean overall it does have
that<00:02:19.410> same<00:02:19.740> kind<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.190> dimpled<00:02:20.640> finish

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
that same kind of that dimpled finish

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.490 
that same kind of that dimpled finish
that<00:02:21.150> Meggie<00:02:21.360> has<00:02:21.630> been<00:02:21.840> putting<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.320> their

of<00:02:50.910> braking<00:02:51.270> time<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.660> you'll<00:02:51.750> find<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:52.050> it

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
of braking time and you'll find that it

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.890 
of braking time and you'll find that it
feels<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.590> lot<00:02:52.950> better<00:02:53.220> after<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.910> now<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.780> I

on to the strike itself like I said this

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.560 
on to the strike itself like I said this
is<00:03:23.340> something<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.850> would<00:03:23.970> pick<00:03:24.090> up<00:03:24.270> if

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
is something that you would pick up if

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.870 
is something that you would pick up if
you<00:03:24.780> were<00:03:24.930> on<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> bit<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.740> budget<00:03:25.950> it

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
you were on a bit of a budget it

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.030 
you were on a bit of a budget it

about this year's strike is that no

about this year's strike is that no

longer does it have a shiny finish

longer does it have a shiny finish
instead<00:03:34.770> it's<00:03:34.890> more<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.190> matte<00:03:35.400> finish<00:03:35.820> with

that slight dimpling like you might find
on<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.460> top<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.150> sight<00:03:39.450> not<00:03:39.930> sure<00:03:40.140> how

strike<00:03:42.330> in<00:03:42.540> at<00:03:43.020> least<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.380> couple<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.740> years<00:03:43.950> but

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
strike in at least a couple of years but

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.100 
strike in at least a couple of years but
for<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.700> most<00:03:44.850> part<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.210> ball<00:03:45.360> itself<00:03:45.660> hasn't

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
for the most part the ball itself hasn't

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.110 
for the most part the ball itself hasn't
changed<00:03:46.470> all<00:03:46.680> they've<00:03:47.130> changed<00:03:47.430> is<00:03:47.730> that

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
changed all they've changed is that

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.060 
changed all they've changed is that
finish<00:03:48.390> on<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.810> outside<00:03:49.200> which<00:03:49.740> in<00:03:49.950> all

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
finish on the outside which in all

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.740 
finish on the outside which in all
honesty<00:03:50.490> shouldn't<00:03:50.880> change<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.150> performance

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
honesty shouldn't change the performance

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.990 
honesty shouldn't change the performance
too<00:03:51.960> much<00:03:52.170> at<00:03:52.410> all<00:03:52.680> now<00:03:53.280> one<00:03:53.490> thing<00:03:53.670> that<00:03:53.730> is

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
too much at all now one thing that is

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.640 
too much at all now one thing that is
the<00:03:54.180> same<00:03:54.360> about<00:03:54.630> all<00:03:54.840> three<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.290> these<00:03:55.380> soccer

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
the same about all three of these soccer

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.380 
the same about all three of these soccer
balls<00:03:55.950> is<00:03:56.130> obviously<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.790> high<00:03:56.970> visibility

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
balls is obviously the high visibility

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.630 
balls is obviously the high visibility
colorway<00:03:57.990> come<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.710> winter<00:03:58.980> months<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.340> Nike

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
colorway come the winter months and Nike

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.240 
colorway come the winter months and Nike
always<00:04:00.030> seems<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.830> introduce<00:04:01.830> something<00:04:02.100> that

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
always seems to introduce something that

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.500 
always seems to introduce something that
is<00:04:02.460> a<00:04:02.490> little<00:04:02.580> bit<00:04:02.790> more<00:04:02.850> brighter<00:04:03.180> than<00:04:03.390> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
is a little bit more brighter than the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.600 
is a little bit more brighter than the
standard<00:04:03.900> white<00:04:04.170> ball<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:05.130> they<00:04:05.220> generally

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
standard white ball and they generally

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.070 
standard white ball and they generally
go<00:04:05.760> with<00:04:05.940> yellow<00:04:06.180> just<00:04:06.510> because<00:04:06.750> it's<00:04:06.900> more

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
go with yellow just because it's more

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.980 
go with yellow just because it's more
visible<00:04:07.290> in<00:04:07.620> rain<00:04:07.920> as<00:04:08.190> well<00:04:08.490> as<00:04:08.670> in<00:04:08.790> snow<00:04:09.180> so<00:04:09.930> to

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
visible in rain as well as in snow so to

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.480 
visible in rain as well as in snow so to
prepare<00:04:10.230> all<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.950> league's<00:04:11.160> for<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
prepare all of the league's for the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.130 
prepare all of the league's for the
winter<00:04:11.730> months<00:04:12.060> they<00:04:12.390> release<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.959> high

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
winter months they release this high

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.930 
winter months they release this high
visibility<00:04:13.530> colorway<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.370> obviously<00:04:14.760> as

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
visibility colorway that obviously as

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.630 
visibility colorway that obviously as
you<00:04:15.060> can<00:04:15.209> see<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.570> very<00:04:16.049> very<00:04:16.560> visible<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.489> also

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
you can see is very very visible it also

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.550 
you can see is very very visible it also
has<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.209> radar<00:04:18.660> technology<00:04:19.260> like<00:04:19.440> you're

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
has that radar technology like you're

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.140 
has that radar technology like you're
gonna<00:04:19.650> find<00:04:19.950> on<00:04:20.160> all<00:04:20.459> three<00:04:20.700> of<00:04:20.730> these<00:04:20.850> balls

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
gonna find on all three of these balls

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.270 
gonna find on all three of these balls
which<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.840> basically<00:04:22.169> this<00:04:22.380> purple<00:04:22.800> graphic

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
which is basically this purple graphic

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.640 
which is basically this purple graphic
going<00:04:23.550> across<00:04:23.790> the<00:04:24.180> yellow<00:04:24.540> face<00:04:24.810> which<00:04:25.380> is

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
going across the yellow face which is

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.510 
going across the yellow face which is
designed<00:04:26.160> to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
designed to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.029 
designed to
for<00:04:27.060> maximum<00:04:27.780> visibility<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.740> ball<00:04:28.889> and

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
for maximum visibility of the ball and

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.320 
for maximum visibility of the ball and
what<00:04:29.129> that<00:04:29.250> means<00:04:29.490> is<00:04:29.699> you're<00:04:30.060> going<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.270> be

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
what that means is you're going to be

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.059 
what that means is you're going to be
able<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.539> really<00:04:30.900> see<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.289> spin<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:31.949> the<00:04:31.979> ball

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
able to really see the spin of the ball

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.309 
able to really see the spin of the ball
no<00:04:32.639> matter<00:04:32.789> which<00:04:33.090> way<00:04:33.300> no<00:04:33.539> matter<00:04:33.720> how<00:04:33.960> fast

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
no matter which way no matter how fast

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.260
