vault<00:00:10.500> hunter<00:00:10.620> mode<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.480> it<00:00:12.480> comes<00:00:12.690> from<00:00:12.840> a

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
vault hunter mode and it comes from a

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.400 
vault hunter mode and it comes from a
barcode<00:00:13.469> that's<00:00:13.710> transformed<00:00:14.400> several<00:00:14.730> times

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
barcode that's transformed several times

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.230 
barcode that's transformed several times
so<00:00:16.410> we<00:00:16.770> found<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.190> if<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.400> run<00:00:17.820> up<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.119> this

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
so we found that if you run up to this

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.630 
so we found that if you run up to this
building<00:00:18.510> up<00:00:18.810> here<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.470> lot<00:00:19.619> safer<00:00:19.949> than

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
building up here it's a lot safer than

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.460 
building up here it's a lot safer than
waiting<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.300> ground<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.930> hoping<00:00:22.410> that

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
waiting on the ground and hoping that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.990 
waiting on the ground and hoping that
they'll<00:00:22.680> transform<00:00:23.220> before<00:00:23.400> they<00:00:23.609> kill<00:00:23.850> you

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
they'll transform before they kill you

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.359

there's also a chance that he'll drop a
unique<00:02:17.450> head<00:02:17.810> but<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.280> chances<00:02:19.760> are

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
unique head but the chances are

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.150 
unique head but the chances are
extremely<00:02:20.450> slim<00:02:20.810> since<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.350> takes<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:21.890> long<00:02:21.920> to

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
extremely slim since it takes so long to

extremely slim since it takes so long to
spawn<00:02:22.610> I'm<00:02:23.030> not<00:02:23.300> even<00:02:23.450> gonna<00:02:23.540> try<00:02:23.810> but<00:02:25.510> if<00:02:26.510> you
