00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
local hardware store I have two

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.700 
local hardware store I have two
different<00:00:18.180> types<00:00:18.359> but<00:00:18.660> they're<00:00:19.080> both<00:00:19.230> halogen

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
different types but they're both halogen

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.710 
different types but they're both halogen
lights<00:00:19.890> they<00:00:20.340> provide<00:00:20.640> me<00:00:20.850> with<00:00:20.970> bare-bones

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
lights they provide me with bare-bones

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.660 
lights they provide me with bare-bones
continuous<00:00:22.529> light<00:00:22.769> I've<00:00:23.100> talked<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
continuous light I've talked about the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.580 
continuous light I've talked about the
benefits<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:24.180> continuous<00:00:24.720> light<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.199> my<00:00:25.320> video

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
benefits of continuous light in my video

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.920 
benefits of continuous light in my video
on<00:00:25.830> fluorescent<00:00:26.430> continuous<00:00:26.970> lights<00:00:27.180> but

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
on fluorescent continuous lights but

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.630 
on fluorescent continuous lights but
basically<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.830> biggest<00:00:29.189> benefit<00:00:29.609> of

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
basically the biggest benefit of

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.429 
basically the biggest benefit of
continuous<00:00:30.179> light<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:31.050> see<00:00:31.260> how

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
continuous light is that you can see how

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.810 
continuous light is that you can see how
your<00:00:31.590> light<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.949> affecting<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.550> scene

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
your light is affecting your scene

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.150 
your light is affecting your scene
without<00:00:33.059> ever<00:00:33.450> taking<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.960> photo<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.980> move

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
without ever taking a photo as you move

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.709 
without ever taking a photo as you move
the<00:00:35.280> lights<00:00:35.460> around<00:00:35.760> or<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.300> subject

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the lights around or as your subject

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.660 
the lights around or as your subject
moves<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.290> immediately<00:00:37.770> see<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> effects

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
moves you immediately see the effects

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.850 
moves you immediately see the effects
continuous<00:00:39.660> lights<00:00:39.870> are<00:00:40.110> also<00:00:40.379> good<00:00:40.710> for

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
continuous lights are also good for

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.740 
continuous lights are also good for
video<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.610> actually<00:00:41.940> why<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> initially

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
video it's actually why I initially

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.450 
video it's actually why I initially
purchased<00:00:43.140> these<00:00:43.260> lights<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.010> use<00:00:44.250> them

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
purchased these lights was to use them

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.430 
purchased these lights was to use them
to<00:00:44.670> light<00:00:44.850> my<00:00:45.000> videos<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> could<00:00:46.110> say<00:00:46.289> that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
to light my videos now I could say that

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.229 
to light my videos now I could say that
these<00:00:46.559> are<00:00:46.620> bare-bones<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.000> mean

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
these are bare-bones and I do mean

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.510 
these are bare-bones and I do mean
bare-bones<00:00:48.719> there<00:00:49.500> isn't<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> lot<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.430> on

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
bare-bones there isn't a lot going on

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.930 
bare-bones there isn't a lot going on
here

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
here

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.520 
here
there<00:00:51.270> isn't<00:00:51.420> much<00:00:51.600> variability<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
there isn't much variability in the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.799 
there isn't much variability in the
output<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.370> ways<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.180> adjust<00:00:54.600> them

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
output but the ways you can adjust them

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.779 
output but the ways you can adjust them
are<00:00:55.020> by<00:00:55.289> either<00:00:55.500> turning<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.430> both<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
are by either turning one or both of the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.090 
are by either turning one or both of the
light<00:00:57.000> heads<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.449> or<00:00:57.750> off<00:00:57.870> by<00:00:58.440> raising<00:00:58.800> or

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
light heads on or off by raising or

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.130 
light heads on or off by raising or
lowering<00:00:59.160> light<00:00:59.789> stands<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.510> by<00:01:00.660> adjusting

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
lowering light stands or by adjusting

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.930 
lowering light stands or by adjusting
the<00:01:01.260> angle<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> light<00:01:02.039> heads<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.579> by

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the angle of the light heads or by

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
the angle of the light heads or by
turning<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> light<00:01:03.510> stands<00:01:03.750> around<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.680> can

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
turning the light stands around you can

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.620 
turning the light stands around you can
even<00:01:05.040> also<00:01:05.369> take<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:05.909> off<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> light

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
even also take them off of the light

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.390 
even also take them off of the light
stands<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.200> set<00:01:07.470> them<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> ground<00:01:08.010> with

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
stands and set them on the ground with

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.130 
stands and set them on the ground with
traditional<00:01:08.939> studio<00:01:09.180> lights<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.930> often

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
traditional studio lights you can often

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.230 
traditional studio lights you can often
add<00:01:10.409> modifiers<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.820> change<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
add modifiers so that you can change the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
add modifiers so that you can change the
character<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> light<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.229> where<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
character of the light or where the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.100 
character of the light or where the
light<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.220> headed<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.850> your<00:01:14.880> scene<00:01:15.299> however

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
light is headed in your scene however

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.109 
light is headed in your scene however
these<00:01:16.710> lights<00:01:17.009> aren't<00:01:17.310> built<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.549> modifiers

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
these lights aren't built for modifiers

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.210 
these lights aren't built for modifiers
and<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.600> run<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:19.140> hot<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.830> really

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and they run very hot so you really

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.859 
and they run very hot so you really
can't<00:01:20.430> make<00:01:20.640> any<00:01:20.820> modifiers<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.630> them

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
can't make any modifiers for them

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.679 
can't make any modifiers for them
without<00:01:22.439> causing<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.040> severe<00:01:23.640> fire<00:01:24.030> hazard<00:01:24.479> but

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
without causing a severe fire hazard but

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.810 
without causing a severe fire hazard but
that's<00:01:25.200> okay<00:01:25.500> because<00:01:25.740> all<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.340> adds<00:01:26.549> up<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
that's okay because all that adds up to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
that's okay because all that adds up to
harsh<00:01:27.390> light<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> sweet<00:01:28.409> spot<00:01:28.680> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
harsh light with a sweet spot of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.740 
harsh light with a sweet spot of
edginess<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.549> creativity<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.570> am<00:01:30.689> I

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
edginess and creativity what am I

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.230 
edginess and creativity what am I

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
in front of the light so that it didn't

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.180

catch fire

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.010 
catch fire
the<00:02:36.700> light<00:02:36.880> filtered<00:02:37.330> through<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.540> lace<00:02:37.780> and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
the light filtered through the lace and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.560 
the light filtered through the lace and
created<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.830> pattern<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.490> light<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.030> shadow<00:02:40.300> on

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.670 
me as a subject hand on the wall behind
me<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.510> it's<00:02:43.690> fun<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:44.080> play<00:02:44.200> around<00:02:44.530> with

me so it's fun to play around with

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.890 
me so it's fun to play around with
modifying<00:02:45.250> these<00:02:45.460> lights<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.630> real

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
reason that I like using them is when I

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.350 
reason that I like using them is when I
want<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.600> good<00:02:49.870> hard<00:02:50.620> edged<00:02:50.920> look<00:02:51.310> those<00:02:52.090> times

to<00:03:10.750> create<00:03:11.140> shadow<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:12.250> end<00:03:12.430> result<00:03:12.880> was<00:03:13.180> edgy

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
to create shadow the end result was edgy

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.840 
to create shadow the end result was edgy
and<00:03:13.870> kind<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.380> badass<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:15.430> can<00:03:15.580> get<00:03:15.700> some

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
and kind of badass you can get some

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.520 
and kind of badass you can get some
really<00:03:16.060> cool<00:03:16.360> looks<00:03:16.630> with<00:03:16.780> these<00:03:16.930> lights<00:03:17.170> but

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
really cool looks with these lights but

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.290 
really cool looks with these lights but
let's<00:03:17.739> talk<00:03:17.890> about<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.160> few<00:03:18.300> considerations

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
let's talk about a few considerations

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.449 
let's talk about a few considerations
when<00:03:19.510> using<00:03:19.840> them<00:03:20.020> they<00:03:20.260> do<00:03:20.320> run<00:03:20.680> hot<00:03:20.920> like<00:03:21.340> I

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
when using them they do run hot like I

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.910 
when using them they do run hot like I
mentioned<00:03:21.850> before<00:03:21.880> obviously<00:03:22.860> you'll<00:03:23.860> want

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
mentioned before obviously you'll want

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.740 
mentioned before obviously you'll want
to<00:03:24.100> be<00:03:24.190> careful<00:03:24.370> touching<00:03:24.850> them<00:03:25.000> when<00:03:25.330> making

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
to be careful touching them when making

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.830 
to be careful touching them when making
any<00:03:26.050> adjustments<00:03:26.800> to<00:03:26.890> their<00:03:27.340> positioning<00:03:28.030> but

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
any adjustments to their positioning but

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.500 
any adjustments to their positioning but
they<00:03:29.320> emanate<00:03:29.739> heat<00:03:30.130> too<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:30.730> your<00:03:30.970> subject<00:03:31.390> is

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
they emanate heat too so your subject is

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.479 
they emanate heat too so your subject is
going<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.020> feel<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.290> they<00:03:32.920> will<00:03:33.160> start

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
going to feel it they will start

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.090 
going to feel it they will start
sweating<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:34.150> after<00:03:34.660> a<00:03:34.690> while<00:03:34.959> so<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.650> like

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
sweating it out after a while so I like

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.770 
sweating it out after a while so I like
to<00:03:36.130> take<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.370> break<00:03:36.610> ever<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.180> often<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.630> cool

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
to take a break ever so often to cool

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.110 
to take a break ever so often to cool
down<00:03:38.190> unless<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.340> sweating<00:03:39.670> adds<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:40.030> the

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
down unless the sweating adds to the

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.540 
down unless the sweating adds to the
image<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:41.620> need<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.830> be<00:03:41.920> careful<00:03:42.280> when<00:03:42.400> moving

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
image you need to be careful when moving

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.000 
image you need to be careful when moving
around<00:03:42.910> any<00:03:43.420> type<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.810> studio<00:03:44.200> lighting<00:03:44.470> but

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
around any type of studio lighting but

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.670 
around any type of studio lighting but
I'm<00:03:45.250> extra<00:03:45.970> careful<00:03:46.360> with<00:03:46.450> these<00:03:46.660> they<00:03:47.230> can<00:03:47.500> be

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
I'm extra careful with these they can be

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.650 
I'm extra careful with these they can be
hot<00:03:47.890> if<00:03:48.160> you've<00:03:48.400> recently<00:03:48.700> had<00:03:48.970> them<00:03:49.269> on<00:03:49.390> and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
hot if you've recently had them on and

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.199 
hot if you've recently had them on and
they're<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.650> bit<00:03:50.860> wobbly<00:03:51.100> especially<00:03:51.970> as<00:03:52.090> you

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
they're a bit wobbly especially as you

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.330 
they're a bit wobbly especially as you
increase<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.840> height<00:03:52.989> so<00:03:53.440> be<00:03:53.890> careful

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
increase the height so be careful

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.030 
increase the height so be careful
walking<00:03:54.489> around<00:03:55.030> them<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.540> where<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.620> lay

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
walking around them and where you lay

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.410 
walking around them and where you lay
down<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.250> power<00:03:57.519> cord<00:03:57.880> so<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.120> don't<00:03:58.269> trip

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
down the power cord so you don't trip

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.440 
down the power cord so you don't trip
over<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.130> they're<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.160> bit<00:04:00.340> heavy<00:04:00.550> too<00:04:00.820> when

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
over it and they're a bit heavy too when

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.000 
over it and they're a bit heavy too when
I'm<00:04:01.540> not<00:04:01.690> using<00:04:01.989> them<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.260> like<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.500> lower<00:04:02.800> them

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
I'm not using them I like to lower them

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.740 
I'm not using them I like to lower them
down<00:04:03.160> as<00:04:03.340> much<00:04:03.459> as<00:04:03.670> they<00:04:03.790> go<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.269> wind<00:04:04.510> the

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
down as much as they go and wind the

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.210 
down as much as they go and wind the
cord<00:04:04.989> around<00:04:05.050> them<00:04:05.410> you<00:04:05.620> also<00:04:05.769> have<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.100> wear

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
cord around them you also have to wear

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.830 
cord around them you also have to wear
gloves<00:04:06.519> when<00:04:06.820> you<00:04:06.910> change<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.330> bulbs<00:04:07.600> you

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
gloves when you change the bulbs you

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.949 
gloves when you change the bulbs you
cannot<00:04:08.320> touch<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.769> bulbs<00:04:09.070> ever<00:04:09.420> one<00:04:10.420> because

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
cannot touch the bulbs ever one because

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.660 
cannot touch the bulbs ever one because
they're<00:04:11.440> very<00:04:11.590> hot<00:04:11.860> so<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.250> will<00:04:12.519> burn

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
they're very hot so you will burn

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.610 
they're very hot so you will burn
yourself<00:04:12.850> if<00:04:13.239> they've<00:04:13.420> been<00:04:13.600> on<00:04:13.720> recently<00:04:14.050> but

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
yourself if they've been on recently but

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.099 
yourself if they've been on recently but
also<00:04:14.890> because<00:04:15.489> even<00:04:16.299> if<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.480> lights<00:04:16.690> are<00:04:16.840> cold

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
also because even if the lights are cold

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.320 
also because even if the lights are cold
the<00:04:17.530> oils<00:04:18.070> from<00:04:18.160> your<00:04:18.310> hands<00:04:18.700> will<00:04:18.970> get<00:04:19.090> on<00:04:19.239> the

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
the oils from your hands will get on the

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.390 
the oils from your hands will get on the
bulbs<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:19.810> then<00:04:20.289> you<00:04:20.590> run<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.919> risk<00:04:20.950> of

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
bulbs and then you run the risk of

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.219 
bulbs and then you run the risk of
bulbs<00:04:21.699> actually<00:04:22.210> exploding<00:04:22.750> when<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.050> turn

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
bulbs actually exploding when you turn

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.360 
bulbs actually exploding when you turn
them<00:04:23.410> on<00:04:23.530> of<00:04:23.800> course<00:04:24.130> there<00:04:24.340> are

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
them on of course there are

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.969 
them on of course there are
considerations<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.540> even<00:04:26.199> workarounds<00:04:26.800> when

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
considerations and even workarounds when

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.219 
considerations and even workarounds when
using<00:04:27.160> work<00:04:27.460> lights<00:04:27.759> in<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.090> studio<00:04:28.419> you<00:04:29.080> are

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
using work lights in the studio you are

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.200 
using work lights in the studio you are
repurposing<00:04:30.220> something<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.820> is<00:04:30.940> meant<00:04:31.150> to
