you can use them in conjunction with

you can use them in conjunction with
chords<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:38.800> you<00:00:38.950> already<00:00:39.219> know<00:00:39.640> to<00:00:40.210> add<00:00:40.330> a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
chords that you already know to add a

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.110 
chords that you already know to add a
little<00:00:40.600> bit<00:00:40.780> of<00:00:40.900> color<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:41.920> flavor<00:00:42.340> to<00:00:42.940> your

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.450 
little bit of color and flavor to your
playing<00:00:43.630> so<00:00:43.960> let's<00:00:44.140> take<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.650> look<00:00:44.890> at<00:00:45.010> three<00:00:45.340> of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
playing so let's take a look at three of

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.750 
playing so let's take a look at three of
them<00:00:45.640> now

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.700 

this<00:00:49.760> cord<00:00:50.180> is<00:00:50.300> very<00:00:50.480> similar<00:00:50.900> to<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.200> D<00:00:51.380> chord

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
this cord is very similar to the D chord

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.440 
this cord is very similar to the D chord
except<00:00:52.430> we're<00:00:52.610> going<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:52.790> be<00:00:52.940> putting<00:00:53.270> our

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
except we're going to be putting our

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.720 
except we're going to be putting our
little<00:00:53.750> finger<00:00:54.020> down<00:00:54.440> at<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.950> third<00:00:55.220> fret<00:00:55.580> on

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
little finger down at the third fret on

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.450 
little finger down at the third fret on
the<00:00:55.820> first<00:00:56.420> string<00:00:56.690> for<00:00:57.470> that<00:00:57.500> suspended

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
the first string for that suspended

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.180 
the first string for that suspended
sound<00:00:59.090> let's<00:01:00.020> just<00:01:00.260> check<00:01:00.470> strings

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
sound let's just check strings

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.160 
sound let's just check strings
separately

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
separately

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.960 
separately
all<00:01:03.680> clear<00:01:03.980> notes<00:01:04.280> and

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
all clear notes and

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.540 
all clear notes and
there<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.690> go<00:01:06.810> should<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.440> fairly<00:01:07.650> easy<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.340> get

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
there we go should be fairly easy to get

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.160 
there we go should be fairly easy to get
this<00:01:08.670> call<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.210> already<00:01:09.420> play<00:01:09.660> a<00:01:09.780> D

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
this call if you can already play a D

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.770 
this call if you can already play a D
chord<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:11.370> also<00:01:11.610> probably<00:01:12.090> worth<00:01:12.330> holding

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
chord it's also probably worth holding

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.930 
chord it's also probably worth holding
down<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.020> note<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.010> second<00:01:14.400> finger<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
down that note the second finger on the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.850 
down that note the second finger on the
first<00:01:15.270> string<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.960> would<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.470> D<00:01:16.680> chord

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
first string like you would in a D chord

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800 
first string like you would in a D chord
even<00:01:17.070> though<00:01:17.160> you're<00:01:17.340> not<00:01:17.460> using<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.030> mode

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
even though you're not using that mode

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.350 
even though you're not using that mode
in<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.170> sus<00:01:19.380> four<00:01:19.680> chord<00:01:19.980> just<00:01:20.550> because<00:01:20.850> very

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
in the sus four chord just because very

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.840 
in the sus four chord just because very
often<00:01:21.780> you're<00:01:21.960> gonna<00:01:22.080> follow<00:01:22.410> the<00:01:22.950> D<00:01:23.130> sus<00:01:23.460> form

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
often you're gonna follow the D sus form

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.360 
often you're gonna follow the D sus form
with<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.680> regular<00:01:25.680> D<00:01:25.830> chord

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.550

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
to play the a sus 4 chord we can just

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.190 
to play the a sus 4 chord we can just
take<00:01:33.740> our<00:01:34.010> regular<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.970> move<00:01:35.690> our<00:01:35.900> third

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
take our regular a and move our third

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.590 
take our regular a and move our third
finger<00:01:36.500> one<00:01:37.010> fret<00:01:37.430> higher<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.240> it's<00:01:38.390> now

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
finger one fret higher so it's now

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.020 
finger one fret higher so it's now
playing<00:01:38.930> at<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.170> 3rd<00:01:39.470> fret<00:01:39.830> on<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.550> second

playing at the 3rd fret on the second

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.700 
playing at the 3rd fret on the second
string<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:42.050> might<00:01:42.080> just<00:01:42.440> want<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.619> adjust

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
string you might just want to adjust

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.770 
string you might just want to adjust
your<00:01:43.010> other<00:01:43.220> fingers<00:01:43.640> slightly<00:01:44.060> as<00:01:44.330> well<00:01:44.540> so

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
your other fingers slightly as well so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.719 
your other fingers slightly as well so
we<00:01:44.900> get<00:01:45.080> nice<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.350> close<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.130> frets<00:01:46.400> and

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
we get nice and close to the frets and

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.300 
we get nice and close to the frets and
there's<00:01:46.880> no<00:01:47.000> chance<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.509> any<00:01:47.630> Buzzy's<00:01:48.380> then

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
there's no chance of any Buzzy's then

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.640 
there's no chance of any Buzzy's then
we're<00:01:49.610> going<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.790> test<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.720> strings<00:01:51.050> one<00:01:51.470> at<00:01:51.619> a

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
we're going to test the strings one at a

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
we're going to test the strings one at a
time

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.570 

she'd<00:01:55.270> have<00:01:55.420> five<00:01:55.689> clear<00:01:56.110> notes<00:01:56.650> and<00:01:56.950> strum

she'd have five clear notes and strum

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.810 
she'd have five clear notes and strum
the<00:01:57.759> chord

finally we come on to the e sus4 chord

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.620 
finally we come on to the e sus4 chord
if<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.220> hold<00:02:08.399> down<00:02:08.550> your<00:02:08.789> normal<00:02:09.420> II

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630

you<00:02:36.060> like<00:02:36.210> which<00:02:36.450> would<00:02:36.600> be<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.990> play<00:02:37.200> like

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
you like which would be to play like

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.070 
you like which would be to play like
this<00:02:38.010> kind<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:38.820> an<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.210> chord<00:02:39.600> but<00:02:39.900> with

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
this kind of like an a chord but with

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.500 
this kind of like an a chord but with
everything<00:02:40.590> moved<00:02:41.070> up<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.550> string<00:02:42.120> towards

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510

the<00:02:43.080> ceiling<00:02:46.130> exactly<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.220> same<00:02:47.430> sound<00:02:47.610> don't

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
the ceiling exactly the same sound don't

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.460 
the ceiling exactly the same sound don't
really<00:02:48.150> recommend<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.690> way<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.020> doing<00:02:49.320> it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
really recommend this way of doing it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.760 
really recommend this way of doing it
just<00:02:49.620> because<00:02:50.250> E<00:02:50.730> sus4<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:52.080> often<00:02:52.410> followed<00:02:52.740> by

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
just because E sus4 is often followed by

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.070 
just because E sus4 is often followed by
the<00:02:53.010> E<00:02:53.430> chord<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.180> makes<00:02:54.390> sense<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.930> do<00:02:55.050> it

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
the E chord and it makes sense to do it

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.590 
the E chord and it makes sense to do it
this<00:02:55.290> way<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.830> then<00:02:55.950> all<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.060> have<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.300> do<00:02:57.420> to

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
this way and then all you have to do to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.390 
this way and then all you have to do to
get<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.930> an<00:02:58.020> E<00:02:58.110> chord<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.650> take<00:02:58.860> off<00:02:59.070> your

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
get to an E chord is to take off your

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.300 
get to an E chord is to take off your
little<00:02:59.640> finger

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.200 

you're<00:03:04.310> gonna<00:03:04.400> want<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.610> have<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.760> good<00:03:04.880> mess

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
you're gonna want to have a good mess

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.540 
you're gonna want to have a good mess
around<00:03:05.360> with<00:03:05.690> these<00:03:05.900> sus4<00:03:06.500> cords<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.400> good

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
around with these sus4 cords a good

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.030 
around with these sus4 cords a good
starting<00:03:08.030> point<00:03:08.330> would<00:03:08.480> be<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.720> play<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.770> sus4

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
starting point would be to play the sus4

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.250 
starting point would be to play the sus4
cord<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:10.970> then<00:03:11.060> follow<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:11.540> by<00:03:11.900> its

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
cord and then follow it by its

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.370 
cord and then follow it by its

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
could play a bar of D sus 4 followed by

fingering for the a sus 4 instead of

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.920 
fingering for the a sus 4 instead of
playing<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:09.069> 3rd<00:04:09.790> fret<00:04:10.150> on<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:10.420> second

string with your third finger you could

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.759 
string with your third finger you could
always<00:04:12.909> just<00:04:13.150> put<00:04:13.420> down<00:04:13.689> your<00:04:13.930> little<00:04:14.139> finger

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769

to play that note and suppose that makes

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.379 
to play that note and suppose that makes
it<00:04:20.320> slightly<00:04:20.739> easier<00:04:21.370> when<00:04:21.639> changing<00:04:22.180> back

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
it slightly easier when changing back

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.960 
it slightly easier when changing back
and<00:04:22.419> forth<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.919> chord<00:04:24.490> in<00:04:24.729> that<00:04:24.850> you

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
and forth to the a chord in that you

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.379 
and forth to the a chord in that you
just<00:04:25.120> have<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.360> put<00:04:25.690> down<00:04:25.960> or<00:04:26.199> lift<00:04:26.410> off<00:04:26.620> your

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
just have to put down or lift off your

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.810 
just have to put down or lift off your
finger<00:04:28.560> personally<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.740> find<00:04:30.070> that<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.460> bit

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
finger personally I find that a bit

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.150 
finger personally I find that a bit
awkward<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.449> prefer<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.110> use<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.650> 3rd<00:04:32.889> finger

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
awkward and prefer to use the 3rd finger

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.800 
awkward and prefer to use the 3rd finger
but<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:33.550> might<00:04:33.820> want<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.060> have<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.210> play<00:04:34.720> around

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
but you might want to have a play around

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.719 
but you might want to have a play around
with<00:04:35.080> that<00:04:35.259> alternative<00:04:35.979> way<00:04:36.160> of<00:04:36.280> doing<00:04:36.490> it<00:04:36.580> as

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
with that alternative way of doing it as

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.219 
with that alternative way of doing it as
well<00:04:38.160> now<00:04:39.160> another<00:04:40.060> thing<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:40.570> could<00:04:40.870> try

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
well now another thing you could try

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.379 
well now another thing you could try
with<00:04:41.530> these<00:04:41.710> sus<00:04:42.130> chords<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:42.729> to<00:04:42.940> throw<00:04:43.180> them

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
with these sus chords is to throw them

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.360 
with these sus chords is to throw them
in<00:04:43.570> to<00:04:43.990> some<00:04:44.500> of<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.710> songs<00:04:44.979> that<00:04:45.130> we've

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
in to some of the songs that we've

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.770 
in to some of the songs that we've
already<00:04:45.699> looked<00:04:46.150> at<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:48.090> often<00:04:49.090> it's<00:04:49.360> gonna

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
already looked at and often it's gonna

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.270 
already looked at and often it's gonna
sound<00:04:50.020> really<00:04:50.470> good<00:04:50.680> particularly<00:04:51.130> if<00:04:51.190> you've

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
sound really good particularly if you've

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.909 
sound really good particularly if you've
got<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.610> bar<00:04:51.849> or<00:04:52.060> two<00:04:52.270> on<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.930> same<00:04:53.199> chord<00:04:53.710> you

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
got a bar or two on the same chord you

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.040 
got a bar or two on the same chord you
can<00:04:53.979> try<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.430> throw<00:04:54.669> in<00:04:54.849> the<00:04:55.060> sus<00:04:55.389> chord<00:04:55.750> and

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
can try and throw in the sus chord and

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.080 
can try and throw in the sus chord and
it<00:04:56.199> will<00:04:56.320> add<00:04:56.440> a<00:04:56.470> bit<00:04:56.919> of<00:04:56.979> extra<00:04:57.340> color<00:04:57.759> and

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
it will add a bit of extra color and

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.050 
it will add a bit of extra color and
flavor<00:04:58.960> won't<00:04:59.770> always<00:04:59.979> work<00:05:00.160> but<00:05:00.639> more<00:05:00.880> often

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
flavor won't always work but more often

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.810 
flavor won't always work but more often
than<00:05:01.330> not<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.750> will<00:05:01.919> let<00:05:02.919> me<00:05:02.949> give<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.580> an

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
than not it will let me give you an

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.620 
than not it will let me give you an
example<00:05:04.240> we<00:05:04.539> looked<00:05:04.990> at<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.770> Wilko<00:05:06.130> song

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
example we looked at the Wilko song

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.100 
example we looked at the Wilko song
California<00:05:07.630> stars<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.229> that<00:05:08.320> went<00:05:08.590> G

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
California stars and that went G

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.629 
California stars and that went G
two<00:05:10.740> vials

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
two vials

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.320 
two vials
then<00:05:13.180> we<00:05:13.270> had<00:05:13.360> two<00:05:13.569> bars<00:05:13.780> of<00:05:13.900> D<00:05:14.849> what<00:05:15.849> about<00:05:16.060> if

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
then we had two bars of D what about if

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.399 
then we had two bars of D what about if
we<00:05:16.449> went<00:05:16.659> these<00:05:17.259> as<00:05:17.560> four<00:05:18.629> on<00:05:19.629> the<00:05:19.840> second<00:05:20.229> bar

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
we went these as four on the second bar

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.120 
we went these as four on the second bar
you're<00:05:21.129> going<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.340> see

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.950 

come<00:05:24.610> back<00:05:24.730> the<00:05:24.940> gym

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
come back the gym

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.650 
come back the gym
so<00:05:27.560> just<00:05:27.770> on<00:05:27.889> the<00:05:28.070> second<00:05:28.520> bar<00:05:28.729> I<00:05:29.180> go<00:05:29.600> around

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
so just on the second bar I go around

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.900 
so just on the second bar I go around
again<00:05:29.930> second<00:05:30.500> bar<00:05:30.710> of<00:05:30.860> D

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
again second bar of D

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:43.910 
again second bar of D
throwing<00:05:33.570> a<00:05:33.660> D<00:05:33.810> star<00:05:34.110> sport<00:05:34.770> there<00:05:35.760> we<00:05:35.850> go

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.210 

I<00:05:45.020> think<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.140> works<00:05:46.380> really<00:05:46.590> well<00:05:46.830> it<00:05:47.040> just

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
I think that works really well it just

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.310 
I think that works really well it just
adds<00:05:47.400> a<00:05:47.520> little<00:05:47.640> bit<00:05:47.760> of<00:05:47.970> interest<00:05:48.570> and<00:05:48.810> extra

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
adds a little bit of interest and extra

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.520 
adds a little bit of interest and extra
flavor<00:05:49.590> at<00:05:49.980> that<00:05:50.190> point<00:05:50.670> in<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:51.390> song<00:05:51.660> so<00:05:51.900> have

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
flavor at that point in the song so have

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.410 
flavor at that point in the song so have
a<00:05:52.560> play<00:05:52.980> around<00:05:53.220> with<00:05:53.460> that<00:05:53.700> you'll<00:05:53.880> find<00:05:54.180> that

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
a play around with that you'll find that

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.630 
a play around with that you'll find that
that<00:05:54.840> works<00:05:55.080> in<00:05:55.290> in<00:05:55.590> lots<00:05:55.830> of<00:05:55.980> songs<00:05:56.280> you<00:05:56.490> can

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
that works in in lots of songs you can

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.300 
that works in in lots of songs you can
just<00:05:56.820> throw<00:05:57.030> in<00:05:57.180> a<00:05:57.390> sus<00:05:57.600> 4<00:05:57.900> chord<00:05:58.310> sometimes

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
just throw in a sus 4 chord sometimes

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.100 
just throw in a sus 4 chord sometimes
for<00:05:59.490> a<00:05:59.520> whole<00:05:59.730> bar<00:05:59.940> like<00:06:00.210> that<00:06:00.420> sometimes<00:06:00.840> just

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
for a whole bar like that sometimes just

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.020 
for a whole bar like that sometimes just
for<00:06:01.170> a<00:06:01.350> beat<00:06:01.590> or<00:06:01.830> half<00:06:02.100> a<00:06:02.280> beat<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:02.700> it<00:06:02.820> works

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
for a beat or half a beat and it works

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.830 
for a beat or half a beat and it works
really<00:06:03.300> well<00:06:04.610> anyway<00:06:05.610> I<00:06:05.640> think<00:06:05.790> that's<00:06:06.120> it<00:06:06.420> for

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
really well anyway I think that's it for

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.560
