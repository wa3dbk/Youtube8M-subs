00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
what's pretty funny we all left and so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.420 
what's pretty funny we all left and so
yeah<00:02:17.540> it's<00:02:17.720> just<00:02:17.810> like<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.739> mean<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:19.310> not

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
yeah it's just like I mean it's not

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.280 
yeah it's just like I mean it's not
tanking<00:02:19.910> spanked<00:02:20.209> but<00:02:20.419> I<00:02:20.480> mean<00:02:20.690> just<00:02:20.959> do<00:02:21.169> your

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
tanking spanked but I mean just do your

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.839 
tanking spanked but I mean just do your
DPS<00:02:21.739> stuff<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.370> uh

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
DPS stuff and uh

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.720 
DPS stuff and uh
if<00:02:22.969> your<00:02:23.180> tank<00:02:23.390> can<00:02:23.629> hold<00:02:23.659> a<00:02:24.019> grow<00:02:24.730> shouldn't

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
if your tank can hold a grow shouldn't

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.229 
if your tank can hold a grow shouldn't
be<00:02:25.790> any<00:02:25.909> issues<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:27.879> there<00:02:28.879> will<00:02:28.999> be<00:02:29.030> another

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
be any issues and there will be another

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.449 
be any issues and there will be another
trick<00:02:29.810> when<00:02:30.349> you<00:02:30.469> reach<00:02:30.680> right<00:02:31.189> now<00:02:31.310> actually

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
trick when you reach right now actually

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.280 
trick when you reach right now actually
was<00:02:31.760> trying<00:02:31.909> to<00:02:32.060> cast<00:02:32.299> as<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.480> wipe<00:02:32.749> ability

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
was trying to cast as the wipe ability

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.890 
was trying to cast as the wipe ability
that<00:02:33.469> we<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:33.799> interrupted<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:35.569> looks<00:02:35.719> like<00:02:35.870> a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
that we just interrupted it looks like a

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.640 
that we just interrupted it looks like a
purplish<00:02:36.499> icon<00:02:37.269> but<00:02:38.269> um<00:02:38.450> once<00:02:39.079> you<00:02:39.290> reach<00:02:39.469> like

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
purplish icon but um once you reach like

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.259 
purplish icon but um once you reach like
a<00:02:39.709> very<00:02:39.980> low<00:02:40.159> percentage<00:02:40.340> it's<00:02:40.849> like<00:02:40.939> 10

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
a very low percentage it's like 10

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.179 
a very low percentage it's like 10
percent<00:02:41.540> or<00:02:41.629> lower<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:41.930> think<00:02:42.200> depends<00:02:43.069> of<00:02:43.159> your

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
percent or lower I think depends of your

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.789 
percent or lower I think depends of your
DPS<00:02:43.609> and<00:02:43.639> your<00:02:43.849> group<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:45.139> at<00:02:45.290> least

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
DPS and your group for that at least

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.209 
DPS and your group for that at least
but<00:02:46.010> um<00:02:46.219> he's<00:02:46.939> gonna<00:02:47.170> like<00:02:48.170> start<00:02:48.469> force

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:49.219 
but um he's gonna like start force

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:50.619 
but um he's gonna like start force
fighting<00:02:49.489> people<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.239> he's<00:02:50.359> going<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.540> be

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
fighting people and he's going to be

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.809 
fighting people and he's going to be
immune<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:50.989> all<00:02:51.200> damage<00:02:51.650> what<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.400> need<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.669> do

immune to all damage what you need to do

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.539 
immune to all damage what you need to do
is<00:02:53.169> knock<00:02:54.169> him<00:02:54.409> like<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:54.950> need<00:02:55.189> to<00:02:55.280> bring<00:02:55.459> him

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:32.509 
her ex fights are pretty easy for the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.179

all so I won't worry too much about the

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.469 
all so I won't worry too much about the
distant<00:03:44.060> counter<00:03:44.709> so<00:03:45.709> right<00:03:46.280> now<00:03:46.400> we<00:03:46.459> push<00:03:47.120> DPS

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
distant counter so right now we push DPS

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.119 
distant counter so right now we push DPS
a<00:03:47.509> bit<00:03:47.750> too<00:03:47.870> much<00:03:48.019> compared<00:03:48.500> for<00:03:48.680> like<00:03:48.859> the

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
a bit too much compared for like the

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.399 
a bit too much compared for like the
gear<00:03:49.310> we<00:03:49.430> had<00:03:49.609> so<00:03:49.909> it<00:03:50.419> didn't<00:03:50.930> have<00:03:51.079> time<00:03:51.349> to

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
gear we had so it didn't have time to

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.159 
gear we had so it didn't have time to
like<00:03:51.949> force<00:03:52.370> me<00:03:53.180> whenever<00:03:53.389> actually<00:03:53.959> force

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
group my team and like having me fight

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:57.960 
group my team and like having me fight
him<00:03:56.509> alone<00:03:56.599> so<00:03:56.750> he's<00:03:56.959> doing<00:03:57.049> it<00:03:57.290> right<00:03:57.319> now

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970
