Walgreens so that is an extra one all

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.229 
Walgreens so that is an extra one all
right<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.230> Batman<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.609> I<00:03:02.700> believe<00:03:03.030> this

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
right this is Batman and I believe this

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.319 
right this is Batman and I believe this
is<00:03:03.450> number<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.920> set<00:03:05.160> it's<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.120> pretty

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
is number one in the set it's a pretty

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.720 
is number one in the set it's a pretty
decent<00:03:06.750> figure<00:03:06.989> charger<00:03:07.739> invulnerability

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
decent figure charger invulnerability

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.690 
decent figure charger invulnerability
and<00:03:09.180> perplex<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.739> Dom<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:11.519> have<00:03:11.670> a

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
and perplex and and Dom so we have a

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.979 
and perplex and and Dom so we have a
patent<00:03:12.120> in<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.420> starts<00:03:12.660> off<00:03:12.810> with

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
patent in that starts off with

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.830 
patent in that starts off with
invulnerability<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:15.180> that's<00:03:15.390> pretty

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
invulnerability so that's pretty

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.479 
invulnerability so that's pretty
interesting<00:03:15.959> it's<00:03:16.680> got<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.890> Batman<00:03:17.190> ta<00:03:17.370> so

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
interesting it's got the Batman ta so

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.020 
interesting it's got the Batman ta so
it's<00:03:17.819> got<00:03:17.970> stuff<00:03:18.500> that's<00:03:19.500> pretty<00:03:19.709> cool<00:03:20.030> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
it's got stuff that's pretty cool the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.720 
it's got stuff that's pretty cool the
only<00:03:21.209> thing<00:03:21.389> I<00:03:21.480> don't<00:03:21.540> like<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.650> we<00:03:23.489> have

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
only thing I don't like is that we have

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.650 
only thing I don't like is that we have
a<00:03:23.910> lot<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.569> Batman<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:26.090> like<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.209> bunch<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.510> them

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
a lot of Batman and like a bunch of them

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.259 
a lot of Batman and like a bunch of them
will<00:03:27.780> have<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.079> same<00:03:28.290> sculpt<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.099> this<00:03:29.730> one<00:03:30.030> I

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
will have the same sculpt so this one I

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.690 
will have the same sculpt so this one I
think<00:03:30.329> is<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.750> same<00:03:30.930> sculpt<00:03:31.349> as<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:32.160> one<00:03:32.370> from

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
think is the same sculpt as the one from

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.670 
think is the same sculpt as the one from
the<00:03:32.910> target<00:03:33.269> one<00:03:33.480> that<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.750> got<00:03:33.900> from<00:03:34.079> Walgreens

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
the target one that I got from Walgreens

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.039 
the target one that I got from Walgreens

sets<00:04:15.919> okay<00:04:16.919> here<00:04:17.130> we<00:04:17.250> go<00:04:17.280> we<00:04:17.579> have<00:04:17.609> Bane<00:04:18.090> this

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
sets okay here we go we have Bane this

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.839 
sets okay here we go we have Bane this
is<00:04:18.660> actually<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.199> Bane<00:04:19.349> from<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.650> set<00:04:19.889> the

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
is actually the Bane from the set the

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.219 
is actually the Bane from the set the
main<00:04:21.000> set<00:04:21.269> so<00:04:21.510> he's<00:04:21.690> got<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.930> little<00:04:22.049> bit

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
main set so he's got a little bit

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.690 
main set so he's got a little bit
different<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:22.680> think<00:04:22.860> this<00:04:23.039> one<00:04:23.219> starts<00:04:23.580> off

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
different I think this one starts off

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.959 
different I think this one starts off
with<00:04:24.000> an<00:04:24.180> 18<00:04:24.599> boner<00:04:25.140> ability<00:04:25.650> with<00:04:26.400> charge<00:04:26.760> I

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:26.969 
with an 18 boner ability with charge I

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:27.760 
with an 18 boner ability with charge I
believe

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
believe

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.589 
believe
so<00:04:28.770> that's<00:04:28.949> pretty<00:04:29.190> cool<00:04:29.789> different<00:04:30.300> dial<00:04:30.449> and

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
so that's pretty cool different dial and

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:35.149 
so that's pretty cool different dial and
he's<00:04:30.690> more<00:04:31.050> expensive<00:04:33.620> okay<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:34.680> here's<00:04:35.099> the

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 
he's more expensive okay so here's the

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:37.490 
he's more expensive okay so here's the
Joker<00:04:35.580> as<00:04:35.849> the<00:04:36.120> sergeant<00:04:36.720> this<00:04:37.139> is<00:04:37.199> a<00:04:37.319> non

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
Joker as the sergeant this is a non

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.170 
Joker as the sergeant this is a non
figure<00:04:37.800> that<00:04:37.949> I<00:04:38.009> really<00:04:38.430> wanted<00:04:38.729> because<00:04:39.120> he

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
figure that I really wanted because he

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.529
