mid-june and mid July and goes through a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.049 
mid-june and mid July and goes through a
big<00:00:33.660> rally<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.530> mathematically<00:00:35.160> odds<00:00:35.640> favor

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
big rally so mathematically odds favor

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.110 
big rally so mathematically odds favor
that<00:00:36.630> were<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.020> trough<00:00:37.410> period

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
that were in that trough period

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.310 
that were in that trough period
interesting<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.390> seem<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.870> stuck<00:00:40.110> in

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
interesting so we seem to be stuck in

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.799 
interesting so we seem to be stuck in
this<00:00:40.440> range<00:00:40.739> right<00:00:41.040> now<00:00:41.070> 1180<00:00:41.879> 1190<00:00:42.629> what

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
this range right now 1180 1190 what

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.240 
this range right now 1180 1190 what
would<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> take<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.230> break<00:00:43.530> out<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:44.010> Frank

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
would it take to break out of it Frank

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.330 
would it take to break out of it Frank
Oh<00:00:44.489> some<00:00:45.239> type<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.450> an<00:00:45.660> event<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.039> rates

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
Oh some type of an event of the rates

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.880 
Oh some type of an event of the rates
not<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> rise<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> u.s.<00:00:48.570> until<00:00:49.379> much

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
not going to rise in the u.s. until much

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.700 
not going to rise in the u.s. until much
later<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> year<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.120> happens

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
later in the year and if that happens

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.260 
later in the year and if that happens
rates<00:00:52.710> rise<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.219> Europe<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:53.850> don't<00:00:53.969> rise

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
rates rise in Europe and they don't rise

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.750 
rates rise in Europe and they don't rise
in<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> u.s.<00:00:55.020> it'll<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> dollar<00:00:55.890> factor<00:00:56.399> but

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
in the u.s. it'll be a dollar factor but

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.639 
in the u.s. it'll be a dollar factor but
i<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> sleeper<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.899> india<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
i think the sleeper is india and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.459 
i think the sleeper is india and
consumption<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.399> india<00:00:59.789> will<00:01:00.329> continue<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.899> be

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
consumption in india will continue to be

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.650 
consumption in india will continue to be
robust<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.609> were<00:01:02.699> commenting<00:01:03.059> about<00:01:03.180> silver

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
robust we were commenting about silver

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.250 
robust we were commenting about silver
as<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.439> consumption<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.979> silver<00:01:05.369> strong<00:01:05.729> i

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
as a consumption of silver strong i

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.399 
as a consumption of silver strong i
think<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> gdp<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.820> india<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.750> turned

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
think that the gdp in in india is turned

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.950 
think that the gdp in in india is turned
is<00:01:10.710> very<00:01:10.920> constructive<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.729> rising<00:01:12.390> gdp<00:01:12.810> per

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
is very constructive and rising gdp per

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.890 
is very constructive and rising gdp per
capita<00:01:12.990> inch<00:01:13.650> india<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.310> very<00:01:15.030> very<00:01:15.330> important

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
capita inch india is very very important

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.690 
capita inch india is very very important
right<00:01:16.140> silver<00:01:16.500> had<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.680> good<00:01:16.920> month<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.280> May<00:01:17.460> up

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
right silver had a good month of May up

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.420 
right silver had a good month of May up
three<00:01:18.060> percent<00:01:18.540> due<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.470> demand<00:01:19.920> coming<00:01:20.220> out

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
three percent due to demand coming out

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730 
three percent due to demand coming out
of<00:01:20.460> India<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> India<00:01:22.140> shifting<00:01:22.590> more

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
of India is a India shifting more

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.310 
of India is a India shifting more
towards<00:01:23.189> silver<00:01:23.549> away<00:01:23.820> from<00:01:24.060> gold<00:01:24.330> Frank<00:01:24.630> no<00:01:25.290> I

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
towards silver away from gold Frank no I

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.719 
towards silver away from gold Frank no I
don't<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.950> i<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.220> there's<00:01:26.549> also

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
don't think so i think there's also

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.510 
don't think so i think there's also
tight<00:01:27.060> demand<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.810> silver<00:01:28.530> for<00:01:28.860> solar<00:01:29.100> panels

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
tight demand for silver for solar panels

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.819 
tight demand for silver for solar panels
and<00:01:29.610> there's<00:01:29.790> been<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.180> many<00:01:30.329> solar<00:01:30.750> deals<00:01:31.170> so

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and there's been so many solar deals so

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.310 
and there's been so many solar deals so
they're<00:01:31.979> improving<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.610> crystal<00:01:33.000> technology

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
they're improving the crystal technology

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.200 
they're improving the crystal technology
making<00:01:34.400> electrical<00:01:35.400> energy<00:01:35.610> much<00:01:36.000> more

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
making electrical energy much more

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.200 
making electrical energy much more
efficient<00:01:36.829> coming<00:01:37.829> from<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> Sun<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> they

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
efficient coming from the Sun but I they

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.700 
efficient coming from the Sun but I they
need<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> lot<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.570> silver<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.380> right<00:01:40.530> let's

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
need a lot of silver all right let's

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.109 
need a lot of silver all right let's
talk<00:01:40.829> about<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.189> two<00:01:41.340> news<00:01:41.579> items<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.970> could

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
talk about the two news items that could

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
we're going to get a rate hike and we'll

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.230 
we're going to get a rate hike and we'll
see<00:01:55.110> how<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.320> unfolds<00:01:55.790> but<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:57.090> what's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
see how that unfolds but I think what's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.760 
see how that unfolds but I think what's
important<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.020> depends<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.469> dollar

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
important is it depends what the dollar

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.440 
important is it depends what the dollar
does<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.430> inverse<00:01:59.729> relationship<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.270> so

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
does and the inverse relationship is so

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.780 
does and the inverse relationship is so
important<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.170> recognize<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:02.310> what<00:02:02.460> happened

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
important to recognize but what happened

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.730 
important to recognize but what happened
to<00:02:02.820> Europe<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.780> had<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> big<00:02:04.200> rally<00:02:04.439> in

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
to Europe is that we had a big rally in

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.560 
to Europe is that we had a big rally in
the<00:02:04.860> Europe<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.340> bonds<00:02:05.640> rose<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.119> Germany

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the Europe because bonds rose in Germany

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.479 
the Europe because bonds rose in Germany
and<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.560> made<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> Euro<00:02:08.250> more

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
and and that made the Euro more

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.119 
and and that made the Euro more
attracted<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.179> dollar<00:02:09.500> but<00:02:10.500> i<00:02:10.530> think<00:02:10.830> that

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
attracted to the dollar but i think that

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.940 
attracted to the dollar but i think that
the<00:02:11.730> gdp<00:02:12.180> per<00:02:12.330> inch<00:02:12.629> india<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.290> important

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the gdp per inch india is important

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.160 
the gdp per inch india is important
but<00:02:14.099> so<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.489> China<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.090> every<00:02:15.540> time<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.930> bad

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
but so is China and every time is bad

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.600 
but so is China and every time is bad
news<00:02:16.410> out<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.620> China<00:02:16.950> there's<00:02:17.400> some

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
news out of China there's some

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.759 
news out of China there's some
stimulation<00:02:18.239> taking<00:02:18.720> place<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.170> that's

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
stimulation taking place and that's

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.790 
stimulation taking place and that's
what's<00:02:19.980> key<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.310> see<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.879> gdp<00:02:21.239> per<00:02:21.390> capita

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
what's key to see the gdp per capita

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.990 
what's key to see the gdp per capita
rising<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:22.890> those<00:02:23.040> two<00:02:23.190> countries<00:02:23.370> because

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
rising in those two countries because

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.240 
rising in those two countries because
they<00:02:24.150> love<00:02:24.420> gold<00:02:24.750> all<00:02:25.230> right<00:02:25.410> Greece<00:02:25.739> will<00:02:26.129> we

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
they love gold all right Greece will we

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.640 
they love gold all right Greece will we
see<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> resolution<00:02:26.940> no<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> think<00:02:28.110> Greece<00:02:28.500> is

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
see a resolution no I think Greece is

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.580 
see a resolution no I think Greece is
totally<00:02:29.160> dysfunctional<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:30.360> think<00:02:31.170> it'll<00:02:31.319> have

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
totally dysfunctional I think it'll have

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.670 
totally dysfunctional I think it'll have
a<00:02:31.700> reason<00:02:32.700> for<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.880> spike<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.180> gold<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:34.349> I<00:02:34.410> think

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
a reason for a spike in gold but I think

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.990 
a reason for a spike in gold but I think
it's<00:02:34.800> only<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.130> matter<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.340> time<00:02:35.430> before<00:02:35.700> they

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
it's only a matter of time before they

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.490 
it's only a matter of time before they
leave<00:02:36.209> they<00:02:36.630> just<00:02:36.810> don't<00:02:36.989> have<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.140> reform

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
leave they just don't have the reform

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.250 
leave they just don't have the reform
like<00:02:37.680> Spain<00:02:38.040> Spain's<00:02:38.849> creating<00:02:39.510> jobs<00:02:39.780> fame

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
like Spain Spain's creating jobs fame

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.110 
like Spain Spain's creating jobs fame
has<00:02:40.530> great<00:02:40.890> p.m.<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.370> because<00:02:41.760> they<00:02:41.910> went

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
has great p.m. is because they went

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.880 
has great p.m. is because they went
through<00:02:42.299> a<00:02:42.360> lot<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.599> reform<00:02:43.170> well<00:02:43.739> that's

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
through a lot of reform well that's

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.350 
through a lot of reform well that's
really<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.190> question<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.910> know<00:02:45.000> first

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
really the question you know first

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.900 
really the question you know first
grease<00:02:45.629> then<00:02:45.900> who's<00:02:46.140> next<00:02:46.349> well<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.250> think<00:02:47.610> it's

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
grease then who's next well I think it's

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.059 
grease then who's next well I think it's
who<00:02:48.060> doesn't<00:02:48.390> reform<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.930> next<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.530> that's

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
who doesn't reform is next and that's

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.530 
who doesn't reform is next and that's
the<00:02:50.160> key<00:02:50.370> factor<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:50.970> note<00:02:51.360> your

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
the key factor on that note your

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.199 
the key factor on that note your
touchdown<00:02:51.780> pass<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.440> week<00:02:52.620> Frank<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.209> will
