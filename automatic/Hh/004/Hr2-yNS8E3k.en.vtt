00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:15.699
 the fishing industry 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.699
 is the second most important sector in the economy of Peru 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.659

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.520
 the biggest 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.140
 but I do consider that we are one of the most efficient companies in it 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.630
 by the volume of captures that we can achieve 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.630

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.619

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.429
 in lubricants in the fishing sector due to the so it is of high quality 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.799

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.680
 from experience 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.320

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.630
 when you think about location for the industry think about oils and fats
