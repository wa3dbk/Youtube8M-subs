00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.640
 hello everyone with you billy and the gate of our 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.520
 planet zones are increasingly being set alone and 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.529
 same questions how to play a link which 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.200
 Stage is better to choose and what tactics 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.119
 apply combat and therefore no how a 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.480
 upcoming issues will be devoted to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.430
 It is this topic and so we will start first 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.710
 general information for comfort 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.960
 interaction link is highly desirable 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.300
 have voice communication with your combat 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.850
 mates in this case you will reach 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.079
 better coordination of actions here i can 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.660
 recommend you to use 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.730
 internal voice function either 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.570
 such third-party programs as he sleeps 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.909
 or skype 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.039
 where to find and how to use them I hope 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.320
 understand this release for you 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.899
 The link consisting of 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 three heavy fighters this tactic 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.280
 also works for two strands 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.710
 first you need to evaluate the balance of power 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.530
 both teams and understand which way 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.450
 keep your path 1 goal of your link 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.820
 you so i do must be enemy 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.220
 heavy fighters of the very beginning of the battle 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.890
 lift up nose and including afterburner 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.869
 try to climb as high as possible when 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.149
 you scored the maximum available for that 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.189
 it's time to come to the fight itself 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.950
 immediately need to decide who will 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.979
 take the lead fly have and goals and who 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.259
 the lead task is on the way to indicate the goal 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.689
 which your link should attack 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.240
 English is responsible for this by default. 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.640
 key t as soon as the target mark on 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.070
 fast photo rural three should 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.810
 destroy the touring try to always be 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.570
 at the height in no case 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.450
 sink to the ground and destroy first 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.090
 the most saga flying goal in order to protect 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.820
 yourself from the mind of the zoom so only with strands 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.539
 finished it's time to go to the lungs 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.659
 fighters 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.280
 action is also in the same pattern 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.219
 burzum climb 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.240
 grip 2 tooth climb well and in 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.100
 last turn 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.550
 no longer be a problem that destroyed 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.740
 militants again just as surely this 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.750
 tactic well work on words and when 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.790
 ideal conditions but if constantly 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.800
 practiced or lurked by some 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.560
 same people then I ate will rub 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.230
 This is like a clock, but I hope everything 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.780
 this release was useful with you was billy
