the DIY silhouette or in our dining room

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.220 
the DIY silhouette or in our dining room
I've<00:03:29.829> also<00:03:30.130> used<00:03:30.519> paint<00:03:30.910> fabric<00:03:31.390> decorative

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
I've also used paint fabric decorative

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.000 
I've also used paint fabric decorative
tape<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:33.280> create<00:03:33.489> eye-catching<00:03:34.079> edges<00:03:35.079> this

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
tape to create eye-catching edges this

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.220 
tape to create eye-catching edges this
works<00:03:36.340> best<00:03:36.640> when<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:36.970> naturally<00:03:37.660> see<00:03:37.959> the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
works best when you naturally see the

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.229 
works best when you naturally see the
edge<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.920> piece<00:03:39.160> hanging<00:03:39.790> on<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.030> wall

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
edge of the piece hanging on the wall

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.270 
edge of the piece hanging on the wall
meaning<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.380> see<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.739> from<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:41.950> side

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
meaning you see it from the side

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.360 
meaning you see it from the side
sometimes<00:03:43.030> like<00:03:43.359> in<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.570> hallway<00:03:43.950> stairwell<00:03:44.950> or

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
sometimes like in a hallway stairwell or

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.150 
sometimes like in a hallway stairwell or
maybe<00:03:46.120> when<00:03:46.390> peering<00:03:46.900> in<00:03:47.079> from<00:03:47.410> another<00:03:47.590> room

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
maybe when peering in from another room

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.979 
maybe when peering in from another room
I<00:03:50.100> also<00:03:51.100> believe<00:03:51.609> that<00:03:51.640> every<00:03:52.299> room<00:03:52.510> needs<00:03:52.810> a

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
I also believe that every room needs a

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.680 
I also believe that every room needs a
mirror<00:03:53.459> depending<00:03:54.459> on<00:03:54.489> your<00:03:54.579> style<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.510> may

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
mirror depending on your style you may

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.199 
mirror depending on your style you may
prefer<00:03:56.140> more<00:03:56.500> than<00:03:56.739> one<00:03:56.920> mirror<00:03:57.310> but<00:03:57.790> for<00:03:58.030> me

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
prefer more than one mirror but for me

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.069 
prefer more than one mirror but for me
the<00:03:58.840> right<00:03:59.049> amount<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.530> one<00:04:00.190> per<00:04:00.489> room<00:04:01.079> every

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
the right amount is one per room every

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.960 
the right amount is one per room every
room<00:04:02.319> could<00:04:02.590> benefit<00:04:02.980> from<00:04:03.040> multiplied<00:04:03.700> light

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
room could benefit from multiplied light

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.569 
room could benefit from multiplied light
a<00:04:04.239> mirror<00:04:05.049> can<00:04:05.319> reflect<00:04:05.620> natural<00:04:06.370> or

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
a mirror can reflect natural or

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.059 
a mirror can reflect natural or
artificial<00:04:07.060> light<00:04:07.299> back<00:04:07.690> into<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:08.109> room<00:04:08.380> so

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
even if the mirror is purely decorative

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.370 
even if the mirror is purely decorative
it's<00:04:11.590> serving<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.280> secondary<00:04:12.730> function<00:04:13.380> while
