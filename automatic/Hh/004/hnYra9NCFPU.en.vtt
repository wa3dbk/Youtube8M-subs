what<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.780> think<00:01:55.729> it's<00:01:56.729> got<00:01:56.820> lots<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.060> caffeine

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
what you think it's got lots of caffeine

what you think it's got lots of caffeine
in<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.659> caffeine<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.619> really

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
in it and caffeine is a really really

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
in it and caffeine is a really really
good<00:01:59.100> ingredient<00:01:59.520> provides<00:01:59.790> pretty<00:02:00.240> much<00:02:00.450> in

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
good ingredient provides pretty much in

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.660 
good ingredient provides pretty much in
every<00:02:00.719> eye<00:02:00.869> cream<00:02:01.530> out<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.399> reason

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
every eye cream out there the reason

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.130 
every eye cream out there the reason
being<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.090> constricts<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.540> blood<00:02:03.600> flow<00:02:03.899> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
being it constricts the blood flow and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.050 
being it constricts the blood flow and
it<00:02:04.259> sort<00:02:04.649> reduces<00:02:05.310> puffiness<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.790> makes<00:02:05.939> your

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
it sort reduces puffiness and makes your

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.459 
it sort reduces puffiness and makes your
eyes<00:02:06.180> more<00:02:06.450> awake<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.079> actually<00:02:07.170> feel

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
eyes more awake you can actually feel

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.760 
eyes more awake you can actually feel
your<00:02:07.680> eyes<00:02:07.829> being<00:02:08.550> more<00:02:08.729> alert<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.770> metals

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
your eyes being more alert and metals

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.670 
your eyes being more alert and metals
cold<00:02:11.009> yes<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.360> metal<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.750> cold<00:02:12.989> now

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
cold yes the metal is cold now

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.470 
cold yes the metal is cold now
methylate<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.129> like<00:02:14.280> surgical<00:02:14.579> steel<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.329> it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
methylate is like surgical steel so it's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.580 
methylate is like surgical steel so it's
not<00:02:15.569> going<00:02:15.719> to<00:02:15.780> lose<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.959> shape<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.349> it's<00:02:16.469> not

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
not going to lose the shape and it's not

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.339 
not going to lose the shape and it's not
going<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.799> sort<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.040> drag<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.519> pull<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
going to sort of drag and pull and

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.270 
going to sort of drag and pull and
another<00:02:19.349> thing<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.680> mean<00:02:19.829> this<00:02:19.920> isn't<00:02:20.129> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
another thing I mean this isn't the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.830 
another thing I mean this isn't the
cheapest<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:20.879> out<00:02:21.060> there<00:02:21.239> there<00:02:21.359> are<00:02:21.390> cheaper

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
cheapest one out there there are cheaper

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.990 
cheapest one out there there are cheaper
ones<00:02:22.019> but<00:02:22.439> in<00:02:22.650> my<00:02:22.980> view<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.579> cheap<00:02:23.760> ones

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
ones but in my view the cheap ones

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.459 
ones but in my view the cheap ones
aren't<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.299> good<00:02:24.450> ingredients<00:02:25.079> aren't<00:02:25.260> quite

aren't as good ingredients aren't quite

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.500 
aren't as good ingredients aren't quite
as<00:02:25.560> nice<00:02:25.739> because<00:02:26.519> it's<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:27.000> bit<00:02:27.329> more

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
as nice because it's a bit more

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.729
