00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
joined a game late and I decided to go

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
joined a game late and I decided to go
for<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.720> anyways<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.260> were<00:00:31.410> 14<00:00:31.830> kills<00:00:32.099> behind

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
for it anyways we were 14 kills behind

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.790 
for it anyways we were 14 kills behind
and<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.790> got<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.329> think<00:00:33.510> 18<00:00:33.930> kills<00:00:34.260> which

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
and I got up to I think 18 kills which

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.709 
and I got up to I think 18 kills which
is<00:00:34.950> pretty<00:00:35.340> impressive<00:00:35.550> i<00:00:35.940> think<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.480> i<00:00:36.690> think

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
is pretty impressive i think so i think

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.270 
is pretty impressive i think so i think
with<00:00:37.110> 10<00:00:37.290> kills<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.680> might<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.950> able<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> do

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
with 10 kills we might be able to do

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
with 10 kills we might be able to do
this<00:00:38.399> not<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.059> sure<00:00:39.210> about<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.510> map<00:00:39.719> but

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
couldn't we get switched over quite fast

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.880

enough<00:01:30.950> all<00:01:31.910> right<00:01:32.150> all<00:01:32.630> right<00:01:35.680> one<00:01:36.680> thing<00:01:36.800> I

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
enough all right all right one thing I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.260 
enough all right all right one thing I
actually<00:01:37.010> kind<00:01:37.369> of<00:01:37.490> like<00:01:37.550> is<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.000> fact<00:01:38.030> that

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
actually kind of like is the fact that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.670 
actually kind of like is the fact that
you<00:01:38.390> don't<00:01:38.570> have<00:01:38.780> blast<00:01:39.020> suppressor<00:01:39.440> in<00:01:39.560> this

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
you don't have blast suppressor in this

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.560 
you don't have blast suppressor in this
so<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.310> can<00:01:40.340> kind<00:01:40.640> of<00:01:40.700> draw<00:01:40.850> enemies<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.479> you

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
so you can kind of draw enemies to you

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.550 
so you can kind of draw enemies to you
by<00:01:41.720> boosting<00:01:42.140> Oh<00:01:43.720> sometimes<00:01:44.720> it<00:01:44.960> doesn't<00:01:45.530> work

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
by boosting Oh sometimes it doesn't work

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.109 
by boosting Oh sometimes it doesn't work
out<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:45.920> great<00:01:46.010> for<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.340> though<00:01:46.490> all<00:01:47.000> right

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119
