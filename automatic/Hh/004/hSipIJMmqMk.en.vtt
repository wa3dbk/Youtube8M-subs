it was a very low level 2 &amp; 3 on the
number<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:11.220> divisible<00:03:11.250> by<00:03:12.090> 6<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:14.160> divisible

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
number is divisible by 6 is divisible

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.840 
number is divisible by 6 is divisible

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.039 
levels 2 &amp; 3
what<00:03:17.850> about<00:03:17.970> 420<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.560> number<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:21.420> even

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
what about 420 this number and is even

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.410 
what about 420 this number and is even
because<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.590> ends<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:23.040> 0<00:03:23.400> which<00:03:23.910> means<00:03:24.150> it's

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
because it ends in 0 which means it's

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.289 
because it ends in 0 which means it's
divisible<00:03:24.780> by<00:03:25.140> 2<00:03:25.320> when<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.250> add<00:03:26.489> up<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.730> numbers

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
divisible by 2 when I add up the numbers

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.870 
divisible by 2 when I add up the numbers
4<00:03:27.870> 2<00:03:28.350> &amp;<00:03:28.620> 0<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.950> get<00:03:29.280> 6<00:03:29.610> &amp;<00:03:29.880> 6<00:03:30.209> is<00:03:30.450> divisible<00:03:30.480> by<00:03:31.170> 3<00:03:31.880> so

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
4 2 &amp; 0 I get 6 &amp; 6 is divisible by 3 so

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.310 
4 2 &amp; 0 I get 6 &amp; 6 is divisible by 3 so
that<00:03:33.090> means<00:03:34.100> 420<00:03:35.100> is<00:03:35.250> divisible<00:03:35.700> by<00:03:36.030> both<00:03:36.239> 2<00:03:36.540> &amp;

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
that means 420 is divisible by both 2 &amp;

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.770 
that means 420 is divisible by both 2 &amp;
3<00:03:37.410> which<00:03:38.100> means<00:03:38.340> it's<00:03:38.610> divisible<00:03:38.940> by<00:03:39.209> 6

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
3 which means it's divisible by 6

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.580 
3 which means it's divisible by 6
what<00:03:40.680> about<00:03:40.790> 804<00:03:41.790> well<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.870> 4<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.440> ones

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
what about 804 well the 4 is in the ones

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.340 
what about 804 well the 4 is in the ones
place<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:45.180> make<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.600> forms<00:03:46.200> an

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
place so that that make and forms an

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.870 
place so that that make and forms an
even<00:03:46.620> number<00:03:46.920> so<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.250> makes<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.610> divisible

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
even number so that makes it divisible

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.170 
even number so that makes it divisible
by<00:03:48.150> 2<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:49.380> how<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.709> figure<00:03:50.310> out<00:03:50.370> if<00:03:50.670> students

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
by 2 and how you figure out if students

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.270 
by 2 and how you figure out if students
with<00:03:51.299> well<00:03:51.450> by<00:03:51.600> 3<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.080> you<00:03:52.350> add<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.560> 4<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.160> the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
with well by 3 is you add the 4 and the

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.070 
with well by 3 is you add the 4 and the
8<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:53.970> makes<00:03:54.209> 12<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:54.780> don't<00:03:54.989> really

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
8 and that makes 12 and you don't really

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.100 
8 and that makes 12 and you don't really
need<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.380> count<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.739> 0<00:03:56.000> 12<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:57.269> divisible<00:03:57.690> by<00:03:57.930> 3

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
need to count to 0 12 is divisible by 3

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.770 
need to count to 0 12 is divisible by 3
so<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.890> makes<00:03:59.130> this<00:03:59.310> number<00:03:59.640> this<00:04:00.360> is<00:04:00.570> will

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
so that makes this number this is will

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.900 
so that makes this number this is will

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
by both 2 &amp; 3 and that makes us number

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.199 
by both 2 &amp; 3 and that makes us number
divisible<00:04:03.450> by<00:04:03.690> 6

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
divisible by 6
