with repair procedures and products to
accommodate<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.560> repair<00:00:22.980> industry<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.880> feel

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
accommodate the repair industry we feel

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.700 
accommodate the repair industry we feel
that<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.660> good<00:00:24.960> approach<00:00:25.350> right<00:00:25.680> now

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
that we have a good approach right now

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.490 
that we have a good approach right now
on<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.000> products<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.840> added<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.470> have

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
on on the products that we added we have

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.040 
on on the products that we added we have
aluminum<00:00:29.070> weld<00:00:29.279> stations<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.029> contain<00:00:30.539> all

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
aluminum weld stations that contain all

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.889 
aluminum weld stations that contain all
the<00:00:31.439> tools<00:00:31.740> needed<00:00:32.160> for<00:00:32.309> aluminum<00:00:32.969> repair<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the tools needed for aluminum repair you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.389 
the tools needed for aluminum repair you
don't<00:00:34.079> want<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> mix<00:00:34.610> aluminum<00:00:35.610> with<00:00:36.230> steel

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
don't want to mix aluminum with steel

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.290 
don't want to mix aluminum with steel
basically<00:00:38.399> because<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> contamination

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
basically because of the contamination

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.569 
basically because of the contamination
into<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.170> aluminum<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.800> steel<00:00:41.010> particles

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
into the aluminum with steel particles

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.420 
into the aluminum with steel particles
could<00:00:42.300> end<00:00:42.480> up<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.870> corrosion<00:00:43.290> problems<00:00:44.190> in

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
could end up with corrosion problems in

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.209 
could end up with corrosion problems in
the<00:00:44.700> future<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> station<00:00:46.590> where

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the future so we have the station where

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.209 
the future so we have the station where
there's<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> tools<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.649> aluminum

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
there's all the tools in this aluminum

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
there's all the tools in this aluminum
well<00:00:50.340> stage<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.420> used<00:00:51.660> for

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
well stage is just going to be used for

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.049 
well stage is just going to be used for
for<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> aluminum<00:00:52.829> repair<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.670> everything

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
for the aluminum repair it's everything

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.689 
for the aluminum repair it's everything
from<00:00:54.420> from<00:00:54.930> MIG<00:00:55.379> welding<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> utility

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
from from MIG welding we have a utility

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.729 
from from MIG welding we have a utility
stations<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.050> different<00:00:58.620> voltages

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
stations on that for different voltages

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.060 
stations on that for different voltages
and<00:00:59.430> that<00:01:00.390> accommodates<00:01:01.020> both<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.500> dent

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and that accommodates both the dent

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
and that accommodates both the dent
pulling<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.960> mig<00:01:04.170> welding<00:01:04.500> applications

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
pulling and the mig welding applications

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.490 
pulling and the mig welding applications
as<00:01:05.369> well<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.180> aluminum<00:01:06.689> hood<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.350> much

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
as well the aluminum hood is so much

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.760 
as well the aluminum hood is so much
more<00:01:07.710> expensive<00:01:07.979> than<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.479> steel<00:01:10.260> was<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
more expensive than the steel was it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.950 
more expensive than the steel was it
will<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> more<00:01:11.250> need<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.880> repair<00:01:12.540> versus

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
will be a more need to repair versus

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.710 
will be a more need to repair versus
replace<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.549> do<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> capacitor

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
replace we can do that with a capacitor

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.380 
replace we can do that with a capacitor
discharge<00:01:16.229> system<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.490> welding<00:01:18.180> on

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
discharge system we have for welding on

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.240 
discharge system we have for welding on
the<00:01:18.869> pulling<00:01:19.470> taps<00:01:20.070> onto<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> aluminum<00:01:21.200> so

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
the pulling taps onto the aluminum so

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
the pulling taps onto the aluminum so
basically<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.520> takes<00:01:23.759> more<00:01:24.119> control<00:01:24.600> less

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
basically it takes more control less

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.819 
basically it takes more control less
time<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.939> welding<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.689> aluminum<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.590> more

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
time to do welding on aluminum it's more

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.710 
time to do welding on aluminum it's more
sensitive<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.579> heat<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.150> feel<00:01:30.360> we<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
sensitive to heat but we feel we have a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.660 
sensitive to heat but we feel we have a
good<00:01:30.930> approach<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.650> good<00:01:31.829> system<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.250> that

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
good approach and a good system for that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.240 
good approach and a good system for that
there's<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.570> lot<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> man<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> OEMs<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
there's a lot of the man on the OEMs to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
there's a lot of the man on the OEMs to
come<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.820> more<00:01:36.150> fuel<00:01:36.450> efficient

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
come up with more fuel efficient

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.230 
come up with more fuel efficient
vehicles<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.829> by<00:01:38.280> introducing<00:01:38.610> aluminum

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
vehicles and by introducing aluminum

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.480 
vehicles and by introducing aluminum
into<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.570> vehicle<00:01:40.259> aluminum<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.040> half<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
into the vehicle aluminum is half the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.429 
into the vehicle aluminum is half the
weight<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> steel<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.450> there's<00:01:42.689> obviously<00:01:43.049> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
weight of steel so there's obviously a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.830 
weight of steel so there's obviously a
lot<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.680> weight<00:01:44.009> saving<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.909> using<00:01:45.360> aluminum

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
lot of weight saving in using aluminum

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.770 
lot of weight saving in using aluminum
versus<00:01:46.409> steel<00:01:46.790> but<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.909> course<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.420> vehicle

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
versus steel but of course the vehicle

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.639 
versus steel but of course the vehicle
has<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.229> made<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.710> safe<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:51.649> resistance

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
has to be made as safe and as resistance

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.609 
has to be made as safe and as resistance
as<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.360> previous<00:01:54.360> models<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:55.020> Steel<00:01:55.350> has

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
as the previous models with Steel has

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.620 
as the previous models with Steel has
been<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> mindset

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
been it's going to have to be a mindset

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.160 
been it's going to have to be a mindset
from<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.649> technician<00:01:59.189> standpoint<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.170> by

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
from the technician standpoint and by

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.149 
from the technician standpoint and by
helping<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.890> having<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> tools
