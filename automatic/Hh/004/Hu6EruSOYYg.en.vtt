00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.260 
it basically means cinematic or even
beyond<00:02:24.780> cinematic<00:02:25.530> quality<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.940> really<00:02:27.180> is

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
beyond cinematic quality so it really is

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.230 
beyond cinematic quality so it really is
the<00:02:27.510> cutting<00:02:27.750> edge<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.459> video<00:02:29.459> quality<00:02:29.760> these

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
the cutting edge of video quality these

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.390 
the cutting edge of video quality these
days<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.260> basically<00:02:31.530> you've<00:02:31.950> got<00:02:32.190> a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
days and you basically you've got a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.270 
days and you basically you've got a
cinema<00:02:32.880> camera<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.450> your<00:02:33.510> pocket<00:02:37.040> review<00:02:38.040> look

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
cinema camera in your pocket review look

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.680 
cinema camera in your pocket review look
wherever<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.760> point<00:02:38.940> your<00:02:39.090> camera<00:02:39.270> looks

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
wherever you point your camera looks

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.390 
wherever you point your camera looks
beautiful<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.620> sometimes<00:02:40.860> almost<00:02:41.160> be

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
beautiful but it can sometimes almost be

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.979 
beautiful but it can sometimes almost be
overwhelming<00:02:42.090> like<00:02:42.300> where<00:02:42.510> do<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.660> start

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
overwhelming like where do I start

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.050 
overwhelming like where do I start
shooting<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:44.130> think<00:02:44.190> having<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.820> ability

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
shooting and I think having the ability

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.690 
shooting and I think having the ability
to<00:02:45.420> change<00:02:45.660> lenses<00:02:46.080> allows<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.489> create

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
to change lenses allows you to create

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.360 
to change lenses allows you to create
totally<00:02:48.450> different<00:02:48.780> looks<00:02:49.050> really<00:02:49.650> easily<00:02:50.100> in

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
totally different looks really easily in

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.180 
totally different looks really easily in
one<00:02:50.970> place<00:02:51.209> with<00:02:52.020> equipment<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:53.010> can

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
one place with equipment that you can

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.430 
one place with equipment that you can
easily<00:02:53.640> carry<00:02:53.850> with<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.570> just<00:02:54.750> literally

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
selfie see how how could you the really

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.479 
selfie see how how could you the really
cool<00:03:03.720> thing<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.200> screen<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:05.310> love

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
cool thing is the screen I really love

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.720 
cool thing is the screen I really love
to<00:03:05.670> shoot<00:03:05.880> inconvenient<00:03:06.870> angles

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
to shoot inconvenient angles

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.910 
to shoot inconvenient angles
I'll<00:03:09.239> often<00:03:09.629> lie<00:03:10.019> on<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.290> ground<00:03:10.500> when<00:03:10.830> I

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
I'll often lie on the ground when I

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.979 
I'll often lie on the ground when I
shoot<00:03:11.129> low<00:03:11.310> 10<00:03:11.519> shots<00:03:11.849> I'll<00:03:12.120> get<00:03:12.659> into<00:03:12.810> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
shoot low 10 shots I'll get into the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.410 
shoot low 10 shots I'll get into the
water<00:03:13.170> those<00:03:14.159> shots<00:03:14.519> if<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.790> don't<00:03:15.060> have<00:03:15.390> a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
water those shots if you don't have a

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.509 
water those shots if you don't have a
flip-out<00:03:15.870> screen<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.860> can<00:03:17.069> look<00:03:17.280> at

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
flip-out screen that you can look at

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.610 
flip-out screen that you can look at
from<00:03:17.849> waist<00:03:18.120> level<00:03:18.360> they're<00:03:19.080> much<00:03:19.409> much

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
from waist level they're much much

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.470 
from waist level they're much much
harder<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.159> achieve<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.700> that's<00:03:20.879> screen<00:03:21.239> for

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
harder to achieve so that's screen for

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.290 
harder to achieve so that's screen for
me<00:03:21.599> in<00:03:21.720> particular<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:22.260> real<00:03:22.440> lifesaver

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.600 

if<00:03:25.840> it's<00:03:26.080> more<00:03:26.230> convenient<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:27.220> reach<00:03:27.370> out

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
if it's more convenient to reach out

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.920 
if it's more convenient to reach out
with<00:03:27.730> your<00:03:27.790> thumb<00:03:28.060> or<00:03:28.210> your<00:03:28.330> finger<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.690> touch

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
with your thumb or your finger and touch

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.260 
with your thumb or your finger and touch
the<00:03:29.290> screen<00:03:29.770> that's<00:03:30.220> what<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.460> do<00:03:30.640> if<00:03:30.910> it's

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
the screen that's what you do if it's

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.790 
the screen that's what you do if it's
easy<00:03:31.450> enough<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:31.750> touch<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.230> buttons<00:03:32.560> that's

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
easy enough to touch the buttons that's

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.960 
easy enough to touch the buttons that's
what<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.490> gives<00:03:33.580> you<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.760> lot<00:03:33.910> of

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
what you do so it gives you a lot of

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.030 
what you do so it gives you a lot of
latitude<00:03:34.210> and<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:35.200> small<00:03:35.470> camera<00:03:35.800> and

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
latitude and a small camera and

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.500 
latitude and a small camera and
effectively<00:03:36.520> gives<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.880> really<00:03:37.270> good

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
effectively gives you really good

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.950 
effectively gives you really good
ergonomics<00:03:38.080> I<00:03:39.210> really<00:03:40.210> like<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.570> creative

camera bag on some shoots I would say

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.180 
camera bag on some shoots I would say
there<00:04:29.720> will<00:04:29.780> literally<00:04:30.230> be<00:04:30.470> times<00:04:30.800> where<00:04:31.160> I
