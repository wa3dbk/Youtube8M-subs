00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.100 
basically like little applets little
applications<00:02:09.459> of<00:02:09.610> their<00:02:09.759> own<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.479> you're

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
applications of their own that you're

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.900 
applications of their own that you're
running<00:02:11.470> there<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.770> like<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.160> one<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.819> know

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
running there I like this one you know

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.350 
running there I like this one you know
showing<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.270> CPU<00:02:13.860> usage<00:02:14.860> on<00:02:15.310> your<00:02:16.060> machine

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
showing the CPU usage on your machine

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.199 
showing the CPU usage on your machine
and<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.690> RAM<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.620> that's<00:02:18.099> very<00:02:18.310> nice<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:18.819> mean

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
and the RAM so that's very nice I mean

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.970 
and the RAM so that's very nice I mean
to<00:02:19.360> have<00:02:19.480> up<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.230> running<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.650> know<00:02:20.830> when

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
to have up and running so you know when

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.770 
to have up and running so you know when
your<00:02:21.100> machines<00:02:21.370> are<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.970> know<00:02:22.060> getting<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
your machines are you know getting to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.290 
your machines are you know getting to
top<00:02:23.200> capacity<00:02:23.800> here<00:02:24.280> are<00:02:24.400> some<00:02:24.580> examples<00:02:25.120> of

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
top capacity here are some examples of

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.700 
top capacity here are some examples of

through the software which I'll show you

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.840 
through the software which I'll show you
in<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.660> moment<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.740> like<00:02:29.980> white<00:02:30.520> actually

library that it has different types of
games<00:02:55.810> obviously<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.710> and<00:02:57.600> select<00:02:58.600> those<00:02:58.750> as

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
games obviously and and select those as

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.960 
games obviously and and select those as
your<00:02:59.110> primary<00:02:59.380> ones<00:02:59.740> here<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.520> list<00:03:00.820> of

your primary ones here is a list of

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.240 
your primary ones here is a list of
different<00:03:01.750> games<00:03:02.290> obviously<00:03:02.620> that<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.070> can

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.240 
different games obviously that you can
choose<00:03:03.430> from<00:03:03.700> for<00:03:04.240> example<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:05.530> have

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
choose from for example I have

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.130 
choose from for example I have
battlefield<00:03:06.760> 3<00:03:07.030> so<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.390> know<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.780> detects

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
battlefield 3 so you know it detects

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.070 
battlefield 3 so you know it detects
that<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.380> can<00:03:08.770> add<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:10.360> can<00:03:10.510> customize

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
that it can add that you can customize

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.950 
that it can add that you can customize
it<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:13.270> can<00:03:13.420> let<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.660> do<00:03:13.750> its<00:03:13.900> thing

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
it so you can let it do its thing

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.020 
it so you can let it do its thing
basically<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.920> just<00:03:14.950> put<00:03:15.460> things<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:15.880> there

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
basically and just put things in there

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.030 
basically and just put things in there
for<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.480> or<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:17.410> can<00:03:18.180> add<00:03:19.180> your<00:03:19.390> own<00:03:19.800> okay<00:03:20.800> and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
for you or you can add your own okay and

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.280 
for you or you can add your own okay and
that's<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.970> flexibility<00:03:22.720> about<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.080> right

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
that's the flexibility about it right

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.250 
that's the flexibility about it right
being<00:03:23.590> able<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:23.920> do<00:03:24.070> that<00:03:24.220> no<00:03:24.400> like<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:25.000> said

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
being able to do that no like I said

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.780 
being able to do that no like I said
this<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.470> high<00:03:26.650> quality<00:03:26.710> keyboard<00:03:27.520> I<00:03:27.610> can

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
this is a high quality keyboard I can

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.880 
this is a high quality keyboard I can
tell<00:03:27.940> by<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.120> keys<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:29.020> construction<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.770> it

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
tell by the keys the construction of it

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.680 
tell by the keys the construction of it
I<00:03:30.070> do<00:03:30.250> like<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:30.940> it's<00:03:31.150> fingerprint

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
I do like that it's fingerprint

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.690 
I do like that it's fingerprint
resistant<00:03:32.320> okay<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.800> materials<00:03:33.220> on<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.430> so

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
resistant okay the materials on it so

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.310 
resistant okay the materials on it so
even<00:03:33.940> though<00:03:34.090> it's<00:03:34.209> got<00:03:34.300> a<00:03:34.360> shiny<00:03:34.690> finish<00:03:34.930> I

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
even though it's got a shiny finish I

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.440 
even though it's got a shiny finish I
don't<00:03:35.680> see<00:03:35.860> my<00:03:35.980> fingerprints<00:03:36.550> around<00:03:36.970> on<00:03:37.300> that

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
don't see my fingerprints around on that

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.540 
don't see my fingerprints around on that
blue<00:03:37.860> section<00:03:38.860> that<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.100> can<00:03:39.220> see<00:03:39.370> on<00:03:39.459> the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
blue section that you can see on the

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.990 
blue section that you can see on the
keyboard<00:03:39.910> there<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:40.750> that's<00:03:41.080> very<00:03:41.260> nice<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
keyboard there so that's very nice the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.330 
keyboard there so that's very nice the
keys<00:03:43.239> do<00:03:43.450> feel<00:03:43.690> a<00:03:43.989> good<00:03:44.440> quality<00:03:44.920> by<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.100> way

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
keys do feel a good quality by the way

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.699 
keys do feel a good quality by the way
so<00:03:45.790> just<00:03:46.209> if<00:03:46.630> you're<00:03:46.720> wondering<00:03:47.080> but<00:03:47.200> like<00:03:47.590> I

so just if you're wondering but like I

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.620 
so just if you're wondering but like I
mentioned<00:03:47.770> this<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:48.310> not<00:03:48.459> a<00:03:48.670> mechanical

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
mentioned this is not a mechanical

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.630 
mentioned this is not a mechanical
keyboard<00:03:49.930> okay<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:50.980> even<00:03:51.190> though<00:03:51.340> it's<00:03:51.459> their
