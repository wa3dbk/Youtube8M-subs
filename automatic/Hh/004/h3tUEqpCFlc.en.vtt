00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
with a crow call most of birds that I

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.020 
with a crow call most of birds that I
hunt<00:02:36.530> tend<00:02:36.829> to<00:02:36.889> get<00:02:37.010> hunted<00:02:37.310> pretty<00:02:37.519> hard<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
course of the day and I think that makes

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.610
