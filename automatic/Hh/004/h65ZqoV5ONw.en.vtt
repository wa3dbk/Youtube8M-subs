00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.480
 try is a fixed section of the sheet 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.880
 for this week we teach the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.719
 make a toy an experience 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.719
 something 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.119
 Unfortunately, filming failed. 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.490
 actor nick serrano dead two stumps 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.250
 of clown what is the banana trick 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.820
 that you pretend that broke the banana has 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.610
 to stay here and another that is is as if a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.899
 was trapped in the floating air and 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.969
 you have been punished 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.200
 I'm here to teach you what to do with 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.780
 that works 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.420
 talking only a magic bullet you go 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.739
 eat 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.350
 So comes the play on the newsroom if you 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.870
 get a machine like this 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.600
 I hunted for having a few doors 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.729
 and improve the back-end campaign of the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.210
 band we talk to the block brings her 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:04.820
 curve will pick up the downside crisis and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.820
 made the tip and open 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:17.770
 and the sun shines on her who invented it yet 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.860
 so a bit of top so but you 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.370
 will touch the background with points that it will 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.230
 to touch the side to pass by the police 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.230
 would the fifth realize that he will have to 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.830
 be to the end and if not you will pull the 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.200
 Banana is not cool is that you have 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:46.540
 his image here on the bottom for 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:48.340
 up taking it rather just get their 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.950
 friends when it appears a little bit 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.630
 magic to you that I'm going to eat one 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.890
 banana for the daily wants to see thrashing 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.080
 Leave it here 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.600

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.420

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.940
 preferably a woman 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:16.030
 You will even go up in history and there 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.420
 You 'll take how I bring my 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.560
 The dream is that she 'll stay with her and I'll go 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:28.890
 start trying help leave 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.890
