00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.530
 the sparkling it entrusts its head to our team with a precise idea 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.530
 she dreams of a hairstyle at natalie portman 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.420
 I did not say anything because I used to tie hair all 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.110
 the weather 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.660
 and april I think my lajemmerais to a cut that would allow them 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.120
 let go a little bit of time 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.940
 in fact so bad of the huge things 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.340
 very worked and I have a very small village which jacques chouat the meeting 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.990
 we are really a huge mass effect on a tiny face that it 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.000
 not going at all natalie portman for what I liked is the stage length 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.060
 2 million euros of that would allow attached and let go in the top that 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.540
 maybe pushing me a little bit more than letting go 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.660
 he could also go in the capillaries of saâles hairdresser cédric 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.720
 pin chain unveils its strategy 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.330
 we will start with a dome 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.290
 with an inverted gradient and then we will bring color with that for 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.150
 snatch try the mechins little clearer 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.030
 after i will show you to saragossa and create how they do to hair 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.410
 because as soon as she receives a bonus and a buckle it works very 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.690
 very strong 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.560
 when a blow 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.430
 colors and its line will be realized it will be enough to paris the faces and its 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.130
 light points like that it's clear the call to a very pretty for a small 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.710
 little rosé au naturel 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.700
 and so that I could already go it's transparent 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.870
 transpire 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.450
 for his skin through makeup 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.390
 and I thought to make a very glamorous makeup% but but without I fill with 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.629
 colors earlier in the day shading games 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.019
 light 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.260
 to look like natalie portman it is necessary to cut the hair of some 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.059
 centimeters we start with the fringe but be careful caution is required 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.690
 if the series is slowly enough to recover from the wat 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.510
 to be able to see how to control and react 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.170
 to not end up with them 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.979
 a mobile phone 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:29.869
 we are going to lose 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:31.749
 little bit different way 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.649
 with a wick on the side and no longer but especially if the wind is 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:39.090
 slightly longer than 350 copies in power attach them for her the 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:40.469
 statistics 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.000
 on the other hand it is there I remain intact 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.290
 no question of cutting too short because drying the German railways 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.269
 have shouted in a climb zone 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.040
 these two examples in its structure and volume by degrading the wicks of the 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.939
 many skull summit speak 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.139
 how massively 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.739
 like that I ask you five minutes his picket call to a screening 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.670
 deep 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.680
 so it also helps people and when we have to push back a few months 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.269
 he finally gave in 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.269
 the actress minutes the crucial synthesis 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.019
 we know all types 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.689
 do not panic it fits in the classics so we can ensure 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.730
 the uniformity of the color thanks to a light sweep patinated by a color 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.259
 more brilliant 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.559
 after mating go to shaping to get the same tastes 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.579
 that the sofa bed a week at work these chairs hair 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.319
 of course it looks like it was working early wearing a sweater 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.069
 I congratulate 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.279
 you have to respect some things between friends with products to decrease 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:36.620
 costs 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.299
 the loops to make it look good 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.320
 mid-session but still 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.429
 a diffuser the club for his hair 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:49.150
 and the 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.870
 why because it explodes loops 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.750
 really 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.750
 respect the show as a desire to put 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:00.539
 then eager to do a little more on each wick 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.769
 and most important then carry it in motion 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.769
 a little more defined on the length 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.009
 when the roots 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:13.210
 but what is good is also not to cf 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.310
 all the loops in the same direction we work as an earring and a 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.400
 loop of the other 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.069
 humor and a little bit further 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.629
 it is important not to mount too much 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.770
 and when the whole wall chain and no longer a single detail of the chord 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.029
 must be written 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:29.929
 taking example compostable materials might do a little more 

00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:31.650
 loops so that it does not do too much 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.729
 six interactive sites 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.729
 on arrival cyril only remains to know if the gard 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.189
 j 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.629
 for a leading role of natalie portman is at 1,503 the hands of the american 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.720
 the friendly artist in marseille and lyon 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.850
 the goal is to reproduce a bright and subtle makeup 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.679
 for that they too have their regard we stitched a pearl-colored blush on the 

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:05.979
 eyelid mobile and flush eyelashes in thrace pencil a workout and then 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.979
 opposite shadows game 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.089
 where there is 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.870
 a natural case jacques santini 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.749
 to create the relief of the v5 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.749
 we assist 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.549
 even in one case it's a trap always buy a point of light 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:28.680
 both on the center 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.270
 from the eyelid a little in the inner corner 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.270
 and under the brow bone 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.009
 these are breaks now a layer of mascara 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.289
 a trick for tired eyes when to acquire eyelid ap ap red 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.730
 we try to use for the state a white pencil 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.499
 he is a pencil 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:49.749
 for this blow their party foundation 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.800
 why because it's more natural than white 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.069
 while there it will turn with the light 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:57.979
 it will pay their lawyer 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.060
 Finally, we put a kudyrie chouïa on the temples to support them. 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:05.690
 neckline it's all over you just have to shine like natalie 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:08.689
 portman 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.920
 so says cause first of all a star-like appearance has mostly done what effect it is 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.710
 slip into the skin of natalie portman in a sense I'm gaining weight on the 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.580
 pascal scene 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.130
 the bridge are present at the meeting 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.660
 yesterday morning I have a lot more natural than what I'm used to 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.569
 personally do 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.690
 by confirming to you can even passed a casting to play the lining 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:33.689
 from natalie portman 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:34.680
 she
