 chain3 to television more open than 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.890
 never if you thought you had already seen 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.410
 the operator because I think it has not happened and 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.690
 well this news after 4 to 0 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.660
 before the eagles of the america in the frame 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.670
 of the national classic today jorge vergara 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.130
 decides to thank the brain 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.990
 they were four months old and well 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.570
 the club announces mind of its account of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.090
 twitter this news and the bench of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.010
 The rojiblancos remains vacant Ricardo 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.080
 the whole blow is at this moment 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.910
 finalizing details practically a 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.710
 done the one that after this meeting with 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.480
 the club's leaders so be 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.730
 arriving an agreement to sign a contract 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 with the Tapatio team in Argentina 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.540
 directed to the plant the most to monterrey 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.239
 to the Mexican team in the world 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.969
 of 2006 and there has come a 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.850
 seguidilla of failures summons with vélez 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.220
 with banfield staying in all of them 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.530
 short of the objectives 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.150
 and well, precisely as it has gone 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.800
 to volpe directing in Mexico after 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.290
 of having been with the selection in 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.910
 Germany-2006 in no team and neither 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.680
 even reached 45 percent of 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.160
 effectiveness in atlante 37 percent 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.380
 in atlas 41 percent in Monterrey 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.000
 although he keeps saying that he left the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.380
 served to vucetich and that the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.909
 track championships 43 percent 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.859
 unfortunately and I say it with the 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.340
 convincing the subject for the addition 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:27.369
 of chivas because they have an owner 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.770
 that always prefers to throw at a 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.530
 technical director dismiss him so that 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.500
 to blame someone for the mistakes 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.319
 who have been coming for 12 years since 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.789
 position of the owner's function 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.950
 the real güero or the one that is in its place 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.890
 Well, it will be one more than this man 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.020
 Use to remove the tips then 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.539
 does not let you take the blame you 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.720
 they loaded everything on this man and I think 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.819
 Mr. embers that the problem of chivas not 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.009
 is neither of the real genius nor of his 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.649
 predecessors is a problem of a team 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.209
 badly managed that reminds me 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.270
 both the dallas cowboys was yes 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.789
 one thinks 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.380
 the subject of an owner who then has 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.899
 won and that has not allowed him to have 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.330
 its around people who know the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.209
 buy for an institution if there is a 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.310
 favor and that the 1220s have not been able to 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.069
 great stadium another provides well is and 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.680
 both suffer from ex because yes because 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.910
 when I let someone work in the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.560
 football theme 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.090
 chivas road was the time when 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.860
 got the title that was best seen 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.930
 this team and then these decisions 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.190
 how is this block because they do not allow 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.599
 there is a process in guadalajara the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.000
 number of technicians that have gone through 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.950
 chivas is incredible now it was the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.420
 real güero but there have been many 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.190
 which has been pointed out as guilty but 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.170
 if there is no solid structure it is very 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.209
 difficult for things to work 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.040
 chivas then when vergara bought the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.810
 team had a certain solid foundation 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.549
 little by little those were going away 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.900
 footballers who were foundations of the 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.700
 Mexican soccer team during 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.650
 2005 2006 in the world cup 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.870
 precisely in which he directed ricardo 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.730
 the volpe and has stopped appearing that 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.560
 talent have managed to manage have not known 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.390
 bring some young footballers the 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.950
 more clear example because to have yielded 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.230
 although it is still owned by the club 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.430
 marco fabián not having known how to handle that 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.870
 situation and that of many others 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.849
 young soccer players 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.709
 at hiring at some point 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.959
 He blamed bringing players 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.390
 already veterans but I was charging it to 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.010
 who advised him so he said and 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.390
 Well now he has decided not to bring 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.200
 expensive players and the team is still without 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.659
 function 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.549
 brought Dutch was crowd changed the 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.319
 stadium turf the certain thing is that 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.360
 chivas good because it is a team that has 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.010
 gained very little of certain 12 years a 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.079
 title 'presumes that there was an 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.909
 end of cup liberators to two others 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.110
 semifinals that were truncated a 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.269
 little by the subject of the selection 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.769
 national this is about winning the 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.569
 titles have not appeared and there have been 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.489
 other institutions that have known 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.560
 managed at this time and that have 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.079
 gained much more with much less carries 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.420
 almost 30 tournaments the chivas team 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.280
 since this man arrived and of those 30 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.530
 tournaments has won one serve you the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.079
 success rate but it's a disaster 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.879
 of administration because today he prefers 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.190
 assume that he is the savior of his 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.629
 team and firing a man is a 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.000
 honest work with very few resources 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.010
 with a defensive that looks like a cheese 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.340
 gruyère where there is no seniority where
