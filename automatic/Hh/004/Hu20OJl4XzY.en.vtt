00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.740
 long time no see everyone hello to you 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.330
 phil and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.200
 and this is the fourth guide to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:36.050
 battlefield 4 today we look 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.050
 first available machine gun yust mark five 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 manual machine gun produced in singapore 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.460
 ultimax 100 is a lung and 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.440
 very precise support weapon which 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.440
 practically does not have a return 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.390
 presented in the game modification 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.760
 characterized by the presence of a folding stock 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.839
 integrated picatini straps and 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.690
 the possibility of using stores 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.350
 machine and beta simok with a capacity of 30 of 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.390
 100 rounds respectively more and more 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.380
 more military recognize dignity 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.960
 this machine gun 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.229
 Now you are 100 in service 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.630
 more than ten countries and 100 inflicts 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.400
 good damage you will need only 4 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.100
 accurate shots near to kill 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.590
 enemy damage with distance drops not 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.480
 too much after 50 meters you 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.060
 only need 2 more bullets 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.920
 so you can safely fire on 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.290
 enemies that are far away 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.610
 as in this case will help the most 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.300
 high in the class of machine guns 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.850
 the speed of the bullet recoil yu 100 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.830
 very weak you barely feel 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.580
 her while shooting even long 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.160
 bursts 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.200
 that's why this machine gun is great 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.180
 suitable even for beginners who are still 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.140
 do not know how to control strong returns 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.590
 weapons 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.800
 rate of fire very low only 590 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.740
 shots per minute 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.380
 this is the worst figure in class so 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.720
 forget about using this machine gun in 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.500
 melee you will be incredibly difficult 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.300
 shoot the enemy with any weapon 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.490
 sometimes itâ€™s much faster and safer 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.800
 get a gun especially if you 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:18.130
 use something quick - fire like 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:21.520
 g18 or 93 p shooting rate of 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.490
 hip is also very low but as in 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.650
 the rest of the machine guns are weapons that 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.290
 intended for aimed shooting at 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.680
 enemies remember this first aim 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.480
 then open fire 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.310
 store capacity is low for class 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.350
 machine guns total 45 rounds + 1 in the barrel 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.810
 however, this is offset by faster 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.420
 recharge and low rate of fire 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.920
 even with the introduction completely 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.170
 automatic fire 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.600
 one store is enough for you 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.070
 hit a few enemies change 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.900
 the store comes pretty fast 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.820
 especially when compared 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.090
 Yusta with other machine guns that 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.140
 have tape feed 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.370
 tactical recharge takes a little 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.850
 less than three seconds 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.800
 full almost 4 so try 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.870
 always recharge before u 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.870
 you completely run out of ammo 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.790
 the store will save you a bit 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.730
 time and so the enemy will be difficult 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.100
 catch you by sight standard sight 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.670
 quite good however to lead effective 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.880
 shooting 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.500
 I can give you a ride with him 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.730
 set holographic or 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.550
 collimator sight 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.920
 as soon as they become available it 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.560
 will simplify aimed shooting especially 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.959
 moving targets 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.060
 due to a slight drop in damage and low 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.630
 the return will also be an excellent option 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.310
 multiplicity sights 3 and 4 as art 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.910
 free module I recommend 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.099
 use 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.310
 a thickened trunk which is positive 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.800
 will affect the accuracy of your weapon this 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.280
 will further enhance the potential and 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.739
 mouth 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.560
 when shooting at long and medium and sims 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.420
 ii perhaps this is the most useful module so 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.880
 how it allows you to get the most out of 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.800
 this machine gun 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.620
 yet he has the lowest damage 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.110
 second in class install 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.209
 laser designator no sense yust 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.940
 not suitable for shooting from the hip and 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.859
 melee is much better to use 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.139
 this lens slot 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.079
 magnifier well or flashlight and if you 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.360
 absolutely nothing to do among the grenade launchers 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.210
 modules you can choose to your taste 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.430
 if you want to make the task even more 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.070
 nice then install the tilted 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.950
 the grip short grip will add 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.880
 even more accuracy and without that exact 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.600
 for stock and for those who prefer 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.340
 positional defense there are pitfalls and 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.740
 tired this is interesting and no doubt 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.360
 good machine gun which is great 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.990
 to destroy the enemies on the distant and 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.850
 middle distances maybe he is often not 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.190
 enough rate of fire and the amount 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.950
 cartridges store but you don't even 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.400
 remember what is return and withdrawal 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.430
 trunk main remember aim accurately 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.900
 do not be afraid to shoot at enemies away 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.900
 recharge on time and do not meddle in 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.360
 close combat do these simple 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.480
 instructions and ultimax will become 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.590
 the ultimate weapon of your hands 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.060
 as deadly as it is accurate 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.130
 Thank you very much for your attention with you 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.900
 Artem join us next 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.450
 times when we will consider 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.450
 cs lr4 good luck in battle
