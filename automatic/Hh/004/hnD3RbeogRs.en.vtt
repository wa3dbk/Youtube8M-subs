it's<00:00:38.129> not<00:00:38.250> lifting<00:00:38.670> off<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.840> I'm<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.050> got<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
it's not lifting off so I'm just got to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.510 
it's not lifting off so I'm just got to
run<00:00:42.270> us<00:00:42.420> through<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.350> happens<00:00:43.739> I'll

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
run us through see what happens I'll

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.040 
run us through see what happens I'll
stick<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.620> as<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.070> see<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:49.910> set<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:51.149> so

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
stick this on as you can see I set up so

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.189 
stick this on as you can see I set up so
we'll<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.620> local<00:00:52.890> test<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> bedroom

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
we'll just do local test in the bedroom

door shut all rights looking for a GPS
signal<00:01:01.219> I'm<00:01:02.219> doing<00:01:02.489> things<00:01:02.699> at<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> moment

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
signal I'm doing things at the moment

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.380 
signal I'm doing things at the moment
and<00:01:05.900> get<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> look<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.290> while<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:08.150> don't<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.330> we

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and get a look a while I don't think we

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
and get a look a while I don't think we
need<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> gps<00:01:09.840> signal<00:01:10.439> though<00:01:10.590> anyway<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
need the gps signal though anyway do it

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.840 
need the gps signal though anyway do it
just<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.520> doing<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.820> test<00:01:12.229> anyway<00:01:13.850> it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
just for doing this test anyway it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.719 
just for doing this test anyway it
didn't<00:01:15.090> work<00:01:15.210> last<00:01:15.360> time<00:01:15.509> ah<00:01:16.460> what<00:01:17.460> we'll<00:01:17.580> do

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
didn't work last time ah what we'll do

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.340 
didn't work last time ah what we'll do
we'll<00:01:18.090> turn<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.770> we'll<00:01:19.770> turn<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
we'll turn it on we'll turn this on and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.920 
we'll turn it on we'll turn this on and
now<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> right<00:01:23.070> hand<00:01:23.310> throttle<00:01:23.930> there

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
now this is a right hand throttle there

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.039 
now this is a right hand throttle there
it<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.549> right-handed<00:01:26.549> flawtl<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.600> power<00:01:27.840> we

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
it is right-handed flawtl so a power we

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
it is right-handed flawtl so a power we
have<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.229> push<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:29.780> left<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.049> stick<00:01:31.880> which

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
have to push this left and stick which

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.310 
have to push this left and stick which
is<00:01:33.000> left<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.360> right<00:01:33.600> we're<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> push

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
is left and right we're going to push

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.080 
is left and right we're going to push
that<00:01:34.350> right<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.979> unlocks<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.610> that's<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
that right that unlocks it that's the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.999 
that right that unlocks it that's the
way<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> unlock<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.619> actually

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
way to unlock it it's not actually

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.789 
way to unlock it it's not actually
throttle<00:01:38.430> stick<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:39.150> far<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.570> know<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.990> seems

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
throttle stick as far as I know it seems

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.399 
throttle stick as far as I know it seems
to<00:01:41.009> work<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> does<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.119> anyway<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.229> we'll

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
to work and it does that anyway so we'll

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.550 
to work and it does that anyway so we'll
switch<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.950> put<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> throttle<00:01:44.790> down<00:01:45.119> to

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
switch it on put the throttle down to

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.160 
switch it on put the throttle down to
some<00:01:47.479> remote<00:01:48.479> zero<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:50.070> switch<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.850> mode<00:01:51.329> 0<00:01:51.360> on

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
some remote zero on switch be mode 0 on

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.179 
some remote zero on switch be mode 0 on
switch<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.770> right<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.030> we're<00:01:54.180> ready<00:01:54.270> now<00:01:55.189> we're

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
switch a right so we're ready now we're

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.560 
switch a right so we're ready now we're
going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> lock<00:01:56.490> unlock<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> motors<00:01:57.390> by

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
going to lock unlock the motors by

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.660 
going to lock unlock the motors by
pushing<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.140> left<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.430> what<00:01:59.579> the
