spark<00:02:10.890> which<00:02:11.640> does<00:02:11.879> provide<00:02:12.209> enough<00:02:12.480> power<00:02:12.510> to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
spark which does provide enough power to

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.350 
spark which does provide enough power to
do<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:14.430> pretty<00:02:14.640> much<00:02:14.790> all<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.030> need<00:02:15.269> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
do this so pretty much all you need to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.619 
do this so pretty much all you need to
do<00:02:15.510> if<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.409> have<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.590> nexus<00:02:17.099> 7<00:02:17.519> there's<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
do if you have a nexus 7 there's the

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.050 
do if you have a nexus 7 there's the
pogo<00:02:18.959> pins<00:02:19.200> that's<00:02:19.530> opposite<00:02:20.129> decide<00:02:20.489> with

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
pogo pins that's opposite decide with

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.449 
pogo pins that's opposite decide with
the<00:02:21.209> power<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.840> volume<00:02:22.459> you're

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
the power and the volume you're

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.610 
the power and the volume you're
basically<00:02:23.609> just<00:02:23.879> going<00:02:24.180> to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
basically just going to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.399 
basically just going to
that<00:02:24.830> in<00:02:24.980> there<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.599> there's<00:02:29.599> no<00:02:29.750> real<00:02:30.019> magic

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
that in there so there's no real magic

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.890 
that in there so there's no real magic
there<00:02:31.420> it's<00:02:32.420> charging<00:02:33.700> here<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.909> my<00:02:35.569> google
