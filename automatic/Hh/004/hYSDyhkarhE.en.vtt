00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 hello my name is mike you look 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:11.400
 free topic friends for no one 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.440
 the secret is that I play the guitar that I sing 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.570
 that I have a checkout group that we 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.029
 act and so on and so forth and 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.789
 more than once at concerts I had to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.410
 tune the guitar so friends and business in 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.240
 that I didn't have long ago 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.189
 more precisely for a long time I did not have tuners 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.929
 no, I kept tuning the guitar 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.630
 on stage right so that all people 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.450
 heard there was no other choice 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.340
 so here I will tell in this issue 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.370
 about all the ways 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.520
 about my evolution of guitar tuning so 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.390
 let's start the very first old - fashioned way 5 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.760
 frets went to set up 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.590
 guitar under the old-fashioned way 5 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:00.050
 frets you only need hearing and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.949
 fingers that's all we pull the first string 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.010
 second on the fifth fret 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.680
 they should sound the same first 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.680
 open 2 on the fifth on the second 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.659
 open 3 by 4 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.359
 also 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:18.429
 now not small here and now 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.710
 specially frustrated fourth and 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:24.819
 fourth third open should sound 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:29.759
 equally from 4 on the fifth fret now is not 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:29.759
 equally pull up 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:43.780
 the fourth is the same now 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:48.280
 open 5 by 5 5 open 6 on the fifth lo 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.200
 that is, the bottom open next on 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.049
 the fifth but the only exception is 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.909
 the third string that is 2 open and the third 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.270
 must on the fourth you so here 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.310
 Now everything is set up like this 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.409
 old-fashioned way 5 frets now i'm 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.069
 tell you about how you can customize 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.739
 let's say with a harmonica if 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:12.010
 you have a harmonica can find out 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.209
 and yes, my nationality is 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.670
 there are holes and in fact which 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.680
 Here I will show you on this camera holes 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.489
 which need to which which blow or 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.200
 exhale and then you can extract this 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.709
 the very note that you need exactly us 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.370
 the first string is not that is e here it is 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.250
 it turns out 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.750
 exhale here I have a sign like this 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.190
 in my harmonica 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.660
 my, this is the exhale in the second hole 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.700
 i.e 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.700
 pull the first string 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.210
 feel up to exactly the same 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.100
 have tuned the first string you can 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.500
 further on childish ways like new 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.350
 lada set up everyone else also i 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.040
 I was there at one time 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.660
 the tuner is completely battered the same 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.390
 that the harmonica is only here everything is signed 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:15.569
 what string what hole that is six 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:19.360
 holes 6 tun first string 2 3 4 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.850
 guys 100 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.510
 here actually I used it 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.980
 at all rehearsals I do not remember at the end 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.690
 I smelled before the concert for sure 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.030
 set up on the stage I'm not this thing 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.920
 enjoyed it would be funny here but with 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.320
 recently quite recently 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.650
 in less than two weeks 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.920
 probably yes 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:46.870
 bought here is such a tuner ter firm 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:50.320
 virtuoso it cost 350 rubles as far as I 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.350
 I remember we add 350 this austerity tuner 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:57.510
 sensor great thing she puts on 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:04.080
 the neck turns on like this 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:06.800
 You see, that is, pulling the string 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.360
 he gets vibrations through the fretboard and 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.750
 shows us tuned or guitars if 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.090
 configured then 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.329
 in this way we either omit 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.090
 either we pull up and get the green light 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.130
 this green light is on green screen 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.230
 and everything means the string is tuned 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.680
 way at a concert can be turned off 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.970
 the electric guitar is completely that is the sound in 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.860
 the amplifier wo n't go and we can 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.620
 calm tune your guitar like i'm 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.500
 basically set up and the last of ours 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.070
 speeches here 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.660
 but 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.660
 like this 1 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.920
 third string 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.600
 see all the same old-fashioned way not 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.490
 so very accurate and therefore by ear not 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.990
 so you can precisely adjust 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.690
 see and corrects the tuner shows 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.350
 us that I pulled the string now 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:09.810
 a little bit of them down here the tuner i 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.810
 checked the tuner is not lying here 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.390
 great guitar tuners tuned super 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.600
 cool thing you can wear it 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.110
 in this way, let's say, and not 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.750
 I am steaming 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.210
 that someone will see your tuner here 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.940
 and in front can play tune in 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.880
 the playing time even that is, removed the note or 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.290
 what kind of note do you watch 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.450
 how you have it configured to accurately 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.460
 friends play guitar sing 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.620
 make music listen good 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.580
 music 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.070
 I advise you to purchase 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.660
 any because of the tuners but at the same 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:49.250
 I only want to give you time 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.440
 great advice is to learn this one 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.150
 old-fashioned way 5 palms never you 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.340
 hurt because not always the tuner 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:01.900
 will be at hand but I hope this one 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.900
 release you useful with you was a mike movie 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.390
 he
