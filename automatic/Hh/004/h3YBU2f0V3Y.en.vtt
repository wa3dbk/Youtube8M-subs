00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
with the boost and you can actually run

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.930 
with the boost and you can actually run
into<00:00:56.560> other<00:00:56.649> people<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.430> Mongoose<00:00:57.910> is

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
into other people the Mongoose is

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.850 
into other people the Mongoose is
actually<00:00:58.510> really<00:00:58.660> good<00:00:58.899> for<00:00:59.230> just<00:00:59.500> trying<00:00:59.739> to

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
actually really good for just trying to

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.710 
actually really good for just trying to
hide<00:01:00.070> like<00:01:00.340> if<00:01:00.550> you<00:01:00.820> see<00:01:00.970> a<00:01:01.000> bunch<00:01:01.239> of<00:01:01.360> ghosts

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
i would definitely just get in the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.050 
i would definitely just get in the
Mongoose<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.220> drive<00:01:06.340> around<00:01:06.579> until<00:01:06.729> there's

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
Mongoose and drive around until there's

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.059 
Mongoose and drive around until there's
less<00:01:07.240> players<00:01:07.509> and<00:01:07.749> then<00:01:07.869> just<00:01:08.380> dish<00:01:08.859> it<00:01:08.979> out

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:09.069 
less players and then just dish it out

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.830 
less players and then just dish it out
from<00:01:09.280> there<00:01:09.369> once<00:01:09.609> the<00:01:09.729> vehicles<00:01:10.179> are<00:01:10.479> up<00:01:10.630> here

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
from there once the vehicles are up here

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.749 
from there once the vehicles are up here
as<00:01:10.990> well<00:01:11.200> with<00:01:11.439> a<00:01:11.530> soft<00:01:11.889> kill<00:01:12.159> boundary<00:01:12.609> to

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
as well with a soft kill boundary to

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.700 
as well with a soft kill boundary to
force<00:01:12.999> players<00:01:13.240> fall<00:01:13.539> down<00:01:13.749> to<00:01:14.350> fall<00:01:14.530> down

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
force players fall down to fall down

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.469 
force players fall down to fall down
from<00:01:14.920> there<00:01:15.159> go<00:01:15.280> since<00:01:15.549> they<00:01:15.639> don't<00:01:15.789> they<00:01:16.090> die

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
from there go since they don't they die

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.779 
from there go since they don't they die
of<00:01:16.509> course<00:01:16.869> so<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:17.770> game<00:01:17.920> type<00:01:18.159> originally

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
of course so the game type originally

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.849 
of course so the game type originally
didn't<00:01:19.060> eat<00:01:19.179> a<00:01:19.209> lot<00:01:19.569> of<00:01:19.719> work<00:01:19.899> it<00:01:20.170> just<00:01:20.649> did<00:01:20.829> not

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
didn't eat a lot of work it just did not

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.010 
didn't eat a lot of work it just did not
play<00:01:21.249> at<00:01:21.459> all<00:01:21.490> but<00:01:21.909> I<00:01:22.090> managed<00:01:22.719> to<00:01:22.869> make<00:01:22.990> it

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
play at all but I managed to make it

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.139 
play at all but I managed to make it
where<00:01:23.289> players<00:01:23.530> are<00:01:23.859> not<00:01:24.039> inspired<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.789> have

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
where players are not inspired to have

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.940 
where players are not inspired to have
just<00:01:25.479> beat<00:01:25.659> down<00:01:25.840> battles<00:01:26.259> you<00:01:26.649> can<00:01:26.770> actually

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
just beat down battles you can actually

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.160 
just beat down battles you can actually
kind<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.399> splatter<00:01:27.700> people<00:01:28.090> now<00:01:28.270> which<00:01:28.810> isn't

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
kind of splatter people now which isn't

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.469 
kind of splatter people now which isn't
really<00:01:29.380> that<00:01:29.770> code<00:01:30.009> if<00:01:30.130> idea<00:01:30.459> but<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.299> better

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
really that code if idea but the better

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.840 
really that code if idea but the better
half<00:01:31.779> at<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:31.959> time<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.499> won't<00:01:32.829> happen<00:01:33.189> you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
half at the time it won't happen you

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.179 
half at the time it won't happen you
know<00:01:33.939> no<00:01:34.149> beatdowns<00:01:34.569> overall<00:01:35.319> is<00:01:35.560> probable

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
know no beatdowns overall is probable

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.889 
know no beatdowns overall is probable
that<00:01:36.219> you'll<00:01:36.609> die<00:01:36.969> by<00:01:37.240> some<00:01:37.479> sort<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.749> bad

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
that you'll die by some sort of bad
