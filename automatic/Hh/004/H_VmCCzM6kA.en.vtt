00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.860
 how to start learning management 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.259
 cocking the trigger 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.020
 the shooter must be clear 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.710
 what are the types of trigger with combat 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.620
 platoon that's nice gun look 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.530
 please here 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.110
 trigger mechanism debugged so 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:46.230
 so that the Makarov pistol is available 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:49.110
 descent with a warning here I click 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.510
 on the trigger and stops 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.520
 side arm trigger in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.100
 a certain place that is increase me 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.790
 it is necessary to pull the trigger to press it 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.399
 increasing the pressure on the trigger 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.769
 hook this is caused by pressing on 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.090
 trigger 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:12.780
 trigger pull moving forward and whispering 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.439
 rises up and rests against the roof 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.299
 rises up resisting shepherd 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.490
 further if i keep clicking on 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.210
 the trigger of the sear would be beneficial 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.650
 from under the trigger the trigger will strike at 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:32.750
 drummer i.e. a shot will happen 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:36.450
 free play goes further to compression 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.830
 a shot exactly the same 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.810
 plan a trigger with a warning 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:51.030
 there is also a sniper rifle 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:54.810
 Dragunov note 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.670
 so I squeeze free play here he 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.340
 it feels free to stop and after 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.360
 further enhance your finger on the trigger 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.250
 hook pressing finger trigger 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.430
 there is a shot besides this 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.530
 exists 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.330
 the release of the platoon and without 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:24.600
 the warnings here are characteristic 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:27.660
 An example is the Kalashnikov assault rifle 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.440
 In this case, if all the time presses 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.459
 the trigger moves without 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.910
 stopping that is no 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.900
 there is no warning and the trigger breaks down with 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:43.670
 platoon there are still types 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.730
 weapons for example gun tt where 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.239
 there is a trigger with a warning but 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.100
 without a broach there is practically no finger 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.600
 feels the movement of the trigger 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.010
 after that when you survived the free move 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.610
 he will be in a certain 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.230
 position until when 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.780
 the force will reach the excess tension 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.489
 the springs whispering and whispering will be beneficial 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.130
 under the trigger naturally occur 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.620
 a shot in this and a different difference in 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.340
 firing pistol t t and pistol 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.340
