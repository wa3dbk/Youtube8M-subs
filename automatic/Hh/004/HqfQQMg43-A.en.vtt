 she really horny but before we in 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.370

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.640
 look at the banderole give that 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.510
 Wrapped in a script gave me the fsk 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.210

 By the way, the whole thing is amazon too

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.120
 slicks so here we have the back 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.490
 fat info description with it and 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.720
 Of course, the main actor will be one 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.090
 Of course again by Johnny Depp 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.160
 So johnny dork is what the 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.390
 save film from tim bed is present 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.950
 really good friends 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.140
 That's why he's always there 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.539
 as well as many tons of hangover the 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.049
 here also gives the voice of one 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:16.090
 great figure of a speaker with it 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.630
 can you read the book the movie is going 77 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.200
 minutes 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.049
 and here we have a picture of dolby 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.130
 digital 5.1 So the movie is synonymous 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.960
 from the year 2005 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.939
 That's why you can actually say 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.130
 Innovations interest really cool just in 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.929
 these classes tim burton style and in it 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.030
 is already a little bit in number 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.929
 9 on of templeton and I love 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.369
 Just this animation style from him and 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.499
 his movies are simply all always 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.639
 very remarkable and very remarkable 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:44.499
 I'm all really cool now 

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:46.899
 Do we have the dealbook which I think right 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.729
 Cool is that we are the moon of the 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.469
 sor punched everything in the 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.939
 Mouth in it is very marked that head 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.770
 shaped by the globe and also the two 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.810
 Heads here it tries you all 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.880
 to show if you can see that 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.079
 I do think that really cool 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.090
 shaped here and the moon is 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.619
 stamped which includes the heads are 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.049
 shaped and everything is just here 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.599
 so dull and the figures are highland 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.060
 that looks really cool it's front 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.890
 Ex works really cool then let's go 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.940
 here to spin about everyone with the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.610
 analogy 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.350
 the office and tim burton's header 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.920
 writing relatively simple and black 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.310
 held 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.720
 but I think that's okay 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.310
 on the back we have the again 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.620
 moon the whole now no longer coined 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.290
 still very cool here with easy 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.050
 Float the glossy deposits of 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.880
 rest is looks really cool on a 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.410
 and some more information from 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.090
 werner that's always the case 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.730
 otherwise it is correct so far 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.260
 cool ebook what's up then 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.900
 of course, a really cool in the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.630
 the first ever ever blu-ray 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.910
 disc with the fsk logo still with the level 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.410
 logo one else is not really 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.150
 I think it's really cool 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.370
 So we also had a cool artwork 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.100
 on the disc like donation and have now 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.620
 Here's the cool part in the artwork 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.750
 all of it figures out pretty cool 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.070
 very colorful and very colorful 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.170
 So I have to say it is again 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.780
 a really cool Berners-lee book 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.950
 become the right film and strengthen 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.350

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.550
 wants to buy herself in her buy 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.990
