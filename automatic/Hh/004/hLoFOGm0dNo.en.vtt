okay today I'm going to do a quick video
on<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.689> playing<00:00:04.500> field<00:00:05.629> trigger<00:00:06.629> this<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.620> a

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
on the playing field trigger this is a

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.330 
on the playing field trigger this is a
number<00:00:09.330> one<00:00:09.480> mark<00:00:10.110> 3<00:00:11.450> it's<00:00:12.450> been<00:00:12.599> sport<00:00:12.960> arised

number one mark 3 it's been sport arised

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.450 
number one mark 3 it's been sport arised
of<00:00:14.340> course<00:00:14.610> there's<00:00:15.139> the<00:00:16.139> actual<00:00:16.379> trick<00:00:16.800> catch

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
of course there's the actual trick catch

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.880 
of course there's the actual trick catch
will<00:00:17.640> trigger<00:00:17.880> blade<00:00:18.150> here<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.619> see

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
will trigger blade here and you can see

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.759 
will trigger blade here and you can see
these<00:00:20.670> two<00:00:21.590> small<00:00:22.590> protrusions<00:00:24.170> this<00:00:25.170> one

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
these two small protrusions this one

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.640 
these two small protrusions this one
appears<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.400> first<00:00:27.320> stage<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
appears to be the first stage of the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.070 
appears to be the first stage of the
trigger<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.510> appears<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.720> be<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
trigger and this appears to be the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.170 
trigger and this appears to be the
second<00:00:31.439> stage<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> trigger<00:00:32.279> problem<00:00:33.090> with

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
second stage of the trigger problem with

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.319 
second stage of the trigger problem with
the<00:00:33.270> trigger<00:00:33.510> wires<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:35.000> first<00:00:36.000> stage<00:00:36.180> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the trigger wires is it first stage is

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.680 
the trigger wires is it first stage is
very<00:00:36.510> long<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.309> can<00:00:38.309> kind<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.640> feel<00:00:38.879> crunchy

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
very long and can kind of feel crunchy

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.819 
very long and can kind of feel crunchy
rough<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.059> then<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.210> get<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.590> point

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
rough and then you get to this point

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.040 
rough and then you get to this point
where<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.129> stops<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> squeeze<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
where it stops and then you squeeze a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.630 
where it stops and then you squeeze a
little<00:00:46.110> harder<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.620> let's<00:00:46.770> off<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
little harder and let's off just the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
little harder and let's off just the
first<00:00:47.879> stage<00:00:48.149> wasn't<00:00:48.780> quite<00:00:49.260> annoying

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
first stage wasn't quite annoying

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.189 
first stage wasn't quite annoying
because<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> felt<00:00:50.010> quite<00:00:50.250> rough<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:52.079> was

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
because it felt quite rough and it was

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.900 
because it felt quite rough and it was
inconsistent<00:00:52.649> sometimes<00:00:53.340> it'll<00:00:53.579> let<00:00:53.760> off

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
inconsistent sometimes it'll let off

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.439 
inconsistent sometimes it'll let off
sometimes<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.020> wouldn't<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:56.449> pretty

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
sometimes it wouldn't and it's pretty

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.029 
sometimes it wouldn't and it's pretty
detrimental<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> accuracy<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.649> see

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
detrimental to the accuracy you can see

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.770 
detrimental to the accuracy you can see
further<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.640> here

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780

this<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.260> section<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:06.090> actually

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
this is section this is what actually

this is section this is what actually
engages<00:01:07.830> with<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.280> bolt<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.470> lets<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.850> moves

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
engages with the bolt and lets it moves

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.280 
engages with the bolt and lets it moves
down<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.770> actually<00:01:14.240> see<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.080> I

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
down and you can actually see here if I

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.960 
down and you can actually see here if I
place<00:01:16.920> my<00:01:16.950> finger<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.520> trigger

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
place my finger on the trigger

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.179 
place my finger on the trigger
you<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.409> moving<00:01:19.850> downwards<00:01:20.850> that's

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
you can see that moving downwards that's

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
you can see that moving downwards that's
the<00:01:23.189> first<00:01:23.520> stage<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.750> second

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the first stage and then the second

stage engages you can see that quite

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.149 
stage engages you can see that quite
clearly<00:01:28.619> there<00:01:29.540> this<00:01:30.540> actually<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.259> top

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.440 
section actually engages on this section
of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> bolt<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.909> slips<00:01:39.240> back

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
of the bolt here and then slips back

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.530 
of the bolt here and then slips back
into<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.900> angled<00:01:40.380> section<00:01:41.030> as<00:01:42.030> far<00:01:42.240> as<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.479> can

these sections are I'll install the bolt
if<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.700> can<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.270> we'll<00:02:18.480> see<00:02:19.280> how<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.340> sucker

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
if I can and we'll see how the sucker

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.560 
if I can and we'll see how the sucker
works<00:02:21.770> as<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:23.010> can<00:02:23.160> see<00:02:23.490> it's<00:02:23.970> coming<00:02:24.270> back

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
works as you can see it's coming back

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.550 
works as you can see it's coming back
it's<00:02:25.070> catching<00:02:26.070> there<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.050> try<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.350> in

it's catching there and if I try this in

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.020 
it's catching there and if I try this in
one<00:02:28.770> hand<00:02:29.100> I'm<00:02:29.310> going<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.520> put<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.820> down<00:02:29.880> a

one hand I'm going to put this down a

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.890 
one hand I'm going to put this down a
second<00:02:30.480> because<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:33.410> con<00:02:34.410> close<00:02:35.900> there

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
second because it's a con close there

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.980 
second because it's a con close there
you<00:02:37.530> can<00:02:37.680> actually<00:02:37.800> see<00:02:38.630> it's<00:02:39.630> actually

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
you can actually see it's actually

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.950 
you can actually see it's actually
sitting<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:41.150> sitting<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.450> surface

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
sitting on that sitting on that surface

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.070 
sitting on that sitting on that surface
there<00:02:43.290> now<00:02:44.120> there's<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.180> bit<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.360> grace<00:02:45.780> there

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
there now there's a bit of grace there

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.170 
there now there's a bit of grace there
so<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.710> service<00:02:47.070> is<00:02:47.220> quite<00:02:47.640> polished

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
so that service is quite polished

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.320 
so that service is quite polished
I<00:02:48.240> wouldn't<00:02:48.750> recommend<00:02:49.080> touching<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.940> end<00:02:51.150> of

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
I wouldn't recommend touching the end of

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.780 
I wouldn't recommend touching the end of
this<00:02:51.450> where<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.780> touches<00:02:52.280> because<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.400> alter

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
this where it touches because you alter

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.050 
this where it touches because you alter
the<00:02:54.440> geometry<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:55.920> can<00:02:56.190> alter<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
the geometry of that you can alter the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.400 
the geometry of that you can alter the
weight<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.810> poor<00:02:58.050> boots

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
weight of poor boots

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.110 
weight of poor boots
unless<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.280> really<00:02:59.400> know<00:02:59.640> what<00:02:59.670> you're<00:02:59.910> doing

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.030 
unless you really know what you're doing
I<00:03:00.210> wouldn't<00:03:00.510> get<00:03:00.600> into<00:03:00.780> filing<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.470> I'm<00:03:01.710> not

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
I wouldn't get into filing that I'm not

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.610 
I wouldn't get into filing that I'm not
going<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.250> bother<00:03:03.230> because<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.260> don't<00:03:04.410> want<00:03:04.560> to

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
going to bother because I don't want to

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.990 
going to bother because I don't want to
start<00:03:04.800> replacing<00:03:05.100> parts<00:03:05.670> because<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:05.910> only

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
start replacing parts because you only

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.020 
start replacing parts because you only
get<00:03:06.120> one<00:03:06.300> shot<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.960> do<00:03:07.080> if<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.230> fuck<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.620> up

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
get one shot if you do if you fuck it up

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.220 
get one shot if you do if you fuck it up
you've<00:03:09.030> got<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.270> replace<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.110> don't

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
you've got to replace it so I don't

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.110 
you've got to replace it so I don't
unless<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.310> know<00:03:11.430> you're<00:03:11.580> doing<00:03:11.670> dunk<00:03:11.970> I've

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
unless you know you're doing dunk I've

fallen and I don't know enough about it

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.630 
fallen and I don't know enough about it
I<00:03:13.710> just<00:03:13.740> wanted<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.160> make<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.340> trigger<00:03:14.610> a

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
I just wanted to make the trigger a

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.210 
I just wanted to make the trigger a
little<00:03:14.700> bit<00:03:14.910> smoother<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:16.530> as<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.800> can<00:03:16.950> see

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
little bit smoother and as you can see

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.840 
little bit smoother and as you can see
now<00:03:17.460> when<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.880> engage<00:03:19.160> when<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.280> engage<00:03:20.460> the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
now when you engage when you engage the

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.050 
now when you engage when you engage the
first<00:03:21.090> stage<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:23.190> second<00:03:23.550> stage<00:03:23.580> clicks

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
first stage and the second stage clicks

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.270 
first stage and the second stage clicks
and<00:03:24.240> you<00:03:24.300> can<00:03:24.450> see<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.780> slowly<00:03:25.650> sliding<00:03:26.010> off

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
and you can see it slowly sliding off

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.000 
and you can see it slowly sliding off
squeeze<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.850> little<00:03:26.940> bit<00:03:27.090> more<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:28.410> off<00:03:28.800> we<00:03:28.980> go

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
squeeze a little bit more and off we go

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.320 
squeeze a little bit more and off we go
it's<00:03:29.670> popped<00:03:30.000> off

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.110 

but<00:03:33.330> basically<00:03:33.710> what<00:03:34.710> I<00:03:34.740> did<00:03:34.980> was<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.400> polish

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
but basically what I did was to polish

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.800 
but basically what I did was to polish
the<00:03:36.240> bolt<00:03:36.590> surface<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.740> it<00:03:37.830> -<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.760> want<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.240> sort

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
the bolt surface to it - you want I sort

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.470 
the bolt surface to it - you want I sort
of<00:03:39.840> did<00:03:39.990> -<00:03:40.140> like<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.290> mirror<00:03:40.620> finish<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.580> then

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
of did - like a mirror finish and then

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.040 
of did - like a mirror finish and then
just<00:03:42.690> Polish<00:03:43.490> polish<00:03:44.490> these<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.780> lumps

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
just Polish polish these to the lumps

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.670 
just Polish polish these to the lumps
here

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
here

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.530 
here
I<00:03:46.710> even<00:03:47.430> polished<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:47.940> surface<00:03:48.300> I<00:03:48.360> don't

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
I even polished this surface I don't

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.480 
I even polished this surface I don't
think<00:03:48.660> that's<00:03:48.780> necessary<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.740> and<00:03:50.070> polished

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
think that's necessary and and polished

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.020 
think that's necessary and and polished
in<00:03:51.060> here<00:03:51.330> as<00:03:51.450> well<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:53.310> it's<00:03:53.520> made<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.850> Roux

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
in here as well and it's made that Roux

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.060 
in here as well and it's made that Roux
a<00:03:54.060> little<00:03:54.360> bit<00:03:54.480> smoother<00:03:55.020> another<00:03:55.890> is

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
a little bit smoother another is

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.480 
a little bit smoother another is

Canada<00:04:02.490> I<00:04:02.520> think<00:04:02.850> on<00:04:02.970> Wisconsin<00:04:03.810> or<00:04:03.900> wherever

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
Canada I think on Wisconsin or wherever

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.010 
Canada I think on Wisconsin or wherever
it<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.290> does<00:04:04.530> does<00:04:04.980> one<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:06.030> don't<00:04:06.660> know<00:04:06.810> if<00:04:06.870> it's

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
it is does does one I don't know if it's

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.750 
it is does does one I don't know if it's
worth<00:04:07.170> getting<00:04:07.560> in<00:04:07.680> but<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:08.490> definitely

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
worth getting in but it's definitely

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.930 
worth getting in but it's definitely
better<00:04:09.210> than<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:10.620> was<00:04:11.100> when<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.310> originally<00:04:11.760> got

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
better than it was when I originally got

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.860 
better than it was when I originally got
it<00:04:12.590> because<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.770> actual<00:04:14.270> natural<00:04:15.270> surface

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
it because the actual natural surface

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.710 
it because the actual natural surface
here<00:04:16.109> here<00:04:16.680> was<00:04:16.920> um<00:04:17.160> on<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:18.120> bot<00:04:18.299> was<00:04:18.420> actually

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
here here was um on the bot was actually

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.630 
here here was um on the bot was actually
quite<00:04:18.930> rough<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.310> had<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> little

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
quite rough and that you had a little

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.590 
quite rough and that you had a little
indentation

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
indentation

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.120 
indentation
in<00:04:23.560> there<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:24.010> that<00:04:24.990> yeah<00:04:25.990> that's<00:04:26.920> basically

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
in there so that yeah that's basically

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.870 
in there so that yeah that's basically
it

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
it

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.040

I<00:04:27.960> mean<00:04:28.960> these<00:04:29.170> rifles<00:04:29.620> are<00:04:29.740> renowned<00:04:30.040> for

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
I mean these rifles are renowned for

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.990 
I mean these rifles are renowned for
having<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.140> slightly<00:04:32.410> rough<00:04:32.710> trigger<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.370> mean

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
having a slightly rough trigger I mean

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.630 
having a slightly rough trigger I mean
the<00:04:34.150> trigger<00:04:34.930> is<00:04:35.140> very<00:04:35.650> simple<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:36.250> it's<00:04:36.370> in

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
the trigger is very simple and it's in

the trigger is very simple and it's in
its<00:04:36.790> design<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:38.250> it'll<00:04:39.250> be<00:04:39.340> very<00:04:39.490> reliable

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110

break even if it was to fill up with
dirt<00:04:44.440> or<00:04:44.650> water<00:04:45.060> it's<00:04:46.060> still<00:04:46.150> function<00:04:46.830> and
