a pretty nice it's not that heavy it
does<00:00:52.230> come<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:53.070> base<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:54.000> i<00:00:54.030> like

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
does come with a little base but i like

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.900 
does come with a little base but i like
i<00:00:54.690> said<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.050> packed<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.399> projects<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
i said it's packed so the projects that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.729 
i said it's packed so the projects that
i<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.539> me<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.440> let's<00:00:58.469> go

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
i don't have it here with me so let's go

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.170 
i don't have it here with me so let's go
ahead<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.949> transform<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.850> want<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> grab

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
ahead and transform it you want to grab

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.160 
ahead and transform it you want to grab
this<00:01:00.510> leg<00:01:00.809> down<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.410> pull<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.930> on<00:01:03.930> both

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
this leg down and pull like this on both

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.570 
this leg down and pull like this on both
sides<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.830> we're<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> other<00:01:05.460> one

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
sides so we're going to do the other one

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.370 
sides so we're going to do the other one
too<00:01:06.830> once<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.010> get<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.400> we're<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.380> pull

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
too once we get that we're going to pull

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.800 
too once we get that we're going to pull
out<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.590> leg<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.270> look<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.450> other<00:01:12.479> leg

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
out the leg like this look the other leg

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.370 
out the leg like this look the other leg
as<00:01:12.990> well<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:14.119> feel<00:01:15.119> these<00:01:16.040> from<00:01:17.040> here<00:01:18.380> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
as well and we feel these from here and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.109 
as well and we feel these from here and
I<00:01:20.600> do<00:01:21.600> not<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.229> any<00:01:23.000> nails<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:25.790> there's<00:01:26.790> one

inside here that you want to pull out to

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.969 
inside here that you want to pull out to
endow<00:01:30.829> stabilize<00:01:33.020> stabilize<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.350> figure<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
endow stabilize stabilize the figure a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.740 
endow stabilize stabilize the figure a
little<00:01:35.250> bit<00:01:35.340> more<00:01:35.549> when<00:01:36.150> you're<00:01:36.270> trying<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750

the other one and one of the cool things
about<00:02:20.610> these<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:22.050> top<00:02:22.830> ten<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
about these is that is a top ten to the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.960 
about these is that is a top ten to the
