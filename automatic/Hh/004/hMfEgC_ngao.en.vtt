00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.999 

okay<00:00:01.350> so<00:00:01.939> this<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.210> our<00:00:03.449> cell<00:00:04.020> model<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.890> this

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
okay so this is our cell model and this

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.570 
okay so this is our cell model and this
is<00:00:05.069> really<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.640> only<00:00:05.850> part<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.810> lab<00:00:07.109> to

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
is really the only part of the lab to

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.669 
is really the only part of the lab to
exercise<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.610> isn't<00:00:09.450> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.780> be<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:09.900> Angel

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
exercise that isn't going to be on Angel

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.339 
exercise that isn't going to be on Angel
in<00:00:10.920> another<00:00:11.639> form<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> just<00:00:12.840> wanted<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.200> go

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
in another form so I just wanted to go

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.070 
in another form so I just wanted to go
through<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.860> with<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.219> quickly<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.630> can

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
through it with you quickly so you can

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.269 
through it with you quickly so you can
see<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.740> nucleus<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> cell<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
see the nucleus of the cell here the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.900 
see the nucleus of the cell here the
white<00:00:20.670> part<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.189> representing<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
white part here is representing the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.859 
white part here is representing the
nuclear<00:00:24.449> envelope<00:00:25.699> okay<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.539> really

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
nuclear envelope okay this is really

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.720 
nuclear envelope okay this is really
more<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.260> inner<00:00:28.650> layer<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> nuclear

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
more the inner layer of the nuclear

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.359 
more the inner layer of the nuclear
envelope<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.439> also<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:32.040> some<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
envelope and then you also have some of

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.970 
envelope and then you also have some of
the<00:00:32.489> outer<00:00:32.790> surface<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.530> nuclear

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the outer surface of the nuclear

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.370 
the outer surface of the nuclear
envelope<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.059> green<00:00:36.390> okay<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.260> then

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
envelope here in green okay and then

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.950 
envelope here in green okay and then
here's<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> internal<00:00:38.520> environment<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
here's the internal environment of the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.709 
here's the internal environment of the
nucleus<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.890> where<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.719> genetic

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
nucleus this is where the genetic

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.590 
nucleus this is where the genetic
material<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.590> chromatin<00:00:44.250> would<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
material the chromatin would be and you

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.979 
material the chromatin would be and you
can<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> nucleolus<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.480> here<00:00:48.480> as<00:00:48.690> well

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
can see the nucleolus in here as well

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.439 
can see the nucleolus in here as well
okay<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> nucleolus<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.000> where<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
okay and the nucleolus is where you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.340 
okay and the nucleolus is where you
produce<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:53.210> components<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.360> your<00:00:54.420> ribosomes

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
produce the components of your ribosomes

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.020 
produce the components of your ribosomes
the<00:00:55.620> subunits<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> make<00:00:56.850> your

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the subunits that go to make your

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.590 
the subunits that go to make your
ribosomes<00:00:57.800> okay<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.520> come<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
ribosomes okay so we come out of the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.030 
ribosomes okay so we come out of the
nucleus<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.820> here<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> contents

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
nucleus and here is all of the contents

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.910 
nucleus and here is all of the contents
of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:06.409> cytoplasm<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:09.540> plasma<00:01:10.170> membrane<00:01:10.680> is

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
of the cytoplasm the plasma membrane is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.010 
of the cytoplasm the plasma membrane is
around<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.890> external<00:01:13.890> surface<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.610> cell

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
around the external surface of the cell

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.590 
around the external surface of the cell
okay<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.740> all<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.670> material<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.509> you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
okay so all of this material that you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.100 
okay so all of this material that you
see<00:01:18.869> that's<00:01:19.259> kind<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.680> squiggly<00:01:20.630> that's<00:01:21.630> going

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
see that's kind of squiggly that's going

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.620 
see that's kind of squiggly that's going
around<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> cell<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.580> has<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.330> green

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
around in the cell that has the green

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.520 
around in the cell that has the green
with<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> white<00:01:25.500> dots<00:01:25.970> that<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.330> all<00:01:27.659> rough

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
with the white dots that is all rough

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.140 
with the white dots that is all rough
endoplasmic<00:01:29.630> reticulum<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.900> white<00:01:31.590> dots

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
endoplasmic reticulum the white dots

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.390 
endoplasmic reticulum the white dots
represent<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> ribosomes<00:01:33.869> which<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:35.130> where

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
represent the ribosomes which is where

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.080 
represent the ribosomes which is where
you<00:01:35.640> string<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.869> amino<00:01:37.710> acids<00:01:38.280> together<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
you string the amino acids together to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.350 
you string the amino acids together to
make<00:01:39.329> your<00:01:40.200> polypeptides<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
make your polypeptides and then the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.350 
make your polypeptides and then the
polypeptides<00:01:43.170> go<00:01:43.500> into<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> lumen<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
polypeptides go into the lumen of the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.980 
polypeptides go into the lumen of the
rough<00:01:45.540> ER<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.579> they<00:01:47.579> are<00:01:47.939> converted<00:01:48.810> into

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
rough ER and they are converted into

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.060 
rough ER and they are converted into
functional<00:01:49.619> proteins<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.270> location

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
functional proteins in that location

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.950 
functional proteins in that location
okay<00:01:53.100> where<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.890> sections<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.960> this

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
okay where you have sections of this

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.980 
okay where you have sections of this
material<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.619> don't<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.689> the<00:02:00.689> little

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
material that don't have the little

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.280 
material that don't have the little
white<00:02:01.170> dots<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.829> them<00:02:02.390> those<00:02:03.390> are<00:02:03.630> sections<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
white dots on them those are sections a

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.310 
white dots on them those are sections a
smooth<00:02:04.649> ER<00:02:06.079> okay

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
smooth ER okay

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.249 
smooth ER okay
so<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.770> smooth<00:02:08.069> ER<00:02:08.280> there's<00:02:09.270> obviously<00:02:09.959> less

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
so the smooth ER there's obviously less

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.740 
so the smooth ER there's obviously less
of

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
of

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.610 
of
in<00:02:10.930> cell<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.850> smooth<00:02:13.150> ER<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.930> where<00:02:14.380> you

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
in cell and the smooth ER is where you

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.720 
in cell and the smooth ER is where you
would<00:02:14.770> do<00:02:14.950> limp<00:02:15.310> lipid<00:02:15.970> synthesis<00:02:16.960> and

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
would do limp lipid synthesis and

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.250 
would do limp lipid synthesis and
metabolism<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.300> really<00:02:19.630> only<00:02:19.990> find

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
metabolism so you really only find

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.400 
metabolism so you really only find
smooth<00:02:20.710> ER<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.520> cells<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.570> need<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.990> do<00:02:23.170> those

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
smooth ER in cells that need to do those

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.350 
smooth ER in cells that need to do those
jobs<00:02:24.060> okay<00:02:25.260> over<00:02:26.260> here<00:02:26.740> we<00:02:27.280> have<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.730> Golgi

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
jobs okay over here we have the Golgi

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.080 
jobs okay over here we have the Golgi
apparatus<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:31.000> Golgi<00:02:31.570> apparatus<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:33.090> an

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
apparatus and the Golgi apparatus is an

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.050 
apparatus and the Golgi apparatus is an
organelle<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.750> packages<00:02:35.710> proteins<00:02:36.310> that

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
organelle that packages proteins that

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.190 
organelle that packages proteins that

the cell these orange structures that
you<00:03:02.620> see<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:03.340> have<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:05.400> internal<00:03:06.400> foldings

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
you see that have the internal foldings

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.590 
you see that have the internal foldings
in<00:03:07.600> their<00:03:07.900> membrane<00:03:08.440> are<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.760> mitochondria

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
in their membrane are the mitochondria

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.340

just<00:03:30.670> looking<00:03:30.910> at<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.120> key<00:03:31.300> and<00:03:31.540> saying<00:03:31.870> oh

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
just looking at the key and saying oh

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.870 
just looking at the key and saying oh
the<00:03:32.530> yellow<00:03:32.650> ones<00:03:32.950> must<00:03:33.220> be<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
the yellow ones must be this and the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.750 
the yellow ones must be this and the
black<00:03:34.690> ones<00:03:34.959> must<00:03:35.170> be<00:03:35.320> this<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:35.860> this

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
black ones must be this is this

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.970 
black ones must be this is this
structure<00:03:37.180> right<00:03:37.540> here<00:03:38.050> and<00:03:38.230> this<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.680> the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
structure right here and this is the

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.860 
structure right here and this is the
centrosome<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.299> can<00:03:40.450> see<00:03:40.600> that<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:40.840> have

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
centrosome so you can see that you have

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.680 
centrosome so you can see that you have
these<00:03:41.200> two<00:03:41.610> little<00:03:42.610> bar<00:03:42.790> like<00:03:43.090> structures

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
these two little bar like structures

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.539 
these two little bar like structures
that<00:03:43.930> are<00:03:43.989> arranged<00:03:44.650> at<00:03:44.769> right<00:03:44.980> angles<00:03:45.459> to

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
that are arranged at right angles to

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.449 
that are arranged at right angles to
each<00:03:45.700> other<00:03:46.140> okay<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.650> older<00:03:47.950> name<00:03:48.130> for

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
each other okay and the older name for

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.550 
each other okay and the older name for
the<00:03:48.519> centrosome<00:03:49.120> remember<00:03:49.660> is<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.930> centriole

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
the centrosome remember is the centriole

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.930 
the centrosome remember is the centriole
pair<00:03:51.390> okay<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.930> centrosome<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.670> place

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
pair okay so the centrosome is the place

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.699 
pair okay so the centrosome is the place
where<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:56.790> can<00:03:57.790> organize<00:03:58.330> your<00:03:58.709> microtubules

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
where you can organize your microtubules

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.420 
where you can organize your microtubules
and<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.130> this<00:04:00.280> will<00:04:00.400> have<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.610> job<00:04:00.940> doing<00:04:01.299> that

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
and so this will have a job doing that

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.759 
and so this will have a job doing that
function<00:04:03.430> in<00:04:03.670> regular<00:04:04.299> cell<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:04.959> then<00:04:05.530> you

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
function in regular cell and then you

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.630 
function in regular cell and then you
make<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.010> second<00:04:06.670> one<00:04:06.910> going<00:04:07.720> into<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:09.220> mitotic

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
make a second one going into the mitotic

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.940 
make a second one going into the mitotic
phase<00:04:10.060> so<00:04:10.420> that<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:10.690> can<00:04:10.900> have<00:04:11.410> one<00:04:11.680> at<00:04:11.830> each

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
phase so that you can have one at each

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.100 
phase so that you can have one at each
end<00:04:12.220> of<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.459> cell<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.850> organize<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.600> spindle

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
end of the cell to organize the spindle

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.789 
end of the cell to organize the spindle
okay<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:14.920> that's<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.880> model<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.200> cell<00:04:17.470> and

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
okay so that's the model of the cell and

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.890 
okay so that's the model of the cell and
you'll<00:04:18.070> be<00:04:18.250> seeing<00:04:18.580> it<00:04:18.789> on<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.239> quiz<00:04:19.510> next

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
you'll be seeing it on the quiz next

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.080 
you'll be seeing it on the quiz next
week
