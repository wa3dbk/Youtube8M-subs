00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
guy's pretty hard but the technique to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.010 
guy's pretty hard but the technique to
kill<00:01:23.340> him<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.909> double<00:01:24.180> jump<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.600> hit<00:01:24.810> him

a<00:03:22.420> juggle<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.930> sorts<00:03:23.290> where<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.500> just<00:03:23.680> can't

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
a juggle of sorts where you just can't

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.620 
a juggle of sorts where you just can't
get<00:03:24.070> out<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.519> keep<00:03:24.760> hitting<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.209> like<00:03:25.420> I'm

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
get out and you keep hitting it like I'm

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.630 
get out and you keep hitting it like I'm
doing<00:03:25.660> now<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.830> better<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.280> are<00:03:27.310> at<00:03:27.430> this

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
doing now and the better you are at this

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.520 
doing now and the better you are at this
technique<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.480> faster<00:03:28.900> you'll<00:03:29.049> do<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.380> and

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
technique the faster you'll do it and

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.530 
technique the faster you'll do it and
the<00:03:29.590> less<00:03:29.739> mistakes<00:03:30.160> you'll<00:03:30.400> have<00:03:30.610> got<00:03:30.910> this

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
the less mistakes you'll have got this

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.780 
the less mistakes you'll have got this
is<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.930> think<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.590> second<00:03:33.010> time<00:03:33.190> I've<00:03:33.370> tried<00:03:33.519> to

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
is I think the second time I've tried to

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.020 
is I think the second time I've tried to
do<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.299> I'm<00:03:34.630> not<00:03:34.660> very<00:03:34.930> good<00:03:35.080> but<00:03:35.890> if<00:03:36.880> you

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
do it and I'm not very good but if you

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.670 
do it and I'm not very good but if you
practice<00:03:37.450> you'll<00:03:37.720> obviously<00:03:38.140> get<00:03:38.290> super<00:03:38.530> good

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
practice you'll obviously get super good

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.520 
practice you'll obviously get super good
at<00:03:38.769> it<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:40.360> this<00:03:40.630> is<00:03:40.810> probably<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.290> first

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
at it and this is probably the first

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.990 
at it and this is probably the first
boss<00:03:41.799> people<00:03:42.010> are<00:03:42.220> gonna<00:03:42.310> have<00:03:42.519> trouble<00:03:42.820> with

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
boss people are gonna have trouble with

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.030 
boss people are gonna have trouble with
because<00:03:43.600> this<00:03:44.170> guy<00:03:44.350> can<00:03:44.530> kill<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:44.799> in<00:03:44.920> like

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
because this guy can kill you in like

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.490 
because this guy can kill you in like
one<00:03:45.220> or<00:03:45.250> two<00:03:45.370> hits<00:03:45.700> e-easy<00:03:46.000> hurts<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.780> lot<00:03:47.140> and

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
one or two hits e-easy hurts a lot and

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.860 
one or two hits e-easy hurts a lot and
this<00:03:48.310> is<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.549> first<00:03:48.760> mission<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.690> guide

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
this is the first mission of the guide

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.509 
this is the first mission of the guide
so<00:03:50.140> far<00:03:50.380> where<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.590> don't<00:03:50.709> get<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.190> S<00:03:51.310> rank

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
so far where I don't get the S rank

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.090 
so far where I don't get the S rank
because<00:03:51.940> this<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.079> second<00:03:53.500> take<00:03:53.680> when<00:03:54.070> I

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
because this is the second take when I

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.069 
because this is the second take when I
beat<00:03:54.370> him<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.700> first<00:03:54.910> take<00:03:55.180> he<00:03:55.570> I<00:03:55.720> got<00:03:55.959> him

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
beat him the first take he I got him

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.810 
beat him the first take he I got him
down<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.290> low<00:03:56.560> life<00:03:56.799> I<00:03:57.010> jumped<00:03:57.310> up<00:03:57.400> there<00:03:57.459> and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
down to low life I jumped up there and

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.970 
down to low life I jumped up there and
he<00:03:57.880> killed<00:03:58.150> me<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.660> if<00:03:59.140> he<00:03:59.260> had<00:03:59.350> not<00:03:59.530> killed<00:03:59.739> me

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
he killed me and if he had not killed me

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.199 
he killed me and if he had not killed me
I<00:04:00.010> don't<00:04:00.280> know<00:04:00.370> if<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.519> would<00:04:00.730> have<00:04:00.790> got<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> S

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
I don't know if I would have got the S

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.660 
I don't know if I would have got the S
but<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:01.810> kind<00:04:02.049> of<00:04:02.170> think<00:04:02.709> in<00:04:02.920> my<00:04:03.040> mind<00:04:03.070> I<00:04:03.489> would

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
but I kind of think in my mind I would

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.830 
but I kind of think in my mind I would
have<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.030> would<00:04:04.120> have<00:04:04.209> been<00:04:04.299> really<00:04:04.540> nice

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
have and it would have been really nice

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.530 
have and it would have been really nice
cuz<00:04:05.170> this<00:04:05.709> is<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:05.920> first<00:04:06.040> really<00:04:06.820> challenging

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
cuz this is the first really challenging

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.120 
cuz this is the first really challenging
