couldn't<00:00:43.820> sell<00:00:44.059> them<00:00:44.239> on<00:00:44.329> since<00:00:44.660> they<00:00:44.780> don't

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
couldn't sell them on since they don't

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.880

stuff<00:00:49.160> than<00:00:49.340> I<00:00:49.399> ever<00:00:49.430> use<00:00:49.910> and<00:00:50.379> for<00:00:51.379> this<00:00:51.800> I

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
stuff than I ever use and for this I

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.889 
stuff than I ever use and for this I
decided<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:52.700> use<00:00:52.820> these<00:00:53.090> little<00:00:53.390> tear<00:00:53.660> drop

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
decided to use these little tear drop

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.990 
decided to use these little tear drop
shaped<00:00:54.260> ones<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:54.980> these<00:00:55.160> little<00:00:55.489> round<00:00:55.640> ones

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
shaped ones and these little round ones

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.689 
shaped ones and these little round ones
and<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:57.440> was<00:00:57.530> convenient<00:00:57.949> since<00:00:58.250> I<00:00:58.370> had<00:00:58.550> them

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
and it was convenient since I had them

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.380 
and it was convenient since I had them
both<00:00:58.910> in<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.870> same<00:01:00.050> color<00:01:00.940> just<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.059> make<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.270> a

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
both in the same color just to make it a

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.900 
both in the same color just to make it a
little<00:01:02.809> bit<00:01:03.020> easier<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.469> work<00:01:03.620> with<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:04.190> kind<00:01:04.879> of

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
little bit easier to work with I kind of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.660 
little bit easier to work with I kind of
cut<00:01:05.149> out<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.449> bottom<00:01:05.840> of<00:01:06.110> just<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:07.070> paper<00:01:07.310> cup

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
cut out the bottom of just a paper cup

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.639 
cut out the bottom of just a paper cup
and<00:01:07.940> dump<00:01:08.390> some<00:01:08.660> out<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.320> they're<00:01:09.470> just

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
and dump some out so that they're just

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.230 
and dump some out so that they're just
laying<00:01:09.950> flat<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.140> easier<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.259> pick<00:01:12.470> up<00:01:12.649> and

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
laying flat and easier to pick up and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.270 
laying flat and easier to pick up and
then<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.360> just<00:01:14.509> have<00:01:14.720> an<00:01:14.840> orange<00:01:15.200> stick<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.830> pick

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
then I just have an orange stick to pick

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.790 
then I just have an orange stick to pick
them<00:01:16.459> up<00:01:16.550> with<00:01:16.789> and<00:01:17.149> you<00:01:17.990> can<00:01:18.170> dip<00:01:18.349> the<00:01:18.500> end<00:01:18.649> of

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
so if I cover up the camera but at times

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.350 
so if I cover up the camera but at times
I'm<00:02:30.980> going<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.400> start<00:02:31.640> with<00:02:31.790> one<00:02:31.820> there

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
I'm going to just start with one there

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.320 
I'm going to just start with one there
and<00:02:33.010> then<00:02:34.010> leaving<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.610> little<00:02:34.910> bit<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.120> open

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
and then leaving a little bit of open

space<00:02:35.840> I'm<00:02:36.350> going<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.680> place<00:02:36.890> one<00:02:37.190> opposite

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
space I'm going to place one opposite

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.630 
space I'm going to place one opposite
that<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.830> if<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:39.950> don't<00:02:40.160> get<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.400> placed

that and if you don't get it placed

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.420 
that and if you don't get it placed
perfectly<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.840> know<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.230> top<00:02:42.860> coat<00:02:43.160> should

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
perfectly you know the top coat should

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.460 
perfectly you know the top coat should
be<00:02:43.610> wet<00:02:43.940> enough<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.570> can<00:02:44.750> adjust<00:02:45.020> it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
be wet enough that you can adjust it

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.640 
be wet enough that you can adjust it
around<00:02:45.710> a<00:02:45.860> little<00:02:45.890> bit<00:02:46.840> but<00:02:47.840> try<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.350> be<00:02:48.530> as

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
around a little bit but try to be as

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.850 
around a little bit but try to be as
accurate<00:02:48.920> as<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.460> can<00:02:49.760> work<00:02:50.750> fairly<00:02:51.410> quickly

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
accurate as you can work fairly quickly

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.900

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
so that you are working won't still wet

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.260 
so that you are working won't still wet
and<00:02:57.910> I'm<00:02:58.910> just<00:02:59.150> placing<00:02:59.510> them<00:03:00.640> with<00:03:01.640> like<00:03:02.240> I
