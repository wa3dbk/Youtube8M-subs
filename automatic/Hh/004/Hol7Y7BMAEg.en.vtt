00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.710 

all<00:00:01.979> right<00:00:02.159> now<00:00:02.370> we<00:00:02.429> have<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.760> look<00:00:02.909> at<00:00:03.120> pseudo

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
all right now we have to look at pseudo

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.130 
all right now we have to look at pseudo
complex<00:00:04.290> forms<00:00:04.650> okay<00:00:05.370> so<00:00:05.540> here's<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.660> pseudo

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
complex forms okay so here's a pseudo

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.030 
complex forms okay so here's a pseudo
complex<00:00:07.649> form<00:00:07.919> right<00:00:08.910> here<00:00:09.410> how<00:00:10.410> do<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.800> get

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
complex form right here how do we get

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.419 
complex form right here how do we get
this<00:00:11.250> now<00:00:12.150> let's<00:00:12.929> look<00:00:13.110> at<00:00:13.290> these<00:00:13.590> two<00:00:14.130> for

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
this now let's look at these two for

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.369 
this now let's look at these two for
example<00:00:14.940> let's<00:00:15.210> take<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.599> ball<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:15.990> just

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
example let's take this ball and just

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.130 
example let's take this ball and just
put<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.740> right<00:00:16.770> into<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.310> geometry<00:00:17.970> now<00:00:18.570> this

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
put it right into the geometry now this

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.019 
put it right into the geometry now this
is<00:00:19.199> what<00:00:19.560> happened<00:00:20.240> we<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.840> very<00:00:22.109> low<00:00:22.500> res

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
is what happened we have a very low res

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.250 
is what happened we have a very low res
item<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:25.170> very<00:00:25.320> high<00:00:25.680> res<00:00:26.010> item<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
item and a very high res item and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.250 
item and a very high res item and
obviously<00:00:28.260> if<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.429> look<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:31.080> looks

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
obviously if you look at this it looks

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.940 
obviously if you look at this it looks
about<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> same<00:00:32.270> but<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.380> actually<00:00:34.739> one

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
about the same but this is actually one

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.330 
about the same but this is actually one
piece<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.340> geometry<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> want<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.010> do

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
piece of geometry so what I want to do

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.850 
piece of geometry so what I want to do
is<00:00:38.700> teach<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.300> how<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.960> make<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.469> basic

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
is teach you how to just make the basic

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.540 
is teach you how to just make the basic
divot<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.489> bump<00:00:42.149> okay<00:00:42.989> trust<00:00:43.530> me<00:00:43.649> there's<00:00:44.129> you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
divot and bump okay trust me there's you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.810 
divot and bump okay trust me there's you
can<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> lot<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.800> will<00:00:47.640> go

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
can do a lot with this it just will go

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.869 
can do a lot with this it just will go
into<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.360> more<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.829> start<00:00:50.070> modeling<00:00:50.640> but

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
into it more as we start modeling but

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.330 
into it more as we start modeling but
here<00:00:51.600> these<00:00:52.260> basics<00:00:52.739> need<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.129> getting

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
here these basics need to be getting

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.150 
here these basics need to be getting
covered<00:00:53.820> right<00:00:54.030> off<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> bat<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.890> go<00:00:55.920> in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
covered right off the bat so if I go in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.069 
covered right off the bat so if I go in
to<00:00:56.190> face<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.670> example<00:00:57.090> let's<00:00:57.120> put<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> divot<00:00:57.960> at

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
to face for example let's put a divot at

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.310 
to face for example let's put a divot at
the<00:00:58.199> top<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.980> bump<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> bottom<00:01:00.000> okay<00:01:00.570> so

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
the top and a bump at the bottom okay so

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.170 
the top and a bump at the bottom okay so
joining<00:01:01.800> two<00:01:02.219> shapes<00:01:03.180> together<00:01:05.030> alright<00:01:06.030> so

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
joining two shapes together alright so

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.130 
joining two shapes together alright so
it's<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.689> lot<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> extrude<00:01:08.930> scale<00:01:09.930> in

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it's a lot with the extrude scale in

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.690 
it's a lot with the extrude scale in
just<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.470> little<00:01:10.619> bit<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.280> what<00:01:11.549> that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
just a little bit and then what that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.929 
just a little bit and then what that
doesn't<00:01:11.939> inserts<00:01:12.630> an<00:01:12.869> edge<00:01:13.080> loop<00:01:13.350> around<00:01:13.880> on<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
doesn't inserts an edge loop around on a

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.590 
doesn't inserts an edge loop around on a
face<00:01:15.509> instead<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.740> round<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.189> form<00:01:17.460> okay<00:01:18.210> so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
face instead of a round of form okay so

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.690 
face instead of a round of form okay so
unlike<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.380> insert<00:01:19.920> edge<00:01:20.100> loop<00:01:20.130> tool<00:01:20.369> that

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
unlike the insert edge loop tool that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.330 
unlike the insert edge loop tool that
inserts<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.270> around<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.750> form<00:01:22.340> extrude

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
inserts it around the form extrude

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.190 
inserts it around the form extrude
actually<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:24.000> inserts<00:01:24.630> an<00:01:24.810> edge<00:01:24.990> loop

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
actually just inserts an edge loop

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.830 
actually just inserts an edge loop
across<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> face<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:27.689> about

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
across the face if you can think about

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.679 
across the face if you can think about
that<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.650> how<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.540> go

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that and how I know that is if you go

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.630 
that and how I know that is if you go
into<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:31.350> edit<00:01:31.770> mesh<00:01:31.979> insert<00:01:32.400> edge<00:01:32.610> loop

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
into now edit mesh insert edge loop

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.490 
into now edit mesh insert edge loop
before<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.720> used<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.079> all<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.320> way<00:01:34.350> around

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
before it used to go all the way around

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.200 
before it used to go all the way around
the<00:01:34.710> form<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.759> okay<00:01:36.570> well<00:01:37.729> if<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.000> want

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the form like this okay well if I want

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.149 
the form like this okay well if I want
to<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.500> undo<00:01:40.860> their<00:01:42.530> put<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> insert<00:01:43.890> edge

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
to do and undo their put the insert edge

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.980 
to do and undo their put the insert edge
loop<00:01:44.189> here<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.880> now<00:01:45.119> insert<00:01:45.630> edge<00:01:45.960> loop

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
loop here and now insert edge loop

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.749 
loop here and now insert edge loop
around<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.850> face<00:01:48.299> okay<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.610> this<00:01:50.610> is

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
around that face okay and this is

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.310 
around that face okay and this is
bracing<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> geometry<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.439> change<00:01:52.710> okay<00:01:54.320> all

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
bracing the geometry for change okay all

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.950 
bracing the geometry for change okay all
right<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.710> i<00:01:55.829> take<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.189> face<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.969> i

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
right so if i take this face now and i

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.649 
right so if i take this face now and i
do<00:01:58.020> something<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.100> where<00:01:59.939> i<00:01:59.969> extrude

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
do something like this where i extrude

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.410 
do something like this where i extrude
one<00:02:00.899> more<00:02:01.079> time<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:02.159> take<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> scale<00:02:03.180> tool

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
one more time and take the scale tool

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.389 
one more time and take the scale tool
and<00:02:03.630> scale<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:05.149> then<00:02:06.149> push<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.600> facedown

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
and scale in and then push this facedown

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.249 
and scale in and then push this facedown
what's<00:02:08.399> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> happen<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.479> next<00:02:09.780> level<00:02:10.140> of

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
what's going to happen the next level of

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.110 
what's going to happen the next level of
smooth<00:02:10.619> when<00:02:11.160> i<00:02:11.250> hit<00:02:11.400> three<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> keyboard

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
smooth when i hit three in the keyboard

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.940 
smooth when i hit three in the keyboard
it's<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.050> make<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.260> debt

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it's going to make a debt

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.820 
it's going to make a debt
geometry<00:02:14.580> okay<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.080> can<00:02:16.260> make<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.410> debt

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
geometry okay and I can make that debt

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.080 
geometry okay and I can make that debt
as<00:02:17.010> big<00:02:17.220> as<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.459> want<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:19.440> view<00:02:20.090> and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
as big as I want and this this view and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.979 
as big as I want and this this view and
of<00:02:22.080> course<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.590> higher<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.830> go<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.989> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
of course the higher I go with the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.800 
of course the higher I go with the
change<00:02:25.379> let's<00:02:25.920> say<00:02:26.069> I<00:02:26.330> smooth<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.450> one<00:02:27.629> more

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
change let's say I smooth it one more

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.839 
change let's say I smooth it one more
time<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.950> could<00:02:29.129> do<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.250> going<00:02:29.640> mesh

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
time and I could do that going mesh

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.809 
time and I could do that going mesh
smooth<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:33.480> more<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.980> hard<00:02:35.250> edge<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.670> get

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
smooth the more of a hard edge you get

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.470 
smooth the more of a hard edge you get
around<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.300> okay<00:02:38.060> leading<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.239> good

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
around it okay leading to a good

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.130 
around it okay leading to a good
topology<00:02:40.019> change<00:02:41.060> okay<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.120> let's<00:02:42.569> undo<00:02:42.900> that

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
topology change okay so let's undo that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.750 
topology change okay so let's undo that
and<00:02:44.810> one<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:45.959> keyboard<00:02:46.410> now<00:02:46.950> what<00:02:47.280> about<00:02:47.310> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
and one on the keyboard now what about a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.960 
and one on the keyboard now what about a
debt<00:02:48.560> not<00:02:49.560> dead<00:02:49.799> but<00:02:50.069> let's<00:02:50.430> look<00:02:50.519> at<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.700> bump

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
debt not dead but let's look at a bump

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.870 
debt not dead but let's look at a bump
at<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.209> bottom<00:02:52.010> okay<00:02:53.010> well<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.640> same

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
at the bottom okay well it's the same

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
at the bottom okay well it's the same
principle<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.900> i<00:02:55.200> extrude<00:02:56.569> scale<00:02:57.569> in<00:03:00.380> extrude

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
principle so i extrude scale in extrude

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.339 
principle so i extrude scale in extrude
scale<00:03:03.900> out<00:03:05.989> okay<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:09.090> now<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.239> get<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.780> bump<00:03:10.230> at

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
scale out okay and now I get a bump at

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.050 
scale out okay and now I get a bump at
the<00:03:10.440> bottom<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:13.380> all<00:03:13.680> started<00:03:14.160> back<00:03:14.400> here

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
the bottom so it all started back here

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.140 
the bottom so it all started back here
when<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.269> had<00:03:15.599> this<00:03:15.900> Bray<00:03:16.349> square<00:03:16.799> so<00:03:17.760> this

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
when I had this Bray square so this

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.470 
when I had this Bray square so this
brace<00:03:19.079> square<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.850> can't<00:03:20.850> tell<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.269> how<00:03:21.420> many

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
brace square I can't tell you how many

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.009 
brace square I can't tell you how many
times<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.989> use<00:03:22.170> this<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.910> actual<00:03:23.910> modeling<00:03:24.630> it's

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
times I use this in actual modeling it's

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.770 
times I use this in actual modeling it's
just<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.650> very<00:03:26.250> useful<00:03:26.609> thing<00:03:26.880> because<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.630> can

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
just a very useful thing because you can

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.319 
just a very useful thing because you can
get<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.959> lot<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.230> good<00:03:28.850> topology<00:03:29.850> changes<00:03:30.030> it

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
get a lot of good topology changes it

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.590 
get a lot of good topology changes it
off<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.720> okay<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.340> simple<00:03:32.489> concept<00:03:32.819> it

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
off of it okay it's a simple concept it

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.809 
off of it okay it's a simple concept it
gets<00:03:33.959> way<00:03:34.200> more<00:03:34.230> complex<00:03:34.980> than<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.220> but

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
gets way more complex than that but

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.860 
gets way more complex than that but
that's<00:03:36.389> about<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:38.190> more<00:03:38.910> complex<00:03:39.480> thing

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
that's about it a more complex thing

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.890 
that's about it a more complex thing
would<00:03:40.500> be<00:03:40.709> lets<00:03:41.010> say<00:03:41.130> well<00:03:41.850> what<00:03:42.090> happens<00:03:42.510> if<00:03:42.750> I

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
would be lets say well what happens if I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.710 
would be lets say well what happens if I
need<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.319> debt<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.920> be<00:03:44.100> like<00:03:44.730> somewhere<00:03:45.450> else

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
need the debt to be like somewhere else

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.429 
need the debt to be like somewhere else
on<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.260> square

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.149 

let's<00:03:54.439> say<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.709> need<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.920> dead<00:03:55.159> here<00:03:55.549> well<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:57.159> had

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
let's say I need a dead here well I had

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.030 
let's say I need a dead here well I had
to<00:03:58.280> brace<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.180> outside<00:03:59.540> edges<00:03:59.719> of<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.680> actual

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
to brace the outside edges of the actual

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.339 
to brace the outside edges of the actual

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:14.379 

strood<00:04:11.230> push<00:04:12.230> it<00:04:12.349> down<00:04:13.209> three<00:04:14.209> in<00:04:14.299> the

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
strood push it down three in the

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.509 
strood push it down three in the
keyboard<00:04:14.569> will<00:04:15.379> present<00:04:15.769> a<00:04:15.829> debt<00:04:16.070> only<00:04:16.430> in

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
keyboard will present a debt only in

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.570 
keyboard will present a debt only in
that<00:04:16.639> one<00:04:16.789> area<00:04:19.630> all<00:04:20.630> right<00:04:20.780> so<00:04:21.130> now<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:22.430> we

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
that one area all right so now that we

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.450 
that one area all right so now that we
looked<00:04:22.940> at<00:04:23.090> some<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:24.199> know<00:04:24.229> changes<00:04:24.919> in<00:04:25.130> how

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
looked at some you know changes in how

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.730 
looked at some you know changes in how
to<00:04:25.520> get<00:04:25.820> you<00:04:26.210> know<00:04:26.330> two<00:04:26.389> forms<00:04:27.020> mixing<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.590> now

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
to get you know two forms mixing it now

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.820 
to get you know two forms mixing it now
i'll<00:04:27.889> get<00:04:28.250> more<00:04:28.550> complex<00:04:29.210> forms<00:04:29.300> now<00:04:29.840> like<00:04:30.620> how

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
i'll get more complex forms now like how

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.999 
i'll get more complex forms now like how
do<00:04:30.889> i<00:04:31.039> get<00:04:31.300> very<00:04:32.300> large<00:04:32.780> extrudes<00:04:33.380> coming<00:04:33.800> off

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
do i get very large extrudes coming off

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.969 
do i get very large extrudes coming off
and<00:04:34.430> those<00:04:34.849> extrudes<00:04:35.509> are<00:04:35.770> controlled<00:04:36.770> in

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
and those extrudes are controlled in

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.790 
and those extrudes are controlled in
some<00:04:37.280> mechanism<00:04:37.880> some<00:04:38.300> way<00:04:38.509> alright<00:04:39.229> so<00:04:39.680> we'll

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
some mechanism some way alright so we'll

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.789 
some mechanism some way alright so we'll
look<00:04:39.919> at<00:04:40.070> that<00:04:40.099> in<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.340> next<00:04:40.460> video
