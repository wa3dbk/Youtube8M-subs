here<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.309> got<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> render<00:00:47.789> distance<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.239> 16

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
here so got the render distance on 16

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.360 
here so got the render distance on 16

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
it up it doesn't generate any way so max

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.080 
it up it doesn't generate any way so max
frame<00:00:56.879> rate<00:00:57.239> I've<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.739> there<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.100> max

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090

frame rate I've got on there so max
frame<00:01:00.300> rate<00:01:00.480> got<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.840> turn<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.079> unlimited

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
frame rate got that turn to unlimited

so view bobbing got that on basically
bob<00:01:09.659> everywhere<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:10.409> right<00:01:10.619> kind<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.890> stuff

you<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.220> view<00:01:11.460> bubbling<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.240> doesn't

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
you know view bubbling is it doesn't

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660 
you know view bubbling is it doesn't
really<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.680> doesn't<00:01:13.860> affect<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.250> FBS<00:01:14.520> too

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
much i'm pretty sure the brightness

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.520 
much i'm pretty sure the brightness
doesn't<00:01:16.770> matter<00:01:16.920> particles<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.530> vsync

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
doesn't matter particles on all vsync

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.789 
doesn't matter particles on all vsync
off<00:01:19.680> because<00:01:20.070> its<00:01:20.220> capture<00:01:20.580> FPS<00:01:20.909> anyways

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
off because its capture FPS anyways

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.340 
off because its capture FPS anyways
alternate<00:01:22.799> blocks<00:01:23.100> got<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> like

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
alternate blocks got that on so like

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.230 
alternate blocks got that on so like
when<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.560> look<00:01:26.220> at<00:01:26.340> blocks<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.119> got

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
when you look at blocks like if you got

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.179 
when you look at blocks like if you got
the<00:01:27.360> same<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.409> house<00:01:28.890> made<00:01:29.159> out

going down it that turns off are two

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.859 
going down it that turns off are two
sorts<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.850> out<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.210> does<00:01:36.450> something

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
sorts it out you know does something

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.600 
sorts it out you know does something

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.330 
that just demand more from you computer
and<00:01:38.939> pretty<00:01:39.090> sure<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.390> graphics<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:39.960> fancy

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
and pretty sure so the graphics on fancy

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
and pretty sure so the graphics on fancy
smooth<00:01:41.340> latin<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.700> maximum<00:01:42.180> freely<00:01:42.960> off

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
smooth latin on maximum freely off

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.889 
smooth latin on maximum freely off
because<00:01:43.409> obviously<00:01:43.590> 3d<00:01:44.189> GUI<00:01:45.119> skills<00:01:45.509> matter

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
because obviously 3d GUI skills matter

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.139 
because obviously 3d GUI skills matter
clouds<00:01:46.439> i<00:01:46.619> got<00:01:46.740> them<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.009> full<00:01:47.369> screen<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
clouds i got them on full screen on to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.260 
clouds i got them on full screen on to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
record it in 1080p mipmap levels set to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.700 
record it in 1080p mipmap levels set to
five<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:51.960> what<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.170> does<00:01:52.229> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
five you don't know what this does it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.530 
five you don't know what this does it
makes<00:01:52.979> everything<00:01:53.280> further<00:01:53.670> away<00:01:53.850> look<00:01:54.210> nicer

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
makes everything further away look nicer

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.249 
makes everything further away look nicer
and<00:01:55.219> use<00:01:56.219> vb<00:01:56.640> OS<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.210> because<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.110> actually

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
and use vb OS on because this actually

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.780 
and use vb OS on because this actually
increases<00:01:58.860> your<00:01:58.920> frame<00:01:59.159> rate<00:01:59.189> because<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
increases your frame rate because the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.429 
increases your frame rate because the
when<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> world's<00:02:00.630> generating<00:02:01.049> i<00:02:01.110> don't<00:02:01.290> know

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
when the world's generating i don't know

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.959 
when the world's generating i don't know
too<00:02:01.619> much<00:02:01.710> about<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> basics

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
too much about but it's like the basics

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.209 
too much about but it's like the basics
i<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.210> by<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.930> stars<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.500> memory<00:02:04.890> summit

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
i know by it stars like memory summit

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.330 
i know by it stars like memory summit
into<00:02:05.490> your<00:02:05.610> ram<00:02:05.790> normally<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.710> when<00:02:08.250> you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
into your ram normally and and when you

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.410 
into your ram normally and and when you
got<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.550> turned<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.910> i'm<00:02:09.000> pretty<00:02:09.209> sure<00:02:09.360> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
got this turned on i'm pretty sure it

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.479 
got this turned on i'm pretty sure it
puts<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.020> into<00:02:10.140> your<00:02:10.319> GPU<00:02:10.679> graphics<00:02:10.890> card

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
puts it into your GPU graphics card

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.490 
puts it into your GPU graphics card
stars<00:02:11.819> at<00:02:12.000> lex<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:12.450> better<00:02:12.629> star<00:02:12.989> in<00:02:13.080> it

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
stars at lex it's better star in it

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.990 
stars at lex it's better star in it
for<00:02:13.830> when<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.070> loading<00:02:14.430> up<00:02:14.520> or<00:02:14.670> something

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
for when it's loading up or something

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.550 
for when it's loading up or something
and<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.180> makes<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.630> whole<00:02:15.690> process<00:02:15.750> faster<00:02:16.320> of

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and it makes the whole process faster of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.760 
and it makes the whole process faster of
summer<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.990> yeah<00:02:18.990> it's<00:02:19.140> fast<00:02:19.350> if<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.590> do<00:02:19.680> it

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
summer so yeah it's fast if you do it

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.930 
summer so yeah it's fast if you do it
that<00:02:19.890> way<00:02:20.010> i'm<00:02:20.100> pretty<00:02:20.370> sure<00:02:20.490> but<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.730> doesn't

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
that way i'm pretty sure but it doesn't

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.460 
that way i'm pretty sure but it doesn't
it<00:02:21.060> doesn't<00:02:21.090> increase<00:02:21.600> your<00:02:21.720> FPS<00:02:21.870> by<00:02:22.170> too<00:02:22.230> much

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
it doesn't increase your FPS by too much

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.780 
it doesn't increase your FPS by too much
like<00:02:22.680> five<00:02:22.920> percent<00:02:23.190> or<00:02:23.280> ten<00:02:23.490> percent<00:02:23.700> or

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
like five percent or ten percent or

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.480 
like five percent or ten percent or
something<00:02:24.120> like<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:25.010> so<00:02:26.010> yeah<00:02:26.250> I've<00:02:26.340> got

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
something like that and so yeah I've got

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.250 
something like that and so yeah I've got
this<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> standard<00:02:27.390> share<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:27.930> package

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
this is a standard share this package

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.150 
this is a standard share this package
you'll<00:02:28.440> notice<00:02:28.770> in<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.950> title<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.980> runs

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
you'll notice in the title and it runs

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.690 
you'll notice in the title and it runs
pretty<00:02:32.370> smooth<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.709> yeah<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.130> haven't<00:02:35.310> even<00:02:35.459> got

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
pretty smooth so yeah I haven't even got

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.430 
pretty smooth so yeah I haven't even got
my<00:02:35.790> graphics<00:02:36.150> card<00:02:36.180> turn<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.780> max<00:02:36.990> because<00:02:37.320> if

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
my graphics card turn to max because if

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.130 
my graphics card turn to max because if
you<00:02:37.530> don't<00:02:37.650> know<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.750> graphics<00:02:39.750> card<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.080> I

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
you don't know the graphics card that I

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.699 
you don't know the graphics card that I
have<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.890> get<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.130> GPU<00:02:41.640> tweak<00:02:41.880> option<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.709> I

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
have you get this GPU tweak option and I

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.230 
have you get this GPU tweak option and I
honestly<00:02:44.280> haven't<00:02:44.459> touched<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.940> I've<00:02:45.060> left

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
honestly haven't touched it I've left

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.940 
honestly haven't touched it I've left
under<00:02:45.630> full<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.989> can<00:02:46.170> turn<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.380> up<00:02:46.530> even<00:02:46.830> more

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
under full you can turn it up even more

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.410 
under full you can turn it up even more
if<00:02:47.100> you<00:02:47.190> want<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.550> could<00:02:47.670> get<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:47.850> lot<00:02:48.030> more<00:02:48.090> FPS

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
if you want you could get a lot more FPS

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.970 
if you want you could get a lot more FPS
to<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.840> i'm<00:02:48.989> pretty<00:02:49.200> sure<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:49.590> i<00:02:49.620> don't<00:02:49.830> want

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
to this i'm pretty sure but i don't want

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.960 
to this i'm pretty sure but i don't want
to<00:02:50.040> turn<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.280> up<00:02:50.340> because<00:02:50.459> i<00:02:50.610> don't<00:02:50.760> want<00:02:50.820> to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
to turn it up because i don't want to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.699

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.040 
the whole purpose in recording 1080p is
so<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.980> know<00:03:11.459> how<00:03:12.180> much<00:03:12.330> fps<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.900> will

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
so that you know how much fps you will

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.170 
so that you know how much fps you will
get<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.320> 1080p<00:03:13.650> rather<00:03:14.010> than<00:03:14.190> 720p<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.030> it's

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
get in 1080p rather than 720p so it's

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.210 
get in 1080p rather than 720p so it's
good<00:03:15.360> mess<00:03:15.570> about<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:15.930> settings<00:03:16.230> here<00:03:16.380> if<00:03:16.980> I

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
good mess about this settings here if I

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.650 
good mess about this settings here if I
turn<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.400> down<00:03:17.610> let's<00:03:17.910> just<00:03:18.120> say<00:03:18.269> let's<00:03:18.480> turn

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
turn this down let's just say let's turn

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.240 
turn this down let's just say let's turn
this<00:03:18.720> down<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.989> two<00:03:19.170> because<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:20.100> know<00:03:20.190> you

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
this down to two because you know you

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.070 
this down to two because you know you
don't<00:03:20.489> even<00:03:20.610> need<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:20.910> on<00:03:21.209> far<00:03:21.540> let's<00:03:21.930> just

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
don't even need that on far let's just

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.300 
don't even need that on far let's just
turn<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.320> on<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.680> settings<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.250> I

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
turn it on to the settings that I

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.400 
turn it on to the settings that I
normally<00:03:23.489> play<00:03:23.760> on<00:03:23.940> by<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.150> way<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:24.390> turn<00:03:25.380> it

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
normally play on by the way so turn it

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.900 
normally play on by the way so turn it
off<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.830> doesn't<00:03:26.040> really<00:03:26.160> matter<00:03:26.340> decrease

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
off it doesn't really matter decrease

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.460 
off it doesn't really matter decrease
don't<00:03:27.209> see<00:03:27.420> much<00:03:27.630> of<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.900> difference<00:03:27.930> between

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
don't see much of a difference between

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.080 
don't see much of a difference between
particles<00:03:28.799> on<00:03:29.130> all<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.549> decrease<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.030> be

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
particles on all and decrease to be

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
particles on all and decrease to be
honest<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:31.400> that's<00:03:32.400> about<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.239> yeah<00:03:33.840> just

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
honest and that's about it so yeah just

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.330 
honest and that's about it so yeah just
turn<00:03:34.260> them<00:03:34.440> down<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.860> as<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.040> can<00:03:35.160> see<00:03:35.190> I

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
turn them down and as you can see I

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.039 
turn them down and as you can see I
don't<00:03:35.580> really<00:03:35.700> get<00:03:35.850> much<00:03:35.910> more<00:03:36.330> FPS<00:03:36.510> because<00:03:37.019> I

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
don't really get much more FPS because I

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.360 
don't really get much more FPS because I
did<00:03:37.260> this<00:03:37.350> before<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:37.920> was<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.130> what<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
did this before and I was like what the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.470 
did this before and I was like what the
fuck<00:03:38.459> could<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:38.880> turn<00:03:39.000> my<00:03:39.150> half<00:03:39.299> our

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
fuck could just turn my half our

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.930 
fuck could just turn my half our
settings<00:03:39.750> down<00:03:39.870> oh<00:03:40.110> no<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.799> does<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.040> okay<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.880> I

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
settings down oh no it does it okay so I

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.140 
settings down oh no it does it okay so I
didn't<00:03:42.180> hit<00:03:42.239> 60<00:03:42.690> FPS<00:03:42.989> do<00:03:43.590> something<00:03:44.130> but<00:03:44.459> you

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
didn't hit 60 FPS do something but you

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.509 
didn't hit 60 FPS do something but you
can<00:03:45.360> tell<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.870> look<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.320> in<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.160> top<00:03:47.340> corner

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519
