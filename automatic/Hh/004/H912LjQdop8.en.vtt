00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
therefore one way we're going to

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.209 
therefore one way we're going to
preserve<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.450> harvest<00:01:26.899> is<00:01:27.140> through<00:01:27.590> vacuum

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
preserve the harvest is through vacuum

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.480 
preserve the harvest is through vacuum
sealing<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.509> what<00:01:29.719> I<00:01:29.750> did<00:01:30.140> is<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.710> roasted<00:01:31.280> some

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
sealing so what I did is I roasted some

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.969 
sealing so what I did is I roasted some
peppers<00:01:32.390> as<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:32.780> can<00:01:32.960> see<00:01:33.200> they<00:01:33.619> were<00:01:33.679> in<00:01:33.859> this

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
peppers as you can see they were in this

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.459 
peppers as you can see they were in this
pan<00:01:34.310> they<00:01:34.909> look<00:01:35.119> like<00:01:35.270> this<00:01:35.539> and<00:01:35.810> I<00:01:36.049> took<00:01:36.109> off

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
pan they look like this and I took off

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.450 
pan they look like this and I took off
the<00:01:36.500> black<00:01:36.890> charred<00:01:37.280> area<00:01:37.600> then<00:01:38.600> what<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:38.899> did

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
the black charred area then what I did

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.849 
the black charred area then what I did
was<00:01:40.460> I<00:01:40.609> frozen<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:41.270> they'd<00:01:41.420> be<00:01:41.539> nice<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.200> hard

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
was I frozen so they'd be nice and hard

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.160 
was I frozen so they'd be nice and hard
and<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.520> reason<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:43.969> I<00:01:44.149> froze<00:01:44.509> my<00:01:44.539> peppers

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
and the reason that I froze my peppers

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.160 
and the reason that I froze my peppers
is<00:01:45.320> because<00:01:45.679> they<00:01:45.920> were<00:01:46.009> very<00:01:46.399> juicy<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.509> when

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
is because they were very juicy and when

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.239 
is because they were very juicy and when
you<00:01:48.289> vacuum<00:01:48.710> seal<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:50.090> sucks<00:01:50.810> all<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.109> air<00:01:51.950> out

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
you vacuum seal it sucks all the air out

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:55.899 
you vacuum seal it sucks all the air out
of<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.719> air<00:01:53.719> is<00:01:54.170> what<00:01:54.350> oxidizes<00:01:55.219> your<00:01:55.640> produce

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
of it air is what oxidizes your produce

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.569 
of it air is what oxidizes your produce
it's<00:01:56.329> what<00:01:56.450> makes<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.810> go<00:01:56.960> bad<00:01:57.289> how<00:01:57.950> many<00:01:58.189> times

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
it's what makes it go bad how many times

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.039 
it's what makes it go bad how many times
have<00:01:58.969> you<00:01:59.119> put<00:01:59.420> something<00:01:59.659> away<00:01:59.899> in<00:01:59.990> your

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
have you put something away in your

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.109 
have you put something away in your
freezer<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.799> later<00:02:01.159> you<00:02:01.340> go<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:01.670> get<00:02:01.819> it<00:02:01.939> out

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
freezer and later you go and get it out

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.969 
freezer and later you go and get it out
and<00:02:02.329> it's<00:02:02.420> got<00:02:02.569> like<00:02:02.719> frost<00:02:03.049> all<00:02:03.319> over<00:02:03.679> it<00:02:03.829> and

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
and it's got like frost all over it and
