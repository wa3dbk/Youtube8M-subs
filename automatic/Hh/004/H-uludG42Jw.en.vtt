00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
yeah i'm assuming you had to turn the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:37.480 
yeah i'm assuming you had to turn the
energy<00:01:28.880> on<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.940> gate<00:01:32.149> up<00:01:36.039> let's<00:01:37.039> get<00:01:37.189> back<00:01:37.340> in

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
energy on the gate up let's get back in

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.830 
energy on the gate up let's get back in
this<00:01:37.610> monster<00:01:38.299> aw<00:01:40.149> come<00:01:41.149> on<00:01:41.420> there<00:01:41.600> wasn't

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
this monster aw come on there wasn't

this monster aw come on there wasn't
enough<00:01:41.990> though<00:01:42.140> but<00:01:42.320> they<00:01:42.380> got<00:01:42.530> their<00:01:42.710> thing

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.350 
really no of course gotta be some kind
of<00:01:53.299> issue<00:01:53.450> yet<00:01:54.970> you<00:01:55.970> know<00:01:56.090> here<00:01:56.299> we<00:01:56.420> go<00:01:58.179> what<00:01:59.179> do

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
of issue yet you know here we go what do

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.219 
of issue yet you know here we go what do
I<00:01:59.450> have<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.690> do<00:01:59.959> is<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.319> question<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:02.229> tried
