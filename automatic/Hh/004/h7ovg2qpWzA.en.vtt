to<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.140> obviously<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> over<00:02:07.439> two<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
to you is obviously the over two and a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.520 
to you is obviously the over two and a
half<00:02:07.860> goals<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.429> that's<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.700> low<00:02:09.050> 1.66<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.440> if

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
half goals here that's a low 1.66 but if

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.740 
half goals here that's a low 1.66 but if
you<00:02:10.619> combine<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.580> Chelsea<00:02:12.180> win<00:02:12.390> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you combine that with a Chelsea win and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.980 
you combine that with a Chelsea win and
you<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:12.989> one<00:02:13.290> point

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
you have one point

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.440 
you have one point
1.8<00:02:14.710> not<00:02:15.130> as<00:02:15.250> high<00:02:15.430> as<00:02:15.490> I<00:02:15.670> like<00:02:15.880> but<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.270> has

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
1.8 not as high as I like but it has

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.880 
1.8 not as high as I like but it has
some<00:02:16.660> value<00:02:16.840> what<00:02:17.350> do<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.470> think<00:02:17.620> about<00:02:17.680> that

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
some value what do you think about that

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.490 
some value what do you think about that
one<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.690> think<00:02:19.690> there's<00:02:19.870> better<00:02:19.990> value<00:02:20.350> in

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
one I think there's better value in

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.950 
one I think there's better value in
Chelsea<00:02:21.010> keeping<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.370> clean<00:02:21.580> sheet<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:22.750> then

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
Chelsea keeping a clean sheet then then

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.110 
Chelsea keeping a clean sheet then then
when<00:02:23.110> winnings<00:02:23.650> real<00:02:23.830> for<00:02:24.070> Neil<00:02:24.280> okay<00:02:24.970> well

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
when winnings real for Neil okay well

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.550 
when winnings real for Neil okay well
that's<00:02:25.240> your<00:02:25.450> bet<00:02:25.630> Chelsea<00:02:26.080> keeping<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.380> clean

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560
