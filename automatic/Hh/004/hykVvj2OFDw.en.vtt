00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.150
 why should you do it all the same we are in a very small video 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.550
 verge the review is self and this video is about 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:11.079
 Munich 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.719
 help would be asked again and again how to prepare properly for one 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.970
 oral exam before and my answer is 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.830
 Struck 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.999
 Thurau 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.220
 4 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.359
 content 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.449
 since the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.510
 Tour of knowledge clear 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.190
 These are the content KÃ¶nemann structure 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.000
 is 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.070
 Dr 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.269
 Key structurally is the key 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.020
 for a successful oral 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.090
 exam 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.989
 if you know where that belongs 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.379
 then they almost won 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.230
 because in the suit "substantive questions of detail come 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.940
 the exam time is usually already expired 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.670
 how do you do that 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.690
 a wonderful possibility is the means Medtech already are Walter his 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.570
 application 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.410
 yes, my topic is up to a certain point 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.080
 Volume free means master - master point come written my 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.210
 Master talked 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.880
 the very consciously chosen 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 No, they are going out for now 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.420
 head 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.590
 Points 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 gist 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.810
 head 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.620
 Point 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.240
 2 centuries after the main point 13 points yes that can of course now everything 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.900
 the more colorful 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.940
 Reduction in color mark Naseer with different possibilities and 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.710
 Then, when you have made it clear that your exam fee is id2 essential 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.420
 Main points would be canceled 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.200
 For example, that they were looking to the side and there were strong at the start 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.880
 Method" 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.310
 just as an example 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.410
 then come next 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.910
 here under point attacks 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.190
 and then comes 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.170
 under point 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.289
 2 yes that would be natural, you can neither 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.729
 make bigger 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.979
 In almost every case, the color-coded two claim that they do exactly that 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.500
 same under point 1 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.580
 Under point there were thus a structure of knowledge and then only for 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.599
 Monza very much 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.129
 to the content 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.849
 Structure in front of the 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.110
 you can watch the wars too 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.719
 and 4 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.289
