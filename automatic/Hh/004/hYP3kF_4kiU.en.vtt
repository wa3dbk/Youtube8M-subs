as you can see there is some
anti-vibration<00:00:55.289> rubber<00:00:55.890> between<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.180> fans

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
anti-vibration rubber between the fans

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.779 
anti-vibration rubber between the fans
and<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.859> heatsink<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> bottom<00:00:59.579> we

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and the heatsink so on the bottom we

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.130 
and the heatsink so on the bottom we
have<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> base<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> cooler<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.960> theres

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
have the base of the cooler and theres

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.990 
have the base of the cooler and theres
also<00:01:01.230> 6<00:01:01.379> heat<00:01:01.800> pipes<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.489> two

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
also 6 heat pipes that go to two

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.939 
also 6 heat pipes that go to two
different<00:01:03.270> radiators<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.409> I've<00:01:04.500> been<00:01:04.619> testing

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
different radiators so I've been testing

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.260 
different radiators so I've been testing
this<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> few<00:01:05.519> weeks<00:01:05.640> now<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.119> can

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
this for a few weeks now and I can

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.789 
this for a few weeks now and I can
definitely<00:01:06.479> say<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.290> fans<00:01:07.560> are

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
definitely say that the fans are

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.310 
definitely say that the fans are
extremely<00:01:08.700> quiet<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.270> place<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> microphone

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
extremely quiet I place the microphone

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.530 
extremely quiet I place the microphone
about<00:01:10.530> 30<00:01:10.740> centimeters<00:01:11.159> away<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.210> let's<00:01:12.420> have

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
about 30 centimeters away so let's have

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:41.620 
about 30 centimeters away so let's have
a<00:01:12.570> listen

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.539 

as<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:42.409> can<00:01:42.500> tell<00:01:42.560> they're<00:01:42.860> extremely<00:01:43.189> quiet

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
as you can tell they're extremely quiet

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.550 
as you can tell they're extremely quiet
and<00:01:43.880> that's<00:01:44.030> because<00:01:44.210> noctua<00:01:44.930> makes<00:01:45.320> some<00:01:45.530> of

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
and that's because noctua makes some of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.590 
and that's because noctua makes some of
the<00:01:45.680> most<00:01:45.860> quiet<00:01:46.189> fans<00:01:46.640> in<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.030> world<00:01:47.060> it

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
the most quiet fans in the world it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.120 
the most quiet fans in the world it
seems<00:01:47.930> like<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.229> perfect<00:01:48.350> choice<00:01:48.710> for<00:01:48.740> anyone

seems like the perfect choice for anyone
looking<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.549> overclock<00:01:50.180> their<00:01:50.390> system

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
looking to overclock their system

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.600 
looking to overclock their system
without<00:01:50.960> jumping<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.740> water<00:01:51.979> cooling<00:01:52.369> as<00:01:52.490> i

without jumping to water cooling as i
said<00:01:52.850> earlier<00:01:53.000> as<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.020> do<00:01:54.170> need<00:01:54.380> quite<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.679> bit

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
said earlier as you do need quite a bit

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.520 
said earlier as you do need quite a bit
of<00:01:55.159> cooley<00:01:55.670> when<00:01:56.240> you're<00:01:56.360> overclocking<00:01:56.719> the

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
of cooley when you're overclocking the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.590 
of cooley when you're overclocking the
only<00:01:57.799> problem<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.250> could<00:01:58.610> arise<00:01:58.759> is<00:01:59.299> that<00:01:59.479> it

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
only problem that could arise is that it

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.910 
only problem that could arise is that it
doesn't<00:01:59.899> fit<00:02:00.049> in<00:02:00.140> your<00:02:00.259> case<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:00.679> I<00:02:00.710> would

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
doesn't fit in your case so I would

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.529 
doesn't fit in your case so I would
definitely<00:02:01.069> recommend<00:02:01.340> checking<00:02:01.880> the

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
definitely recommend checking the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.080 
definitely recommend checking the
dimensions<00:02:02.990> first<00:02:03.229> before<00:02:04.069> purchase<00:02:04.549> so

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
dimensions first before purchase so
