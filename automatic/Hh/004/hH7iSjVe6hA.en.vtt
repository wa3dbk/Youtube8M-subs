00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.760
 the 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.749
 the only things that made us agree 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:15.169
 ranked pts and oil 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.210
 areva no salon and they are the same they have both been 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.689
 each of the very different personalities 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.779
 in the back that fits better some directories it depends also 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 of paragliding still astonishing that launches the world is also a fragrance 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.210
 more affinity with 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.730
 because no one 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.050
 and the eyes of the world the woman who whispered in the ear of the lions 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.540
 and these animals and its reserve around new york and the soaring 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.590
 burning of rachmaninoff 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.420
 to return north to paris to dakar last album back at deutsche 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.150
 grammophon it was also the program of the concert of January 19, 2009 at dawn 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.680
 all the bins 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.970
 especially recently that some levels 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.090
 he was the fifth gospel 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.500
 I think that's how I told you 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.990
 yes we can read in this music 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.700
 and spiritual and his music such mystical data that someone who 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.420
 celebrated the invisible presence 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.990
 and then in the music puts you in touch with 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.550
 a name of who 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.570
 beyond the one in which we find ourselves so it's a feeling 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.940
 really huh a bridge down the spiritual world that's for sure 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.940
 and that's why I then referred to why 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.789
 on the theme side also for those who operate 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.740
 sometimes some of your teammates want you 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.689
 he's the proudest it's more like like math at the highest 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.800
 level it's more of poetry 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.850
 and I think so 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.040
 too many people were welcomed but if he fell 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.150
 as in many countries whose judgment was stopped at the pit 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.770
 is impaired by this condition 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.700
 leaving a little harare 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.470
 to remove the expression expressive firs 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.250
 guide feelings to this music because we had 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.670
 perceives how so perfect 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.230
 all of a sudden 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.089
 from there it's almost a prescribed street sesame 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.999
 almost everywhere 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.779
 while it's possible it's way beyond that it's because it's 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:14.739
 military 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.409
 there was mostly a 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.159
 of a poet and always always very expressive this music in the kitchen of the 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.159
 ever more stopped in this election that you have to go 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.359
 247 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.589
 Toulalan 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:32.429
 the contents will be interpreted on this medium 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.179
 it consists of many others 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.999
 what should be done 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.439
 but spend months and years at the om can say that godard 1 this 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.819
 star series is done every month and even a little paltry compared to 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.689
 itself since it has made several versions 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:45.859
 that nothing to see 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.749
 with each other and that's also the richness this music is 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.049
 that it is ultimately very very little guidance that is given 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.449
 at the text level 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.459
 of which some contrasted freedoms the dynamics same hotel country 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.639
 and the usap a doctor had renewed we had reading 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.569
 lyon keeps a feather duster 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.269
 it's very technical where 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.039
 I find it disappointing since his victory of May 10 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:11.729
 cancer in the mood 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:13.069
 the event of what they are 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.219
 of the state of its interior of the public collection 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.829
 what did we do the day before what we are going to point out all this makes 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:19.849
 very very 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.760
 very changeable very variable in the best case 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.819
 in May 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.819
 in a second set state is not really 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.919
 the splitting schild s in his eyes 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.919
 waterfalls 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.479
 another ritual question one needs better 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.079
 an old grain hall 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.219
 for caring 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.549
 I have always enjoyed this year in Toulouse the pink city then 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.509
 apart from paris pouget most often played 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:04.239
 - so I always come back with great joy if the genes and the places 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.529
 obviously it takes a lot of it always committed here it was not returned 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:09.529
 mulched in two years this concert to sion the affection that there for a city 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.119
 a lot to do with it with him where it takes certainly takes place 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:14.390
 and vegetables 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.920
 we return to the grain market on January 26, 2009 with the orchestra of 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.600
 european chamber she will play the concerto in mauritius ravel soil nothing to see 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.009
 with a solo recital I always thought 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.009
 it's almost the religious experience it's something very 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.169
 citrix very austere 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.669
 in the discipline and its heelettes 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.629
 maybe but only but at the same time we are such a tool 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.789
 it goes like that was a little diminished at noon same medium between 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.460
 in addition the group was assigned and the public 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.949
 so that's something you 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.349
 totally different 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.020
 it's going really remorse is not imagining because you will say it's a 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.389
 concert with colleagues and 1,100 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.909
 but it's really like another another discipline 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.400
 he recalls that in June having settled 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.889
 when the clown any other music 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.039
 yes it is another 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.189
 another universe and the other another pianist mo sistas not just a 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:03.240
 a matter of taste 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.969
 extraction 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:07.590
 likewise under water but also from 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.610
 anyway to take 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.250
 you will need another who opposed an angevin so I find my happiness between 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.990
 laon and others 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.990
 for the benefit of wildlife 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.089
 in which you are known 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:20.059
 at 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:23.199
 next it is certain that we could geographically in general what 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.569
 I did but still higher 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.150
 but it is advertised as being 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.840
 finally I do not think we are face to face and my baby crack is then 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.050
 inevitably I am and I am for these tools including always exciting 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.279
 it's a shame to Nancy 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:35.819
 let's do more pragmatic 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.509
 to connect to the organization and after for all that is% and wild 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.929
 day to day I would say that it is also artistically not financial but 

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:46.599
 always also to explain even at the time I lived there 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:47.919
 really close 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.289
 day-to-day projects 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.990
 that's what you've always done for me for its immunity but if the 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.490
 scenic activities 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.680
 the killing is finally the muse 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.310
 ultimedia was for nothing 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.439
 for all the artists who this composer poet writer 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.959
 to the painter and she is in fact it is the same to interpret like that 

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:10.250
 to rejuvenate himself but he loved the wild world spinning 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.850
 he is even in the in relation to the complete work since it was he 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.839
 is a world that is not 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.289
 india 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.650
 not even tame with words 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.550
 it's happening totally arnaud very high level 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.509
 and so the year of his agent 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:26.779
 how 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:27.910
 it can help 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.330
 lauryn hill and violent more than aggressive some time to critics it's also 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.250
 important that that's also the emotion so it must be that he 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.839
 be part of the spectrum 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:38.839
 very well thank you 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:43.909
 to go away 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:44.959
 when
