00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.550
 a little more back 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.840
 out there too 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.480
 well I'll teach you because how do 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.990
 understand the smoker is worth it and already what 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.580
 we will put on our YouTube channel 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.869
 so that everyone learns 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 let's start one as you could call 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.550
 beekeeping school for beginners 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.550
 and for professionals 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.210
 essential carrying a box 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.469
 metal because then we 're going to put it 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.469
 when it's hot 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.370
 and the palette 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.750
 and I'm going to show how I do it 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.989
 many ways everyone has to find 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.989
 its way 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.730
 material to start 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:21.270
 and used it was also voided of bleach 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:25.159
 as fuel for longer thanks 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.729
 they look so congratulated can be used 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.610
 granules apparently each animal 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.730
 of different things 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.130
 I also use a few drops of 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.140
 accelerators 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.060
 liquid ignite barbecues click 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.820
 kerosene 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.970
 a few drops once it is undertaken 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.970
 no toxicity 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.990
 and the process is the following with the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:00.370
 empty shipowner and the part underneath the 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:04.290
 device also empty like a handful of 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:08.470
 herbs i do 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.950
 a bottom base a small base 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.710
 is for what I do 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.110
 well for here 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.110
 the fuel when it is burning 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.980
 inside the smoked do not go down 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.420
 the tennis players if you do not study, let's say 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.010
 does as a filter to follow 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.590
 rising the smoke because the herbs 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.370
 greens is more 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.370
 called 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.299
 I also put up 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.359
 and when he threw me 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.280
 and a few drops 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.730
 to help understand 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.450
 ah 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.450
 and that is very fast 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.350
 that we are very careful now in time 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.890
 summer 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.160
 where do that why I put myself here 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.160
 inside 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.439
 go to a command 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.439
 to the fire 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.599
 the straw gives you the ignition speed 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:48.660
 and now being these organs once 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:51.330
 I see that the straw has learned this 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.340
 smoked the kiss very high as it allows 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.340
 be hours and hours 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.680
 working without turning off the 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.760
 main principals the smoker go 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.849
 all right 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.420
 the smoke has become thick and the lover has not 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.569
 turn on well 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.659
 good day 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:19.199
 If you do not do well 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:21.739
 at least because it will control well the 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.739
 hill 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.450
 you can almost turn around 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.230
 doing is not good up I go back to 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.230
 put herbs 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:39.330
 with the sense of 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.740
 in which the smoke cools and goes out with 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
 less trend 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.710
 but good when the smoke rises to 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.740
 above 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.290
 but speaking mainly so that the 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.810
 fuel when you return it what 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.320
 mature down does not fall down the 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.620
 swimming pool 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.100
 that is by the point of the owner and do not go 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.100
 to the hive 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.920
 ah 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.070
 every race 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.680
 but we have not made any spark no 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.680
 there is no danger 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.580
 ah 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:26.120
 and the caller has to throw alone 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.419
 when no strip as there during 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:33.580
 burial or open it a little and leave it 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.580
 open for you to take it then 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.600
 as we know that the mother is well 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:47.840
 when the values 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:51.190
 same as those who smoke in the mouth 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.190
 the little bit of air and they do not know 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:05.070
 from one of the band of good that are 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:11.150
 here you smell like smoke but you do not 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:11.150
 suffocation is even used as fuel 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.150
 or traditional made in money for 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.560
 animals or animal excrement that yes 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:26.560
 they remain in thick smoke that says it causes 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.560
 the smoke is more charged with co2 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:39.250
 the lover once finished 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.250
 you can not put
