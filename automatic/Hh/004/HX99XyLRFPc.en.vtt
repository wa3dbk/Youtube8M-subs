I'm<00:02:04.040> gonna<00:02:04.190> make<00:02:04.340> another<00:02:04.370> mark<00:02:04.910> here<00:02:05.860> and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
I'm gonna make another mark here and

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.490 
I'm gonna make another mark here and
this<00:02:07.040> is<00:02:07.220> my<00:02:07.250> header

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
this is my header

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.880 
this is my header
so<00:02:10.500> here's<00:02:10.650> my<00:02:10.860> header<00:02:11.180> underneath<00:02:12.650> your<00:02:13.650> top

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
so here's my header underneath your top

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.400 
so here's my header underneath your top
plate<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.490> have<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.330> header<00:02:15.600> marked<00:02:15.990> out<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
plate I have that header marked out the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.350 
plate I have that header marked out the
exact<00:02:16.770> height<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.240> only

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
exact height of that but that only

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.940 
exact height of that but that only
leaves<00:02:18.660> me<00:02:18.870> about<00:02:19.110> three<00:02:19.350> quarters<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.830> an

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
leaves me about three quarters of an

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.840 
leaves me about three quarters of an
inch<00:02:20.100> well<00:02:21.060> how<00:02:21.150> am<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.270> gonna<00:02:21.390> deal<00:02:21.690> with<00:02:21.720> this

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
inch well how am I gonna deal with this

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.970 
inch well how am I gonna deal with this
plywood<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.750> could<00:02:24.930> get<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.080> piece<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.440> 3/4

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
plywood so I could get a piece of 3/4

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.400 
plywood so I could get a piece of 3/4
inch<00:02:26.010> plywood<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.880> then<00:02:27.510> when<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.720> fabricate

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
inch plywood and then when I fabricate

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.500 
inch plywood and then when I fabricate
my<00:02:28.440> header<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.220> know<00:02:29.670> right<00:02:30.060> off<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.480> bat

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
my header I know right off of the bat

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.110 
my header I know right off of the bat
I'm<00:02:31.200> gonna<00:02:31.410> need<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.740> put<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> 3/4<00:02:32.520> inch<00:02:32.550> piece

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
I'm gonna need to put a 3/4 inch piece

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.300 
I'm gonna need to put a 3/4 inch piece
of<00:02:33.150> plywood<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.990> top<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.890> make<00:02:35.100> up

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
of plywood on top of this to make up

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.690 
of plywood on top of this to make up
this<00:02:35.490> difference<00:02:36.030> here's<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.080> top<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.710> my
