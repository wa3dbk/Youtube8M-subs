00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello you already know me 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.150
 you already know the blocked street and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.429
 well today we will talk about a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.780
 other russian var is a variant the street 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:19.080
 round or almost round evening we can 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.029
 to do to 8 side as you have already seen 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.550
 on the clip of joel we can also 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.500
 increase the number of side to get 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.109
 get closer to the round shape even more 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.240
 so here I did a test of hives var 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.619
 and could cost us 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.880
 so we're still in the principle of 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.750
 the marsh street that is to say that the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.750
 elements are empty 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.790
 there's nothing inside are swamps the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.350
 bees build their rays 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.390
 these are elements grow from ancient 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.329
 from 21 cents to 2 so well understood he has 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.450
 worked as the hock normally 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.490
 are not rendered 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.760
 making work help them in their 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.180
 normal sense that we are black and hard so 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 its rotation well it's a little 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.190
 complicated it's on the floor in 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.680
 below in the countries here and the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.980
 elements then the elements it takes 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.880
 to do with that are elements like 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.840
 that kung fu panda seems so it's true 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.250
 that it requires to make cuts in 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.330
 very little complicated sometimes but once 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.130
 that these assemblies have here a form 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:25.800
 almost round so it's pretty apple 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.009
 evening interviews at the back we put 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.130
 obviously the little leak that is going to 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.460
 find closed by the water curative water 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.430
 like that so there the bees are 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.130
 closed the farmer can see his 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.590
 bees as he wants in the front one 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.890
 can also like that you have a hive on 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.399
 bottom m a tr input hole that we're going 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.860
 butcher with a little cap what 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.440
 looks pretty and then there is also after 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.250
 you can be flat roof or roof 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 pyramidal 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.119
 we stop there at the level of the work of 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.640
 wood it's a bit complicated but it makes 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.240
 a very beautiful object look at the cup the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.740
 roof shape and this Russian with his 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.510
 roof 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.970
 Val on board is in my opinion very pretty 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.769
 in a garden and then whoever 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.840
 is interested in borders to an eyed 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.549
 peas will and form angles of form 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.030
 very positive energy 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.769
 so here is a very nice evening for 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.310
 amateurs 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.310
 this is your voice 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.530
 I
