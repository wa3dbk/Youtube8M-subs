00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.119
 hello girls welcome to a new video 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.359
 of trevelez in the video that we have 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.939
 presented for today we are going to teach you 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.669
 a way to shade the eye with 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.349
 vanilla or chocolate colors is that 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.230
 we have taken advantage for this to 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.719
 apply a color mind color leaves 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.910
 peach color and we have profiled and 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:36.850
 we have made up the lip with the couture 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.320
 with a nude color that is color 01 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.690
 so that we do well for the result 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.180
 let's do it then 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.270
 we are going to show you how we are going to carry out 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.850
 the shading 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.310
 good girls well to shade the eye 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.650
 with chocolate shades I will use 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.210
 the Maltese mono shadow collection a 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.489
 shadow collection so that as its 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.200
 name says they are matte shadows that do not 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.630
 they will bring no shine in the eye 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.760
 they are texture shadows with a little 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.739
 micronized so that really the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.140
 blurring is very easy to make a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.880
 simple and that really is gone 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.010
 a little better to the touch of us endure 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.470
 more time 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.650
 first use a base shade I will 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.330
 Take a stick rosita to sweeten a 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.850
 little makeup that is not a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.180
 make up with some features very 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.180
 hard 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.880
 apply in both eyes 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.700
 also a little bit will help us 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:41.100
 send then the little red screams 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.100
 that usually appear on the eyelid 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.190
 and now yes 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.950
 we are going to help the brush a little 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.810
 more finite and flatter 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.230
 to perform as if we were 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.520
 making an eyeliner 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.159
 with the same shadow 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.350
 and on the outside of the eye 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.350
 let's mark a small basin 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.220
 as if it were a small triangular 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.100
 front 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.940
 that will help us strengthen a 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.940
 little look 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.710
 to mark the eye without the eye look 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.710
 excessively make-up 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.250
 if you look at this little triangular 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.079
 to be able to emphasize a little more then 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.730
 we have used this brown chocolate a 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.680
 little bit darker 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.290
 up to the ceiling 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.530
 and we're also going to apply a little bit in 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.280
 the bottom to frame the eye and 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.600
 to help us give 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.550
 Well, that force 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.550
 intensify a little the look 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.870
 let's clean up a little bit here we're going to 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.870
 the net 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.390
 now we are going to outline a little the eye 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.120
 for the bottom we will work 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.640
 with a pencil just like we had 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.319
 commented on earlier times is a 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.609
 pencil that is very creamy is not like 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.590
 those little ones that you have to 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.239
 scratch to be able to make up you and that 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.340
 It is also resistant not only to 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.530
 water but also to friction is 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.900
 really because it 's front is a little bit 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.700
 the eyes will hold you all day 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.700
 put look at the ceiling carla 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.379
 let's outline how I have put the 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.989
 umbrella on the outside of the 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.670
 eyelashes I have no choice but to 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.670
 outline from the inside 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.790
 for the top I'm going to work 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:59.640
 with a permanent line you are a permanent 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.769
 that a more eyeliner will work for us 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.659
 Ink time plus marker time for 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.590
 that we have the most defined eyeliner and 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.590
 rather worked 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.400
 work the eyeliner 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:17.329
 from the beginning of the tab to having 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.680
 the hard tip really is pretty 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.680
 simple to apply 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.470
 this 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.280
 and we're going to take it a little bit to the 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.030
 end of the last tab tearing the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.030
 eye learn 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.310
 and we are going to blur it 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.520
 to finish we will use a 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.680
 illuminator in cream 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.960
 at the point below the eyebrow in the 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.120
 point of light and we will also take advantage 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.610
 to illuminate the remains of the face 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:17.130
 we will put it as if it were a small 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:20.760
 from this central line will help us 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.100
 give more depth to the look and 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.780
 these lines here are going to help us 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.110
 focus on the area of ​​the 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.630
 little eyes that is always what we like 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.300
 enhance or highlight a little more 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.110
 being a cream illuminator really is 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.980
 it blends very well 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.980
 and very fast 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.849
 giving us that point of light but without 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.199
 the skin is 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.199
 too bright 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.960
 finally let's work the mask 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.240
 I 'm going to work on the lashes 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.729
 eyelash mask of hyaluronic acid 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.979
 not only to make up the eyelash 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.349
 but to help us strengthen a 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.819
 little bit the hair root and that the 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.819
 eyelash does not weaken us so 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.860
 well girls we have finished our 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:20.030
 makeup in chocolates and pink tones 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.610
 stick 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.440
 only to remind you that although we 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.690
 We have used several products to 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.390
 I can make the makeup I know that many 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.430
 of you suppress some steps is 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.440
 completely the right one could be 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.730
 do without any problem for all 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.440
 those things that you always have a 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.050
 little bit more hurry and good morning 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.830
 we do not feel like doing so many steps 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.690
 to get this finished with this 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.880
