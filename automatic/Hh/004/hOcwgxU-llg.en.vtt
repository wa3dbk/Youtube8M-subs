labeled on each deck which normally is
about<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> width<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.930> your<00:00:21.960> shoulders<00:00:22.279> or<00:00:23.279> you

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
about the width of your shoulders or you

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.089 
about the width of your shoulders or you
can<00:00:23.850> go<00:00:23.970> wider<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:25.230> more<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.619> freestyle

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099

can go wider for more of a freestyle
stance<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.240> go<00:00:27.480> narrower<00:00:27.890> for<00:00:28.890> more<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.429> a

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
needs on the hill you might want to do a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.610 
needs on the hill you might want to do a
little<00:02:18.900> bit<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.080> everything

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
little bit of everything

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.680 
little bit of everything
again<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.730> would<00:02:20.850> probably<00:02:21.360> be<00:02:21.540> at

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
again that would probably be at

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.030 
again that would probably be at
reference<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.790> hair<00:02:27.120> bit<00:02:27.450> duck<00:02:28.040> and

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
reference and just a hair bit duck and

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.860 
reference and just a hair bit duck and
again<00:02:29.820> duck<00:02:30.060> footed<00:02:30.360> his<00:02:31.070> feet<00:02:32.070> out<00:02:32.100> like<00:02:32.460> so

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
again duck footed his feet out like so

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.980 
again duck footed his feet out like so
aggressive<00:02:33.870> Alpine<00:02:34.260> angle<00:02:34.650> forward<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.750> just

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
aggressive Alpine angle forward and just

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.870 
aggressive Alpine angle forward and just
kind<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.320> tamed<00:02:37.560> down<00:02:37.710> for<00:02:38.400> your<00:02:38.490> all-around

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
kind of tamed down for your all-around

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.850 
kind of tamed down for your all-around
stance<00:02:39.270> just<00:02:40.640> like<00:02:41.640> so
