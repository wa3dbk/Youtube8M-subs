turn it over and continue doing that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.700 
turn it over and continue doing that
until<00:01:50.220> you've<00:01:50.670> cut<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.780> vegetable<00:01:52.500> and

until you've cut up the vegetable and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.240 
until you've cut up the vegetable and
this<00:01:53.670> exposes<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:55.530> surface<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
this exposes the surface of the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.830 
this exposes the surface of the
vegetable<00:01:57.110> so<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.530> cook<00:01:58.710> evenly<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
vegetable so that it can cook evenly and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.230 
vegetable so that it can cook evenly and
that's<00:02:00.840> four<00:02:01.469> ounces<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.119> courgettes

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that's four ounces of courgettes

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.660 
that's four ounces of courgettes
that<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.780> been<00:02:03.990> roe<00:02:04.259> cut<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.950> also<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.549> think

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
that have been roe cut and also I think

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.520 
that have been roe cut and also I think
it<00:02:05.880> makes<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.180> very<00:02:06.210> nice<00:02:06.600> attractive<00:02:06.930> pattern

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
it makes a very nice attractive pattern

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.070 
it makes a very nice attractive pattern
