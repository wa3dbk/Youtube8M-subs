00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.340
 hello very good everyone I'm ring and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.289
 today I bring you a new trick to talk 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.359
 with two multiplayer to have 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.250
 any free card 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.619
 payment visit is worth it 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.539
 we will need to have two controls and two 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.240
 your user accounts and other 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.769
 ok you lose it some friend or something to 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.230
 he has left me shifts I give him the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.290
 thank you I will leave your face in the description 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.820
 and if someone does not have an account and has 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.200
 some code because you make an account and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.030
 the code of that is to do the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.680
 trick as you see I am teaching that the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.719
 business card to dragon I do not have it 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.210
 bought is worth and makes me buy it for 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.010
 put it by the let's unlock 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.050
 for free we put ourselves on top of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.860
 barracks with command 1 ok and now 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.130
 we light the command 2 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.600
 Once the command 2 is on, we will take 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.240
 We will start session with the account that 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.640
 have better secondary account 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.790
 I do not know what they left or something I 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.100
 example I use that of troll once I 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.570
 we have to log in we will take you 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.030
 we will give the middle button with the command 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.680
 2 to exit the menu and on top of 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.200
 barracones is worth it that we have it on top 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.810
 barracks instead of giving it to him 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.440
 we'll give it to her and it's worth to get into what 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.440
 of the Friends 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.730
 good 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.830
 once we are those of friends 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.400
 we can choose any one I'm going to 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.950
 choose the first one and we'll give it to the and you 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.960
 we give to and when we are here not 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.150
 we do nothing we give the middle button 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.150
 the xbox one is worth 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.240
 and well once we have given the button 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.930
 from the middle we closed session worth x him 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.930
 we give yes 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.490
 it's worth once you have to do the session 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.740
 we hit the middle button and with the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.380
 command 1 is very important with taking 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.539
 1 we give to the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.430
 and as you see something strange will stay there 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.450
 ok with the command 1 we give it back to 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.520
 barracks 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.520
 because it's already on top of barracks 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.459
 and we give you a business card voucher 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.100
 now something weird 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.830
 as you see and we give him the card again 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.830
 of visits to 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.220
 Once here, this is very important 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.030
 It is very important that we give you a 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:39.050
 time to the right twice to the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.879
 left and again to the right and you 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.530
 we give the above business card 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.840
 that has to stay there 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.940
 now I would have them let us move around 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.290
 all cards if not 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.000
 so you have done it wrong and three is 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.530
 to repeat it is valid but in theory if 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.700
 do as the video will get leave 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.489
 move now we will have to give the rv 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.459
 or lb is worth the tactics button or 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.590
 the lethal grenades we give you once I 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.269
 I'll give it once to the RV and we'll see 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.920
 that the paid visit cards are 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.420
 they put more claritas vale is not appreciated 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.730
 a lot but yes it is noticeable as you see 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.829
 now they have put more claritas vale 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.690
 once we have already done these that 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.549
 They are like unlocked and we have you 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.079
 to give the business card that 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.120
 we want to unblock myself 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.670
 example I'm going to give to the dragon and 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.900
 we will go out to buy it, we will not 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.420
 we have to give to buy to any 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.569
 side now we give it to the round is worth 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.269
 bird to bird we give back 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.310
 and we'll have it on and now 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.659
 we will get unlocked voucher as you see 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.389
 I already have it unlocked without having 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:43.140
 paid now very far back is worth it 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:45.480
 We give the bird a while until it comes out 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.890
 to go to the main menu to zombies and 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.110
 that's worth we have to give back 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.850
 as you see, it's worth it and once we have 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.560
 given back now we're going to 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.690
 barracks and we'll see what we have 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.610
 putting the business card and everything and 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.190
 Well I hope you liked the the 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.990
 Trick is worth seeing if we get to 300 likes 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.670
 I would greatly appreciate this new 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.080
 trick the bad wishes serves to 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.880
