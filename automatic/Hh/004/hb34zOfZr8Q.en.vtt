00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
we would say what's humble origins of

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.450 
we would say what's humble origins of
your<00:00:20.640> idea<00:00:21.350> where<00:00:22.350> does<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.619> come<00:00:22.800> from<00:00:22.859> inside

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
your idea where does it come from inside

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.849 
your idea where does it come from inside
and<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:24.539> they<00:00:24.689> would<00:00:24.840> say<00:00:25.019> well<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.320> sister<00:00:25.710> had

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and if they would say well my sister had

and if they would say well my sister had
polio<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.430> that's<00:00:26.640> why<00:00:26.880> I've<00:00:27.029> learned<00:00:27.300> this

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
polio and that's why I've learned this

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.230 
polio and that's why I've learned this
bodywork<00:00:27.900> or<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.920> was<00:00:29.369> an<00:00:29.490> asthmatic<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
bodywork or I was an asthmatic and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.790 
bodywork or I was an asthmatic and
that's<00:00:30.449> how<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> learned<00:00:30.929> how<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.140> breathe<00:00:31.470> now

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800

that's how I learned how to breathe now
family<00:00:32.790> would<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.360> would<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.510> would<00:00:33.809> book<00:00:34.110> them

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
family would we would we would book them

family would we would we would book them
we<00:00:34.620> would<00:00:34.739> put<00:00:34.920> them<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.760> they<00:00:35.880> didn't

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
we would put them in and if they didn't

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.690 
we would put them in and if they didn't
have<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.540> humble<00:00:37.260> origin<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.309> what<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.610> were

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
have a humble origin to what they were

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.290 
have a humble origin to what they were
doing

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
doing

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.990 
doing
like<00:00:39.750> Uncle<00:00:39.930> Harry<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:41.219> my<00:00:41.370> case<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.820> my

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
like Uncle Harry or in my case like my

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.670 
like Uncle Harry or in my case like my
father<00:00:43.850> we<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.300> said<00:00:45.510> no<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.899> passed<00:00:46.350> them

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
father we we said no we passed them

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.930 
father we we said no we passed them
because<00:00:47.690> this<00:00:48.690> kind<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.410> work<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.940> dimension

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
because this kind of work this dimension

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.869 
because this kind of work this dimension
has<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:51.590> has<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.620> come<00:00:52.949> at<00:00:53.100> first<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.670> think

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
has to be has to come at first I think

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.549 
has to be has to come at first I think
from<00:00:54.030> some<00:00:54.239> personal<00:00:54.660> place<00:00:54.870> someplace<00:00:55.320> where

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
from some personal place someplace where

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.470 
from some personal place someplace where
it<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:55.860> matters<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> your<00:00:56.579> own<00:00:56.820> soul<00:00:57.090> I

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
it really matters in your own soul I

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.840 
it really matters in your own soul I
think<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> old<00:00:58.500> days<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.219> used<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.579> say

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
think in the old days we used to say

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.639 
think in the old days we used to say
otherwise<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:00.750> sort<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.109> head<00:01:01.289> tripping

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
otherwise it was sort of head tripping

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.330 
otherwise it was sort of head tripping
that's<00:01:01.980> right

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that's right

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.830 
that's right
it<00:01:02.460> was<00:01:02.609> head<00:01:02.789> tripping<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.480> head<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> me

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it was head tripping it was head to me

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.370 
it was head tripping it was head to me
so<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> humble<00:01:04.439> origins<00:01:04.860> count<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.850> lot

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
so the humble origins count a lot

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.580 
so the humble origins count a lot
certainly<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.530> me<00:01:09.080> you've<00:01:10.080> been<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
father and my father was a surgeon in

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.770 
father and my father was a surgeon in
the<00:01:19.170> 40s<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> 50s<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.420> those<00:01:21.540> years

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the 40s and the 50s and in those years

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.660 
the 40s and the 50s and in those years
there<00:01:22.020> was<00:01:22.110> no<00:01:22.290> chemotherapy<00:01:22.650> there<00:01:23.400> was<00:01:23.490> no

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
there was no chemotherapy there was no

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.800 
there was no chemotherapy there was no
radiation<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.900> most<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.619> his<00:01:25.680> patients<00:01:25.890> died

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
radiation and most of his patients died

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.390 
radiation and most of his patients died
so<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> got<00:01:28.110> very<00:01:28.229> used<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> fact<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.220> my

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
so I got very used to the fact that my

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.100 
so I got very used to the fact that my
father<00:01:29.640> would<00:01:29.729> be<00:01:29.850> very<00:01:29.880> tired<00:01:30.329> some<00:01:30.689> mornings

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
father would be very tired some mornings

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.410 
father would be very tired some mornings
because<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.950> patient<00:01:32.430> had<00:01:32.520> died<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.150> he<00:01:33.329> had

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
because a patient had died and he had

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.440 
because a patient had died and he had
stayed<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:33.900> night<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.229> them<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.450> every

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
stayed up all night with them and every

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.480 
stayed up all night with them and every
time<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.659> patient<00:01:37.110> died<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.710> seemed<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.250> they

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
time a patient died it seemed that they

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.539 
time a patient died it seemed that they
gave<00:01:38.729> him<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.540> gift<00:01:39.720> for<00:01:40.020> me<00:01:40.140> either<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.159> stuffed

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
gave him a gift for me either a stuffed

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.270 
gave him a gift for me either a stuffed
animal<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.390> book<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.140> read<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.770> he<00:01:44.100> would<00:01:44.220> be

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
animal or a book to read so he would be

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800 
animal or a book to read so he would be
very<00:01:44.490> tired<00:01:44.729> there'd<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> president<00:01:45.659> my

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
very tired there'd be a president my

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
then I would say well where did they go

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.719 
then I would say well where did they go
when<00:01:52.290> they<00:01:52.320> died<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.130> he<00:01:53.340> would<00:01:53.460> say<00:01:53.610> they

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.020 
when they died and he would say they
went<00:01:53.880> someplace<00:01:54.119> else<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:55.790> made<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> lot<00:01:57.000> of

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
went someplace else I made a lot of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.030 
went someplace else I made a lot of
sense<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.899> they<00:01:58.049> went<00:01:58.259> someplace<00:01:58.469> else<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.009> I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
sense but they went someplace else so I

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.010 
sense but they went someplace else so I
learned<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.700> when<00:02:00.299> people<00:02:00.479> die<00:02:00.719> they<00:02:00.899> go

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
learned that when people die they go

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.179 
learned that when people die they go
someplace<00:02:01.290> else<00:02:01.729> they<00:02:02.729> die<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.500> some<00:02:04.500> very

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
someplace else they die and some very

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.709 
someplace else they die and some very
generous<00:02:05.640> take<00:02:05.880> because<00:02:06.060> they<00:02:06.149> all<00:02:06.360> bought<00:02:06.570> me

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
generous take because they all bought me

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.510

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
it was daddy's talking to children it

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.700 
it was daddy's talking to children it
wasn't<00:03:06.160> real<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.550> wasn't<00:03:06.790> very<00:03:07.030> true<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.840> then

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
wasn't real it wasn't very true and then

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.280 
wasn't real it wasn't very true and then
another<00:03:08.980> friend<00:03:09.220> died<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:10.180> he<00:03:10.870> died<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.140> the

going<00:03:17.470> someplace<00:03:17.740> else<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.600> thought<00:03:19.600> oh<00:03:20.160> now

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
going someplace else I thought oh now

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.050 
going someplace else I thought oh now
that's<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.550> difference<00:03:21.820> what's<00:03:21.940> the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
that's the difference what's the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.460 
that's the difference what's the
difference<00:03:22.390> between<00:03:22.540> these<00:03:22.870> two<00:03:23.050> men<00:03:23.230> because

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
difference between these two men because

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.590 
difference between these two men because
they<00:03:23.590> were<00:03:23.680> both<00:03:23.860> very<00:03:24.550> young<00:03:24.610> men<00:03:25.000> both<00:03:25.300> very

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
they were both very young men both very

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.860 
they were both very young men both very
tragic<00:03:26.110> deaths<00:03:26.350> both<00:03:27.040> very<00:03:27.280> funny<00:03:27.670> men<00:03:28.000> both

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
tragic deaths both very funny men both

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.650 
tragic deaths both very funny men both
very<00:03:29.170> well<00:03:29.320> educated<00:03:29.500> men<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.459> one<00:03:31.180> died<00:03:31.390> a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
very well educated men and one died a

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.750 
very well educated men and one died a
horrible<00:03:32.080> death<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.709> one<00:03:33.010> died<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.400> glorious

horrible death and one died of glorious

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.420 
horrible death and one died of glorious
death<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.020> difference<00:03:35.380> is<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:36.130> found

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
death and the difference is that I found

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.449 
death and the difference is that I found
that<00:03:37.270> the<00:03:37.510> one<00:03:37.660> who<00:03:37.840> died<00:03:38.020> a<00:03:38.380> glorious<00:03:39.280> death

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
that the one who died a glorious death

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.570 
that the one who died a glorious death
believed<00:03:39.880> he<00:03:40.000> was<00:03:40.120> going<00:03:40.390> someplace<00:03:40.660> else<00:03:41.050> and

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
believed he was going someplace else and

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.640 
believed he was going someplace else and
I<00:03:42.580> thought<00:03:42.760> well<00:03:43.450> let's<00:03:43.690> find<00:03:44.260> out<00:03:44.500> about

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
I thought well let's find out about

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.830 
I thought well let's find out about
someplace<00:03:45.220> else<00:03:45.490> let's<00:03:46.330> find<00:03:46.570> out<00:03:46.720> what

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
someplace else let's find out what

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.860 
someplace else let's find out what
they're<00:03:46.990> like<00:03:47.110> so<00:03:47.740> there's<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.130> sense<00:03:48.610> in<00:03:49.240> these

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
they're like so there's a sense in these

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.730 
they're like so there's a sense in these
two<00:03:50.260> deaths<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.480> idea<00:03:52.480> of<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:53.200> someplace

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
two deaths that the idea of a someplace

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.060 
two deaths that the idea of a someplace
else<00:03:54.100> an<00:03:54.370> idea<00:03:54.730> of<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.959> soul<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.620> larger
