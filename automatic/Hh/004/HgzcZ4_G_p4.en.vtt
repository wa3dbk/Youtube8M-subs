Formula<00:00:43.449> 1<00:00:43.570> 30<00:00:43.780> track<00:00:43.989> into<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.230> 134<00:00:44.710> track<00:00:44.920> so

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
Formula 1 30 track into the 134 track so

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.049 
Formula 1 30 track into the 134 track so
I'll<00:00:45.219> just<00:00:45.399> change<00:00:45.670> this<00:00:45.820> to<00:00:46.660> 1:30<00:00:47.340> now<00:00:48.340> if<00:00:48.610> you

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
I'll just change this to 1:30 now if you

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.810 
I'll just change this to 1:30 now if you
wanted<00:00:49.359> to<00:00:49.510> do<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:49.960> quick<00:00:50.620> swap<00:00:50.980> transition

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
wanted to do the quick swap transition

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.580 
wanted to do the quick swap transition
style<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.750> best<00:00:52.870> way<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.109> do<00:00:53.320> that<00:00:53.379> would<00:00:53.559> be

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
style the best way to do that would be

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.060 
style the best way to do that would be
to<00:00:53.710> play<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.280> track<00:00:54.899> click<00:00:55.899> here<00:00:56.379> in<00:00:56.530> the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
tempo box type in the BPM that you want

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.439 
tempo box type in the BPM that you want
and<00:01:02.050> at<00:01:02.769> the<00:01:02.829> time<00:01:03.250> that<00:01:03.429> you<00:01:03.550> want<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:04.030> BPM<00:01:04.420> to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
and at the time that you want the BPM to

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.930 
and at the time that you want the BPM to
change<00:01:04.750> just<00:01:05.440> hit<00:01:05.590> enter<00:01:05.890> now<00:01:06.610> let<00:01:06.730> me<00:01:06.820> show

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
change just hit enter now let me show

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:18.570 
change just hit enter now let me show
you<00:01:07.000> what<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.270> looks<00:01:07.660> like<00:01:07.750> in<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:09.340> mix

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.700 

you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.800 

so<00:01:23.400> that's<00:01:23.550> how<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.700> would<00:01:23.910> do<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.480> quick

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
so that's how you would do the quick

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.650 
so that's how you would do the quick
swap<00:01:25.080> transition<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:26.010> you<00:01:26.700> were<00:01:26.820> doing<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.330> on

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
swap transition if you were doing it on

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.290 
swap transition if you were doing it on
the<00:01:27.870> fly<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:29.010> to<00:01:29.070> type<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> BPM

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
the fly you just want to type in the BPM

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.260 
the fly you just want to type in the BPM
into<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.260> tempo<00:01:31.530> box<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.040> wait<00:01:32.670> until<00:01:33.120> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
into the tempo box and wait until you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.110 
into the tempo box and wait until you
want<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:34.050> time<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.470> which<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.620> want<00:01:35.010> to<00:01:35.120> swap

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
want the time in which you want to swap

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.240 
want the time in which you want to swap
the<00:01:36.300> DB<00:01:36.990> PMS<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.410> then<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.740> hit<00:01:37.830> enter<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the DB PMS and then just hit enter and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.420 
the DB PMS and then just hit enter and
that's<00:01:39.240> how<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> quick<00:01:39.930> swap<00:01:40.170> now<00:01:41.070> if

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that's how to do the quick swap now if

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.500 
that's how to do the quick swap now if
you<00:01:41.640> don't<00:01:41.700> want<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.940> do<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> quick<00:01:42.300> swap

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
you don't want to do the quick swap

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.430 
you don't want to do the quick swap
transition<00:01:43.050> you<00:01:43.650> can<00:01:43.680> also<00:01:44.450> simply<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:46.410> a

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
transition you can also simply do a

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.690 
transition you can also simply do a
similar<00:01:47.450> action<00:01:48.560> but<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.520> is

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
similar action but this is and this is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.270 
similar action but this is and this is
for<00:01:51.240> many<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> different<00:01:52.170> options<00:01:52.650> in

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
for many of the different options in

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.040 
for many of the different options in
line<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:53.760> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.300> play<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
line but what you can do is play the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.370 
line but what you can do is play the
track<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.560> click<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> tempo<00:01:57.060> box<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:57.990> use

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
track and click on the tempo box and use

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.190 
track and click on the tempo box and use
the<00:01:58.590> arrow<00:01:58.830> keys<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.090> down<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.720> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the arrow keys to go up and down in the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.910 
the arrow keys to go up and down in the
BPM<00:02:01.619> now<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.250> will<00:02:02.460> say<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.940> if<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.479> this

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
BPM now I will say that if you do this

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.340 
BPM now I will say that if you do this
you<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.490> only<00:02:05.729> adjust<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.390> BPM<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:07.820> full<00:02:09.350> 1:1

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
you can only adjust the BPM in full 1:1

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.590 
you can only adjust the BPM in full 1:1
BPM<00:02:10.800> interval<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:11.400> right<00:02:11.760> now<00:02:11.880> it's<00:02:12.030> at<00:02:12.150> 1:30

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
BPM interval so right now it's at 1:30

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.170 
BPM interval so right now it's at 1:30
and<00:02:12.780> if<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.650> press<00:02:14.070> up<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:14.790> see<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.090> it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
and if we press up you can see that it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.410 
and if we press up you can see that it
goes<00:02:15.239> up<00:02:15.480> by<00:02:15.750> 1<00:02:16.230> BPM<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.250> press<00:02:17.430> down<00:02:17.459> it

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
goes up by 1 BPM if you press down it

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.229 
goes up by 1 BPM if you press down it
will<00:02:18.540> go<00:02:18.660> down<00:02:18.810> by<00:02:19.200> 1<00:02:19.440> BPM<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.940> do<00:02:21.090> that

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
will go down by 1 BPM so you can do that

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.120 
will go down by 1 BPM so you can do that
in<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.290> mix<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:23.340> as<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.820> said<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:25.590> can<00:02:25.739> only<00:02:25.890> do

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
in the mix but as I said you can only do

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.980 
in the mix but as I said you can only do
it<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.430> intervals<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.150> 1

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.320 

the<00:02:30.830> best<00:02:31.040> way<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.250> do<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.820> if<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.120> have<00:02:32.300> a

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the best way to do this is if you have a

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.320 
the best way to do this is if you have a
mini<00:02:32.600> controller<00:02:33.020> as<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:34.250> can<00:02:34.370> see<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.820> have

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
mini controller as you can see I have

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.010 
mini controller as you can see I have
the<00:02:35.720> m-audio<00:02:36.200> X<00:02:36.680> session<00:02:37.040> Pro<00:02:37.250> out<00:02:37.490> here<00:02:38.060> and

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
the m-audio X session Pro out here and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.730 
the m-audio X session Pro out here and
what<00:02:39.230> I'm<00:02:39.320> going<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.470> do<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:41.240> map<00:02:41.810> two<00:02:42.560> of

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
what I'm going to do is to map two of

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.840 
what I'm going to do is to map two of
the<00:02:42.860> knobs<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.730> adjust<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:44.860> tempo<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:46.070> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
the knobs to adjust the tempo of the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.210 
the knobs to adjust the tempo of the
live<00:02:47.060> project<00:02:47.750> what<00:02:48.590> we're<00:02:48.680> going<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.860> do<00:02:49.010> is

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
live project what we're going to do is

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.930 
live project what we're going to do is
go<00:02:49.550> up<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.210> mini<00:02:50.690> button<00:02:51.080> here<00:02:51.680> on<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.700> top

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
go up to the mini button here on the top

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.460 
go up to the mini button here on the top
right<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:53.690> can<00:02:53.870> see<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:54.140> now<00:02:54.290> we<00:02:54.320> have

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
right and you can see that now we have

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.310 
right and you can see that now we have
all<00:02:54.770> of<00:02:54.800> these<00:02:54.980> blue<00:02:55.250> options<00:02:56.080> I'm<00:02:57.080> going<00:02:57.260> to

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
all of these blue options I'm going to

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.860 
all of these blue options I'm going to
open<00:02:57.530> up<00:02:57.680> our<00:02:57.860> browser<00:02:58.700> here<00:02:59.270> and<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.570> can<00:02:59.720> see

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
open up our browser here and you can see

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.480 
open up our browser here and you can see
that<00:03:00.020> we<00:03:00.110> have<00:03:00.260> all<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.650> mini<00:03:00.800> mappings<00:03:01.250> in

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
that we have all of the mini mappings in

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.990 
that we have all of the mini mappings in
our<00:03:02.090> project<00:03:02.480> right<00:03:02.690> now<00:03:02.720> we<00:03:02.870> don't<00:03:03.080> have<00:03:03.170> any

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
our project right now we don't have any

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.910 
our project right now we don't have any
we're<00:03:05.000> going<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.180> do<00:03:05.300> is<00:03:05.480> click<00:03:06.050> on<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.500> tempo

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
we're going to do is click on the tempo

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.740 
we're going to do is click on the tempo
and<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.490> can<00:03:07.640> see<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:08.090> we<00:03:08.210> have<00:03:08.330> two

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
and you can see that we have two

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.620 
and you can see that we have two
different<00:03:09.530> options<00:03:10.100> here<00:03:10.640> one<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.030> coarse<00:03:11.420> and

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
different options here one is coarse and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.080 
different options here one is coarse and
one<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:11.930> fine<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.440> I<00:03:13.340> believe<00:03:13.640> that's<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.970> new

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
one it's fine and I believe that's a new

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.990 
one it's fine and I believe that's a new
feature<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.980> recent<00:03:16.520> versions<00:03:16.970> of<00:03:17.060> live<00:03:17.960> I

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
feature to the recent versions of live I

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.950 
feature to the recent versions of live I
don't<00:03:20.000> think<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.180> was<00:03:20.240> in<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.480> older<00:03:20.690> versions

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
don't think it was in the older versions

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.200 
don't think it was in the older versions
but<00:03:21.170> in<00:03:21.320> hue<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:22.610> we're<00:03:22.700> going<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:22.850> click<00:03:23.030> on

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
but in hue so we're going to click on

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.450 
but in hue so we're going to click on
course<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.990> then<00:03:24.530> we're<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:24.710> going<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.010> move

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
course and then we're just going to move

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.870 
course and then we're just going to move
one<00:03:26.240> of<00:03:26.390> our<00:03:26.570> oh<00:03:27.700> like<00:03:28.700> X<00:03:28.940> not<00:03:30.490> one<00:03:31.490> of<00:03:31.580> our<00:03:31.670> mini

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
one of our oh like X not one of our mini

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
one of our oh like X not one of our mini
knobs<00:03:32.120> there<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.540> then<00:03:32.630> we're<00:03:32.750> going<00:03:32.840> to

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
knobs there and then we're going to

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.710 
knobs there and then we're going to
click<00:03:33.080> on<00:03:33.200> fine<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:34.120> we're<00:03:35.120> going<00:03:35.240> to<00:03:35.270> move<00:03:35.450> a

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
click on fine and we're going to move a

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.980 
click on fine and we're going to move a
second<00:03:36.230> MIDI<00:03:36.410> knob<00:03:37.180> now<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.240> one<00:03:38.510> important

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
second MIDI knob now the one important

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.200 
second MIDI knob now the one important
thing<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.230> do<00:03:39.410> here<00:03:39.830> is<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.430> set<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:40.850> minimum

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
thing to do here is to set the minimum

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.860 
thing to do here is to set the minimum
and<00:03:41.630> maximum<00:03:42.020> value<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:43.060> your<00:03:44.060> tempo<00:03:44.930> control

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
and maximum value of your tempo control

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.270 
and maximum value of your tempo control
because<00:03:47.870> if<00:03:48.110> you<00:03:48.260> don't<00:03:48.350> do<00:03:48.560> this<00:03:48.710> it's<00:03:49.160> going

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
because if you don't do this it's going

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.720 
because if you don't do this it's going
to<00:03:49.340> be<00:03:49.460> impossible<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:50.450> get<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.200> BPM<00:03:51.680> close<00:03:52.520> to

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
to be impossible to get the BPM close to

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.490 
to be impossible to get the BPM close to
the<00:03:52.820> new<00:03:52.940> track<00:03:53.300> as<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.570> can<00:03:53.780> see<00:03:53.960> this<00:03:54.110> value

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
the new track as you can see this value

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.860 
the new track as you can see this value
is<00:03:54.740> huge<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.700> since<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.150> know<00:03:56.210> that<00:03:56.570> the<00:03:56.630> track

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
is huge and since I know that the track

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.370 
is huge and since I know that the track
that<00:03:57.080> I'm<00:03:57.200> going<00:03:57.530> from<00:03:57.770> is<00:03:58.210> 130<00:03:59.210> to<00:03:59.390> 134<00:04:00.080> I'll

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
that I'm going from is 130 to 134 I'll

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.090 
that I'm going from is 130 to 134 I'll
just<00:04:01.040> set<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.990> minimum<00:04:02.990> as<00:04:03.290> 130<00:04:03.770> and<00:04:04.040> the

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
just set the minimum as 130 and the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.090 
just set the minimum as 130 and the
maximum<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.360> 134<00:04:06.050> and<00:04:07.270> the<00:04:08.770> degree<00:04:09.770> at<00:04:09.920> which

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
maximum to 134 and the degree at which

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.450 
maximum to 134 and the degree at which
they<00:04:10.310> can<00:04:10.490> go<00:04:10.820> between<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.360> now<00:04:11.750> much<00:04:12.650> smaller

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
they can go between is now much smaller

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.700 
they can go between is now much smaller
so<00:04:14.390> I'm<00:04:14.480> going<00:04:14.600> to<00:04:14.660> get<00:04:14.780> out<00:04:14.960> of<00:04:14.990> mini<00:04:15.320> mapping

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
so I'm going to get out of mini mapping

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.210 
so I'm going to get out of mini mapping
mode<00:04:15.860> and<00:04:16.420> you<00:04:17.420> can<00:04:17.600> see<00:04:17.870> that<00:04:18.440> if<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.680> turn<00:04:18.980> this

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
mode and you can see that if I turn this

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:27.190 
mode and you can see that if I turn this
knob<00:04:20.200> that<00:04:21.200> it<00:04:21.380> changes<00:04:24.580> from<00:04:25.580> 130<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.210> 134<00:04:27.050> if

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
knob that it changes from 130 to 134 if

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.500 
knob that it changes from 130 to 134 if
I<00:04:27.260> go<00:04:27.410> all<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.650> way<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:29.060> can<00:04:29.210> also<00:04:29.300> see

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
I go all the way and you can also see

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.010 
I go all the way and you can also see
that<00:04:29.540> this<00:04:29.750> top<00:04:30.020> knob<00:04:30.320> will<00:04:31.070> change<00:04:31.550> in<00:04:32.090> a

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
that this top knob will change in a

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.350 
that this top knob will change in a
finer<00:04:33.500> adjustment<00:04:35.200> see<00:04:37.000> so<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.060> doesn't<00:04:38.270> go

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
finer adjustment see so it doesn't go

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.350 
finer adjustment see so it doesn't go
all<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.540> way<00:04:38.570> and<00:04:38.720> each<00:04:39.350> move

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
all the way and each move

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.670 
all the way and each move
point<00:04:42.360> zero<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:44.360> BPM<00:04:45.360> or<00:04:45.630> as<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:46.050> bottom<00:04:46.470> one

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
point zero to BPM or as this bottom one

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.960 
point zero to BPM or as this bottom one
does<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.880> much<00:04:48.150> larger<00:04:49.080> range<00:04:49.790> so<00:04:50.790> now<00:04:50.880> I'm

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
does a much larger range so now I'm

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.730 
does a much larger range so now I'm
going<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.150> show<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:51.300> how<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:51.960> would<00:04:52.200> use<00:04:52.500> that

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
going to show you how you would use that

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.710 
going to show you how you would use that
in<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.490> mix<00:04:53.700> so<00:04:53.880> let's<00:04:54.090> start<00:04:54.360> playing<00:04:54.570> it

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
in the mix so let's start playing it

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.720 
in the mix so let's start playing it
again<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.110> over<00:04:55.680> time<00:04:55.920> you'll<00:04:56.130> see<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:56.460> as<00:04:56.580> I

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
again and over time you'll see that as I

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.440 
again and over time you'll see that as I
move<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.630> midi-controller<00:04:58.730> knob<00:04:59.730> to<00:05:00.420> the

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
move the midi-controller knob to the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.650 
move the midi-controller knob to the
right<00:05:00.600> that<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.920> tempo<00:05:02.700> will<00:05:02.940> change<00:05:03.270> so

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
right that the tempo will change so

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.260 
right that the tempo will change so
let's<00:05:03.840> take<00:05:04.020> a<00:05:04.050> look<00:05:04.200> at<00:05:04.290> how<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:04.590> works<00:05:04.770> and

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
let's take a look at how that works and

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.260 
let's take a look at how that works and
as<00:05:06.270> as<00:05:07.050> I'm<00:05:07.650> doing<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:07.980> I'll<00:05:08.160> just<00:05:08.190> record<00:05:09.180> it

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
as as I'm doing this I'll just record it

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.570 
as as I'm doing this I'll just record it
in<00:05:09.420> the<00:05:09.750> automation<00:05:10.080> so<00:05:10.410> you<00:05:10.500> can<00:05:10.620> see<00:05:10.860> what<00:05:11.490> it

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
in the automation so you can see what it

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:27.350 
in the automation so you can see what it
looks<00:05:11.730> like

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.719 

all<00:05:28.360> right<00:05:28.479> so<00:05:28.660> you<00:05:28.870> can<00:05:29.169> see<00:05:30.180> that<00:05:31.319> we<00:05:32.319> have

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
all right so you can see that we have

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.399 
all right so you can see that we have
started<00:05:33.729> at<00:05:33.940> 1:30<00:05:34.389> and<00:05:34.539> we've<00:05:34.900> gone<00:05:35.080> all<00:05:35.289> the

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
started at 1:30 and we've gone all the

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.770 
started at 1:30 and we've gone all the
way<00:05:35.440> up<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:37.319> 134<00:05:38.319> BPM<00:05:39.220> now<00:05:40.000> you<00:05:40.120> could<00:05:40.330> do<00:05:40.629> this

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
way up to 134 BPM now you could do this

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.450 
way up to 134 BPM now you could do this
in<00:05:41.020> different<00:05:41.050> directions<00:05:41.830> and<00:05:42.039> you<00:05:42.129> can<00:05:42.280> also

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
in different directions and you can also

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.399 
in different directions and you can also
you<00:05:42.639> know<00:05:42.909> play<00:05:43.720> with<00:05:43.900> the<00:05:43.990> knob<00:05:44.110> if<00:05:44.289> you

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
you know play with the knob if you

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:45.770 
you know play with the knob if you
switch<00:05:44.650> it<00:05:44.770> back<00:05:44.889> and<00:05:45.129> forth<00:05:45.370> really<00:05:45.580> quickly

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
switch it back and forth really quickly

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.510 
switch it back and forth really quickly
then<00:05:46.780> it<00:05:46.960> will<00:05:47.080> change<00:05:47.349> the<00:05:47.530> BPM<00:05:47.680> quite

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
then it will change the BPM quite

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.969 
then it will change the BPM quite
drastically<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:49.319> that's<00:05:50.319> how<00:05:50.530> you<00:05:50.620> can

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
drastically and that's how you can

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.420 
drastically and that's how you can
adjust<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:52.379> BPM<00:05:53.379> of<00:05:53.650> an<00:05:53.889> Ableton<00:05:54.190> Live

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
adjust the BPM of an Ableton Live

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.539 
adjust the BPM of an Ableton Live
project<00:05:54.940> on<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.360> fly
