little<00:00:11.550> bit<00:00:11.670> too<00:00:11.759> hard<00:00:11.969> for<00:00:12.120> me<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.300> really<00:00:12.570> set

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
little bit too hard for me to really set

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.570 
little bit too hard for me to really set
read<00:00:12.929> properly<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.950> let<00:00:14.070> me<00:00:14.130> just<00:00:14.340> show<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.490> a

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.790 
read properly so let me just show you a
couple<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:15.030> cool<00:00:15.299> things<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.630> happens<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.320> in

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
couple of cool things that happens so in

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.300 
couple of cool things that happens so in
the<00:00:16.890> beginning<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.560> then<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.769> have<00:00:22.920> all<00:00:23.100> these

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the beginning and then we have all these

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.060 
the beginning and then we have all these
like<00:00:23.550> really<00:00:24.210> fast<00:00:27.650> so<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:28.710> I'm<00:00:28.830> doing<00:00:28.859> is

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
like really fast so what I'm doing is

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.769 
like really fast so what I'm doing is
I'm<00:00:29.189> doing<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.429> really<00:00:29.730> really<00:00:29.849> tight<00:00:30.330> ricochet

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
I'm doing a really really tight ricochet

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.030 
I'm doing a really really tight ricochet
like<00:00:32.030> in<00:00:33.050> order<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.469> really<00:00:34.649> have

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
like in order to do that I really have

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.760 
like in order to do that I really have
to<00:00:35.250> tighten<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:36.000> my<00:00:36.390> fingers<00:00:36.630> usually<00:00:37.530> when<00:00:37.739> I

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
to tighten my my fingers usually when I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.290 
to tighten my my fingers usually when I
play<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> keep<00:00:38.550> my<00:00:38.700> fingers<00:00:39.000> really

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
play I like to keep my fingers really

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.970 
play I like to keep my fingers really
really<00:00:39.600> relaxed<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.290> case<00:00:40.530> I'm

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
really relaxed but in this case I'm

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.799 
really relaxed but in this case I'm
going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> tighten<00:00:41.430> them<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.610> because<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.600> want

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
going to tighten them up because I want

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:53.850 
going to tighten them up because I want
it<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> bounce

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.790 

and<00:00:55.420> then<00:00:56.420> let's<00:00:57.050> say<00:00:57.140> this<00:00:57.230> one<00:00:57.440> is<00:00:57.590> I<00:00:57.770> think

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
and then let's say this one is I think

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.140 
and then let's say this one is I think
slides<00:01:00.550> now<00:01:01.550> these<00:01:01.850> harmonics<00:01:03.850> my<00:01:04.850> hand

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
slides now these harmonics my hand

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.390 
slides now these harmonics my hand
actually<00:01:05.750> just<00:01:06.290> stretches<00:01:06.740> out<00:01:06.920> about<00:01:07.160> this

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
actually just stretches out about this

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.090 
actually just stretches out about this
far<00:01:07.640> on<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.480> body<00:01:09.110> of<00:01:09.230> the<00:01:09.410> violin<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:09.980> so

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
far on the the body of the violin and so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.120 
far on the the body of the violin and so
I've<00:01:10.190> just<00:01:10.220> kind<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:10.580> memorized<00:01:11.920> but<00:01:12.920> that's

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
I've just kind of memorized but that's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:21.520 
I've just kind of memorized but that's
where<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.520> ends<00:01:13.790> up<00:01:16.060> so<00:01:19.840> that's<00:01:20.840> that's<00:01:21.290> the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
where it ends up so that's that's the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.260 
where it ends up so that's that's the
the<00:01:21.920> point<00:01:22.160> of<00:01:22.250> reference<00:01:22.400> I'm<00:01:22.700> using<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.210> you

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
the point of reference I'm using so you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.090 
the point of reference I'm using so you
don't<00:01:23.450> have<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:23.660> think<00:01:23.840> of<00:01:23.930> it<00:01:24.050> as<00:01:24.380> much<00:01:24.710> of<00:01:24.890> a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
don't have to think of it as much of a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.800 
don't have to think of it as much of a
shift<00:01:25.430> as<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:26.030> should<00:01:26.360> shouldn't<00:01:26.570> think<00:01:26.690> of

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
shift as you should shouldn't think of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.710 
shift as you should shouldn't think of
it<00:01:26.960> as<00:01:27.140> placing<00:01:27.740> your<00:01:27.830> hand<00:01:28.100> where<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.030> body

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
it as placing your hand where the body

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.430 
it as placing your hand where the body
where<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.170> rip<00:01:30.440> this<00:01:30.740> part<00:01:31.430> of<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.610> violin<00:01:31.970> is

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
where the rip this part of the violin is

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.480 
where the rip this part of the violin is
comfortably<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:33.979> then<00:01:34.070> just<00:01:34.280> let<00:01:34.369> your

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
comfortably and then just let your

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.060 
comfortably and then just let your
fingers<00:01:34.790> slide<00:01:35.060> out<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.570> is<00:01:35.690> extended

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:55.020 

okay<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.130> putting<00:01:40.640> those<00:01:40.820> together

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.430 

like<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.450> it's<00:01:56.840> actually<00:01:57.080> kind<00:01:57.230> of<00:01:57.260> cool

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
like that and it's actually kind of cool

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.950 
like that and it's actually kind of cool
I<00:01:57.500> like<00:01:57.710> that<00:01:57.740> because<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.880> harmonics<00:01:59.780> can

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
I like that because the harmonics can

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.370 
I like that because the harmonics can
ring<00:02:00.200> now<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.400> next<00:02:01.730> part<00:02:01.940> is<00:02:02.380> false

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
ring now the next part is false

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.050 
ring now the next part is false
harmonics<00:02:03.800> so<00:02:04.370> basically<00:02:04.670> what<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:04.940> do<00:02:05.030> is

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
harmonics so basically what you do is

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.210 
harmonics so basically what you do is
you<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.510> put<00:02:05.720> one<00:02:05.870> finger<00:02:06.020> down<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:06.590> then<00:02:07.130> you

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
you you put one finger down and then you

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.260 
you you put one finger down and then you
stick<00:02:07.520> your<00:02:07.850> fourth<00:02:08.570> finger<00:02:08.630> down<00:02:09.050> on<00:02:09.410> the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
stick your fourth finger down on the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.510 
stick your fourth finger down on the
well<00:02:11.270> okay<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:11.570> let<00:02:11.780> me<00:02:11.840> show<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.400> see

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
well okay so let me show you so you see

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.820 
well okay so let me show you so you see
how<00:02:16.610> that's<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.910> that's<00:02:17.180> making<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.720> fourth<00:02:18.230> you

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
how that's a that's making a fourth you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.670 
how that's a that's making a fourth you
can<00:02:18.860> do<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.190> anywhere<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:24.290> that's<00:02:24.410> what<00:02:24.590> I'm

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
can do it anywhere so that's what I'm

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:34.720 
can do it anywhere so that's what I'm
going<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.920> do<00:02:25.100> here<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:25.370> let<00:02:25.580> me<00:02:25.610> show<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:33.730> so

keep stopping to explain but I'm just
keeping<00:02:39.590> my<00:02:39.620> fingers<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.640> same<00:02:40.880> distance

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
keeping my fingers the same distance

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:54.460 
keeping my fingers the same distance
basically<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:53.030> then<00:02:53.209> this<00:02:53.360> part<00:02:53.660> just<00:02:54.200> jumps

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
basically and then this part just jumps

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.720 
basically and then this part just jumps
up<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:57.530> it's<00:02:57.620> basically<00:02:57.920> combining<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.550> two

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
up so it's basically combining the two

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.120 
up so it's basically combining the two
it's<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.090> slide<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.690> then<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.019> Ricochet<00:03:01.510> and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
it's the slide and then the Ricochet and

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.759 
it's the slide and then the Ricochet and
then<00:03:04.130> finally<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.900> let<00:03:06.260> me<00:03:06.320> see<00:03:06.440> if<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.560> can<00:03:06.680> do

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
then finally so let me see if I can do

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:20.940 
then finally so let me see if I can do
that<00:03:06.890> together

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.470 

okay<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.459> now<00:03:22.550> that<00:03:22.670> I've<00:03:22.820> had<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.120> chance<00:03:23.390> to

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
okay so now that I've had a chance to

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.360 
okay so now that I've had a chance to
practice<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:24.019> during<00:03:24.590> this<00:03:24.709> video<00:03:24.950> I'm

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
practice this during this video I'm

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.460 
practice this during this video I'm
gonna<00:03:25.550> give<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.880> shot<00:03:25.910> at<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.360> end<00:03:26.510> from<00:03:27.410> the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
gonna give it a shot at the end from the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.340 
gonna give it a shot at the end from the
beginning<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:27.950> end<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.370> then<00:03:29.120> call<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:29.660> so

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
beginning to the end and then call it so

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:46.000 
beginning to the end and then call it so
here<00:03:30.500> we<00:03:30.560> go

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:04:14.679 

let's<00:03:47.010> try<00:03:47.159> that<00:03:47.219> again<00:03:49.549> it's<00:03:50.549> getting<00:03:50.760> harder

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:31.939 

more<00:04:15.689> time<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:29.539> almost<00:04:30.539> nailed<00:04:30.720> that<00:04:30.949> anyways

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
more time I almost nailed that anyways

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.310 
more time I almost nailed that anyways
thanks<00:04:32.729> very<00:04:32.910> much<00:04:33.060> for<00:04:33.300> suggesting<00:04:33.930> this<00:04:34.080> one
