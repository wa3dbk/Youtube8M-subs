them up I know they'll travel easy you
have<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.979> do<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.399> nice<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.580> slow<00:02:08.910> though

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
have to do it nice and slow though

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.610 
have to do it nice and slow though
because<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> wafer<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.649> they<00:02:10.860> flake

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
because it is a wafer and they flake

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.649 
because it is a wafer and they flake
so<00:02:12.739> if<00:02:13.129> one<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.610> shorter<00:02:13.940> than<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.120> other<00:02:14.239> just

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
so if one is shorter than the other just

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.720 
so if one is shorter than the other just
trim<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.260> other<00:02:15.409> so<00:02:15.739> that<00:02:15.890> they<00:02:16.069> are<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.519> same

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
trim the other so that they are the same

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.240 
trim the other so that they are the same

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.700 
it doesn't seem very stable you can just
lift<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.289> up

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710
