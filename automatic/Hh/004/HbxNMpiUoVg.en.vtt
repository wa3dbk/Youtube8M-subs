00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.040
 there are good states to what it smells 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.859
 recommended I bring you black gameplay 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.570
 ops 2 and well I bring you a video 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.299
 who practices that is the last one that 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.450
 I was talking about what is for me 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:18.800
 let's say the best submachine gun and good 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.260
 there is in fact when the smoke came out one 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.849
 of the let's say that of the weapons that I said 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.590
 that was practically the best in the game 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.970
 of the msc 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.859
 you know that there have been as I do not know 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.269
 how many updates three or four 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.530
 updates in which they have 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.120
 changed the mmc and therefore not 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.620
 can we dedicate that compare with him as 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.899
 at the beginning but it still follows 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.850
 being my favorite rifle eye that's not 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.399
 it means that it is the best in the world 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.260
 or anything like that or if not 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.570
 use this weapon you are not going to kill 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.210
 that simply for me this weapon is 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.940
 we would almost say that the best 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.559
 all the best of all possible I know that 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.289
 the oil great many people 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.199
 He likes it but I do not know why I do not know no 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.870
 I know if I do not know honestly I did not like it 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.100
 use we use it using the mmc and ya 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.300
 you know that always using lots of 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.150
 different weapons not even barely 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.670
 He used the ms m 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.890
 but good as I say but to me 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.450
 personally it is quite good and more 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.580
 that nothing by elimination because then 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.650
 let's say that the other possible ones have the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.870
 scorpion that is a weapon that has 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.860
 very many cadence you decide 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.750
 for a lot of bullets per second and it's 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.660
 very well and how fast I do not like it 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.190
 how is it going too much from the hip and 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.540
 even better to go the sound of the weapon is 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.580
 that the sound seems to me that I do not know what it is 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.140
 a weapon that pulls a lot is I do not know 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.740
 just how will it be how it moves 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.780
 etc 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.840
 I like the truth and that's why 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.119
 that I almost always choose it 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.700
 sometimes carry a double charger a 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.000
 loader I have expanded sometimes takes it 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.060
 also with a kind of hard cannon 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.440
 but that it is true that 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.780
 grip does not work for practically 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.600
 nothing to try to take it with a silencer and 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.310
 the peephole laser melilla enough for me going 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.820
 pretty good because he always shoots with 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.740
 let's say that very very successful from that of 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.720
 this race and that 's what I floor 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.040
 bring and I tell you try fast charger 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.869
 It also goes very well especially for 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.530
 show if you're all the time playing 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.900
 game modes 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.100
 for example sheet demolition 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.720
 Earth is game mode 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.040
 a lot of people and you're going to have to 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.050
 recharge quickly but if not 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.190
 virtually no needless can 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.230
 take what you want is not because it is 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.120
 a measure because it is absurd to put it on 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.160
 the its possible is never one of my 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.290
 videos but normal is to take it and it has been 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.120
 with a long barrel if you want a 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.830
 peephole would be to fly with stability 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.270
 be more than enough a silencer 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.060
 you are playing you love but if you 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.880
 let's say a little more to ninja but 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.370
 little more as I tell you in the rest the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.410
 rest, basically, you try to be a kid 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.150
 normal that is not that they are bad but it is 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.459
 that are not as good as these at 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.690
 same as the resource vector 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.489
 practically the same is a weapon that is 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.810
 pretty good I love it but if 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.580
 I had to choose would choose this is 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.720
 say no by choosing this simple that 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.790
 the others are worse but simply 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.830
 that I like that and nigeria with 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.380
 this double pedro is what I say 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.459
 I do not know why it did not convince me before 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.290
 too good I did not like to use 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.730
 both because it was too good 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.650
 then something changed aircraft 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.140
 different from a lot of people using 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.790
 the same the key of w although it follows 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.040
 it remains but not being which 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.610
 principle and that's why I 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.070
 I say that I 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.810
 diskeeper is not bad but it is normal that 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.600
 it's like more mid-distance I know that 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.730
 many people who do not play do not play with 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.160
 the books better said does not have the pack 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.730
 of maps and plays that you can not play with 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.740
 these weapons 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.330
 believes that the specter but about it 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.220
 we would be lapinsky pÃ©rez spectrum 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.200
 very good as, however, it is not for 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.280
 nothing is to say it is normal that it goes well to 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.130
 medium distance but at a short distance 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.690
 really bad because it's a little bit long 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.280
 distance is also very bad 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.810
 that is, practically to be 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.940
 effective effective you have to mount 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.840
 someone not very close but not very 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.470
 far 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.910
 medium distance and then as I say no 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.890
 is that these are bad but it is that 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.810
 is the best for me to practice in 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.880
 use the bullets more things that I 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.020
 like iron minilla ie 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.330
 when ten miles I like how 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.459
 it works I like practically how it is 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.980
 and that's why it's why I 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.660
 I could put the car or fear 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.610
 Always wear it also vest 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.870
 Bulletproof dexterity for the correct side 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.930
 for another if you want to also put 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.030
 let's say they are going to a lightweight 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.010
 but not practically I would stay 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.380
 as not with hardness 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.870
 and scavengers use it I would use 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.400
 as practically indispensable as well 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.870
 nothing with that are all the 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.240
 weapon categories 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.530
 let's say that covered well thanks 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.120
 the video vote it and see you next 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.120
 a single all and goodbye
