on<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.329> hard<00:00:51.629> drive<00:00:51.719> right<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.579> this

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
on this hard drive right here this

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
on this hard drive right here this
camera<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.149> i'm<00:00:54.239> using<00:00:54.270> right<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.649> flip

camera that i'm using right now the flip

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.729 
camera that i'm using right now the flip
cam<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:56.489> i<00:00:56.520> used<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.719> video<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.500> now<00:00:58.680> the

cam is what i used to video it now the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.459 
cam is what i used to video it now the
reason<00:00:59.100> why<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.579> decided<00:00:59.960> not<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> actually

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
reason why we decided not to actually

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.619 
reason why we decided not to actually
upload<00:01:01.829> video<00:01:02.309> along<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> way<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> trips

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
upload video along the way on the trips

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.270 
upload video along the way on the trips
because<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.989> had<00:01:04.170> limited<00:01:04.619> internet<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.129> only

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
because we had limited internet we only

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.789 
because we had limited internet we only
have<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.729> those<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:06.140> dongle<00:01:07.140> type

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
have one of those little dongle type

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.620 
have one of those little dongle type
things<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.729> all<00:01:08.939> three<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.330> us<00:01:09.479> were

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
things we're all three of us were

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.990 
things we're all three of us were
actually<00:01:09.900> sharing<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> internet<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.100> one

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
actually sharing the internet of one

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.600 
actually sharing the internet of one
else<00:01:12.150> was<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.659> too<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:13.530> box<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
else was a little too little box a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.499 
else was a little too little box a
little<00:01:14.729> 4g<00:01:15.659> box<00:01:15.960> Telstra<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.970> it<00:01:17.970> had<00:01:18.150> limited

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
little 4g box Telstra and it had limited

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.780 
little 4g box Telstra and it had limited
internet<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.860> maximum<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:20.640> could

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
internet on it and the maximum we could

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.210 
internet on it and the maximum we could
get<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.090> 25<00:01:21.509> deep<00:01:21.810> from<00:01:22.020> Telstra<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.070> we

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
get was 25 deep from Telstra so we

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.010 
get was 25 deep from Telstra so we
figured<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.700> kept<00:01:23.970> uploading<00:01:24.420> video<00:01:24.750> every

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
figured if we kept uploading video every

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.630 
figured if we kept uploading video every
day<00:01:25.200> would<00:01:25.409> quickly<00:01:25.650> burn<00:01:25.979> through<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
day would quickly burn through it and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.270 
day would quickly burn through it and
Chloe<00:01:27.420> our<00:01:28.290> daughter<00:01:28.590> who<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:28.829> traveling

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
Chloe our daughter who was traveling

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.069 
Chloe our daughter who was traveling
with<00:01:29.400> us<00:01:29.460> wouldn't<00:01:30.240> actually<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.600> any

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
with us wouldn't actually have any

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.200 
with us wouldn't actually have any
internet<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.490> able<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.909> her<00:01:33.060> schoolwork

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
internet to be able to do her schoolwork

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.569 
internet to be able to do her schoolwork
when<00:01:33.840> she<00:01:34.020> was<00:01:34.140> doing<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.530> school<00:01:34.710> away<00:01:35.130> from

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
when she was doing in school away from

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.179 
when she was doing in school away from
her<00:01:35.880> new<00:01:36.210> school<00:01:36.689> away<00:01:37.020> from<00:01:37.200> school<00:01:37.500> sort<00:01:38.130> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
her new school away from school sort of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.850 
her new school away from school sort of
thing<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.450> therefore<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:40.259> chose<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.740> just

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
thing and so therefore we chose to just

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.280 
thing and so therefore we chose to just
say<00:01:41.100> belong<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.549> hard<00:01:41.790> drive<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.750> that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
say belong on the hard drive so that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.289 
say belong on the hard drive so that
hard<00:01:44.040> drive<00:01:44.189> since<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.729> home<00:01:44.850> that's<00:01:45.030> also
