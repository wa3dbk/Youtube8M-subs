00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.919
 so the weather today is pretty non-flying 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.840
 so tell how to allocate bee 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.420
 sting 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.160
 what sting is located in the tummy here 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:21.480
 at the end of the tummy we see squeezed 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:29.519
 the site she just follows as follows 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:31.820
 tummy bumps the skin leaves 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.820
 jalla 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.940
 after the bee sting to dies and so here it is 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.100
 bit in order to remove the sting 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.100
 just need a fingernail 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:52.820
 tear it that way here it is 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:56.519
 left on the finger here it is a place of bite 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.489
 not flushed and swollen therefore than 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.400
 the faster you remove the sting the better that 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.850
 comes from lay not removed matter in 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.820
 tom that here these plying movements 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.340
 here it pulses 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.399
 end of complaints inject everything under the skin 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.979
 more poison and dosage accordingly 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.550
 increases so well what we see by 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.950
 after five minutes the place he blushed 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.289
 a little swollen if we remove the sting 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.979
 again just take and 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:43.200
 We rip off his fingernail so she stayed 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.380
 next to the bite the hole itself as 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.950
 Once around a small such 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.000
 blister principle nothing much 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.310
 swells if you have allergies or 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.280
 idiosyncrasy bites then 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.939
 of course the picture was a completely different bite 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.710
 the bees don't itch don't hurt just 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:12.890
 the tumor slowly subsides and everything passes 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.890
 Thank you all for your attention.
