better word long itself and it's
supposed<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.320> because<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.309> mean<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
supposed to be because I mean just the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.470 
supposed to be because I mean just the
overall<00:00:39.239> design<00:00:39.800> it's<00:00:40.800> supposed<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.480> long

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
what we're gonna do is I'm going to show

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.920 
what we're gonna do is I'm going to show
you<00:00:57.270> how<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.480> draw<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:59.250> character<00:01:00.090> holding<00:01:00.780> each

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
you how to draw a character holding each

you how to draw a character holding each
one<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.260> these<00:01:01.320> designs<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.690> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
one of these designs that we do so this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.590 
one of these designs that we do so this
will<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:05.489> top<00:01:05.700> portion<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
will be the top portion of one of the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
will be the top portion of one of the
hands<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.140> since<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.560> sword<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> meant<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
hands and since this sword is meant to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.780 
hands and since this sword is meant to
be<00:01:08.369> held<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.939> two<00:01:09.180> hands<00:01:09.680> immediately

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
be held with two hands immediately

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.370 
be held with two hands immediately
underneath<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.270> first<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.140> we're<00:01:13.320> gonna

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
underneath the first one we're gonna

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.370 
underneath the first one we're gonna
draw<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.030> thumb<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> set<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.990> fingers

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
draw a thumb and then a set of fingers

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.580 
draw a thumb and then a set of fingers
here<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.070> well<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> way<00:01:22.229> someone

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
here as well and then the way someone

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.840 
here as well and then the way someone
would<00:01:22.680> hold<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.280> sword<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.939> one

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
would hold up the sword like this one

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.560 
would hold up the sword like this one
would<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:27.110> it's<00:01:28.110> got<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> very<00:01:28.650> very<00:01:28.979> long<00:01:29.570> long

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
would be it's got a very very long long

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.890 
would be it's got a very very long long
long<00:01:31.020> long<00:01:31.290> long<00:01:31.350> long<00:01:31.680> handle<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.840> can

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
long long long long handle so you can

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.890 
long long long long handle so you can
get<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> good<00:01:34.409> good<00:01:34.920> grip<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:38.570> go<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.689> here

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
get a good good grip on it go in here

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.620 
get a good good grip on it go in here
and<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.079> draw<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.290> base<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.430> then

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
and you draw the base like that and then

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.170 
and you draw the base like that and then
working<00:01:42.630> our<00:01:42.720> way<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:46.939> handle<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
working our way up the handle here you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.429 
working our way up the handle here you
draw<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> little<00:01:48.630> bit<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.899> texture<00:01:49.229> there

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
draw a little bit of texture there

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.560 
draw a little bit of texture there
basically<00:01:49.950> since<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.549> your<00:01:50.820> sword<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.420> can

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
basically since it is your sword you can

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.399 
basically since it is your sword you can
pretty<00:01:51.750> much<00:01:52.100> do<00:01:53.329> whatever<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.960> with

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
pretty much do whatever you like with

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.950 
pretty much do whatever you like with
the<00:01:55.759> handle<00:01:56.759> design<00:01:57.740> don't<00:01:58.740> feel<00:01:58.979> limited

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
the handle design don't feel limited

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.209 
the handle design don't feel limited
basically<00:02:00.960> use<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.320> imagination<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
basically use your imagination just the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.530 
basically use your imagination just the
one<00:02:02.340> thing<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.579> want<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> keep<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.030> mind<00:02:03.270> is

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
one thing you want to keep in mind is

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.930 
one thing you want to keep in mind is
the<00:02:03.719> handle<00:02:04.079> has<00:02:04.170> got<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.590> very<00:02:04.950> very<00:02:05.250> long

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.059 

you're<00:02:08.940> gonna<00:02:09.149> make<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.660> very<00:02:09.959> clear

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
you're gonna make that very clear

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.330 
you're gonna make that very clear
it<00:02:12.819> is<00:02:12.969> a<00:02:12.999> long<00:02:13.299> sword<00:02:13.659> and<00:02:14.290> has<00:02:14.469> a<00:02:14.620> name<00:02:14.950> for<00:02:15.280> a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
it is a long sword and has a name for a

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.970 
it is a long sword and has a name for a
reason<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:16.209> blade<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.139> handle<00:02:17.170> both

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
reason the blade and the handle both

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.619 
reason the blade and the handle both
quite<00:02:18.310> long<00:02:19.950> at<00:02:20.950> as<00:02:21.129> much<00:02:21.280> detail<00:02:21.730> as<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:22.060> like

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.229 

then<00:02:25.629> what<00:02:25.930> we'll<00:02:26.079> do<00:02:26.700> once<00:02:27.700> we<00:02:27.849> kind<00:02:27.969> of<00:02:28.060> have

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
then what we'll do once we kind of have

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.459 
then what we'll do once we kind of have
the<00:02:28.359> handle<00:02:28.750> down<00:02:30.299> well<00:02:31.299> come<00:02:31.810> out<00:02:31.840> here<00:02:32.290> and

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
the handle down well come out here and

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.369 
the handle down well come out here and
we'll<00:02:32.590> draw<00:02:32.859> the<00:02:32.889> blade<00:02:33.900> now<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.049> blade

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
we'll draw the blade now the blade

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.110 
we'll draw the blade now the blade
doesn't<00:02:35.680> necessarily<00:02:36.069> have<00:02:36.189> to<00:02:36.280> be<00:02:36.400> very<00:02:36.670> wide

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
doesn't necessarily have to be very wide

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.449 
doesn't necessarily have to be very wide
and<00:02:38.019> learning<00:02:38.590> how<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.680> draw<00:02:38.889> swords<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.430> a

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
and learning how to draw swords is a

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.920 
and learning how to draw swords is a
great<00:02:39.700> way<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:39.879> learn<00:02:40.060> how<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.269> draw<00:02:40.599> straight

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
great way to learn how to draw straight

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.479 
great way to learn how to draw straight
lines<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.560> one<00:02:41.650> way<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.829> do<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.159> is<00:02:42.280> kind<00:02:42.459> of

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
lines and one way to do that is kind of

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.909 
lines and one way to do that is kind of
keep<00:02:42.669> your<00:02:42.819> eyes<00:02:42.969> on<00:02:42.999> where<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:43.419> want<00:02:43.569> the

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:43.919 
keep your eyes on where you want the

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.920 
keep your eyes on where you want the
line<00:02:44.919> to<00:02:45.159> end<00:02:45.310> up<00:02:45.639> no<00:02:46.090> it's<00:02:46.389> a<00:02:46.450> trick<00:02:46.629> you<00:02:46.780> all

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
line to end up no it's a trick you all

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.409 
line to end up no it's a trick you all
have<00:02:47.079> heard<00:02:47.549> growing<00:02:48.549> up<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:49.299> draw<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:49.689> point

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:03:00.780 

like<00:02:55.419> so<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.980> one<00:02:59.980> way<00:03:00.159> when<00:03:00.489> you're<00:03:00.609> drawing

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
like so and one way when you're drawing

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.939 
like so and one way when you're drawing
a<00:03:01.000> sword<00:03:01.299> if<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.199> want<00:03:02.439> to<00:03:02.530> draw<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.709> lot<00:03:02.859> of

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:02.949 
a sword if you want to draw a lot of

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.649 
a sword if you want to draw a lot of
detail<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.699> they<00:03:03.849> really<00:03:04.150> make<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.419> sword

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
detail and they really make the sword

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.899 
detail and they really make the sword
kind<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:04.989> stand<00:03:05.260> out<00:03:05.439> one<00:03:06.189> way<00:03:06.340> good<00:03:06.549> way<00:03:06.669> to<00:03:06.730> do

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
kind of stand out one way good way to do

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.000 
kind of stand out one way good way to do
that<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.180> show<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.169> width<00:03:08.379> and<00:03:08.590> depth<00:03:08.829> of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
that to show the the width and depth of

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.709 
that to show the the width and depth of
the<00:03:09.069> blade<00:03:09.219> itself<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.000> since<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.329> blade<00:03:10.599> is

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
the blade itself and since this blade is

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.659 
the blade itself and since this blade is
not<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:11.439> is<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.590> flat<00:03:11.919> blade<00:03:12.219> but<00:03:12.400> it's<00:03:12.519> not

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
not it is a flat blade but it's not

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.670 
not it is a flat blade but it's not
completely<00:03:13.269> flat<00:03:13.540> one<00:03:13.870> way<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.019> do<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.469> to

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
completely flat one way to do that to

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.599 
completely flat one way to do that to
give<00:03:14.859> it<00:03:14.949> a<00:03:14.980> little<00:03:15.040> bit<00:03:15.219> of<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.400> third

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
give it a little bit of a third

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.030 
give it a little bit of a third
dimension<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:16.389> to<00:03:17.139> draw<00:03:17.379> a<00:03:17.409> line<00:03:17.500> just<00:03:17.889> right

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
dimension is to draw a line just right

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.199 
dimension is to draw a line just right
up<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.220> middle<00:03:18.519> like<00:03:18.549> this<00:03:18.909> so<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.180> can

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
up the middle like this so you can

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.449 
up the middle like this so you can
clearly<00:03:19.689> see<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.840> blade<00:03:23.229> and<00:03:23.739> its<00:03:24.189> thickness

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
clearly see the blade and its thickness

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.550 
clearly see the blade and its thickness
and<00:03:24.939> how<00:03:25.180> just<00:03:25.389> how<00:03:25.449> generally<00:03:26.019> how<00:03:26.109> big<00:03:26.349> it<00:03:26.470> is

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
and how just how generally how big it is

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.899 
and how just how generally how big it is
in<00:03:27.459> relation<00:03:27.729> to<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.629> hands<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.790> we've

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
in relation to the hands that we've

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:38.140 
in relation to the hands that we've
drawn<00:03:31.150> right<00:03:31.299> here

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.449 

that's<00:03:39.150> how<00:03:39.269> someone<00:03:39.629> might<00:03:39.659> hold<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.459> so

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
that's how someone might hold it so

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.250 
that's how someone might hold it so
there<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:41.760> go<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:41.970> have<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.599> longsword<00:03:43.140> and

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
there you go you have the longsword and

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.680 
there you go you have the longsword and
this<00:03:43.409> one<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.980> know<00:03:44.010> your<00:03:44.280> standard

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
this one is you know your standard

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.210 
this one is you know your standard
knight-in-shining-armor<00:03:46.099> charging<00:03:47.099> you

Knight type sword it's very big and

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.759 
Knight type sword it's very big and
heavy<00:03:50.940> though<00:03:51.330> so<00:03:51.659> whenever<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.500> draw<00:03:52.709> it

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
heavy though so whenever you draw it

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.539 
heavy though so whenever you draw it
make<00:03:53.010> sure<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:54.739> make<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.129> characters

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
make sure you make it so the characters

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.979 
make sure you make it so the characters
holding<00:03:56.879> out<00:03:56.970> with<00:03:57.090> both<00:03:57.239> hands<00:03:57.510> otherwise<00:03:57.810> it

holding out with both hands otherwise it

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.690 
holding out with both hands otherwise it
just<00:03:58.019> won't<00:03:58.170> be<00:03:58.379> believable<00:03:58.890> this<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.400> your

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
just won't be believable this is your

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.490 
just won't be believable this is your
Excalibur<00:04:00.660> or<00:04:01.430> blade<00:04:02.430> like<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:03.000> so<00:04:03.629> now<00:04:04.410> if

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
Excalibur or blade like that so now if

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
you got that one down and you got like

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.180 
you got that one down and you got like
your<00:04:06.150> design<00:04:06.450> let's<00:04:07.170> move<00:04:07.440> on<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.769> another

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190
