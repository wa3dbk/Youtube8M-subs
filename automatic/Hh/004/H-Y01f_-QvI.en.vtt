either<00:01:18.549> use<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.880> battery<00:01:19.659> or<00:01:20.170> a<00:01:20.200> little<00:01:20.619> USB

either use the battery or a little USB

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.450 
either use the battery or a little USB
cable<00:01:21.549> that<00:01:21.580> comes<00:01:22.270> with<00:01:22.540> it<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:23.190> it's<00:01:24.190> neat

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
cable that comes with it and it's neat

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.830 
cable that comes with it and it's neat
that<00:01:24.490> they<00:01:24.700> provided<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.390> thought<00:01:25.630> it<00:01:25.750> was

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
that they provided that I thought it was

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.960 
that they provided that I thought it was
kind<00:01:26.049> of<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.229> nice<00:01:26.770> thing<00:01:26.799> my<00:01:27.520> opinion<00:01:27.729> is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
kind of a nice thing my opinion is

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.310 
kind of a nice thing my opinion is
should<00:01:28.090> be<00:01:28.149> standard<00:01:28.479> issue<00:01:28.630> anyway<00:01:29.110> though

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
should be standard issue anyway though

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.260 
should be standard issue anyway though
because<00:01:29.550> sometimes<00:01:30.550> you<00:01:30.670> just<00:01:30.759> don't<00:01:30.880> have

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
because sometimes you just don't have

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.669 
because sometimes you just don't have
that<00:01:31.479> many<00:01:31.630> wires<00:01:31.929> we<00:01:32.080> don't<00:01:32.289> even<00:01:32.470> want<00:01:32.649> to

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
that many wires we don't even want to

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:33.930 
that many wires we don't even want to
have<00:01:32.830> him<00:01:32.950> lying<00:01:33.159> around<00:01:33.369> it<00:01:33.670> just<00:01:33.820> would<00:01:33.909> be

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
have him lying around it just would be

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.120 
have him lying around it just would be
portable<00:01:34.330> after<00:01:34.630> all<00:01:34.720> yeah<00:01:35.140> yeah<00:01:35.649> I<00:01:35.950> found

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
very impressed by that it does slide

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.130 
very impressed by that it does slide
around<00:02:06.939> a<00:02:07.060> lot<00:02:07.240> honestly<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.810> something

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
around a lot honestly and something

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.479 
around a lot honestly and something
against<00:02:08.320> things<00:02:08.530> ended<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.070> storing<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
against things ended the storing the

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.150 
against things ended the storing the
sound<00:02:09.759> significantly<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:10.810> honestly<00:02:11.739> that

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
sound significantly and honestly that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.610 
sound significantly and honestly that
that<00:02:12.730> cable<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.239> way<00:02:13.570> too<00:02:13.630> long<00:02:14.019> for<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.500> you

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that cable is way too long for it you

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.050 
that cable is way too long for it you
actually<00:02:14.769> here<00:02:15.160> for<00:02:15.190> you'd<00:02:15.640> be<00:02:15.730> better<00:02:15.970> off

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
actually here for you'd be better off

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.289 
actually here for you'd be better off
extending<00:02:17.049> both<00:02:17.680> sides<00:02:18.100> of<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.579> I<00:02:18.700> mean<00:02:18.850> look

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
extending both sides of it I mean look

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.420 
extending both sides of it I mean look
how<00:02:19.450> far<00:02:19.750> that's<00:02:19.989> extending<00:02:20.590> yeah<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.160> mean

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
how far that's extending yeah I mean

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.940 
how far that's extending yeah I mean
check<00:02:22.209> out<00:02:22.390> it's<00:02:22.750> gonna<00:02:23.049> be<00:02:23.140> close<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
check out it's gonna be close to the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.800 
check out it's gonna be close to the
ipad<00:02:24.400> there<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.730> mean<00:02:24.940> there's<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.209> no<00:02:25.600> way

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
ipad there I mean there's just no way

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.420 
ipad there I mean there's just no way
even<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.200> way<00:02:26.320> you're<00:02:26.470> supposed<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.829> read<00:02:27.130> or

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
even the way you're supposed to read or

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.099 
even the way you're supposed to read or
why<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.180> listen<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.600> your<00:02:28.720> music<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.049> you

why you listen to your music and you
have<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.290> thing<00:02:29.500> dangle<00:02:30.010> there<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.459> mean<00:02:30.760> that

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
have this thing dangle there I mean that

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.539 
have this thing dangle there I mean that
makes<00:02:31.000> no<00:02:31.180> sense<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.540> me<00:02:31.630> yeah<00:02:32.620> honestly

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
makes no sense to me yeah honestly

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.699 
makes no sense to me yeah honestly
they'd<00:02:33.940> be<00:02:34.000> better<00:02:34.239> off<00:02:34.470> shortening<00:02:35.470> the

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
they'd be better off shortening the

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.650 
they'd be better off shortening the
speaker<00:02:36.010> side<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.820> extending<00:02:37.540> the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
speaker side and extending the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.810 
speaker side and extending the
connection<00:02:38.079> side<00:02:38.290> yeah<00:02:38.829> well<00:02:39.280> whatever<00:02:39.519> you

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
connection side yeah well whatever you

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.099 
connection side yeah well whatever you
gotta<00:02:39.940> do<00:02:40.090> they<00:02:40.359> definitely<00:02:40.660> have<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.019> do

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
gotta do they definitely have to do

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.250 
gotta do they definitely have to do
something<00:02:41.440> because<00:02:41.769> I<00:02:42.430> don't<00:02:43.180> think<00:02:43.269> this<00:02:44.200> is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
something because I don't think this is

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.780 
something because I don't think this is
going<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:44.709> working<00:02:44.890> like<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.609> those

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
going to be working like that and those

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.640 
going to be working like that and those
yeah<00:02:46.480> there<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.780> go<00:02:46.840> that's<00:02:47.320> true<00:02:47.470> if<00:02:47.590> you

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
yeah there you go that's true if you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.410 
yeah there you go that's true if you
don't<00:02:47.859> really<00:02:48.190> stick<00:02:48.579> on<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.820> like<00:02:49.090> put<00:02:49.269> some

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
don't really stick on it like put some

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.449 
don't really stick on it like put some
saliva<00:02:49.720> which<00:02:50.019> is<00:02:50.170> kind<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.380> disgusting<00:02:50.620> and

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
saliva which is kind of disgusting and

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.460 
saliva which is kind of disgusting and
then<00:02:51.790> stick<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.209> on<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.450> box<00:02:52.720> or<00:02:52.930> something<00:02:52.959> I

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
then stick it on a box or something I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.319 
then stick it on a box or something I
mean<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.010> vibration<00:02:54.519> makes<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.120> move

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
mean the vibration makes it to move

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.810 
mean the vibration makes it to move
around<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.900> crazy<00:02:56.109> and<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:57.100> does<00:02:57.519> move

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
around like crazy and it does move

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.150 
around like crazy and it does move
really<00:02:58.239> fast<00:02:58.269> I<00:02:58.870> also<00:02:59.470> he<00:02:59.620> also<00:02:59.799> didn't<00:03:00.100> like

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
really fast I also he also didn't like

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.800 
really fast I also he also didn't like
the<00:03:00.340> fact<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.790> had<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.299> stick<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.780> to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
the fact that you had to stick it to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.000 
the fact that you had to stick it to
something<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.500> get<00:03:02.590> some<00:03:02.829> really<00:03:03.190> good<00:03:03.519> sound

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
something to get some really good sound

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.640 
something to get some really good sound
and<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.370> use<00:03:04.580> good<00:03:05.000> here<00:03:05.269> loosely<00:03:05.750> because<00:03:05.930> you

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
and I use good here loosely because you

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.009 
and I use good here loosely because you
move<00:03:06.920> this<00:03:07.069> thing<00:03:07.280> up<00:03:07.430> even<00:03:07.730> half<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.299> speed<00:03:08.780> I

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
move this thing up even half the speed I

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.410 
move this thing up even half the speed I
mean<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.439> half<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.310> speaker<00:03:10.970> volume<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.390> can

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
mean the half the speaker volume you can

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.509 
mean the half the speaker volume you can
on<00:03:11.870> your<00:03:12.019> iPad<00:03:12.379> for<00:03:12.590> example<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.159> it's

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
on your iPad for example and it's

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.860 
on your iPad for example and it's
already<00:03:13.849> started<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.209> start<00:03:14.569> something

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
already started to start something

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.600 
already started to start something
fierce<00:03:15.319> yeah<00:03:15.739> that's<00:03:16.010> true<00:03:16.159> i've<00:03:16.310> found<00:03:16.519> that

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
fierce yeah that's true i've found that

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.229 
fierce yeah that's true i've found that
the<00:03:17.060> ipad<00:03:17.209> sound<00:03:17.810> was<00:03:18.110> just<00:03:18.439> as<00:03:18.650> loud<00:03:19.129> it<00:03:19.909> just

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
the ipad sound was just as loud it just

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.420 
the ipad sound was just as loud it just
didn't<00:03:20.450> have<00:03:20.569> as<00:03:20.720> much<00:03:20.750> bass<00:03:21.409> because<00:03:22.010> of<00:03:22.280> the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
didn't have as much bass because of the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.210 
didn't have as much bass because of the
size<00:03:22.819> of<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.329> container<00:03:23.959> used<00:03:24.739> for<00:03:24.920> example

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
size of the container used for example

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.530 
size of the container used for example
in<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:25.370> case<00:03:25.430> we're<00:03:25.730> using<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.060> table<00:03:26.390> and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
in this case we're using the table and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.600 
in this case we're using the table and
of<00:03:27.140> course<00:03:27.379> it'll<00:03:27.560> good<00:03:27.709> produce<00:03:27.860> a<00:03:28.190> large

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
of course it'll good produce a large

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.880 
of course it'll good produce a large
vibe<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.480> know<00:03:29.510> vibration<00:03:30.109> large<00:03:30.319> bass<00:03:30.620> down

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
vibe you know vibration large bass down

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.220 
vibe you know vibration large bass down
now<00:03:31.609> I<00:03:31.670> thought<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.180> putting<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.599> wire<00:03:32.870> back

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
now I thought that putting the wire back

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.289 
now I thought that putting the wire back
in<00:03:33.500> this<00:03:34.159> little<00:03:34.489> weekly<00:03:34.790> thing<00:03:34.939> that<00:03:35.090> we<00:03:35.180> have

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
in this little weekly thing that we have

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.789 
in this little weekly thing that we have
to<00:03:35.420> do<00:03:35.510> their<00:03:35.780> thing<00:03:36.170> seems<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.530> take<00:03:36.620> forever

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
to do their thing seems to take forever

giving it a two out of five I find it's

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.099 
giving it a two out of five I find it's
functional<00:04:19.760> but<00:04:20.060> I've<00:04:20.150> limited<00:04:20.570> practical
