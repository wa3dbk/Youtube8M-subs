00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 here we will take breaks and look what 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.730
 cuddly is an invitation I 'm making 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.509
 This little one here we are going to do 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.940
 wine as it works 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.080
 the head looks cool and the invitation is 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.270
 here inside 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.609
 Actually, this one is just a show. 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.170
 this invitation inside is to be 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.710
 done in the graph 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.470
 It's quite easy to make sells very well. 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.550
 out that the person is the sensation of 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.920
 right moment 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.850
 so come on, how are we going to do it? 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.030
 this template 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.460
 I already put it on facebook where it's already 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 there only so let me explain to 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.210
 you are a scanner is not compatible with 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.070
 my computer 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.530
 so I can not do it right 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.570
 to route a sulphite sheet and place 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.050
 for you to have original size 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.329
 the mold but as I do not have what 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.620
 I'm going to tell you to grab a 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.690
 image of the peta on the internet those of 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.210
 someone who colors is the best 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.700
 There you will copy the drawing of the kite. 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.000
 that you took from the internet in size 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.000
 that you want to expand and then yes 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.009
 the mold of the internet not with mine 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.380
 able to do with my okay if 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.080
 can not do with an internet cast 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.780
 You're going to dismantle little arms and 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.970
 to strip the strip off the shoe 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.579
 Body and head okay. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.990
 and we'll do the parts now 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.420
 everything without stop what we are going to do 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.740
 the little body is actually the body of the peta 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.790
 s of the viola 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.210
 I made two equal parts sÃ´nia 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.420
 only the top one I took a little bit 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.759
 which is where it will fit head hollow hour 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.920
 that people with a glass of wine have to 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.140
 fit so that the bodice and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.240
 hence the head 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.009
 we will do twice as well the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.470
 will stay above and below and in the 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.580
 Underneath we'll do 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.850
 a rectangle the size of the little dress 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.100
 one centimeter less because he 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.300
 will fit in and here we go 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.500
 then put the foot not to 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.560
 find it 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.110
 so I make my head and raise one 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:32.060
 rectangle of this head here 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:36.500
 The little hand is two lines in a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:40.100
 that the shoe is also two or 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.950
 but that's all I did here that I 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.209
 I tried the contour of the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:50.750
 The little face of the light had a 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.160
 I muzzle my mouth with my pen and 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.520
 the moving eyes 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.290
 can be people the little eye I designed 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.260
 I think it is even more so cute 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.420
 us, but if you have too much 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.100
 this idea that I made many stones 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:10.040
 the agreement involves more charming of the property 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.769
 same thing in the kitchen 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.000
 We're going to start rolling, I'll go and get it. 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:21.320
 this part of the bottom that have no clipping 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.560
 and I'll glue one of the little hands and the two 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.560
 legs 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.920
 So we'll do it like this. 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.739
 hand in the corner and both 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.690
 legs like she was walking 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.690
 So you 're walking here. 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:49.320
 in exchange we made a mistake that I had 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.250
 managed to take what I'm doing the 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:59.040
 other side penalty and here 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:07.440
 It's on this side of my time to leave. 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:10.590
 still here where we're going to do us 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.280
 Let's glue the top of the dress 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.770
 We'll stick it all the way around. 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.440
 neck that is the opening that left here 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.440
 so let's go with a snapshot 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:32.730
 I'll put glue on my leg and 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:40.550
 I'll spend as you teach from Brazil until 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:40.550
 exact dog 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.199
 and now that the two shoes come back 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:05.050
 selling the wallet has to be different 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:05.050
 here and here to attack 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:17.880
 this other one is so no one here or for 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:26.250
 up and if and now the face 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:33.930
 already the whole bag turns and will fit 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:36.720
 Come in and here's how I said the other 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.730
 I put a little piece of white on it 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.030
 For you, victory, you know that here you will see. 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.220
 the invitation but does not need this part 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.950
 here is done in the graph or on the computer 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:54.260
 for those who make personalized and here the 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:54.260
 people open on dog invitation 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:05.710
 It's annoying to just put it first and then 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.419
 he gets a way and that's cool 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:12.960
 look I put in too much for little leg 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.960
 Up is invitation does not arrive until the end 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:24.099
 Hey guys, look how cool, then you pulled 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.770
 It came out with some good wine, that's it. 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:28.449
 I hope you liked it and soon 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.020
 There's another video there for you. 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:33.180
 good 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.180
 the two seasons kiss, bye, people 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.180
 bye
