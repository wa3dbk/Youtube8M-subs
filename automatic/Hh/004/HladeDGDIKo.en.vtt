00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.100
 it seems that I am doing the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.420
 purchase of things in things that arrive a 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.860
 point since the cashier did not even 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.940
 ask what you want bag because 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.620

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.240
 I stay with my cart and that they do not 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.220
 ask you if you want to pulsate hurts 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.660
 hurts a lot but as I was saying the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.370
 Christmas dinner for a posture dinner 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.400
 for example the nougat trays 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.770
 mantecado and bonbon that's an art that's 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.480
 the art of posture all the trays 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.340
 has the same structure goes as per 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.290
 bed in the bed below are the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.180
 nastiest nougat the worst ones I'm 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.890
 like hard almond this three 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.570
 colors that tells me to eat the typical 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.160
 nougat with leftovers from last year for 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.830
 that are put in the layer below for 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.930
 bulge use to make consistency the 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.340
 tray in plan there are chocolates for all 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.780
 and nougats then above you're going 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.490
 putting the polvorones and then the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.310
 ferrero rocher above all they are 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.680
 as 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.210
 the luxury the luxury of the chocolates is like 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.829
 all chocolate dreams of being a ferrero 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.599
 rocher that seems to be placed 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.880
 volley but not all of that has a study 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.800
 yes before the Ferrers is that 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.720
 are in the layers above disappear 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.310
 Two days after New Year's Eve, only 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.230
 already of the bad ones in plan to those of the fund 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.000
 I'm tired of digging all 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.620
 the New Year's trays already in that 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.480
 date if I find something good and only 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.040
 they are the bad turrones bad and I 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.150
 then but he kept saying 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.950
 that the Christmas dinner posture 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.080
 totally dinner dishes by 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.940
 example never ask what there is to 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.739
 dine if you do not want to give her pleasure 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.480
 huge to the person who answers you 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.940
 my mother and another already asked and what not 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.030
 See mom there is for dinner what there is 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.950
 to eat as a starter we have to 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.739
 Leaves of fresh green and white grass at 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.840
 air in the shape of a mountain goat is 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.910
 lost in the forest with a sweet taste 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.860
 to the honey of the leaves collected in the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.299
 wild flowers 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.130
 that's then a cheese salad and 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.810
 honey of what tradition as well as that 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.760
 it seems it's a high stamping dish that 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.739
 Masterchef kitchen is and is not no 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.209
 that to one in room that is very good the 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.099
 cheese salad and honey but that now 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.630
 posture dinner the postureure cheeses 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.960
 because what we say is a salad 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.750
 Do not make dinner 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.550
 the food we lack the opposite there 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.470
 There is food left but it is not that 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.000
 plan then the night I eat it no no 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.740
 It's enough for three days that you have food 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.240
 from poinsettia for three days on my 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.400
 mother who does not try to hide it but 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.090
 do not strain the fourth day you realize 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.590
 mom that to eat payment with potatoes 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.720
 that to eat turkey salad 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.480
 and mom that to eat croquettes of all 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.660
 mom fell to eat turkey soup mom 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.460
 because we eat so much turkey lately not 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.060
 will be the works of poinsettia 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.530
 no no no no but look that's fine 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.180
 because we must not throw food then 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.220
 I do not know about you but my mother always 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.710
 has the habit of putting carol 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.870
 that day someone finds meaning in 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.430
 the carols, that is, I am outside coaÃ±a 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.930
 I really say it myself and a question that 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.670
 I get inside because it's that as a child 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.200
 I would analyze it and never 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.790
 It made sense I'm going to put some 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.140
 example for me to see it is lame the 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.660
 computer because it 's trotted chrysler already 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.480
 example number one but look how they drink 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.370
 the fish in the river but let's see that 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.230
 there must be a pair on the river in addition to 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.140
 it tells you look like they drink they're going to look 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.190
 fish as well as a fish that 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.560
 fish see anything 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:24.170
 another example example number 2 peer to 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.610
 the sale and we look at the bell 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.560
 let's leave it because it does not have any 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.120
 meaning but then it looks out of the 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.800
 window to see a child in the crib I would 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.530
 I look out the window and I have a clearing 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.090
 uses a single step and vacuum fine one 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.010
 child in a crib 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.210
 and I get scared, I say, the mother is not 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.460
 abandons the child in the middle of the wasteland 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.560
 that we do not take away I do not know about you 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.240
 would feel and look out the windows of 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.940
 your house and a child in a crib 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.500
 and tucked because I would then stay a 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.650
 cradle in the middle of the street and with a child 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.750
 inside example number three towards mba 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.790

 I do not know what the patch will be but the 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.620
 package has done halfway or is 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.000
 I put on a patch, I took it off and

 I leave my twitter if you want to follow me 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.970
 and nothing but happy Christmas to people in 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.200
 special to my killers that I love them with 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.200
 madness and a kiss for all
