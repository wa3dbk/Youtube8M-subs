 I grow up and grow up . 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.180
 1 vote, but it's good to have diabetes in the table. 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.650
 Oh 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.400
 However, in the first two, this diabetes is not referred to as diabetes, 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.620
 Give it to me. 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.200
 Out of three small wake that appeal calcined calcined three weeks to hand over

 Small and medium-sized, we now have a desire to continue eating even if we eat a lot of food . 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.680
 Going is now small 4 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:55.570
 Calcination is a small amount. 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:59.710
 Because the symptoms are different from the three kinds of way, I'm just a pig potatoes 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:03.460
 Above and that there is a cow of the action that's why I'm down a column of failure 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.390
 People eat, eat and keep eating. 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.590
 Pork potatoes can really be said to be a good pro with diabetes 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.160
 If you like it, think about it really good 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.260
 Ah 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:22.780

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:25.000
 You think it's insulin. Yes, I have 4. 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:29.440
 That'll be a help to absorb sugar slowly 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.090
 4 When you use it, it's really natural insulin. 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:39.100
 These thoughts have ttokgatdago day just so my house is 2:00 Have these people 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:45.940
 Well, a word of caution, a pork potato is a carbohydrate in some way. 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:49.750
 If you like each other, ah doeseo blood sugar check is coming up so we recommend not less countries are much 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:55.750

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:59.770
 English inside, ah, ah, I should be, I feel like this name is always underground 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:03.280

 I was looking for food. 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:19.660
 It's funny pig with potatoes, so has the need to go develop this dish 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:25.930
 Also I know the heat is developed so little to be surprised by the speed of the national cooking contest 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:27.160
 The fact that there are no more is that if you have a lot of these two, you starve so much. 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.660
 Why not 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:36.930
 It's hard to even get caught, but it does not make sense to really heat up with it. 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:39.580
 I'm going to talk about that a little bit better doeseo For example, to write another b of bittersweet memories 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:43.870

 When I made soup like this, 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:07:02.740
 While water quality gyesyeotdeon example, when the Fever doing so now I say tk 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.850
 In Japan, there is a heat that divides 9 tons of cold soup in Japan 4 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:08.140
 Yes. 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:13.210
 There potatoes wo also talk a lot in changing the pork potatoes 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:17.650
 41 Further to ask the Japanese to have a different title for powder 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:22.680

 When I go into the puddle , why do I like it? There 's milk in it . 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:42.980
 It is good because the site control lowers our index 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:48.350
 If you eat the protein all together, Kang Ji-su will go down . 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:51.700
 Next, the nutrients become richer, and you need more to replace the sugar or prevent diabetes. 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.700
 Going Yes 

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.720
