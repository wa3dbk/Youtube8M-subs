race ya know to that to bind them we're

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.319 
race ya know to that to bind them we're
adding<00:00:49.800> an<00:00:49.920> egg<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.399> about<00:00:50.670> four

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
tablespoonfuls of water Ayden but the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.950 
tablespoonfuls of water Ayden but the
amount<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> water<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.120> use<00:00:54.270> really<00:00:54.480> depends

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
amount of water you use really depends

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.160 
amount of water you use really depends
on<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.590> how<00:00:56.250> soft<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.789> marge<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.239> okay<00:00:57.960> so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
on and how soft the marge is okay so

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.740 
on and how soft the marge is okay so
that's<00:00:58.379> soft<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.850> particularly<00:01:00.180> soft<00:01:00.539> today

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
that's soft it's particularly soft today

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.729 
that's soft it's particularly soft today
yes<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.440> gradually<00:01:02.190> add<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.489> egg<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
yes so we just gradually add the egg and

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.440 
yes so we just gradually add the egg and
we've<00:01:04.739> combined<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> ingredients<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
we've combined the ingredients and that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.789 
we've combined the ingredients and that
shouldn't<00:01:06.720> take<00:01:06.780> long<00:01:06.930> at<00:01:07.439> all

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
shouldn't take long at all

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.080 
shouldn't take long at all
just<00:01:08.070> bring<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.340> together<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.640> form<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.060> dough

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
just bring it together to form a dough

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.660 
just bring it together to form a dough
and<00:01:09.740> as<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.860> say<00:01:11.070> depending<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and as I say depending on the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.620 
and as I say depending on the
temperature<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> butter

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
temperature of the butter

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
temperature of the butter
gradually<00:01:13.229> add<00:01:13.380> your<00:01:13.710> liquids<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.400> as

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
gradually add your liquids because as

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.179 
gradually add your liquids because as
you<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.090> we<00:01:15.570> didn't<00:01:15.840> use<00:01:15.990> all<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.920> us<00:01:17.009> at

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you see there we didn't use all of us at

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.649 
you see there we didn't use all of us at
all<00:01:17.369> because<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.729> butter<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.180> quite<00:01:18.390> soft

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
all because that butter is quite soft

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.780 
all because that butter is quite soft
but<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.530> can't<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.890> room<00:01:20.070> temperature<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
but if you can't at room temperature it

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.530 
but if you can't at room temperature it
will<00:01:21.240> come<00:01:21.720> together<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> egg<00:01:23.540> it's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
will come together with the egg it's

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.810 
will come together with the egg it's
pretty<00:01:24.720> hot<00:01:24.869> yeah<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.710> indeed<00:01:25.890> now<00:01:26.759> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
pretty hot yeah it is indeed now you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.490 
pretty hot yeah it is indeed now you
bring<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.150> dough<00:01:27.270> together<00:01:27.479> eighteen<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
bring the dough together eighteen and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.440 
bring the dough together eighteen and
you<00:01:28.560> turn<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> floured<00:01:29.850> board

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you turn it out on a floured board

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.210 
you turn it out on a floured board
that's<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.320> looks<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.619> now<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> could

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that's what it looks like now you could

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.429 
that's what it looks like now you could
make<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.729> advance<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.329> cover<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.079> put<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
make that in advance and cover it put it

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.749 
make that in advance and cover it put it
in<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> fridge<00:01:34.770> until<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.130> want<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.400> use<00:01:35.579> it
