were<00:03:21.970> guys<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.480> have<00:03:22.780> just<00:03:23.080> got<00:03:23.290> our<00:03:23.440> player<00:03:23.650> he

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
were guys I have just got our player he

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.950 
were guys I have just got our player he
is<00:03:23.890> called<00:03:24.190> Davis<00:03:24.700> he<00:03:25.420> has<00:03:25.450> got<00:03:25.660> some<00:03:25.810> pretty

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
is called Davis he has got some pretty

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.530 
is called Davis he has got some pretty
good<00:03:26.110> stats<00:03:26.470> for<00:03:26.740> a<00:03:26.800> silver<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.610> I<00:03:28.300> think

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
good stats for a silver and I think

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.720 
good stats for a silver and I think
he'll<00:03:28.720> probably<00:03:28.990> be<00:03:29.920> pretty<00:03:30.310> good<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:30.670> think

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
he'll probably be pretty good I think

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.850 
he'll probably be pretty good I think
you'll<00:03:30.970> be<00:03:31.000> pretty<00:03:31.360> influential<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.650> team

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
you'll be pretty influential to the team

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.430 
you'll be pretty influential to the team
just<00:03:33.130> because<00:03:33.280> our<00:03:33.780> cm<00:03:34.780> Ling<00:03:35.020> God<00:03:35.230> didn't

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
just because our cm Ling God didn't

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.990 
just because our cm Ling God didn't
played<00:03:35.620> quite<00:03:35.830> well<00:03:35.890> what<00:03:36.220> then<00:03:36.610> play<00:03:36.790> well

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
played quite well what then play well

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.410 
played quite well what then play well
we're<00:03:37.150> taught<00:03:37.300> to<00:03:37.330> be<00:03:37.570> honest<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:40.150> I'm<00:03:40.270> gonna

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
we're taught to be honest so I'm gonna

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.140 
we're taught to be honest so I'm gonna
jump<00:03:40.660> into<00:03:40.900> another<00:03:41.020> game<00:03:41.470> now<00:03:42.390> but<00:03:43.390> yeah<00:03:45.150> see

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
jump into another game now but yeah see

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.600 
jump into another game now but yeah see
this<00:03:46.300> is<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.600> team<00:03:46.810> now<00:03:47.050> Davis<00:03:47.950> only<00:03:48.340> actually

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
this is the team now Davis only actually

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.490 
this is the team now Davis only actually
cost<00:03:48.790> us<00:03:48.910> about<00:03:49.000> 200<00:03:49.720> coins<00:03:49.840> but<00:03:50.050> i<00:03:50.110> think<00:03:50.350> i'm

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
cost us about 200 coins but i think i'm

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.770 
cost us about 200 coins but i think i'm
actually<00:03:50.830> going<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.280> do<00:03:51.550> just<00:03:52.360> change<00:03:52.600> water

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
actually going to do just change water

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.480 
actually going to do just change water
bronze<00:03:53.200> because<00:03:53.680> i<00:03:54.220> think<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:55.000> did<00:03:55.120> attract<00:03:55.540> a

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
bronze because i think it did attract a

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.250 
bronze because i think it did attract a
better<00:03:57.490> opponent<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.360> this<00:03:58.720> is<00:03:58.780> just<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:59.050> bit

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
better opponent and this is just a bit

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.110 
better opponent and this is just a bit
hard<00:03:59.770> for<00:03:59.860> me<00:04:00.070> to<00:04:00.220> play<00:04:00.370> against<00:04:00.640> silvers

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
hard for me to play against silvers

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.960 
hard for me to play against silvers
because<00:04:01.270> I<00:04:01.360> probably<00:04:01.590> more<00:04:02.590> likely<00:04:02.860> losing<00:04:03.640> so

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
because I probably more likely losing so

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.850 
because I probably more likely losing so
it's<00:04:04.150> going<00:04:04.270> to<00:04:04.330> quickly<00:04:04.540> do<00:04:05.020> back<00:04:05.320> there<00:04:05.620> a

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
it's going to quickly do back there a

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.300 
it's going to quickly do back there a
door<00:04:06.459> sill<00:04:06.730> at<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.810> Swap<00:04:08.440> sills<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:08.920> goals<00:04:09.160> of
