for<00:01:36.060> me<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.540> around<00:01:36.780> because<00:01:37.020> Simon<00:01:37.350> Callow

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

signed my painting two days before Katy

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.320 
signed my painting two days before Katy
did<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.920> my<00:01:41.040> best<00:01:41.280> guess<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.730> that<00:01:41.760> this<00:01:42.060> path

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
did so my best guess is that this path

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.920 
did so my best guess is that this path
will<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.570> Jenny<00:01:42.900> McCarthy's<00:01:43.380> entrance<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930
