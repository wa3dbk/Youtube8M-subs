00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.500
 quevedo should be seen at 1080 or what the new 

00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:06.990
 has a video more towards the day of 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.759
 today is a video do not see gameplays not from 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.070
 logroÃ±o tutorials nothing nothing 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.169
 absolutely nothing this this video is 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.560
 short and it's just for 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.990
 tell them the following how many of 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.090
 you have not asked or have you 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.520
 asked me or someone else 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.840
 that you can plant from your zombies how many 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.080
 of you names have not asked 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.360
 up to what level will you be able to get in 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.340
 this game is true because it is not something 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.840
 Well I told myself and I 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.680
 even when they asked me 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.710
 I have told you the truth is that I do not know 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.020
 I do not know I did not know it the truth 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.399
 so you guys look here 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 I'm in range 164 I had to see 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.440
 players who were already in the ranks 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.890
 of the 200 inclusive I think that out there 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.320
 gave one of 205 more though 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.340
 until today for me that was something 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 that I did not know and did not have 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.980
 at what level could I get there then I 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.530
 I bring you today the answer to 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.450
 That question is like this and it's not a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.880
 you have taken note of some side 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.510
 some twitter page of plants vs 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.479
 zombies and not the poison is something that 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.760
 I discovered for myself just because 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.100
 well it happened to me here inside the 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.770
 I play then well as you already 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.900
 they know boys the only way that I go 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.200
 raising the rank in the game is that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.770
 go completing the levels of the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.270
 characters true then here is in 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.700
 where it starts where I already knew what to do 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.860
 Well, when I was playing kids because 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.399
 when I was playing I realized 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.520
 this if they fix my soldier here already 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.380
 I have at level 30 and if you look what 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.259
 important is that it says that the level 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.450
 maximum in this character has been 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.119
 reached then there is the first 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.340
 great information not up to what level 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.720
 can carry a character is up to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.869
 level 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.960
 and then well I see the 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.750
 other characters at what level I had it 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.210
 Well, what I did is that it's just 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.310
 for example in this case the engineer what 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.460
 I've been in the carnivorous plant 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.670
 level 20 to reach level 30 are 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.430
 10 and so I went successively for each 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.950
 one of the characters fixing me how many 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.170
 levels I was missing to get to 30 and 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.600
 adding and subtracting you already know the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.940
 mathematics chinto the lakers not that 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.209
 I hope this time they will not fail me 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.860
 then that gives me that I can get to a 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:51.000
 maximum rank level within the game of 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:54.180
 233 235 approximately the exact sum 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.480
 It gives me 233 but let's give it one more 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.340
 less and the maximum range that I tell you 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.420
 what can you achieve within this game 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:07.920
 is 233 235 but good the video 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.660
 it's precisely about that and also 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.520
 I want you to interact 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.920
 with me and tell me if you have seen 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.010
 a player with a higher level a 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.680
 rank higher than 235 let's say it like that 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.480
 because very good today as well as 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.490
 I told them the only way to raise the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.370
 rank within the game is that your 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.140
 characters you upload it level if you no longer 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.750
 you can upload your level characters 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.750
 well, that can lead you to 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.180
 have a cap also in the ranges that 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.190
 you can upload within the game but as 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.780
 I tell you this information I do not have it 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.960
 confirmed is not something that can 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.360
 say that I am 100% sure and the truth 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.520
 is that you also want me 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.410
 help to see if they have already seen a 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.510
 player with a higher level not like 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.910
 want this ezekiel pending continue 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.280
 commenting because later I'm going to 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.370
 bring the video when I upload all my 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.250
 characters at level 230 to see if yes or 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.650
 if I can upload the rank range in 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.030
 this game does not and well these are 800 the 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.030
 say goodbye dad
