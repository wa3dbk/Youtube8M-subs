00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.309 
lasers in the game no we don't have
places<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.079> game

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.739 

no<00:02:29.950> well<00:02:30.370> they<00:02:30.909> know<00:02:30.969> to<00:02:31.150> actually<00:02:31.299> use<00:02:31.540> rifles

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:31.749 
no well they know to actually use rifles

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:33.509

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
of backup feeling it does feel like

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.640 
of backup feeling it does feel like
initially<00:03:01.150> at<00:03:01.419> level<00:03:01.659> 1<00:03:01.810> it's<00:03:02.019> 50<00:03:02.230> damage<00:03:02.379> or

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
initially at level 1 it's 50 damage or

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.170 
initially at level 1 it's 50 damage or
15<00:03:02.950> seconds<00:03:03.340> but<00:03:03.370> that<00:03:03.609> does<00:03:03.760> scale<00:03:04.030> with

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
15 seconds but that does scale with

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.569 
15 seconds but that does scale with
level<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.620> even<00:03:05.799> at<00:03:06.040> level<00:03:06.250> one<00:03:06.400> that's

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
level and even at level one that's

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:07.770 
level and even at level one that's
actually<00:03:06.879> pretty<00:03:07.000> good<00:03:07.239> so<00:03:07.480> that's<00:03:07.569> going<00:03:07.719> to

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
actually pretty good so that's going to

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.099 
actually pretty good so that's going to
be<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.900> really<00:03:08.139> useful<00:03:08.169> racial<00:03:08.829> yeah<00:03:10.109> actually
