00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
different things so for me of course my

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
different things so for me of course my
carbohydrates<00:01:41.460> need<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.030> remain<00:01:42.270> high<00:01:42.509> I'm

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
carbohydrates need to remain high I'm

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.870

very very carb sense that if I can get
flat<00:01:45.210> off<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:46.280> 160<00:01:47.280> grams<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.970> carbs<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:49.020> my

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
flat off of 160 grams of carbs so my

saw five weeks out my first training day
if<00:01:59.820> peak<00:02:00.000> week<00:02:00.259> my<00:02:01.259> carbs<00:02:01.619> were<00:02:01.740> actually

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
if peak week my carbs were actually

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.709 
if peak week my carbs were actually
pretty<00:02:02.159> high<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.610> was<00:02:02.850> slightly<00:02:03.090> spilt<00:02:03.570> over

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
pretty high I was slightly spilt over

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.179 
pretty high I was slightly spilt over
which<00:02:03.990> means<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.350> had<00:02:04.439> too<00:02:04.560> many<00:02:04.649> carbs<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.070> was<00:02:05.159> a

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
which means I had too many carbs I was a

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.670 
which means I had too many carbs I was a
little<00:02:05.340> bit<00:02:05.430> soft<00:02:05.640> looking<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.469> now<00:02:07.469> he's

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
little bit soft looking and now he's

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.010 
little bit soft looking and now he's
slowly<00:02:08.160> decreasing<00:02:08.849> my<00:02:08.940> carbs<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.450> until<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
slowly decreasing my carbs and until I

deflated well that's literally the same
principle<00:03:46.229> you<00:03:46.590> kind<00:03:46.889> of<00:03:46.979> do<00:03:47.069> become<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.340> little

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
principle you kind of do become a little

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.589 
principle you kind of do become a little
bit<00:03:47.579> deflated<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.150> want<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.359> keep<00:03:48.479> the

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
bit deflated so you want to keep the

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.960 
bit deflated so you want to keep the
muscles<00:03:48.930> alive<00:03:49.199> full<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.799> active<00:03:49.949> so<00:03:50.849> that's

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
muscles alive full and active so that's

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.059 
muscles alive full and active so that's
what<00:03:51.090> we're<00:03:51.209> doing<00:03:51.419> so<00:03:51.599> you<00:03:52.169> guys<00:03:52.560> saw<00:03:52.739> my<00:03:52.889> last

the first or last place now the thing is

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.500 
the first or last place now the thing is
if<00:06:28.860> it's<00:06:29.100> in<00:06:29.190> your<00:06:29.250> macros<00:06:29.640> clearly<00:06:30.120> works<00:06:30.330> I

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
if it's in your macros clearly works I

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.780 
if it's in your macros clearly works I
mean<00:06:30.540> I<00:06:30.720> use<00:06:30.900> it<00:06:31.050> all<00:06:31.170> the<00:06:31.200> time

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
but I want to stay extremely regimented

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.160 
but I want to stay extremely regimented
and<00:06:35.700> not<00:06:35.880> fall<00:06:36.060> off<00:06:36.090> track<00:06:36.450> at<00:06:36.660> all<00:06:36.690> for<00:06:37.020> peak

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170 
and not fall off track at all for peak

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.080 
and not fall off track at all for peak
week<00:06:37.380> because<00:06:37.710> peak<00:06:37.950> week<00:06:38.130> has<00:06:38.310> to<00:06:38.340> be<00:06:38.550> really

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
week because peak week has to be really

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.180 
week because peak week has to be really
precise<00:06:39.450> so<00:06:39.750> in<00:06:39.990> this<00:06:40.380> case<00:06:40.620> cow<00:06:40.860> hunt<00:06:41.130> just

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
precise so in this case cow hunt just

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.560 
precise so in this case cow hunt just
sets<00:06:41.490> me<00:06:41.610> up<00:06:41.670> with<00:06:41.820> a<00:06:41.910> set<00:06:42.090> meal<00:06:42.270> plan<00:06:42.540> that
