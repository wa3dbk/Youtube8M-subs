 future must tinker pretty apricot 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.670
 that we relaxed with hot water to 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.010
 heat a little bit to kill her a 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.960

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.010
 it's good because almonds can 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.540
 sweet pies it works the juice of the fruit 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.430

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.430
