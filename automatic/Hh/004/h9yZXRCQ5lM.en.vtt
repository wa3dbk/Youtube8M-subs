00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.040
 but when i want to tell you a little bit 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.200
 phone menu form 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.700
 searching his system wanted to say so 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.330
 operating system how they tried to imagine 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.849
 the answer is actually here 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.309
 these funds are spent 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.250
 garden 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.040
 so with such a prefix tach because 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.109
 that we do not indicate resistive screens 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.880
 that is, an obvious provocation related 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.939
 with particular economic strength 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.899
 oh so let's see how 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.960
 organized at base follow 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.220
 by the way quite nice let's 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.570
 let's start the beginning of the 40 main screen 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.190
 the main screen can be personalized 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.950
 how do you 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.350
 whatever 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.070
 In this case, the link bar is here. 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.590
 is actually you can do 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.960
 such a small Volodin changing village 40 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.680
 the usual 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.920
 plus other what looks like 500 thousand is possible 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.810
 social project concept 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.350
 on sales in the market 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.480
 screen settings choose at the top of us 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.670
 find plots 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.710
 and then we can appoint Cyprus 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.470
 some see and second budgets we actually 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.030
 extinguished well for example 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.120
 that's where the gun click 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.280
 there is a selected contact calendar 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.140
 in general, the percentage is all the same 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.300
 necessary dollars is convenient agrarian 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.600
 apartments music for example ladies experience 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.619
 here we can endure was recognized as 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.450
 calendar was best or notice 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.770
 any pressure attempt 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.440
 she herself is ready 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.320
 saving the family man of course 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.690
 here we get means oooh music 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.610
 here, radio, well, has been craving a century than anything 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.610
 other but ok 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.590
 the arrest most likely should have been 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.610
 litavrina we have nothing here nothing 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.760
 No, for example, we press 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.320
 yes music player 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.290
 push ships 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.610
 connect the name of the headset is all clear 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.940
 farther 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.620
 Here we have a radio without a headset, it does not 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.590
 works look further 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.260
 if she wanted to say a little bit 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.910
 system speed system 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.370
 the phone works just fine 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.460
 ohh for all my use 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.680
 there was never a reproach 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.949
 hangs 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.269
 neither phone is very fast 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:13.909
 that is, we literally have a few seconds 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.909
 we can run any applications 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.889
 percent fly here and there all in general so 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.379
 and most of all I liked everything 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.809
 lined up and run footage because 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.079
 that his nature has denied the editors a 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.339
 you at home 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.149
 quickly get a camera 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.259
 take a picture of her quickly clean then i don't 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.329
 I know such situations I could not know well 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.089
 eg 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.800
 and something fast sports 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.950
 so indonesia phone times 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.450
 clicked on the camera she launched at second 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.799
 expense and photographed 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.639
 but while talking about the benefits will tell about 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.559
 there is simply no one that is very fast all 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.559
 It starts to give a look at the menu 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.179
 standard cabinet menu icons too 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.939
 standard in general, then the percentage of contacts 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.759
 file names are all very pretty 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.889
 done the only thing I can say is that 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.999
 such a similar situation was baa1 to 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:11.649
 weak screen devices 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:12.829
 when 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.869
 more lived and kept 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.159
 wherein 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.370
 the kinetics worked worse than when we 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.669
 for example they pressed 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.489
 and let go 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.249
 the percentage of fractals there 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.589
 the voltage was shorter 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:27.859
 saying kinetics here 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.489
 also works if you click 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.609
 hold and enjoy moving your finger then 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.239
 our speed is not that good 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.770
 in like for example back rare books 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.699
 let erotic recorder 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.159
 further percentage of musicians per share 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.339
 but those are about educational 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:47.169
 programs 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:48.949
 That's actually so not organized 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.029
 issue it settings climbed 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:54.049
 I will look that there is a nalchik it modes 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.439
 us standard they can be customized as 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.309
 you bite 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:59.659
 there are firms 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.899
 Pirogov immediately realized that 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:04.739
 he 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.129
 even the phone number can be heard 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.760
 Then we went to a quarter to choose a topic 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.299
 can 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.859
 Hermann 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.639
 times two three four total four topics 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.900
 is here 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.690
 You can download their registrations online 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.269
 here are such downloads through 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.919
 internet but there care 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.229
 very little whether they have some kind of fair game 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.900
 interesting topics 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.900
 we went further signal we can assign 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.030
 backlight unfortunately can not be adjusted 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.550
 screen brightness why so with this effect 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.600
 mean what are we when titles 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.580
 for example on the phone and skip the call from 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.680
 the keyboard starts blinking 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.840
 that's what it is on the construction site further 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.960
 backlight display background picture mode 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.379
 expectations in the amount of 610 can assign 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.770
 Further date and time they have 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.800
 quick access connection 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.259
 devices but let's see 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.410
 Claim settings on the phone 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.919
 memory status institute regret 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.669
 very little memory 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.900
 further update phone modes 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.330
 smile information version 0 5 three seas 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:21.919
 farther 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.310
 what else to download it 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.189
 connections will be made of course 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:28.630
 let's get a look 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.630
 I clean the wifi access point home 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.440
 but hardly anything of course he is there 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.860
 plunge well just wondering 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.909
 here is no update 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.270
 in chit motorist so I think it is not necessary 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.050
 don't really cover it so protection 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.689
 accounts and so on no 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.149
 But in principle, but that's all I wanted to show 

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:53.300
 let's be 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.099
 practicing forkcu run applications 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:56.960
 meaning how much 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.249
 to show you 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:00.939
 for example, the application menu will be 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:01.969
 of money 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.969
 rented crafts 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:09.180
 just try to sell something 

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:10.740
 it will be difficult to call 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.960
 production of high-quality video 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.889
 to use 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.949
 the whole complex so he even show how 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:18.789
 actions 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.509
 here 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:23.780
 however 4 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:36.630
 company 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:46.849
 According to the premier, while it all works 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.110
 I think the phone is smart 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.740
 wears glasses who will come the phone very quickly 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.270
 interesting beautiful 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.190
 someone on monday is nimble all everybody
