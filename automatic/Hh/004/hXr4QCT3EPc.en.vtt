00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
make sure you got enough it should be

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.799 
make sure you got enough it should be
just<00:00:38.219> above<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> elbow<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.480> below<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
just above the elbow and just below the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.690 
just above the elbow and just below the
wrist<00:00:40.020> joint<00:00:40.230> still<00:00:40.710> now<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.160> some<00:00:41.309> movement

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
wrist joint still now for some movement

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.090 
wrist joint still now for some movement
as<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:43.050> pre-made<00:00:43.440> gauntlet<00:00:43.890> it

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
as you can see my pre-made gauntlet it

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.190 
as you can see my pre-made gauntlet it
pretty<00:00:44.789> much<00:00:44.879> fits<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.480> exact

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
pretty much fits that exact

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200 
pretty much fits that exact
specification<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.460> cut<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:47.850> into<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
specification so cut that out into a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.540 
specification so cut that out into a
nice<00:00:48.300> square<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:50.039> go<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.340> grab<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
nice square you can then go and grab a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.310 
nice square you can then go and grab a
heat<00:00:50.850> gun<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.180> start<00:00:51.660> applying<00:00:51.870> some<00:00:51.989> heat<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
heat gun and start applying some heat to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.000 
heat gun and start applying some heat to
it<00:00:52.379> now<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:53.010> EBA<00:00:53.460> foam<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.879> course<00:00:54.120> some

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
it now if your EBA foam of course some

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.069 
it now if your EBA foam of course some
bends<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.520> once<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:56.969> bent<00:00:57.210> enough<00:00:57.510> put<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:57.989> in

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
bends so once it's bent enough put it in

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.569 
bends so once it's bent enough put it in
a<00:00:58.109> big<00:00:58.260> loop<00:00:58.440> tie<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.800> down<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.219> hopefully<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
a big loop tie it down and hopefully it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.529 
a big loop tie it down and hopefully it
should<00:00:59.730> set<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.180> that

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
should set like that

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.150 
should set like that
now<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.260> check<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> blueprints<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
now you can check out the blueprints and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.130 
now you can check out the blueprints and
go<00:01:02.280> ahead<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.699> cut<00:01:03.449> out<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> rest<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
go ahead and cut out the rest of the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.600 
go ahead and cut out the rest of the
detailing<00:01:04.470> now<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.830> will<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.250> placed

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
detailing now this will just be placed

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.980 
detailing now this will just be placed
on<00:01:05.790> top<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.330> I'm<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.600> gonna<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.810> any

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
on top of it so I'm not gonna do any

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.990 
on top of it so I'm not gonna do any
trickery<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.799> anything<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:08.729> quite

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
trickery or anything that's quite

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.710 
trickery or anything that's quite
difficult<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.600> guys<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.780> follow<00:01:10.110> because

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
difficult for you guys to follow because

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.240 
difficult for you guys to follow because
this<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.990> doesn't<00:01:13.200> require<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.070> it's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
this just doesn't require it so it's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.190 
this just doesn't require it so it's
pretty<00:01:14.369> easy<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.330> these<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.630> kind<00:01:16.080> of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
pretty easy so with these little kind of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.050 
pretty easy so with these little kind of
square<00:01:16.590> rectangular<00:01:17.040> things<00:01:17.430> we're<00:01:17.939> just

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
square rectangular things we're just

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.580 
square rectangular things we're just
going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> cut<00:01:18.360> them<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.570> half<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.229> lower

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
going to cut them in half just to lower

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.859 
going to cut them in half just to lower
the<00:01:19.950> height<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.820> them<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.060> bit<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.600> when<00:01:21.750> we

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the height of them a bit more so when we

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.300 
the height of them a bit more so when we
do<00:01:21.990> place<00:01:22.200> them<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:22.590> don't<00:01:22.650> stick<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.130> as

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
do place them on they don't stick out as

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.300 
do place them on they don't stick out as
much<00:01:23.520> these<00:01:24.030> are<00:01:24.150> kind<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> buckle

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
much these are kind of like the buckle

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.230 
much these are kind of like the buckle
aesthetics<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> speak<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.090> could

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
aesthetics so to speak you could

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.899 
aesthetics so to speak you could
actually<00:01:27.390> add<00:01:27.540> public<00:01:28.020> buckles<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.909> you're

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
actually add public buckles but you're

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:30.830 
actually add public buckles but you're
gonna<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> spend<00:01:30.329> more<00:01:30.509> money<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
gonna have to spend more money on that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.350 
gonna have to spend more money on that
so<00:01:31.530> once<00:01:31.710> you've<00:01:31.950> got<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> vert<00:01:33.000> Furman<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
so once you've got the vert Furman it

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.640 
so once you've got the vert Furman it
set<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.810> want<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> slip<00:01:34.229> your<00:01:34.320> hand<00:01:34.560> into

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
set so you want to slip your hand into

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
set so you want to slip your hand into
it<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.009> kind<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.189> bend<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.549> around<00:01:35.670> until<00:01:36.119> you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it and kind of bend it around until you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.730 
it and kind of bend it around until you
find<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.840> tight<00:01:37.079> enough<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:37.650> still

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
in and out of once you've done that

extra parts that you don't need now
using<00:01:45.149> hot<00:01:45.329> glue<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.720> definitely<00:01:45.990> go<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
using hot glue you can definitely go and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.550 
using hot glue you can definitely go and
put<00:01:47.549> some<00:01:47.729> heat<00:01:47.909> between<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.509> SRU<00:01:49.079> put<00:01:49.439> some

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
put some heat between the SRU put some

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.249 
put some heat between the SRU put some
adhesive<00:01:49.710> between<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.520> seam<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.479> seal<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.170> up

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
adhesive between the seam and seal it up

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.109 
adhesive between the seam and seal it up
and<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.950> should<00:01:53.130> stick<00:01:53.369> now<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.060> see

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and that should stick now as you can see

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.060 
and that should stick now as you can see
my<00:01:54.600> pre-made<00:01:55.110> one<00:01:55.290> has<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.590> little<00:01:55.860> like

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
my pre-made one has this little like

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.980 
my pre-made one has this little like
slit<00:01:56.460> up<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> top<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.390> gonna<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
slit up the top and this is gonna be the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.120 
slit up the top and this is gonna be the
kind<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:58.920> bicep<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.450> forearm

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
kind of like bicep and forearm

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.620 
kind of like bicep and forearm
maneuvering<00:02:02.130> point<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.909> think<00:02:03.030> it'll<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> key

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
maneuvering point I think it'll be a key

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.139 
maneuvering point I think it'll be a key
quote<00:02:03.950> where<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.100> hinges<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.759> allows

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
quote where it hinges so it allows

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.279 
quote where it hinges so it allows
movement<00:02:06.600> I'll<00:02:07.380> call<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.170> go

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
movement I'll call that and you can go

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.540 
movement I'll call that and you can go
and<00:02:10.470> cut<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.770> out<00:02:10.920> simply<00:02:11.190> enough<00:02:11.400> by

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and cut that out simply enough by

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.309 
and cut that out simply enough by
drawing<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.970> up<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.270> using<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
drawing it up and using the

laughs knife make sure it's sharp

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.009 
laughs knife make sure it's sharp
because<00:02:14.909> this<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.299> bit<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.599> details<00:02:15.900> that

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
cylindrical cube it does kind of like

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.459 
cylindrical cube it does kind of like
morph<00:02:27.840> around<00:02:28.170> it

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
morph around it

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.619 
morph around it
now<00:02:29.219> with<00:02:29.370> these<00:02:29.489> little<00:02:29.730> extra<00:02:30.030> parts<00:02:30.359> now

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
now with these little extra parts now

now with these little extra parts now
not<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.560> belt<00:02:32.250> buckle<00:02:32.579> but<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.819> other<00:02:32.939> little

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
not the belt buckle but the other little

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.789 
not the belt buckle but the other little
tiny<00:02:33.389> part<00:02:33.750> which<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:33.959> gonna<00:02:34.139> go<00:02:34.319> on<00:02:34.439> top<00:02:34.650> of

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
tiny part which is gonna go on top of

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.979 
tiny part which is gonna go on top of
the<00:02:35.040> part<00:02:35.639> you<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.790> glued<00:02:36.239> we're<00:02:36.750> gonna<00:02:36.840> go

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
the part you just glued we're gonna go

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.330 
the part you just glued we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:37.079> and<00:02:37.200> bevel<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.650> edges<00:02:37.859> now<00:02:38.129> by

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
ahead and bevel the edges now by

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.830 
ahead and bevel the edges now by
beveling<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.819> mean<00:02:38.969> cutting<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.269> 45<00:02:39.689> degree

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
beveling I mean cutting a 45 degree

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.110 
beveling I mean cutting a 45 degree
angle<00:02:40.079> on<00:02:40.469> the<00:02:40.620> top<00:02:40.769> just<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.519> it's<00:02:41.669> not<00:02:41.819> very

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
angle on the top just so it's not very

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.379 
angle on the top just so it's not very
kind<00:02:43.109> of<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.379> straight<00:02:44.069> edge<00:02:44.219> on<00:02:44.489> a<00:02:44.549> 90

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
kind of like straight edge on a 90

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.809 
kind of like straight edge on a 90
degree<00:02:45.689> angle<00:02:45.719> as<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.590> would<00:02:46.739> be<00:02:46.889> before<00:02:47.069> this

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
degree angle as it would be before this

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.039 
degree angle as it would be before this
just<00:02:48.030> gives<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.389> bit<00:02:48.510> more<00:02:48.659> of<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.870> dynamic

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
just gives it a bit more of a dynamic

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.390 
just gives it a bit more of a dynamic
view<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.709> when<00:02:49.859> you're<00:02:49.980> looking<00:02:50.159> at<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.370> on

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
view so when you're looking at it on

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.770 
view so when you're looking at it on
camera<00:02:50.639> it<00:02:50.879> kind<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.269> looks<00:02:51.359> a<00:02:51.510> bit<00:02:51.540> more

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
camera it kind of just looks a bit more

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.089 
camera it kind of just looks a bit more
interesting<00:02:52.169> rather<00:02:52.439> than<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.739> flat

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
interesting rather than this flat

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.879 
interesting rather than this flat
surface<00:02:53.609> thing<00:02:54.500> now<00:02:55.500> these<00:02:55.650> belt<00:02:55.859> buckles

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
surface thing now these belt buckles

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.830 
surface thing now these belt buckles
we're<00:02:56.489> gonna<00:02:56.579> put<00:02:56.760> over<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.060> seam<00:02:57.299> just<00:02:57.780> to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
we're gonna put over the seam just to

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.330 
we're gonna put over the seam just to
kind<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.049> hide<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.409> a<00:02:58.469> bit<00:02:58.620> more<00:02:58.769> but<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.189> also

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
kind of hide it a bit more but it also

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.860 
kind of hide it a bit more but it also
gives<00:02:59.609> it<00:02:59.699> the<00:02:59.790> fact<00:02:59.969> that<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.269> gauntlet

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
gives it the fact that this gauntlet

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.110 
gives it the fact that this gauntlet
does<00:03:01.590> open<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.310> course<00:03:02.579> it<00:03:02.730> should<00:03:02.939> actually

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
does open of course it should actually

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.569 
does open of course it should actually
in<00:03:03.449> the<00:03:03.569> sci-fi<00:03:04.439> version<00:03:04.590> but<00:03:05.250> we<00:03:05.400> don't

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
in the sci-fi version but we don't

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.800 
in the sci-fi version but we don't
really<00:03:05.730> want<00:03:05.969> to<00:03:06.090> do<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.329> there's<00:03:06.510> no<00:03:06.629> need
