00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
unfortunately we think is going to stay

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
unfortunately we think is going to stay
for<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> while<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.729> us<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.509> don't<00:01:42.630> see<00:01:42.840> it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
for a while with us we don't see it

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.770 
for a while with us we don't see it
Rosie<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.799> 2009<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:45.030> are<00:01:45.210> preparing

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
Rosie in 2009 so we are preparing

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.149 
Rosie in 2009 so we are preparing
ourselves<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.770> face<00:01:47.060> higher<00:01:48.710> raw<00:01:49.710> material

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
ourselves to face higher raw material

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.940 
ourselves to face higher raw material
price<00:01:50.399> higher<00:01:50.729> energy<00:01:51.299> big<00:01:51.689> shift<00:01:52.079> not<00:01:52.649> only

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
price higher energy big shift not only

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.230 
price higher energy big shift not only
in<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.070> United<00:01:53.100> States<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.729> even<00:01:54.030> i<00:01:54.090> would

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
in the United States but even i would

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.510 
in the United States but even i would
say<00:01:54.329> globally<00:01:54.899> consumers<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.040> front<00:01:56.310> of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
say globally consumers in front of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.190 
say globally consumers in front of
rising<00:01:57.000> energy<00:01:57.180> prices<00:01:57.390> are<00:01:57.899> thought<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
rising energy prices are thought to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.410 
rising energy prices are thought to
think<00:01:58.500> twice<00:01:59.040> about<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.610> cars<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.969> want<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.270> buy

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
think twice about the cars I want to buy

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.149 
think twice about the cars I want to buy
and<00:02:00.689> what<00:02:01.170> they<00:02:01.320> are<00:02:01.380> expecting<00:02:01.829> from<00:02:01.950> their

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
and what they are expecting from their

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.340 
and what they are expecting from their
car<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.299> good<00:02:03.719> period<00:02:04.170> for

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
car so it's a really good period for

period like this now you know that this

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
period that we are all crossing

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
particularly in the industry makes us

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.260 
particularly in the industry makes us
particularly<00:02:46.130> attentive<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.820> our<00:02:46.850> own

particularly attentive to our own

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.720 
particularly attentive to our own
challenges<00:02:47.900> but<00:02:48.620> also<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:49.070> don't<00:02:49.250> think<00:02:49.430> that

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
challenges but also I don't think that

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.040 
challenges but also I don't think that
this<00:02:49.850> industry<00:02:50.300> is<00:02:50.360> going<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.600> be<00:02:50.720> like<00:02:50.900> this

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
this industry is going to be like this

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.920 
this industry is going to be like this
for<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.380> very<00:02:51.530> long<00:02:51.650> time<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.940> think<00:02:53.690> we're<00:02:53.840> going

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
for a very long time I think we're going

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.810 
for a very long time I think we're going
to<00:02:54.020> have<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.140> couple<00:02:54.470> of<00:02:54.530> very<00:02:54.980> rough<00:02:55.250> years<00:02:55.610> in

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
to have a couple of very rough years in

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.330 
to have a couple of very rough years in
front<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.150> us<00:02:56.300> we<00:02:56.780> are<00:02:56.900> all<00:02:57.080> facing<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.650> but

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
front of us we are all facing it but

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.090 
front of us we are all facing it but
after<00:02:58.520> this<00:02:59.170> hopefully<00:03:00.170> growth<00:03:00.440> is<00:03:00.710> going<00:03:00.770> to

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
after this hopefully growth is going to

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.620 
after this hopefully growth is going to
come<00:03:01.220> back<00:03:01.370> with<00:03:01.700> probably<00:03:02.120> products<00:03:02.510> which

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
come back with probably products which

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.780 
come back with probably products which
have<00:03:02.660> changed<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.530> technology<00:03:04.040> which<00:03:04.490> would

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
have changed and technology which would

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.300 
have changed and technology which would
have<00:03:04.970> also<00:03:05.600> shifted<00:03:06.020> so<00:03:06.530> it's<00:03:06.800> not<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.070> end<00:03:07.100> of

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
have also shifted so it's not the end of

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.250 
have also shifted so it's not the end of
the<00:03:07.370> world<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.850> think<00:03:08.060> it's<00:03:08.210> a<00:03:08.330> good<00:03:08.540> moment<00:03:08.810> we

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
the world I think it's a good moment we

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.650 
the world I think it's a good moment we
analyze<00:03:09.800> all<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.550> opportunities<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.420> risk

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
analyze all the opportunities and risk

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.480 
analyze all the opportunities and risk
and<00:03:11.870> make<00:03:12.020> your<00:03:12.170> decision<00:03:12.590> so<00:03:12.800> I<00:03:12.830> don't<00:03:13.340> think

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
and make your decision so I don't think

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.420 
and make your decision so I don't think
it's<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:14.870> it's<00:03:15.110> a<00:03:15.410> great<00:03:15.590> opportunity<00:03:15.830> to<00:03:16.250> move

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
it's a it's a great opportunity to move

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.040 
it's a it's a great opportunity to move
but<00:03:16.640> it's<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.850> great<00:03:16.940> opportunity<00:03:17.270> to<00:03:17.660> anodize

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
but it's a great opportunity to anodize

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.620 
but it's a great opportunity to anodize
reassess<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.920> then<00:03:19.700> after<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:20.360> move

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
reassess and then after this move

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.810 
reassess and then after this move

about<00:03:23.000> how<00:03:23.630> many<00:03:23.840> players<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.850> envision

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
about how many players you you envision

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.840 
about how many players you you envision
in<00:03:26.540> this<00:03:26.660> industry<00:03:26.989> let's<00:03:27.470> say<00:03:27.680> in<00:03:28.040> in<00:03:28.700> the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
in this industry let's say in in the

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.640 
in this industry let's say in in the
next<00:03:29.030> two<00:03:29.360> years<00:03:29.600> you've<00:03:29.870> got<00:03:29.930> three<00:03:30.410> major

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
next two years you've got three major

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.170 
next two years you've got three major
automakers<00:03:31.250> in<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.430> United<00:03:31.760> States<00:03:31.790> you've

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
automakers in the United States you've

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.970 
automakers in the United States you've
got<00:03:32.330> Renault<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.660> Nissan<00:03:32.840> which<00:03:33.650> you're

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
got Renault and Nissan which you're

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.260 
got Renault and Nissan which you're
running<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.550> course<00:03:34.730> we<00:03:34.910> know<00:03:35.090> that

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
running and of course we know that

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.320 
running and of course we know that
Toyota<00:03:35.660> has<00:03:36.200> been<00:03:36.470> successful<00:03:37.160> even<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:38.060> is

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
Toyota has been successful even it is

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.900 
Toyota has been successful even it is
also<00:03:38.540> seeing<00:03:38.930> real<00:03:39.680> problems<00:03:40.190> here<00:03:40.400> how<00:03:40.760> much

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
also seeing real problems here how much

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.050 
also seeing real problems here how much
consolidation<00:03:41.600> will<00:03:41.750> we<00:03:41.900> say<00:03:42.850> what<00:03:43.850> you<00:03:43.970> know

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
consolidation will we say what you know

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.370 
consolidation will we say what you know
it's<00:03:44.209> very<00:03:44.390> difficult<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.840> predict<00:03:45.230> these

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
it's very difficult to predict these

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.810 
it's very difficult to predict these
kind<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.680> numbers<00:03:45.830> but<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.190> can<00:03:46.430> tell<00:03:46.550> you<00:03:46.610> that

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
kind of numbers but I can tell you that

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.540 
kind of numbers but I can tell you that
if<00:03:47.000> I<00:03:47.209> have<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.600> predict<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:48.020> trend<00:03:48.320> is<00:03:48.550> between

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
if I have to predict a trend is between

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.320 
if I have to predict a trend is between
the<00:03:49.790> established<00:03:50.360> global<00:03:50.650> auto<00:03:51.650> maker<00:03:52.330> it's

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
the established global auto maker it's

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.910 
the established global auto maker it's
very<00:03:53.510> likely<00:03:53.720> they're<00:03:54.020> going<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:54.290> be<00:03:54.380> less<00:03:54.650> in

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
very likely they're going to be less in

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.710 
very likely they're going to be less in
the<00:03:55.280> next<00:03:55.550> three<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:55.820> five<00:03:56.000> years<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.480> we<00:03:56.570> have

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
the next three to five years and we have

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.930 
the next three to five years and we have
today<00:03:56.900> on<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.620> contrary<00:03:58.010> you're<00:03:58.700> going<00:03:58.880> to

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
today on the contrary you're going to

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.970 
today on the contrary you're going to
see<00:03:59.120> very<00:03:59.540> likely<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.230> emergence<00:04:00.709> of<00:04:00.890> new

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
see very likely the emergence of new

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.670 
see very likely the emergence of new
auto<00:04:01.760> makers<00:04:02.239> coming<00:04:02.540> from<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.320> emerging

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
auto makers coming from the emerging

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.490 
auto makers coming from the emerging
markets<00:04:03.709> very<00:04:04.700> likely<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:05.180> have<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.630> Chinese<00:04:06.260> or

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
markets very likely to have a Chinese or

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.699 
markets very likely to have a Chinese or
an<00:04:06.650> Indian<00:04:07.120> breaking<00:04:08.120> through<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.170> ranks<00:04:09.350> and

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
an Indian breaking through the ranks and

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.949 
an Indian breaking through the ranks and
becoming<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.310> global<00:04:10.430> player<00:04:10.910> so<00:04:11.269> it's<00:04:11.450> not<00:04:11.900> a

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
becoming a global player so it's not a

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.780 
becoming a global player so it's not a
question<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.620> only<00:04:13.040> consolidation<00:04:13.670> you're

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
question of only consolidation you're

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.979 
question of only consolidation you're
going<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:13.970> have<00:04:14.060> consolidation<00:04:14.660> from<00:04:14.840> one

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
going to have consolidation from one

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.780 
going to have consolidation from one
side<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.530> you're<00:04:15.920> going<00:04:16.040> to<00:04:16.130> have<00:04:16.250> emergence

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
side and you're going to have emergence

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.150 
side and you're going to have emergence
of<00:04:17.000> new<00:04:17.060> players<00:04:17.480> coming<00:04:17.900> with<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.799> emerging

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:37.129 
like in the coming three to five years

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.679 
like in the coming three to five years
yeah<00:04:38.129> you<00:04:38.340> know<00:04:38.430> we<00:04:38.639> are<00:04:38.819> investing<00:04:39.509> heavily

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:39.689

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.110 
yeah you know we are investing heavily
into<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.680> electric<00:04:41.129> car<00:04:41.279> because<00:04:41.849> we<00:04:41.969> think

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
into the electric car because we think

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.999 
into the electric car because we think
zero<00:04:42.449> emission<00:04:42.779> cars<00:04:43.020> are<00:04:43.199> going<00:04:43.349> to<00:04:43.439> become<00:04:43.590> a

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
zero emission cars are going to become a

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.879 
zero emission cars are going to become a
big<00:04:44.340> factor<00:04:44.580> in<00:04:44.789> our<00:04:45.060> industry<00:04:45.620> you<00:04:46.620> know<00:04:46.740> we

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
big factor in our industry you know we

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.619 
big factor in our industry you know we
