00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.420
 I can't get to this stormy sea 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.970
 understand it bardi can see 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.790
 but ends it is similar I do not see that 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.430
 indiscipline and variety cunning 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.440
 no sense of community no 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.310
 love if not for your own advantage 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.670
 then cowardice opportunism 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.259
 I every time the sky darkens 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.090
 I think of the world as I was thinking of 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.130
 nature we think we have different 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.320
 mentality but the parameters are fixed and 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.150
 places from society if I could go 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.640
 back if I had the chance 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.280
 I would go back to many but many years ago when 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.500
 there were no houses, palaces and cities but one 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.269
 nature with its immense dignity 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.860
 there is really too much confusion for 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.739
 think of replacing the 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.460
 situation in an almost buried world there 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.379
 save 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.870
 the art of listening listening to the 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.809
 romantic rustling of the wind admire 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.580
 the eternal majesty of the flower firmament 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.260
 that a gazelle is born that runs the 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.629
 world in silence the life that flows 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.330
 what you need for this time in which you live 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.060
 bad in the world a physical reset to the human 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.299
 mental starting from the first formality 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.070
 to change to restart the game 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.320
 start again without changing preconceptions 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.390
 all our inner hole projects 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.020
 other than black gold that is a 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.430
 starting from scratch we are drowning 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.750
 bound oil with death a 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.600
 blatche eto'o we did the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.210
 sea ​​water and sun wedding that 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.340
 let's get married and make love

 we are drowning glued of 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.200
 oil with death have vinegar there 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.890
 did the sea water marriage e 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.480
 Sun 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.820
 let's get married and make love 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.590
 we are drowning in oil 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.970
 with arm- in- arm death we did 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.430
 we apologize for the sea ​​water and sun wedding 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.680
 life and let's do it in love is not there 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.020
 the more they measure est modus in rebus yes 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.670
 I melt nature I every locus to me 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.370
 i'm not tired you're yen and frank 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.410
 do what is convenient to preach well e 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.480
 I miss scratching sometimes I think that 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.520
 we should get back to the early days before that 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.120
 finish making all my people out 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.250
 values 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.290
 the planet would rebel with one 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.330
 catastrophe would be a reversal 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.610
 all like the tape would me one 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.440
 revenge for every mood tree 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.050
 survived while his fellows 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.030
 nothing fell but terminator we are worms 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.070
 in the metro and we can always alone 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.810
 go back like a shrimp back 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.940
 to true values, serious ones 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.340
 we young people seem to regret this 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.830
 that there was yesterday with this bit melody 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.270
 drum guitars I look for the utopia I say 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.760
 does not speak your rapper ria 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.860
 I would like to see what a joke those who pay 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.260
 account in the end so much you are realizing 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.120
 big suns outside the window I see 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.250
 leaden gray sky I don't let me 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.200
 take as neffa in waiting for the sun 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.240
 flood the landfills all areas 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.490
 rancid a few more and make the 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.140
 shower with acid rain you pour 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.810
 the tears I pull on the sleeves towards 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.300
 dinner on the game with other cans there 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.190
 we are drowning 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.540
 bound oil with death a 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.270
 arm already we did the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.240
 sea water and sun wedding 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.670
 we marry life and make love there 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.380
 we are drowning in oil 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.670
 with the arm-in-arm death he did 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.480
 the marriage 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.330
 water sea and sun we marry the skill and 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.150
 let 's make love 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.980
 proposed ideas sometimes I think a 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.530
 maintain a demeanor remain 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.890
 underneath so much the trees and stones 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.660
 nature 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.240
 sometimes I think Italy is 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.730
 necessary a catastrophe that destroys 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.600
 everything we have superimposed on it 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.390
 the cars provided the cement and the cars 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.610
 bring back to the desert to the bare earth of 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.520
 first so that nature can 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.940
 resume the upper hand and start again 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:59.680
 from the first life form from the first man 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.680
 from the first fire here 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:07.950
 of this cataclysm father I feel 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.950
 ready to be the first victim
