00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.480
 very good you all know that such as 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.250
 you are welcome back to my channel 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.710
 guys and as you can see here you have the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.210
 first n-channel pump is worth the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.640
 first game of warfare sets 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.730
 It's also valid and I'll explain why 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.150
 what I have done has been I am sincere 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.090
 ok echo backwards boosting and I'm already 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.040
 the fourth account and we have done nothing like this 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.840
 like this morning he has lifted me up and we have 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.520
 said mine and let's do let's play 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.430
 against mancos is worth because those of me 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.270
 level then it costs to get a pump dn and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.040
 apart 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.240
 little game this game the game 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.830
 once in a while when I loved it from 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.259
 whites 2 I come to the to do 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.940
 warfare and see what I got out but 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.950
 normally to see only some will arrive 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.439
 ruthless thing is like that and it costs a lot 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.240
 and what happens then look to play against 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.759
 Mancos, you have a level too 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.619
 superior and you can easily get the 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.799
 games so I wanted to get out 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.810
 example a DNA pump for the first time 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.060
 you know to see what it feels like and for 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.340
 see how to play being better 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.740
 that they do not and over with a group of 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.380
 friends worth gamboa les guerri etcetera 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.759
 etcetera and we are like with gusts of 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.679
 help I think some had gusts of 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.429
 kill but we do not throw them away because 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.560
 so we could get better 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.679
 the game is worth and in this case it came out 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.990
 to me the departure and I left the one adn 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.360
 I was very nervous of very skill 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.160
 nervous and everyone there saying that you 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.819
 there are 5 that you have left 4 and start 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.030
 shout saying I'm going to get by 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.030
 your fucking blame the city laughed 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.040
 the serious but the bad luck that not 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.440
 graven life my voice you have the voice of my 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.000
 friends but mine no no no the serious 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.069
 because I did not expect it, it's worth it 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.540
 even if they were banks you 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.280
 they can kill to know because I think that 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.990
 here in this rate had 050 had 2004 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.480
 it was the fourth account and I started the 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.510
 games but nothing started and now I have 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.060
 rate of 0 05 and we were looking for people then 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 similar to that level 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.800
 and now I come to say it is fine what 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.900
 reverse busti has not given me for 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.670
 Yes you out items uploading them 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.800
 as long as days that is reverse 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.360
 gustín is worth as you say there 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.270
 that you're here in a game with people 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.450
 of your level because it seems to me already a 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.700
 I think it's like bravado, I do not know if 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.920
 express myself but well I have 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.510
 said worth this game is against seeing 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.400
 boosting with my fourth account in the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.680
 first account I think I have rate of 1 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.330
 and little more, that is, it is not for 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.569
 mock that with that account I do not have 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.280
 a lot and I still do not control this game 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.930
 but look so I bring you a first 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.239
 game in this game and it comes pretty 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.860
 well for the channel and so you guys 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.150
 you see me playing in warfare appear that 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.730
 it's the first time you're seeing me 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.530
 with the little jumps of the balls or the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.790
 update that more or less I'm getting to know 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.040
 already the maps that yes 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.209
 is that because we are already raising a 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:42.439
 bunch of league and when I have 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:45.680
 so for you and there were no fire of 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.780
 end when and I do not say it to see if it comes out 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.959
 something and it is that it came out in this game 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.480
 kids on youtube close to stop team 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.000
 yelling at your pilot to tomás because the 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.010
 true the first n bomb so it 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.879
 has to give tension yes or yes they had the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.920
 hands shaking but very motivated 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.109
 kids the last thing I wanted to say 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.030
 apart from all this is that by his 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.020
 had double daily video these days and 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.540
 it is and it was pretty good 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.980
 but it's a lot of work to do double video 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.230
 daily but good I'll upload the video 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.450
 when I can because now is my challenge 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.690
 get to 10,000 you know I want to get to 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.940
 10,000 and little by little then more coming 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.670
 not with constancy in the channel then 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.320
 you can go you can fulfill your dream and everything 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.570
 this so nothing kids I'm going to 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.790
 let the voices of my friends have in 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.710
 mind that my voice is not so when 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.990
 I take the black and mass and my 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.130
 comrades as they scream you know that thank you 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.170
 to my friends because I could get out 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.470
 this game because it is not that it is very 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.240
 well I already admit it but it's like 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.270
 controls a little bit so nothing kids 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.050
 I leave you with the video and a greeting 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.050
 How are you 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.350
 I took the other 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.660
 the sports are left 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.040
 deactivated 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.040
 to the book or approach it 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.909
 each 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.960
 he does not have charlie 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.960
 Allied missile attack 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.000
 to the future 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.000
 and we have not lost brief 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.150
 and aggravating 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:47.950
 do not

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.800
 world 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.460
 at least 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.090
 they are screaming 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.090
 for having requested 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.900
