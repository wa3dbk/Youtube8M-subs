Here<00:00:12.160> I<00:00:12.580> am<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.900> my<00:00:14.200> greenhouse<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.969> is

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
Here I am in my greenhouse it is

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.560 
Here I am in my greenhouse it is
February<00:00:17.020> the<00:00:18.419> 19th<00:00:19.590> 2013<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:22.240> I<00:00:22.330> thought

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
February the 19th 2013 and I thought

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.259 
February the 19th 2013 and I thought
it's<00:00:23.260> about<00:00:23.410> time<00:00:23.560> we<00:00:24.279> started<00:00:24.699> doing<00:00:24.849> a<00:00:25.090> bit<00:00:25.210> a

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
it's about time we started doing a bit a

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.779 
it's about time we started doing a bit a
husbandry<00:00:25.810> in<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:26.920> greenhouse<00:00:27.340> and<00:00:27.369> getting

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
husbandry in the greenhouse and getting

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.620 
husbandry in the greenhouse and getting
prepared<00:00:28.300> for<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:29.380> coming<00:00:29.619> season<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.420> this

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
prepared for the coming season so this

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.170 
prepared for the coming season so this
year<00:00:31.900> although<00:00:32.710> my<00:00:32.860> jobs<00:00:33.190> main<00:00:33.519> jobs<00:00:33.790> is<00:00:33.940> to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
year although my jobs main jobs is to

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.399 
year although my jobs main jobs is to
recover<00:00:34.720> my<00:00:35.530> heated<00:00:36.309> propagator<00:00:36.820> here<00:00:37.409> it's

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
recover my heated propagator here it's

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:40.049 
recover my heated propagator here it's
got<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.559> bubble<00:00:38.890> wrap<00:00:39.040> insulator<00:00:39.610> on<00:00:39.760> which

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
got the bubble wrap insulator on which

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.369 
got the bubble wrap insulator on which
is<00:00:40.620> specifically<00:00:41.620> being<00:00:41.920> produced<00:00:42.879> for<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
is specifically being produced for the

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.500 
is specifically being produced for the
greenhouse<00:00:44.909> so<00:00:45.909> it<00:00:46.510> is<00:00:47.280> UV<00:00:48.280> tolerant<00:00:48.970> up<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.479> a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
greenhouse so it is UV tolerant up to a

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.619 
greenhouse so it is UV tolerant up to a
point<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:51.070> now<00:00:51.280> this<00:00:51.729> is<00:00:51.790> a<00:00:51.970> few<00:00:52.239> years<00:00:52.269> old

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
point but now this is a few years old

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.289 
point but now this is a few years old
it's<00:00:53.080> starting<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.799> have<00:00:54.460> been<00:00:54.670> affected<00:00:55.180> and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:55.299 
it's starting to have been affected and

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:57.000 
it's starting to have been affected and
it's<00:00:55.449> starting<00:00:55.869> to<00:00:55.900> break<00:00:56.470> up<00:00:56.650> so<00:00:56.860> I'm<00:00:56.979> just

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
it's starting to break up so I'm just

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.840 
it's starting to break up so I'm just
going<00:00:57.309> to<00:00:57.460> replace<00:00:58.059> it<00:00:58.180> with<00:00:58.589> some<00:00:59.589> new<00:00:59.850> bubble

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
going to replace it with some new bubble

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.429 
going to replace it with some new bubble
wrap<00:01:01.470> okay<00:01:02.820> well<00:01:03.820> I'm<00:01:03.939> going<00:01:04.180> see<00:01:04.720> he's<00:01:05.379> just

I'll<00:01:16.960> have<00:01:17.200> my<00:01:17.380> heated<00:01:18.039> propagator<00:01:18.520> back<00:01:19.450> in

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
I'll have my heated propagator back in

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.310 
I'll have my heated propagator back in
use<00:01:19.979> ready<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.549> start<00:01:21.789> some<00:01:22.119> early<00:01:22.539> seedlings
