I'm going to go ahead and pop that on
right<00:00:58.920> now<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.960> give<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.500> couple<00:01:01.649> shots

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.399 

I<00:01:09.500> can't<00:01:10.220> see

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.080 

all<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.369> we're<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.609> to<00:01:17.670> go<00:01:17.759> ahead<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
all right we're going to go ahead and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.559 
all right we're going to go ahead and
give<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.329> a<00:01:18.359> couple<00:01:18.600> pumps<00:01:23.179> until<00:01:24.179> we<00:01:24.329> see

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
give it a couple pumps until we see

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.950 
give it a couple pumps until we see
grease<00:01:24.840> coming<00:01:25.770> out<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.700> u-joint<00:01:27.329> seal

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
grease coming out of the u-joint seal

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.889 
grease coming out of the u-joint seal
area<00:01:30.890> at<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.130> point<00:01:32.249> in<00:01:32.549> time<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.719> good

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
area at this point in time it's a good

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.319 
area at this point in time it's a good
idea<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.229> inspect<00:01:34.679> your<00:01:35.069> front<00:01:35.459> you<00:01:35.640> joint<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
idea to inspect your front you joint to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.389 
idea to inspect your front you joint to
see<00:01:36.509> if<00:01:36.599> it<00:01:36.750> has<00:01:36.929> a<00:01:36.959> fitting<00:01:37.469> greasing<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
see if it has a fitting greasing it

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.789 
see if it has a fitting greasing it
right<00:01:38.609> now<00:01:38.819> would<00:01:39.090> be<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.270> lot<00:01:39.569> easier<00:01:39.899> than

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
right now would be a lot easier than

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.339 
right now would be a lot easier than
after<00:01:41.069> installing<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.270> drive<00:01:42.599> shaft<00:01:42.959> on<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
the factory fitting on it and there is

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.089 
the factory fitting on it and there is
no<00:01:49.500> grease<00:01:49.829> port<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.489> it<00:01:50.640> anywhere<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.420> here

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
no grease port for it anywhere on here

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.459 
no grease port for it anywhere on here
if<00:01:53.099> your<00:01:53.280> drive<00:01:53.489> shaft<00:01:53.789> is<00:01:54.000> also<00:01:54.299> look<00:01:54.509> has<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
if your drive shaft is also look has a

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.309 
if your drive shaft is also look has a

it's<00:02:00.989> a<00:02:01.079> good<00:02:01.259> idea<00:02:01.349> to<00:02:01.560> go<00:02:01.709> ahead<00:02:01.739> and<00:02:02.099> take

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
it's a good idea to go ahead and take

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.260 
it's a good idea to go ahead and take
and<00:02:02.399> lubricate<00:02:02.819> that<00:02:02.849> at<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:04.049> point<00:02:04.349> in<00:02:04.439> time

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
and lubricate that at this point in time
