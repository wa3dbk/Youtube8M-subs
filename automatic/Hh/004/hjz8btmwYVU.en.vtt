00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
sticky you know it should just come

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.090 
sticky you know it should just come
together<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:32.899> should<00:01:33.020> feel<00:01:33.229> warm<00:01:33.500> if<00:01:33.950> it's

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
together and it should feel warm if it's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.770 
together and it should feel warm if it's
too<00:01:34.310> wet<00:01:34.490> yeah<00:01:34.789> add<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.880> little<00:01:35.270> bit<00:01:35.390> of<00:01:35.509> flour
