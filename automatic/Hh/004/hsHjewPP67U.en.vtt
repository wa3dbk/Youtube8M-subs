flash bracket however this one instead

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.520 
flash bracket however this one instead
of<00:02:58.100> just<00:02:58.610> one<00:02:58.880> app<00:02:59.180> like<00:02:59.630> free<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:01.060> another

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
of just one app like free and another

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.360 
of just one app like free and another
flash<00:03:03.530> adapter<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> screw<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:06.370> basically

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
flash adapter to a screw and basically

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.860 
flash adapter to a screw and basically
this<00:03:07.730> one<00:03:10.180> will<00:03:11.709> changed<00:03:12.709> after<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.790> bit<00:03:14.150> the

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
this one will changed after a bit the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.130 
this one will changed after a bit the
other<00:03:15.049> way<00:03:15.290> around<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:15.799> basically<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.870> want<00:03:17.870> to

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
other way around so basically I want to

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.550 
other way around so basically I want to
grab<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:19.090> handle<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.780> want<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.080> put<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.410> on

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
grab this handle and I want to put it on

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.040 
grab this handle and I want to put it on
the<00:03:21.830> other<00:03:21.920> side

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:53.440 

so<00:03:26.470> now<00:03:26.650> instead<00:03:26.890> of<00:03:29.280> death<00:03:30.930> this

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.770 

so<00:03:54.110> now<00:03:54.500> it's<00:03:56.470> that's<00:03:57.470> more<00:03:57.980> things<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:59.420> I<00:03:59.450> can

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
so now it's that's more things so I can

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.390 
so now it's that's more things so I can
put<00:03:59.989> three<00:04:00.500> things<00:04:00.920> on<00:04:01.190> yeah

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.430 

however<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:10.700> may<00:04:10.910> be<00:04:10.940> be<00:04:11.569> too<00:04:12.080> much<00:04:12.910> extend<00:04:13.910> it

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
however it may be be too much extend it

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.289 
however it may be be too much extend it
for<00:04:15.440> certain<00:04:15.680> answers<00:04:16.160> if<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.459> are<00:04:16.760> like

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
for certain answers if you are like

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.340 
for certain answers if you are like
doing<00:04:18.459> really<00:04:19.459> wide<00:04:19.820> shots<00:04:20.299> or<00:04:20.840> like

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
doing really wide shots or like

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.830 
doing really wide shots or like
following<00:04:22.190> somebody<00:04:22.490> around<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:26.210> extends

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
following somebody around it extends

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.830 
following somebody around it extends
quite<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.229> while<00:04:27.740> so<00:04:28.610> but<00:04:28.910> if<00:04:29.090> you're<00:04:29.330> using

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
quite a while so but if you're using

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.909 
quite a while so but if you're using
that<00:04:30.490> if<00:04:31.490> you're<00:04:31.729> using<00:04:33.040> something<00:04:34.040> like<00:04:34.220> a<00:04:35.919> 28

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
that if you're using something like a 28

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.740 
that if you're using something like a 28
or<00:04:37.220> any<00:04:37.729> longer<00:04:38.120> lenses<00:04:38.570> on<00:04:38.780> it<00:04:39.310> could<00:04:40.310> work

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
or any longer lenses on it could work

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.129 
or any longer lenses on it could work
all<00:04:41.750> right

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
all right

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.620 
all right
I'm<00:04:42.800> not<00:04:43.010> I<00:04:43.220> don't<00:04:43.340> really<00:04:43.790> use<00:04:44.030> this<00:04:44.270> setup

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
I'm not I don't really use this setup

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.840 
I'm not I don't really use this setup
that<00:04:45.350> much

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
that much

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.480 
that much
however<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.810> simpler<00:04:48.350> setup<00:04:48.650> is<00:04:48.950> probably

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
however the simpler setup is probably

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.540 
however the simpler setup is probably
better<00:04:50.120> for<00:04:50.350> most<00:04:51.350> of<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.800> guys<00:04:51.950> who<00:04:52.220> shoot

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
better for most of the guys who shoot

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.740 
better for most of the guys who shoot
skateboards<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:53.870> basically<00:04:54.860> see<00:04:55.460> less

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
skateboards and basically see less

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.320 
skateboards and basically see less
extended<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:57.340> mainly<00:04:58.340> you<00:04:58.880> could<00:04:59.060> use<00:04:59.300> a

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
extended and mainly you could use a

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.440 
extended and mainly you could use a
wider<00:04:59.720> lens<00:05:00.020> with<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.610> so<00:05:01.610> that<00:05:01.640> was<00:05:01.970> basically

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
wider lens with it so that was basically

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.770 
wider lens with it so that was basically
it

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
it

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.990 
it
hopefully<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:03.860> find<00:05:04.130> these<00:05:04.280> information

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
hopefully you find these information

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.640 
hopefully you find these information
quite<00:05:05.870> useful<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:06.680> it's<00:05:07.160> all<00:05:07.990> yeah<00:05:09.050> basic

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
quite useful and it's all yeah basic
