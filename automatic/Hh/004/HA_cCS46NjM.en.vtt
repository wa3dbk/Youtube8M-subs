00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.219 
basically reset it our mindsets and we
said<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.579> gotta<00:01:29.729> wait<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:30.060> band<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.750> out<00:01:30.869> scale

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
said we gotta wait out band we out scale

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.140 
said we gotta wait out band we out scale
them<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> better<00:01:31.979> comp<00:01:32.250> late<00:01:32.430> game<00:01:32.640> so

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
them we have a better comp late game so

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.999 
them we have a better comp late game so
we<00:01:33.270> basically<00:01:33.390> waited<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.500> made

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
we basically waited for that and made

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.289 
we basically waited for that and made
the<00:01:35.130> game<00:01:35.280> lasts<00:01:35.549> longer<00:01:36.030> than<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.270> should

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the game lasts longer than it should

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.899 
the game lasts longer than it should
have<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:36.750> pin<00:01:36.960> well<00:01:37.799> then<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.490> mention<00:01:38.790> it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
have in my pin well then you mention it

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.760 
have in my pin well then you mention it
it<00:01:39.030> was<00:01:39.240> pretty<00:01:39.780> long<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.320> you're<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it was pretty long and it you're the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.960 
it was pretty long and it you're the
hero<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> end<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.670> kill<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
hero in the end because you kill the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.910 
hero in the end because you kill the
Nexus<00:01:42.329> talk<00:01:42.780> me<00:01:42.930> through<00:01:43.110> decision<00:01:43.590> making

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
Nexus talk me through decision making

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.469 
Nexus talk me through decision making
process<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> calling<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:45.090> those<00:01:45.240> last

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
process and the calling for those last

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.499 
process and the calling for those last
moments<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.619> basically<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.250> kill<00:01:47.790> off<00:01:47.909> or<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
moments so basically we kill off or and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.510 
moments so basically we kill off or and
katelyn<00:01:48.869> basically<00:01:49.530> flashes<00:01:49.920> one<00:01:50.070> HP<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
katelyn basically flashes one HP and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.600 
katelyn basically flashes one HP and
they<00:01:50.579> were<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.850> whoa<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.110> him<00:01:52.290> stone<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.860> don't

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
they were like whoa in him stone I don't

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.710 
they were like whoa in him stone I don't
know<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:53.820> him<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.149> think<00:01:54.329> my<00:01:54.390> net<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.689> down

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
know if in him I think my net was down

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.569 
know if in him I think my net was down
and<00:01:55.049> then<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.229> had<00:01:55.409> super<00:01:55.920> minions<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.430> we're

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
and then we had super minions so we're

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.249 
and then we had super minions so we're
like<00:01:56.729> turtle<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.689> add<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.930> here<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.200> I'm

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
like turtle you can add in here and I'm

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.010 
like turtle you can add in here and I'm
like<00:01:58.380> let's<00:01:58.829> do<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.729> they<00:02:00.299> said<00:02:00.540> if

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
like let's do it and then they said if

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.359 
like let's do it and then they said if
Kalin<00:02:01.380> comes<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.829> probably<00:02:02.009> just

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
Kalin comes you can probably just

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.840 
Kalin comes you can probably just
and<00:02:02.729> I'm<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.880> okay<00:02:03.469> well<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:05.369> did<00:02:05.520> take<00:02:05.670> him

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
just talked me through the momentum

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.580 
just talked me through the momentum
going<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.510> rest<00:02:32.780> of<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:32.990> day<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.350> is<00:02:33.410> a

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
going in the rest of the day this is a

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.350 
going in the rest of the day this is a
great<00:02:33.890> start<00:02:34.040> but<00:02:34.220> for<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.550> whole<00:02:34.730> team<00:02:35.060> how

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
great start but for the whole team how

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.910 
great start but for the whole team how
big<00:02:35.570> are<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.810> chance<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.290> close<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.680> on<00:02:36.770> that

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
big are you a chance to close it on that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.770 
big are you a chance to close it on that
number<00:02:37.250> one<00:02:37.550> spot<00:02:37.580> it's<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.180> important<00:02:38.630> um

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
number one spot it's so important um

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.690 
number one spot it's so important um
honestly<00:02:39.380> right<00:02:39.709> now<00:02:39.740> we<00:02:39.950> have<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.370> lot<00:02:40.670> of

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
honestly right now we have a lot of

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.250 
honestly right now we have a lot of
momentum<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:41.450> think<00:02:41.660> we<00:02:41.720> can<00:02:41.840> do<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:41.990> very

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
momentum and I think we can do it very

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.800 
momentum and I think we can do it very
easily<00:02:42.410> with<00:02:42.920> how<00:02:43.280> we<00:02:43.340> are<00:02:43.490> right<00:02:43.670> now<00:02:43.790> Wow<00:02:44.150> big
