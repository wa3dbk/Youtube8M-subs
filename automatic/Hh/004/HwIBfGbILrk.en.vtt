00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.230 

it'll<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> water<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> way

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
it'll have the water going all the way

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.399 
it'll have the water going all the way
up<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:18.659> now<00:01:18.810> cuz<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.080> don't<00:01:19.140> want<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
up right now cuz I don't want the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.830 
up right now cuz I don't want the
turtles<00:01:19.710> getting<00:01:19.890> out<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:21.210> right<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> made

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
turtles getting out so right now I made

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.190 
turtles getting out so right now I made
an<00:01:21.930> overflow<00:01:22.409> box<00:01:22.680> that's<00:01:23.070> exactly<00:01:23.960> 14<00:01:24.960> inches

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
an overflow box that's exactly 14 inches

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.520 
an overflow box that's exactly 14 inches
high<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:27.360> water<00:01:27.600> will<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.080> no<00:01:28.259> higher

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
high so the water will get no higher

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.109 
high so the water will get no higher
than<00:01:28.829> 14<00:01:29.820> inches<00:01:30.119> when<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> does<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:32.729> flows

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
than 14 inches when it does it flows

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.859 
than 14 inches when it does it flows
over<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.840> overflow<00:01:34.200> box<00:01:35.119> it<00:01:36.119> gets<00:01:36.329> sucked<00:01:36.659> up

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
over the overflow box it gets sucked up

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.300 
over the overflow box it gets sucked up
by<00:01:37.460> these<00:01:38.460> tubes<00:01:40.340> which<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.549> comes<00:01:41.850> into<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
by these tubes which then comes into the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.109 
by these tubes which then comes into the
box<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.520> sucks<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.060> down<00:01:46.520> into<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.700> wet/dry

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
box that sucks it down into my wet/dry

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.789 
box that sucks it down into my wet/dry
filter

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.060 

which<00:01:51.219> is<00:01:51.340> right<00:01:51.490> there<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.560> water<00:01:53.799> then

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
which is right there the water then

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.240 
which is right there the water then
passes<00:01:54.520> through<00:01:54.579> the<00:01:55.509> filter<00:01:55.899> media<00:01:56.250> then

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
passes through the filter media then

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.410 
passes through the filter media then
through<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:58.679> bio<00:01:59.679> balls<00:02:00.009> which<00:02:00.579> contains<00:02:01.210> all
