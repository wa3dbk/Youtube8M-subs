lollipop

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.050 

the<00:01:55.240> moment<00:01:55.600> that<00:01:55.630> actually<00:01:56.460> used<00:01:57.460> up<00:01:57.850> at

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
the moment that actually used up at

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.770 
the moment that actually used up at
least<00:01:58.270> 20<00:01:59.020> gigabytes<00:01:59.500> of<00:02:00.240> my<00:02:01.240> internal

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
least 20 gigabytes of my internal

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.930 
least 20 gigabytes of my internal
storage<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.220> going<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.490> take<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.730> while

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
storage so it is going to take a while

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:12.260 
storage so it is going to take a while
before<00:02:04.150> it<00:02:04.360> actually<00:02:04.540> deletes<00:02:05.170> everything

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.580 

and<00:02:13.270> there<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:16.170> deleted<00:02:17.170> everything

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.380 

like<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.380> said<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.710> process<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.460> lengthy

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
like I said the process is lengthy

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.740 
like I said the process is lengthy
depending<00:02:56.230> on<00:02:56.350> how<00:02:56.500> much<00:02:57.120> internal<00:02:58.120> storage

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
depending on how much internal storage

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.990 
depending on how much internal storage
you<00:02:58.960> actually<00:02:59.380> used<00:02:59.620> up<00:02:59.890> but<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:03.580> should<00:03:03.820> be

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
you actually used up but it should be

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.890 
you actually used up but it should be
able<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.420> do<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:05.100> full<00:03:06.100> flash<00:03:06.490> reset<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:13.690> takes

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
able to do a full flash reset it takes

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.250 
able to do a full flash reset it takes
approximately<00:03:14.220> five<00:03:15.220> minutes<00:03:16.260> for

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
approximately five minutes for

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.210 
approximately five minutes for
everything<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:18.360> wipe<00:03:19.500> reset<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:23.010> start<00:03:24.010> off

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220
