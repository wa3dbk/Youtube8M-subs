00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.450
 We are going to put it in our bowl 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.619
 continue with the pumpkin 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.190
 that the pumpkin is rich is raw 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.510
 raw pumpkin in lazy hour is bitter 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.930

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.760
 pumpkin son and knows how to throw is 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.530
 So what do you have to do? 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.800
 two banks and as if it were cucumber 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.400
 rub the two of the two sides and 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.130
 that takes away the bitter taste we're not going to 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.590
 put now the tomato the lycopene 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.750
 that help lower the antigen 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.819
 Prostatic very interesting for 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:45.349
 chilito men let's put chivito 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:49.510
 let's put olives onions for 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:52.060
 that they do not say much onion we are going to 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.099
 strengthen that immune system because 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.769
 then there's no one who does not get saved from 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.049
 true allergies is terrible they know 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.879
 you that the children that have 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:07.490
 overweight they have up to 56 percent 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:11.270
 of possibilities of having more allergies 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:15.170
 and that is very thick is a fact that 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.450
 came out in this in a program that right now 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.670
 is very very very very strong in 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.400
 USA that is called do wake up the nation 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.920
 and this one left me impressed is 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.070
 because it is true then we walk with the 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.710
 mosquito the little thing that does not breathe well 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.950
 and not in our more are allergies 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.930
 then we have to be careful or we do 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.900
 good wáyar let's mix these 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.320
 ingredients let's put a little bit of 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.200
 parsley that buys three united states 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.970
 if they do not have parsley on hand always 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.020
 serves basil 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.720
 I say cilantro sorry cilantro this 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.300
 step tito the herbs that you see there 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.160
 you put everything everything tastes good 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.780
 everyone to see rich but not for nothing 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.110
 but it is already quite easy to 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.510
 get this type of ingredients 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.170
 let's season with a little salt and 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.550
 Pepper 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:16.690
 he can be measured 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:21.630
 michael 33 gas rum throw what 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.630
 and now let's make our vinaigrette 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.840
 we should add a little more 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.569
 onion but to my taste it is enough 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.900
 What do you think? I think we're going to leave the 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:37.270
 onion is to cover a sopita no orale 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.900
 so let's put lemon juice here 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.130
 let it be green lemon to give it that touch 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.990
 we just need the part to zidane 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.260
 or the yellow lemon sometimes is not so 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.090
 acid as I like a little bit of 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.210
 orange that is natural orange by 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.190
 please do not go to do this one or 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.410
 can we do not want from the 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.990
 concentrates we do not want dyes 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.770
 artificial and those things we're going to put 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.750
 that botanera type appointment there are many 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.400
 types of sauce the one you like the most 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.700
 that they like that we will put 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.640
 the joke is that you know if the cost 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.870
 not like that because it is not worth to be 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.270
 diet and eat pure bored 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.520
 because a lot of people think that being 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.370
 diet 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.449
 it's a boring roll and it's net all 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:31.620
 world says I'm not going to diet 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:34.750
 I'm going to eat boring, nothing tastes good 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.980
 this puts you bad is putting in 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.340
 bad and not to see who can stand you 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.320
 it affects 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:46.770
 I do not very much like this 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.810
 you put on damn no no one else do not you 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.350
 you feel good about your head you are 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.020
 as the pp is already on, the chip does not 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.490
 then there is no need to know that 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.500
 when we go on a diet always have 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.080
 a food that will make us happy 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.930
 me this ceviche makes me happy the truth 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.570
 come a little olive oil to 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.430
 this cardiovascular heart condition 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.680
 that circulates in the blood that leaves the 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.770
 cholesterol we're going to put a little bit of 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:18.150
 Olive oil at sunrise we beat well 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.879
 as it should be and we are going to incorporate 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.219
 our 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:25.259
 success who said that who said that 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:27.600
 being on a diet was bad to see the 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:30.170
 contrary 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.480
 this looks good of precious and check 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.070
 if you make service to their children not 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.100
 I know if they have out there of these molds 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.200
 for biscuits they can slice some 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.390
 little things for example to the jlca more what 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.430
 they make in rounds and then with the mold 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.680
 they take out the figure of the cat puppy and 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.700
 everything and make it attractive and take away the 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.580
 chip and this one we put and so they are already 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.710
 eating figurines or letters if they are 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.270
 Learning to write food is very 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.680
 fun you can become very 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.889
 dynamic will put some 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.110
 avocado 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.110
 and in what they lower me mike el chicharrón 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.660
 let's go back to court
