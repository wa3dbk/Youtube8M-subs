00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
other kids in the face of course we

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.750 
other kids in the face of course we
still<00:02:31.020> have<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.530> kid<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> back<00:02:32.250> reading<00:02:32.670> a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
still have the kid in the back reading a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.740 
still have the kid in the back reading a
book<00:02:33.000> which<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.720> pretty<00:02:33.959> Ford<00:02:34.560> esque<00:02:35.010> but

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
book which is pretty Ford esque but

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.490 
book which is pretty Ford esque but
still<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:37.650> an<00:02:37.830> interesting<00:02:38.190> lapse<00:02:38.820> in<00:02:39.209> logic

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
still it's an interesting lapse in logic

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.280 
still it's an interesting lapse in logic
seemingly<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:41.130> what's<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.880> explanation<00:02:42.290> well

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
seemingly so what's the explanation well

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.600 
seemingly so what's the explanation well
I'm<00:02:43.470> sure<00:02:43.650> there's<00:02:43.860> plenty<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.310> possibilities

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
I'm sure there's plenty of possibilities

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.120 
I'm sure there's plenty of possibilities
but<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:45.690> are<00:02:45.810> three<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.320> I'd<00:02:46.500> most<00:02:46.800> likely

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
but here are three that I'd most likely

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.110 
but here are three that I'd most likely
tend<00:02:47.610> towards<00:02:48.440> one<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:49.980> simply<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.520> plotting

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
tend towards one it is simply a plotting

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.510 
tend towards one it is simply a plotting
slip-up<00:02:51.750> maybe<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.530> full<00:02:52.739> story<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.340> the

anything<00:03:55.709> could<00:03:55.950> really<00:03:56.250> be<00:03:56.489> possible<00:03:57.329> I

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
anything could really be possible I

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.690 
anything could really be possible I
guess<00:03:57.510> now<00:03:58.350> those<00:03:58.739> are<00:03:58.950> just<00:03:58.980> three

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.789 
guess now those are just three
explanations<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:00.750> came<00:04:01.079> up<00:04:01.230> with<00:04:01.410> but<00:04:01.739> I

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
explanations that I came up with but I

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.380 
explanations that I came up with but I
want<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.070> know<00:04:02.190> what<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:02.850> think<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.360> mean

there's<00:04:04.110> definitely<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.829> disconnect<00:04:05.730> here<00:04:05.820> of

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
there's definitely a disconnect here of

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.110 
there's definitely a disconnect here of
some<00:04:06.510> sort<00:04:06.870> with<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.950> way<00:04:08.190> he's<00:04:08.549> remembering

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
some sort with the way he's remembering

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.630 
some sort with the way he's remembering
himself<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.959> some<00:04:10.500> memories<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.549> way

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
himself in some memories and the way

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.190 
himself in some memories and the way
he's<00:04:11.850> remembering<00:04:12.299> himself<00:04:12.420> in<00:04:12.780> others

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
he's remembering himself in others

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.069 
he's remembering himself in others
because<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:14.400> not<00:04:14.730> quite<00:04:15.120> lining<00:04:15.630> up<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.959> think

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
because it's not quite lining up I think

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.199
