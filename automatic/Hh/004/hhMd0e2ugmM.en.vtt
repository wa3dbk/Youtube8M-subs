00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi friends so 63 for your 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:06.540
 advent calendar appointments them 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.240
 god stars dare today it's simple 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.460
 we go to the veil at 15,15 located right here 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.170
 but before a little reminder of what 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.059
 we saw yesterday cgc a small 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.640
 ship to build it was about 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.180
 these ci the genesis fighters xii which has 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.100
 it's all over the place so it's 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.650
 left I slightly back the camera 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.780
 during the space and we open box 15 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.320
 hours even though I think I had 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.279
 the idea of ​​what we will receive 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.870
 that's what I understood 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.640
 we will simply make the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.100
 pilot john user and as we can 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:58.829
 see it well a little code but I 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:01:02.329
 will come back here after his head 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.329
 and in a small bag 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.980
 as I have no knife on my hands 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.370
 with me there so I go straight with 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.780
 the names yes it's know so it's a 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:20.480
 line figurines it is built 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:23.330
 quickly a dish and dishes so 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.370
 this is your surprise of the day the john 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.200
 hozjan so is a figurine that we 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.660
 have already seen will have precisely to this 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.970
 clause noah genesis fighter and in a 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.560
 other this output in 2000 all were 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.390
 in the canon of geonosis but this 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.440
 time he had desert elsewhere it's 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.790
 still a pity that for this 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.350
 version of the calendar we do not have 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.119
 dead is the same thank you so bah 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.710
 that's the surprise of the day this then the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.729
 code it's just to have the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.440
 skin of your character on the game of 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.420
 advent calendar on the lego website 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.650
 star wars 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.910
 so today is Sunday so he 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.110
 there is a new level but 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.240
 personally I do not go too much 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.710
 to be interested in this game since I have 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.690
 a little understood after the second of the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.970
 second level it's just a 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.310
 disguised advertising for microphones 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.220
 fighter so I was a little disappointed 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.720
 from that point anyway because I 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.239
 was waiting for me as I explained 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.590
 yesterday refereeing with my friends 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.959
 I was expecting more surprises 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.480
 kind of fitting instructions for 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.769
 the alternative model for example of 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.390
 posters possibly stuff to 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.019
 coloring for the kids finally a brief 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.060
 something a little more fun than an ad 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.709
 disguised for the fighter pickups what I 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.930
 mean more I do not really like the idea 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.280
 who behind classify themselves the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.720
 parents you said you already have 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.130
 have your parents kidnapped for you 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.239
 buy saplings for christmas for 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.910
 january you go again the 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.280
 have a look for the pickups done and that 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.750
 I admit that Japanese is a bit average 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.400
 especially that there reid notebooks before 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.470
 everyone kids are always 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.090
 in the process of their box is there when they 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.940
 go see them to mom I want 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.560
 this micro fighter is the parent he says 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.510
 bah shit I already had to buy the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.100
 gifts and everything here and there for january it 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.930
 is already he's gonna have some presents so 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.650
 in short I check a little bit of if I 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.650
 do not see 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.640
 if there is no problem at the 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.060
 print all that for now I do not 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.390
 see not so that's why I'm not going 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.940
 to do the level I'm not interested 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.410
 everything for the purpose that that's all 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.880
 just disguised pub for the 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.900
 new micro fighter range so but 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.230
 also and especially that there were others 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.070
 moments to advertise 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.040
 none other than going forward 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.890
 and frankly it's a bit nil 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.630
 frankly usually the I am 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.460
 easy I'm still critical about 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:42.040
 everything but there for a pure I am pretty 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.040
 criticism on this type 2 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.720
 there it's nothing it's my choice it has 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.260
 decided to drop a painting I 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.660
 do not know why 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.860
 good brief aida I find that a little dog 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.120
 more critical on it because 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.670
 frankly the approach is really 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.040
 to do to you instead that there is the side 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.020
 christmas festive fun oussalah thériault 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.210
 Ben side for the deposit the good 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.590
 resolution of the month of 2004 to make 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.930
 good resolutions for 2014 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.300
 you'll go straight away with the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.920
 fighter pickups I tell you with the toy 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.340
 fair that happens in February all that you have 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.930
 other moments to promote so 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.400
 product there does not do that a christmas day 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.830
 I honestly really appreciated 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.720
 means well yes it's a small detail 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.609
 for you it may sound stupid but 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.750
 it's true that I for example control 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.480
 millenium is we had small 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.040
 fun videos but in my opinion it's the end 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.450
 of May but at least it had a 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.970
 little contribution appears the spirit of Christmas 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.440
 with a festive and joyful side in 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.020
 classes is just a big pub 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.740
 disguised and we use a short game of 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.150
 promote it 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.669
 and frankly I think it's ridiculous 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.750
 anyway the final surprise we 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.400
 know what it's all about 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.900
 post with all the fighter pickups 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.790
 above as the site at the beginning of the dusit 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.320
 middle of lego star wars had bugged 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.610
 so that's what everybody does when he 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.510
 had finished the first level had 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.910
 access to post 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.169
 so that's really what's the 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.750
 purpose we know what is the surprise 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.510
 final and frankly it interests us 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:05.200
 means what frankly as I say 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.200
 I would have preferred to have more easily 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.240
 surprises from the instructions flows 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.639
 coloring game for kids 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.080
 all in all this kind of thing a good-looking 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.790
 of nothing there just for a figurine I 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.860
 do five minutes I think I exploded 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.310
 the record of oso killer so that's it 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.620
 had to arrive 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.060
 and as for - I'll meet you tomorrow 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.790
 for the opening of the sixth class 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.960
 located right here is so far left 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.100
 with the Dionysian I have a little bit 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.540
 broke the law and I 'm going to put a 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.979
 disk where the previous model like that 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.310
 it's a little prettier and more like 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:37.110
 who would say that I went well to 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.030
 thank you again for listening to me join 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.260
 about this lego star game at and 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.340
 as for drinking down to tomorrow for 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.570
 the opening of the 16th box here is by 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.190
 against it is really explained a blow 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.560
 why do they put all the numbers in 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.340
 brothel like that of m in order 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.840
 chronological 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.919
 in short it's just a small detail that 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.300
 I sing in two wheels marked with this 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.940
 Advent calendar I think it's 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.680
 just about everywhere so ben here is m 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.910
 all right I stop I made six 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.410
 minutes I think I really endow 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.270
 their western channels good it's not 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.830
 serious it was supposed to happen and I 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.830
 find tomorrow go to later
