00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
healthy it's hard for everybody but once

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.430 
healthy it's hard for everybody but once
you<00:03:20.220> get<00:03:20.370> going<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:21.540> takes<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.990> long<00:03:22.110> time<00:03:22.170> to

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
you get going it takes a long time to

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.850 
you get going it takes a long time to
see<00:03:22.710> the<00:03:22.860> change<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.490> I<00:03:23.910> know<00:03:23.970> that's<00:03:24.300> hard

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
see the change and I know that's hard

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.370 
see the change and I know that's hard
but<00:03:25.860> once<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.280> do<00:03:26.520> see<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.000> it's<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:28.050> becomes

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
but once you do see it it's it becomes

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.200 
but once you do see it it's it becomes
like<00:03:28.530> an<00:03:28.680> addiction<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.460> you<00:03:29.850> want<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.090> see

like an addiction like you want to see

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.940 
like an addiction like you want to see
more<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.810> want<00:03:30.990> it<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.230> get<00:03:31.380> better<00:03:31.590> and

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
more and you want it to get better and

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.000 
more and you want it to get better and
better<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.490> I<00:03:33.150> would<00:03:33.600> just<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.080> mean<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:34.860> hard

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
better so I would just I mean it's hard

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.400 
better so I would just I mean it's hard
for<00:03:35.250> everybody<00:03:35.490> to<00:03:36.210> get<00:03:36.300> started<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.260> that's

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
for everybody to get started and that's

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.290 
for everybody to get started and that's
the<00:03:37.950> hardest<00:03:38.280> thing<00:03:38.460> is<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.670> do<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.060> get

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
the hardest thing is to do this get

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.120 
the hardest thing is to do this get
started<00:03:39.390> but<00:03:39.870> once<00:03:39.990> you<00:03:40.200> get<00:03:40.530> started<00:03:40.710> then

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
started but once you get started then

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.340 
started but once you get started then
it's<00:03:41.280> hard<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.580> stop<00:03:41.850> it's<00:03:42.180> hard<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.450> go

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
it's hard to stop it's hard to go

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.370 
it's hard to stop it's hard to go
backwards<00:03:43.830> in<00:03:43.980> Reverse
