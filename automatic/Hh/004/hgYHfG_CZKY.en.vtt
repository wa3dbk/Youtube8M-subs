now<00:01:12.960> there's<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.260> couple<00:01:13.470> ways<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.190> some

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
now there's a couple ways to do it some

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.100 
now there's a couple ways to do it some
of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.940> old<00:01:15.030> Mason's<00:01:15.450> used<00:01:15.510> to<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.930> these

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
of the old Mason's used to have these

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.499 
of the old Mason's used to have these
old<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.560> they<00:01:16.680> call<00:01:16.860> repointing<00:01:17.640> chisels

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
old what they call repointing chisels

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
so we'll get our angle grinder going and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:44.000 
so we'll get our angle grinder going and
let's<00:02:29.069> start<00:02:29.250> cutting<00:02:29.519> some<00:02:29.790> water

grinder there I did have to use the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.490 
grinder there I did have to use the
chisel<00:02:55.849> and<00:02:56.090> Hammer<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.719> a<00:02:56.810> little<00:02:57.019> bit<00:02:57.140> but

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
chisel and Hammer just a little bit but

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.020 
chisel and Hammer just a little bit but
my<00:02:57.620> grinder<00:02:58.040> wouldn't<00:02:58.280> get<00:02:58.400> right<00:02:58.609> down<00:02:58.849> you

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
my grinder wouldn't get right down you

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
know it's a round grinder and it's a

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.259 
know it's a round grinder and it's a
square<00:03:00.709> hole<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.250> what<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.760> think<00:03:02.000> I'll<00:03:02.120> do

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
little bit so we don't move it once we

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.790 
little bit so we don't move it once we
joint<00:06:17.630> it<00:06:17.780> now<00:06:17.900> what<00:06:18.110> we<00:06:18.229> want<00:06:18.410> to<00:06:18.470> do<00:06:18.560> is<00:06:18.680> we
