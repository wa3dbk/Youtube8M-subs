phone<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.119> everyone<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.990> look

forward<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.680> purchase<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.480> that's<00:00:30.480> kind<00:00:30.779> of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
forward to purchase so that's kind of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.990 
forward to purchase so that's kind of
why<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> wanted<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> make<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.740> video<00:00:32.099> even

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
why I wanted to make this video even

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.540 
why I wanted to make this video even
though<00:00:33.300> some<00:00:33.989> people<00:00:34.260> already<00:00:34.469> think<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.160> s3

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
though some people already think the s3

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.520 
though some people already think the s3
is<00:00:35.610> better<00:00:35.880> than<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> iPhone<00:00:36.360> 5<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.170> think

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
is better than the iPhone 5 I do think

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.979 
is better than the iPhone 5 I do think
that's<00:00:37.710> highly<00:00:38.010> debatable<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> don't<00:00:39.840> want

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that's highly debatable but I don't want

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.470 
that's highly debatable but I don't want
to<00:00:40.079> argue<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.649> let's<00:00:41.309> go<00:00:41.520> back<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> point

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
to argue so let's go back to the point

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.560 
to argue so let's go back to the point
of<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.719> video<00:00:43.250> s4<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.579> what<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.360> in

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
of this video s4 so what will be in

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.200 
of this video s4 so what will be in

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
date now February 2013 is when many

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.650

that's<00:01:00.059> kind<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> typical<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:01.079> Samsung<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.739> do

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
that's kind of typical for Samsung to do

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.460 
that's kind of typical for Samsung to do
but<00:01:02.760> before<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.809> get<00:01:03.899> further<00:01:04.199> into

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
but before I really get further into

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050

running on Android will have a new
Exynos<00:01:43.829> processor<00:01:44.610> which<00:01:44.820> will<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.149> pretty

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
Exynos processor which will be pretty

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.980 
Exynos processor which will be pretty
nice<00:01:45.740> as<00:01:46.740> far<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> screen<00:01:47.700> size<00:01:47.970> goes<00:01:48.360> 5

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
bump from a 4.8 inch and you know this

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.980 
bump from a 4.8 inch and you know this
is<00:01:55.740> kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> another<00:01:56.159> thing<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.759> don't<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.840> if

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
is kind of another thing I don't know if

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.020 
is kind of another thing I don't know if
I<00:01:58.079> really<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.189> seems<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.549> every

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
I really like it just seems like every

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.480 
I really like it just seems like every
year<00:02:00.060> Samsung<00:02:01.020> keeps<00:02:01.560> making<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> screens

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
year Samsung keeps making the screens

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.999 
year Samsung keeps making the screens
bigger<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.149> bigger<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:04.380> already<00:02:04.710> gonna<00:02:04.860> be

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
bigger and bigger it's already gonna be

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.039 
bigger and bigger it's already gonna be
a<00:02:05.040> phablet<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.790> guess<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.479> consider<00:02:06.600> it

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
a phablet I guess you can consider it

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.169 
a phablet I guess you can consider it
since<00:02:07.799> it'll<00:02:08.069> be<00:02:08.160> pretty<00:02:08.310> much<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.729> between<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
since it'll be pretty much in between a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.290 
since it'll be pretty much in between a
tablet<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.140> phone<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.790> don't<00:02:12.090> even
