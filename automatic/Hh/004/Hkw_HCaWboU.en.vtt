straight<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.689> box<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.830> also<00:01:08.189> add

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
straight out of the box I can also add

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.780 
straight out of the box I can also add
that<00:01:08.909> ankle<00:01:09.750> supports<00:01:10.320> all<00:01:10.590> kinds<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.250> media

that ankle supports all kinds of media

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.870 
that ankle supports all kinds of media
so<00:01:12.060> yes<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.600> core<00:01:13.260> MIDI<00:01:13.590> compatible<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
so yes it is core MIDI compatible you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.899 
so yes it is core MIDI compatible you
can<00:01:15.090> use<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.509> with<00:01:15.750> any<00:01:15.780> keyboard<00:01:18.860> two

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
can use this with any keyboard two

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.340 
can use this with any keyboard two
oscillators<00:01:20.909> these<00:01:21.360> oscillators<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.080> be

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
oscillators these oscillators can be

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.300 
oscillators these oscillators can be
added<00:01:22.979> subtracted<00:01:23.610> or<00:01:24.650> multiplied<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
added subtracted or multiplied the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
added subtracted or multiplied the
oscillators<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.240> four<00:01:27.570> different<00:01:28.110> types<00:01:28.409> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
oscillators have four different types of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
oscillators have four different types of
waveforms<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.909> choose<00:01:30.119> from

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
waveforms that you can choose from

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.469 
waveforms that you can choose from
triangle<00:01:30.960> sawtooth<00:01:31.740> square<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.700> noise<00:01:33.119> as

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
triangle sawtooth square and noise as

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.060 
triangle sawtooth square and noise as
you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.590> round<00:01:34.860> button

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
you can see here you have a round button

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
you can see here you have a round button
saying<00:01:35.430> food<00:01:35.880> through<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.960> where<00:01:37.170> you

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
saying food through this is where you

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.770 
saying food through this is where you
turn<00:01:37.530> off<00:01:37.829> or<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.430> filter<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.540> off

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
turn off or on the filter with this off

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.810 
turn off or on the filter with this off
the<00:01:40.049> button<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.560> no<00:01:40.770> longer<00:01:41.040> lit<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.579> that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the button is no longer lit and that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.940 
the button is no longer lit and that
means<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.420> filter<00:01:42.840> will<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.110> bypassed<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
means the filter will be bypassed and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.399 
means the filter will be bypassed and
the<00:01:44.220> signal<00:01:44.640> will<00:01:44.670> run<00:01:45.060> cleanly<00:01:45.659> without<00:01:45.960> any

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the signal will run cleanly without any

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.980 
the signal will run cleanly without any
filter<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.159> these<00:01:47.610> sliders<00:01:48.030> here<00:01:48.570> are<00:01:48.810> the

filter on it these sliders here are the
face<00:01:49.290> offset<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.700> some<00:01:50.909> really

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
face offset you can get some really

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.569 
face offset you can get some really
interesting<00:01:51.540> fat<00:01:52.049> sounds<00:01:52.590> by<00:01:52.829> changing<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
value in these sliders when you have

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.160 
value in these sliders when you have
both<00:01:55.979> oscillators<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.390> will<00:01:57.659> shift<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
both oscillators on it will shift the
