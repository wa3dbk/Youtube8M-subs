00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.180
 hello people I am in a beautiful 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.630
 ask the party and I get 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.580
 Often, higher is just why me 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.100
 certain things supplement your yes 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.280
 do not say which things that is 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.080
 are with dietary supplements and 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.020
 yes why I have to do that at all 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.359
 if only this 80 10 10 nutrition this 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.070
 fruits based vegan lifestyle though 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.399
 it's the most natural and healthy 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.390
 The world is why I have to do that 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.059
 you probably already have the question 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.269
 often heard or posed to yourself and 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.390
 That's why I make very short video 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.199
 to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.309
 I have to say very briefly in advance I know 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.050
 not where that comes from 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.210
 but I am against this 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.999
 stubbornness against this narrow-mindedness 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.429
 to say I do not take any 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:05.000
 dietary supplement that is easy 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.080
 shit i said from the beginning 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.700
 Of course we are the best now 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.740
 possibility would be the best option 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.040
 as a people i said that my blood 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.260
 check regularly regularly test 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.850
 but let's be honest make the 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.190
 the little i personally know only one 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.950
 couple of people really every three months 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.400
 let the blood be tested or even still 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.400
 frequently 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.230
 Most of us do not do that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.650
 Often not practical is of course 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.360
 also a money question then and so on 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.260
 then you could say okay I'll leave it 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.700
 do not test blood 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.220
 dietary supplements 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.520
 if everything is ok fit it 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.440
 I do not need comment 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.760
 if, for example, if you have it 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.900
 For example, not everyone is doing it 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.400
 be one and a half years 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.770
 check in the blood recommend that 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.650
 live let your blood test yes that is 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.930
 the level you want 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.510
 Measuring yourself also feel natural 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.700
 how do i feel looking but too 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.290
 really again this quasi these 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.620
 this scientific component is pure 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.890
 I want to recommend everyone 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:13.180
 Two things and that is definitely 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:16.480
 b12 vitamin b12 either as a syringe 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.180
 directly with intrinsic factor i sport 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.120
 cheap or as a drop or as a 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.500
 I have pills now 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.730
 for example his thing or we 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.250
 both take the b12 and the year round 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.420
 So they know that too 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.360
 personal experiences that the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.850
 refill 12 memories 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.620
 and I have said it before 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.900
 does not do the normal tests of 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.630
 normal b12 standard test is easy 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.970
 without meaning if you want to know 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.980
 how the b12 swims around in the blood 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.590
 you want to know how much your body 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.110
 had taken and therefore is there 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.370
 simply the gold standard the ms method 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.540
 the methylonic acid , so to speak 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.500
 byproducts cause but arise 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.519
 I do not want to go into so much detail 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.440
 enter 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.380
 it could see if you accept that 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.140
 yes because it does not help in the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.820
 b12 bleed in highest concentration 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.280
 if you can not use that at all 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.530
 So here too, that's me sometimes 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.269
 That's why everyone sees it 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.739
 professional athletes of every sport and because 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.070
 they know exactly that phase and the 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.410
 even after the nms test, so to speak 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.209
 blood analyzed with regard to b12 only 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.260
 that has the meaningfulness of a cost 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.030
 little master about this standard 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.190
 rest you can in principle in the ton 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.610
 throw and the second thing second 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.980
 food supplement what we still have 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.390
 supplement her is just the vitamin d 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.840
 vitamin b3 which we take every six months 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.180
 So the wintertime when whichever is 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.130
 the statistics on nine out of ten German 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.430
 the 1 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.290
 in the maria and it is everywhere you are 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.480
 Are you alive again with hunger and 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.180
 now it is so summer wise we are 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.400
 out now we are going brown and 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.310
 since it is so I think that 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.010
 league and blood that fits that again 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.810
 So we have enough vitamin d get even 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.490
 very briefly these are the two things 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.710
 which we take and in general 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.970
 food supplements, for example 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.290
 if i am now looking after people though i do 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.000
 Of course I also speak personal 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.300
 recommendations from what you still need 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.310
 and everyone can do a thing now if 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.100
 he two persons are exactly alike 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.460
 eat exactly the same he can be 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.190
 that staff shortage has without and gets 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.670
 yes in the long term of even mineral 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.390
 for example, and person b does not and 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.030
 why is that? 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.130
 That's because of the prehistory everyone has 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.270
 another prehistory 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.220
 some people have some illnesses 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.290
 whatever there are so many 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.940
 you can do different things 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.040
 not flat rate say you do not need any 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.960
 supplement or just the one or two 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.600
 things these are the two things we do 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.620
 recommend to anyone and beyond 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.730
 you can check 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.740
 by blood test or or and and that 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.400
 I find it very important and again 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.740
 very good 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.150
 it is I am we are stuck 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.830
 convinced that this is the best more 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.490
 Mysterious low-fat fruits based 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.960
 vegan lifestyle but work of yours 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.880
 then war or who will get this 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.180
 all year 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.760
 ripe fruit investor organic quality and so on 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.070
 continue a certain variability who 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.870
 get the which nobody was making who 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.090
 then has the whole year fed should not 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.520
 our would actually be from november 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.810
 you would need 34 5000 again 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.650
 kilometer further south that one 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.230
 even a little sun at all 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.560
 yes get all the factors play 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.540
 In short, in short, it leads to that 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.460
 we are here in an unnatural environment 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.390
 then live traffic and there I have 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.860
 already said I do not want it 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.810
 so far that means we need 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.370
 because we are after and natural environment 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.050
 we simply need certain things 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.390
 supplementation with and that has nothing 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.850
 with an unnatural way of life too 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.780
 because we are not natural anymore 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.710
 be able to live 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.290
 i think know what is meant 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.220
 write your opinion to including on 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.170
 In any case, there is nothing worse 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.220
 as completely on 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.880
 dietary supplements such as 12 too 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.320
 I'll say no 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.900
 there you can really on the wall 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.540
 go along that you can pretty much that 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:19.040
 can go out really bad and right 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.630
 I do not recommend that that is ours 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.180
 opinion in my opinion how do you see that 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.710
 Room up to then take care 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.710
 cover show
