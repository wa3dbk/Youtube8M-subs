00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.970
 you know everyone today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.760
 you show how to do rubik's 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.730
 cube two by two by two otherwise 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.740
 called their shackles so is we there 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.540
 will have two algorithms to take that are 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.930
 really very simple which one with a 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.020
 technical memo that is really simple 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.160
 when those who know the chair is 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.609
 the host this will be the z 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.930
 frankly there's nothing very special about it 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.460
 so we start by doing the first 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.390
 phase so I'm sorry for the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.120
 first phase there is not really any 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:40.460
 technique you have to go on instinct 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.460
 we can search for cube without which the 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.300
 cgt as an easy method to do 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.620
 the white cask with the first 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.469
 crown yes because we have to do the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.430
 first crown my heart thank you 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.059
 you started no more than 1 cuba well 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.220
 placed here we see the first phase is 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.200
 made with the first crown to note 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.150
 after returning the leblanc cube to 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.680
 down with the first time and you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.810
 look if you already have fights 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.920
 well placed parrot 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.790
 so we look at this one is well placed 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.289
 because watching 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:38.330
 I am going towards orange orange 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:39.979
 there it is green green red red and so 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.110
 the fashion sphere above as it is 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.119
 the opposite of the white place above 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.679
 after the ball to you are in luck 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.659
 Finally, I am very lucky I 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:52.580
 will do it again because they are all 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:56.119
 well placed as the blue there laurange 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.799
 the embarrassment to the gifts I mount you one of the 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.470
 first algorithm that is super simple 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.539
 so that will be the double check with a 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.229
 chair that exactly the same so basically 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.340
 we are full of sun he starts from laps 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.459
 the chair turns 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.660
 the man comes back we even see the chair 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.069
 save on it and will be either so we do 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.190
 the same on the other side 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.790
 the man gets up late to let go of this 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.459
 fallen man returns here the chair 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.019
 put on and will be so the team 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.450
 are always well placed 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.450
 as we can see so we start again 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.140
 memorize their gorilla terribly 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.120
 technique that I told you so here is 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.870
 so we can have a phase 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:47.510
 created good with the crown 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.900
 here it is to create here so the phase 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.370
 good 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:56.120
 you put it on the left so the target at 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:00.230
 cube are good finally well placed is wrong 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:05.650
 oriented so they are good then we 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.650
 the fact is our colleague again 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:21.620
 understand we start again it's the guy 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:24.910
 licked and the girl the 2 strings not 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:34.780
 two there is also another habit ok 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:37.940
 so we will have for example an example 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.030
 we must replace before us so we 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:49.990
 start again with the first 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:51.980
 Well, I'm doing it fast so 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.430
 because the angles are always good 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.250
 names here so there for example you have 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.290
 you found a good contraband angle y 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.150
 am where any color by 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.650
 example it's good because there is the 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.570
 blue the white the green with the green the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.540
 red with red and yellow at 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.600
 on it so there you put up to 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:24.290
 right and by the way z then z is 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:25.730
 that's it then it's very simple in 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.610
 do that until the angles are good 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.100
 placed there there is one well spent so 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.790
 put him on the top right and you 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.650
 start again ball z 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.070
 so that's what I'll have 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.070
 square 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:49.930
 so 1 2 so that's exactly the same 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.330
 imagine that the face is done but that 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.060
 the English announces his forgiveness I had 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.430
 believed that with the light the round back st 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.410
 so no when we have only 1 that is good 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:07.660
 this is the one we start again 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:10.270
 top right we do the helpers then there 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.090
 all angles second and renÃ©e the red 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.670
 with the red the green and the glass and its 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.680
 devices so there exam a good angle 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.870
 as was at the bottom left and there you 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.260
 redo the man with the chair la 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.110
 chair what do you raise to the right so 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:30.130
 the man gets up by two turns h stump 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.140
 the man comes back he raises the chair will be 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.680
 so it's the same thing that makes you 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.680
 talk on the other side 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:43.180
 well here it is past done so here it is 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.700
 good if you have like that 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.950
 these kind cubic cube here and there and it 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.530
 so are opposed to it 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.370
 there you do the z so I have you 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.530
 shown previously 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.130
 you do zen to the cube will be 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.230
 handed over and normally right not moved these 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.570
 two there sissach candles and that he's 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.210
 like that you put them here 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:11.790
 so here we do the chair by double 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:15.850
 chain continues until it's over 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:18.550
 so these are you finished 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.169
 your crime here is so do not hesitate to 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.280
 subscribe an anti layman ax but 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.419
 also comments that you have not 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.240
 understood and he believes in burundi so 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:32.790
 here and if you make cubes to 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.790
 beaune and you all go
