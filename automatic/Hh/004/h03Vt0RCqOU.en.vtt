a<00:01:49.979> short<00:01:50.979> long<00:01:51.100> coming<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.490> system<00:01:51.789> and

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
a short long coming to the system and

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.699 
a short long coming to the system and
he's<00:01:52.000> got<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.390> lot<00:01:52.479> of<00:01:52.539> experience<00:01:53.050> and<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.289> has

responsive<00:01:56.440> rugby<00:01:56.709> and<00:01:56.770> especially<00:01:57.009> in<00:01:57.220> dry

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
responsive rugby and especially in dry

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.960 
responsive rugby and especially in dry
weather<00:01:57.399> it's<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.759> lot<00:01:57.880> easier<00:01:57.910> to<00:01:58.119> do

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
weather it's a lot easier to do

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.010 
weather it's a lot easier to do
