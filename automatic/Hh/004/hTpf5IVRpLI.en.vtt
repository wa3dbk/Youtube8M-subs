00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.510
 so all the people i greet you a video 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:14.059
 it is fear of the mac today 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:20.029
 michael 100 it is an amplifier 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:23.660
 classify the people he supposedly has 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.310
 200w each pnp 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.830
 it may also be good i appreciate it 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:37.829
 but only at 5 250 watts rms 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:39.989
 He does not bring a 100 watt box to the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.079
 so limit 200 watts can not on any 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.149
 If the case is correct, the quality can also be achieved 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:54.960
 to be desired here you can see for example 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:57.949
 those were the jacks for 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.230
 Unfortunately, speakers are always 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.210
 I had only had the two 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.420
 they also had to work 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.650
 If the people in those Replace 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.810
 I also take these well 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.590
 lower the clamp on and off 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.930
 That's why we or I had to 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:23.150
 replace the connections are whole 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.250
 Simple with cinch man once has the tv 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.350
 connection dvd and pc one can however 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.090
 x-any could then tv 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.070
 Now for example an mp3 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.840
 player connect protection class blabla 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.250
 What interests us is rather less 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.899
 And now there is the power cable 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.880
 I have the cable in front of me somehow 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:55.740
 we have another lost suit 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:56.670
 cable here matches in color yes yes completely 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.650
 normal 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:05.580
 power pick up with 230 volt 50 years 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.649
 we are now the same times 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.530
 hire and see you in the next 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.660
 clip so there we are again 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.280
 I 've connected it now 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.350
 a canton + l boxx is already a very 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.819
 old model still works 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.019
 perfectly has 50 watts rms and with 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.470
 connected to a laptop 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.600
 I have the front aux connection before 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.709
 to forget 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.269
 I will, of course, in order to 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.000
 Connection options and here you can 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.470
 also the modes adjust either front 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.239
 dvd pc tv and pc 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.510
 now, of course, is now on the front 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.269
 will adjust around this cable and 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.510
 this laptop the amplifier with one 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.260
 signal to celebrate we have one now 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.319
 song always picked free stonebridge 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.910
 Of course, job speed miss band knows too 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.859
 I pronounced that correctly 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.910
 but anyway 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.239
 I'll take a look now 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.239
 do 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.340
 hey 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:15.220
 50 sees it at the pc and we do it now 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.220
 here, too, about 75 percent 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.270
 100 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.990
 So I know has no problem with 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:46.390
 the amplifier on this land and 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:49.340
 train to 50 percent and that's what 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.430
 ms castle which actually hung up nicely 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.670
 are now probably a dispute under 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:58.400
 problems with the loud but the 50th 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.830
 Watts do not get lost 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.080
 maximum but then I stayed 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:08.810
 the leds here whet the white 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:14.120
 stem well in the video proof video but the 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:17.000
 Brings bigger box is the mechanics will 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:22.120
 he if you can operate him if you 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.120
 a small at a small power 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.830
 You can not say more about this except is 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.520
 first of all a relatively good one 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:35.360
 years brings back but stayed the 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:39.500
 Achievement is just pathetic that one 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:43.780
 one expects one can buy on amazon 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.780
 and yes you are not
