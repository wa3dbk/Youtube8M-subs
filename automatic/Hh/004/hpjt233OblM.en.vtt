00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.180 

that's<00:02:14.070> all<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.000> really<00:02:15.630> need<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.990> know

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
that's all you really need to know

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.130 
that's all you really need to know
mainly<00:02:18.440> it's<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.530> great<00:02:19.770> vacuum<00:02:20.540> great<00:02:21.540> buy<00:02:21.690> but

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
mainly it's a great vacuum great buy but

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.560 
mainly it's a great vacuum great buy but
uh<00:02:23.240> think<00:02:24.240> this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.050> pretty<00:02:25.230> good<00:02:25.350> vacuum

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
uh think this is pretty good vacuum

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.530 
uh think this is pretty good vacuum
I<00:02:28.400> don't<00:02:29.400> like<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.760> they<00:02:29.910> say<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.210> doesn't

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
I don't like it they say it doesn't

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.900 
I don't like it they say it doesn't
matter<00:02:30.690> but<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.320> brushes<00:02:31.710> are<00:02:31.860> sharp<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.160> but

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
matter but the brushes are sharp so but

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.400 
matter but the brushes are sharp so but
I<00:02:32.940> think<00:02:33.180> they<00:02:33.300> get<00:02:33.420> stiffer<00:02:33.840> as<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.200> spins

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
I think they get stiffer as it spins

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.300 
I think they get stiffer as it spins
fancy<00:02:35.300> but<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.660> was<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.960> chicken<00:02:37.350> /<00:02:37.890> review

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
fancy but that was the chicken / review
