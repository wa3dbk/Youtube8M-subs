00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
and I'm doing that just using some water

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.879 
and I'm doing that just using some water
and<00:04:44.090> since<00:04:45.090> there's<00:04:45.330> not<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.660> lot<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.080> contact

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
and since there's not a lot of contact

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.879 
and since there's not a lot of contact
area<00:04:47.310> between<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.850> flower<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:49.350> cake<00:04:49.650> you

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
area between the flower and the cake you

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.439 
area between the flower and the cake you
might<00:04:50.039> have<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.340> hold<00:04:50.520> them<00:04:50.820> on<00:04:51.000> for<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.330> little

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
might have to hold them on for a little

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.000 
might have to hold them on for a little
while<00:04:51.600> so<00:04:52.169> you<00:04:52.229> might<00:04:52.530> have<00:04:52.650> to<00:04:52.740> hold<00:04:52.830> the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
while so you might have to hold the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.740 
while so you might have to hold the
flower<00:04:53.190> on<00:04:53.430> for<00:04:53.669> about<00:04:53.820> 30<00:04:54.120> seconds<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:54.690> that

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
flower on for about 30 seconds so that

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.200 
flower on for about 30 seconds so that
way<00:04:54.930> they<00:04:55.080> stay<00:04:55.500> but<00:04:56.220> once<00:04:56.370> they're<00:04:56.580> glued<00:04:56.970> on

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
way they stay but once they're glued on

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.760 
way they stay but once they're glued on
they're<00:04:57.570> not<00:04:57.599> likely<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:58.080> fall<00:04:58.380> off<00:04:58.590> they're

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
they're not likely to fall off they're

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.670 
they're not likely to fall off they're
likely<00:04:59.039> to<00:04:59.130> just<00:04:59.280> stay<00:04:59.639> in<00:04:59.940> place<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:01.229> I'm<00:05:01.500> just

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
likely to just stay in place so I'm just

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.649 
recreate it here and I made a matching
teacup<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.830> since<00:05:38.370> it's<00:05:38.550> a<00:05:38.669> 3d<00:05:39.090> cake<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.570> it's

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
teacup so since it's a 3d cake and it's

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:40.820 
teacup so since it's a 3d cake and it's
going<00:05:39.780> to<00:05:39.870> go<00:05:39.990> all<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.229> way<00:05:40.260> around<00:05:40.380> you're

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
going to go all the way around you're

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.170 
going to go all the way around you're
going<00:05:40.919> to<00:05:41.010> want<00:05:41.130> to<00:05:41.190> cover<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.669> whole<00:05:41.880> cake<00:05:42.120> in

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
going to want to cover the whole cake in

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.180 
going to want to cover the whole cake in
flowers<00:05:42.810> and<00:05:43.020> butterflies<00:05:43.169> and<00:05:43.860> everything

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
flowers and butterflies and everything

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.500 
flowers and butterflies and everything
so<00:05:44.310> that<00:05:44.400> way<00:05:44.520> when<00:05:44.669> you<00:05:44.760> turn<00:05:44.940> it<00:05:45.150> around<00:05:45.210> you

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
so that way when you turn it around you

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.960 
so that way when you turn it around you
can<00:05:45.690> really<00:05:45.930> see<00:05:46.169> all<00:05:47.010> the<00:05:47.280> flowers<00:05:47.460> and<00:05:47.849> all

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.310 
can really see all the flowers and all
the<00:05:48.090> different<00:05:48.360> areas<00:05:48.630> of<00:05:48.659> the<00:05:48.750> cake<00:05:48.990> and<00:05:49.199> it's

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
the different areas of the cake and it's

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.540 
the different areas of the cake and it's
it's<00:05:49.710> quite<00:05:49.889> stunning<00:05:50.310> I<00:05:51.710> had<00:05:52.710> so<00:05:53.130> much<00:05:53.310> fun

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
it's quite stunning I had so much fun

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.969 
it's quite stunning I had so much fun
making<00:05:53.820> my<00:05:54.120> teapot<00:05:54.599> cake<00:05:54.930> I<00:05:55.199> mean<00:05:55.710> I<00:05:55.919> think

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
making my teapot cake I mean I think

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.980 
making my teapot cake I mean I think
it's<00:05:56.310> actually<00:05:56.490> probably<00:05:57.180> one<00:05:57.810> of<00:05:57.840> my

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
it's actually probably one of my

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.719 
it's actually probably one of my
favorite<00:05:58.380> cakes<00:05:58.560> that<00:05:58.710> I've<00:05:58.919> ever<00:05:59.099> made<00:05:59.460> just

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
favorite cakes that I've ever made just

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.760 
favorite cakes that I've ever made just
the<00:06:00.270> fact<00:06:00.449> that<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.750> was<00:06:00.840> three-dimensional

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
the fact that it was three-dimensional

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.469 
the fact that it was three-dimensional
it<00:06:02.010> is<00:06:02.190> really<00:06:02.520> big<00:06:02.699> and<00:06:02.970> it<00:06:03.090> was<00:06:03.240> actually

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
it is really big and it was actually

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.050 
it is really big and it was actually
kind<00:06:04.020> of<00:06:04.080> looked<00:06:04.440> like<00:06:04.710> a<00:06:05.070> teapot<00:06:05.669> with<00:06:06.030> a

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
kind of looked like a teapot with a

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.730 
kind of looked like a teapot with a
little<00:06:06.389> matching<00:06:06.539> teacup<00:06:07.199> I<00:06:07.349> think<00:06:07.560> it<00:06:07.650> was

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
little matching teacup I think it was

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.189 
little matching teacup I think it was
gorgeous<00:06:08.039> it's<00:06:08.610> actually<00:06:09.000> not<00:06:09.270> that<00:06:09.300> hard<00:06:09.990> it

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
gorgeous it's actually not that hard it

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.219 
gorgeous it's actually not that hard it
looks<00:06:10.229> a<00:06:10.590> lot<00:06:10.710> more<00:06:10.770> complicated<00:06:11.010> than

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
looks a lot more complicated than

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.230 
looks a lot more complicated than
so<00:06:12.710> I<00:06:12.740> hope<00:06:13.039> that<00:06:13.070> you<00:06:13.280> guys<00:06:13.370> get<00:06:13.639> a<00:06:13.699> shot<00:06:14.060> and
