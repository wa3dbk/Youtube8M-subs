00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.630
 and with this we salute the vine we abandon the insects the towns 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.730
 of the particular to pass however to another problem that that of a bacterium 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.510
 pseudomonas that is causing serious damage from real big problems to tv it 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.619
 what the situation is here 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.820
 is currently the situation with regard to the province of Ferrara 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.019
 quiet enough we don't have any very strong attacks 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.850
 so something has been reported 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.330
 something was found especially in particular on new new plants 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.750
 plants 2011 2010 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.670
 after all 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.040
 touches arroba 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.480
 for that hour on which I wanted to attract attention at this time for everyone 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.659
 those who have tivoli installations 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:49.199
 and control over the facilities and where it is needed right now 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.149
 go check the state of the vegetation if the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.320
 star of the detached mallards or demons that are rustling 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.580
 even not in the hottest hours 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.500
 if they were present on the beautiful leaves, a necrotic ax 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.420
 particular that have never been noticed in previous years and it is 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.030
 need to make the report to our service so we can 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.440
 go for a check and possibly go nini locate 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.080
 foulard situation is and of presence of disease 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.620
 at this moment we also see some on the side of the liquid that comes out of the 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.710
 trunk from the buds pro from the plants in general 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.600
 in general at this time it is no longer visible in the presence of it given 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.840
 also say why the weather conditions 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.509
 I am no longer in favor of this, so the thing to go to afo caledar 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.750
 and attention is precisely the leaf spots and possibly this 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.530
 shoots withering 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.530
 and about va for we just heard what happened in germany with 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.189
 the Escherichia coli also understood this bacterium 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.070
 we are talking about pseudomonas another bacterium for which it is better to remember that 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.570
 the use of antibiotics is absolutely prohibited 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.060
 certainly even in the media, as in the pear, it is absolutely forbidden to use it 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.419
 of you me antibiotics for which 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.970
 I remind everyone that 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.109
 in this case they must never be used 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.659
 and for the companies affected by kiwi bacteria the region 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.450
 Emilia-Romagna has allocated for 2011 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.180
 one million euros together with other indirect support measures but 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.129
 bacteriosis a national problem that we will hear the statements about that 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.400
 minister of agriculture francesco saverio romano is released last 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.769
 week during his visit to ferrara
