00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
University it's actually very different

here and my previous study experiences

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.120 
here and my previous study experiences
in<00:01:38.399> Ireland<00:01:38.810> they<00:01:39.810> were<00:01:39.869> basically<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.039> know

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
in Ireland they were basically you know

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.849 
in Ireland they were basically you know
the<00:01:41.340> lecturer<00:01:41.759> gave<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> lecture<00:01:42.539> and<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.710> know

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
the lecturer gave a lecture and you know

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:45.620 
the lecturer gave a lecture and you know
student<00:01:44.280> participation<00:01:44.820> wasn't<00:01:45.359> really

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
student participation wasn't really

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.800 
student participation wasn't really
encouraged<00:01:46.109> or<00:01:46.350> expected<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.549> here<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:47.969> Lund

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
encouraged or expected but here in Lund

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
encouraged or expected but here in Lund
University<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.679> seems<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.159> group<00:01:50.399> work<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
University it seems that group work and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.330 
University it seems that group work and
student<00:01:52.020> participation<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:53.189> only

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
student participation is not only

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.099 
student participation is not only
expected<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.210> central<00:01:54.539> part<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
expected but it's a central part of the

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.109 
expected but it's a central part of the
course<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.310> huge<00:01:56.549> difference<00:01:56.729> I

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
course so that's a huge difference I

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.399 
course so that's a huge difference I
think<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.539> student<00:01:58.130> what<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.159> learned<00:01:59.700> is

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
think for a student what I learned is

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.620 
think for a student what I learned is
it's<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.630> individual

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
it's not here it's not individual

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.810 
it's not here it's not individual
competition<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.859> more<00:02:05.460> about

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
competition it's not more about

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.359 
competition it's not more about
collaboration<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.899> our<00:02:07.200> teamwork<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
collaboration and our teamwork and

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.770 
collaboration and our teamwork and
I<00:02:09.399> like<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.360> education<00:02:10.840> system<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:12.390> all<00:02:13.390> I
