 market 103 years since December 1911 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.980
 and its name comes from the derivation of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.080
 two Latin words that mean 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.359
 snow for the color that this cream has 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.820

 highlighted and for those who may never 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.160

 over the days you will see our 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.050
 less marked eyelet and less purple other 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.760
 of uses is for hydration in the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.039
 face above all is indicated for 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.989
 dry skins although they can also 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.090
 use it mixed and oily skin 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.949
 when they are dry but above all 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.259
 for dry skin we can use it 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.210
 as a cream and it will work for you 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.399
 wonder can also use it 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.259
 both mixed skins and dry skins 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.789
 Mask mode is a mask 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.399
 great to moisturize that would be 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.070
 for half an hour on our face one 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.200
 thick layer and then we will remove it 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.329
 dry skin both during the day and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.069
 night there are many people of certain 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.380
 age they say is the best cream 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.149
 anti-wrinkle they have tried is to say that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.479
 if many people agree with this opinion 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.189
 it's because it really takes effect 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.990
 another of the uses we can give to 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.299
 Our cream nivea is to put 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.340
 our pretty feet to hydrate them 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.649
 I advise you before we go to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.170
 sleep this you can do twice to 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.149
 the week or the feet are smeared well 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.929
 with 'no idea' 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.119
 later you get some 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.649
 socks and the bed when you 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.590
 get up and go see what he loses 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.239
 moisturized precious soft yes yes about 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.220
 everything when we have an event that 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:00.840
 we want to go with some beautiful sandals 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.450
 and we are going to show all our feet 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.310
 let's go to a wedding or a dinner or please 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.640
 makes this treatment because it's going to 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.110
 leave some incredible feet and this use is 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.970
 best known to deal with 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.890
 diaperitis that is neither more nor less than 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.470
 the rubs that produce the diapers 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.930
 In the baby's culet we put a 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.580
 little bit of cream nivea and we'll see how 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.620
 right away you will pass these 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.960
 chafing we can also use the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.330
 post shaved or affected we are going to 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.970
 put a finite capita on the area 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.580
 that we have filed or we have shaved and 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.460
 this skin is going to avoid those rednesses those 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.709
 little red dots will be testa and soft 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.080
 one of the most hidden uses and also of 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.420
 those that work best is to use the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.730
 cream nivea to hydrate our 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.680
 hair is much better than many 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.480
 moisturizers that are sold for 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.300
 hair and this is because it contains 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.400
 the cedit which is a very very component 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.370
 nutritious especially for hair that 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.440
 they are in three for the dry damaged by 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.290
 chemical treatments like dyes 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.690
 permanent wicks let's make us a 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.209
 mask twice a week with 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.730
 cream nivea if we can we will add 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.280
 a splash of virgin olive oil 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.550
 extra we remove it and we're going to put 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.440
 this mask for our hair 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.630
 all in the most dry areas I 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.300
 I recommend means to ends for a 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.830
 hour or you return with a film and now 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.570
 you are going to remove it by washing your 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.000
 hair as usual I recommend 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.980
 two shampoo passes is that smooth 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.290
 bright and it will also help us 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.300
 hair straightening and frizz to keep 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.280
 wright another use we can give you is 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.590
 as an anxiety for our eyes 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.930
 I recommend this to be used only for 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.730
 nights is very good to treat our 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.460
 crow's feet before going to sleep 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.950
 let's put a good capital 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.750
 massage by our crow's feet if 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.030
 you also want to treat the ojera that does not 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.920
 I told you at the beginning we're going to put 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.750
 by our crow's feet and our 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.790
 opera when we get up we're going to 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.650
 back to massage the area where the 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.630
 night we have put no idea 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.480
 we will finish our face and we will get 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.000
 our usual outline in a little day 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.040
 notice the results is that very powerful 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.580
 against this end another of his wonderful 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.480
 uses is to use the nivea cream as 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.820
 make-up remover if we do not have 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.820
 make-up remover or just want to 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.680
 Make up with cream nivea 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.690
 we can do it without any problem 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.760
 because to remove make- up until 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.190
 waterproof makeup what are more 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.470
 resistant simply by passing a 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.440
 little cream on the area make up 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.720
 the eyes the face to the lips and throw 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.640
 with a cotton is to know what skin so 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.640
 hydrated handle not using the 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.800
 make - up artist and quick cream 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.690
 No idea is the most recommended premium for 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.610
 dermatologists especially for 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.760
 pregnant women in the area of 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.710
 belly to prevent stretch marks is true 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.380
 that there is no cream in the world 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.530
 able to eliminate a stretch and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.960
 installed but yes that cream capable of 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.870
 prevent stretch marks between it is the 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.200
 most powerful of diary is the cream ni 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.690
 idea 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.630
 so if you are pregnant please 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.940
 prevent stretch marks with no idea cream 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.920
 which is the cheapest the most 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.260
 moisturizer and the one that will protect 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.120
 against this another one of the uses and I this 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.120
 I see it one of the most important of the 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.910
 nivea cream is for whitening and moisturizing 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.409
 our elbows and knees have a great 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.539
 moisturizing power 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.849
 therefore we can give ourselves in our 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.249
 elbows and on our knees when the 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.289
 let's see dry because we can also 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.269
 use it to hydrate all our 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.550
 body subsequently to our fight 

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:36.409
 they have the role of bleach in 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.719
 areas that have to get darker to 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:40.759
 very good levels to hydrate our 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:43.580
 cuticles what you have to do is 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:46.219
 put a little cream of nivea in each 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.589
 cuticle let's wait a minute and 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.389
 let's massage well they stay 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:52.309
 well hydrated cuticles too 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.499
 We can use it to remove the 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:56.419
 Cuticles are going to hydrate them from a 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:58.699
 stick of orange tree we will retire towards 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.129
 back one of the best-known uses of 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.169
 the nivea cream is to hydrate our 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.360
 hands with giving them a coat several times 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.029
 a day especially in the hands of this very 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.979
 dry we will notice some very very hands 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.929
 hydrated will help prevent 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.699
 aging and spots in our 

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:16.129
 hands a cream that will help us 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.839
 very much and we have burned a little 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.989
 let's apply on those burns 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:22.719
 over those red areas cream level that 

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:25.759
 zone is going to regenerate quickly 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:27.080
 cream nivea is very good healing 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.840
 where we have a pike 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.930
 and we're just going to give you cream nivea 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.360
 three times a day and easy and it's going to 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.009
 gradually reduce this you have to 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.750
 be constant because you are going to see 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.120
 result and you have seen that the cream 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.669
 nivea has many, many, many uses 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.189
 I have discovered those who use and 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:48.169
 what I considered most important is 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:51.110
 a cream that can not miss in any 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:53.419
 you are very economically very much to me 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.099
 particularly its smell I love it 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.870
 remember also when I was a girl 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:59.240
 when my mother put it on me when I arrived from 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.300
 the beach or when he was doing his nails and in 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.830
 Nivea cream house and it puts a cream 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.409
 What is your smell brings me so many 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.150
 memories and I have not stopped buying 

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:11.030
 I use it for many, many, many 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.770
 things I wanted to discover its uses and very 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.349
 Simple to find that it sells 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.259
 worldwide that you do not leave please 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:19.819
