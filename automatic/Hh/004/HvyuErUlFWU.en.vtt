00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.850
 ah 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.850
 i 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.880
 in this video teach within the 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.010
 song help me with you 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.950
 we need the field enter this number 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 10 and if they do not have they can improvise with 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.250
 a pencil and a league that moors 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.000
 they put 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.530
 and we start using 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.020
 on the second string 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.020
 I remove after the test in fret 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.860
 the first 3 would be like this 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.330
 22 hits in the fifth 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.710
 then the third 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.320
 them in 1 and you bring me 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.720
 then 001 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.000
 and a second behind the third with the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.000
 third string would be that part yes 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.520
 do not 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.640
 and then you come 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.579
 3 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.579
 then the third 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.910
 but in the second 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.060
 and then we had 1 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.460
 in 6 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.460
 i 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.460
 ah 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.370
 66 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.000
 simplified 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:15.000
 33 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 1 and 13 again that part 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.640
 the part of the beginning is repeated 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.510
 and also a little bit 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.330
 What is it 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.630
 second back of the third 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.480
 the trance 0 of the second 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.020
 13 of the second and the second second 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.020
 chopped 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.180
 and then this part nothing 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.640
 when it 's a little 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.689
 16 55 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.609
 Y 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.850
 353 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.660
 to finish is this 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.659
 is a minor for those who do not know is 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.910
 fret 0 while you second after 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.790
 second fret 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.790
 and we play from the second to the 4th 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.810
 presents in this part 73 of the first 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.569
 and second string again 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.739
 two 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.739
 we play them a funk 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.650
 It is a complete end if it is used in account 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.840
 we can put all the paper or really 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.970
 no we do not need we do not need these 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.090
 33 strings 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.989
 would be 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.340
 allow the second and second thirds 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.269
 third 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.229
 interceptase of the 4th 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.229
 and we follow nothing 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.750
 then when we see the sea 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.750
 we really just need a finger 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:39.340
 the second of the fourth string and we do 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.340
 we went up from the second to the fourth 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.100
 so far we have this 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.860
 simply moving from the second 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.860
 rope 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.300
 yes 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.659
 tremendous 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.039
 is that they do not know is first while you 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.039
 centras 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.239
 then we put 1 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.320
 to those who do not know how to treat the Ceron 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.270
 prime 330 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.650
 2. 3 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.650
 and then we finish with this 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:27.930
 what would be the fret 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.669
 in two days 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.669
 this part again goes on like this 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.040
 all together again 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.650
 we can 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.390
 and 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.009
 in the back of the three 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.520
 ropes 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:17.520
 and 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.770
 good would be less than instead of rising 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.770
 once 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.650
 we can upload more 2 can be said 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.650
 A) Yes 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.110
 but good 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.720
 also then we upload it twice 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.440
 is basically we play we play a 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.520
 little bit more with the ropes 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.520

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.940
