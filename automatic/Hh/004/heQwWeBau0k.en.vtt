00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.640
 continuing further with the wire of 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.820
 same color always remembering that if you 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.900
 have the same color yarn 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.790
 you do not need to worry about the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.160
 shut up with stop working 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.330
 to do the new one anyway you can 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.220
 straight and straight 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.570
 Good, now we need to play and if the 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.250
 our work that's right up here 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.190
 here behind 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.379
 so that's it, pick up your needle come here 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.519
 behind she looks wherever she passes 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.449
 that I did 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:58.170
 Come on, come on, come on, see. Come back. 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.589
 back there again look here 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.610
 I laci and bring this wire, I just bought 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:11.830
 out and so o straight and straight you 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.930
 is about to go through the little chain that 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.560
 You had your work back there. 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.350
 Now you see, you just played right. 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.460
 your needle in another direction to 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.350
 other location 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:31.120
 do 8 chains one two three four 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.250
 five six seven and eight 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.470
 there if because you will work the point 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.520
 High and you see, you can see here 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.710
 high that you were previously when 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:48.520
 You made the boats, okay? Pass the needle. 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.470
 ahead of your high point and play there 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.950
 back again, just see what 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.940
 happened there the cup pulls thrown to 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.080
 out 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.170
 see only there again and finish two 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.990
 there if again and finish 2 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.510
 You just make a ring in the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.369
 behind 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:15.760
 now there are six little chains no more 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:19.209
 eight one two three four five and six 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.040
 here comes the next high point here 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.290
 also from here 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:30.549
 back there back loop and pull it out 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.110
 grace concludes lacquer 2 and 2 and concludes 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.720
 so we'll do in the outline 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.480
 only I got here at the end of the event 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.490
 again here at the beginning that I go 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.300
 I'll get closer, I'll get closer. 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.420
 I'll tell 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.270
 see only one chain two chains 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.060
 lines and in the third I'm going to 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.760
 I 'm going to throw a needle and I 'm going to 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.190
 instead only low point locking the 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.980
 my touch ring 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.840
 come on then do the back is 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.680
 similar to what we did here in the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.680
 front 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.260
 change only a little bit o the first thing 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.709
 a low around the first 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.190
 bow fillet and a half point high 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.190
 around the laci and high point 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.300
 Now we're going to work seven times. 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.140
 the high point around this first 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.170
 bow 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:31.489
 I'm in the third or fourth 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:35.060
 now the fifth and sixth and ending 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:38.030
 here with the seventh high point a steel 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.680
 again because I'll make a half point 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:47.120
 high is to end a low 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:50.690
 Look there, it 's right here and look at it. 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:55.090
 made my petal from the back 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.090
 Let's do the same around Toddynho.
