00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.359
 hello everyone good today I bring you a 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.360
 tutorial on how to solve the error of 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.720
 transmission in the game of naruto stones 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:18.039
 3 and well the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.580
 is to download the update which is 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.980
 the 1.00 5 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.760
 I'm going to leave some of these links in the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.850
 description 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.180
 and good when you have downloaded this 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.180
 archive 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.230
 it should be a compressed file 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.110
 like this which we are going to extract good 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.890
 I already did 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.870
 and we will keep these files what 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.870
 let's do is execute this file 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.579
 we proceed to install the update 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.949
 we give next here we look for the route 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.010
 where the game is installed we give 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.380
 next and then we give install I do not 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.079
 I do it because I already have it installed 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.080
 and good 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:10.570
 after this we proceed to copy that 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.570
 file to the game directory 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.180
 in that file I really do not know why 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.460
 is 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.159
 however, the idea occurred to me 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.609
 to stick it and good on the game route 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.280
 after this we will go to the height 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:31.900
 of tumblr which is in English and we're going 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.040
 to download the multiplayer fix version 2 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.310
 well we click here 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.930
 and we click yes 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.930
 will begin to download a file 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.609
 a compressed file and which is going to 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.050
 leave these three files already when they 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.900
 let's bring good 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.650
 we take these three files and the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.710
 we copy in the game directory 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.270
 I do not do it because I already have them 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.810
 well when these files are 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.810
 here we proceed to run the game 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.530
 well already in the game menu we proceed 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.340
 to look for a game in any of 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.069
 its game modes 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.580
 I'm going to put the general map to see if there 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.580
 something 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.040
 and we hope that our positive 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.900
 then we wait for the game 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.739
 charge and good while charging I'm going to 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.739
 pause the video 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.610
 I think yes 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.440
 and well, as you can see, it will crash 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.650
 had vision 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:09.140
 because it conditioned everything and well this has 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.140
 been everything I hope this tutorial
