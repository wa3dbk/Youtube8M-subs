00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.690 
you project maybe four or five years
from<00:03:43.630> now<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.989> may<00:03:44.019> be<00:03:44.170> possible<00:03:44.579> indeed<00:03:45.579> it's

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
from now it may be possible indeed it's

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.309 
from now it may be possible indeed it's
quite<00:03:45.819> feasible<00:03:46.030> and<00:03:46.480> for<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:46.930> surgeon<00:03:47.290> to

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
quite feasible and for a surgeon to

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.890 
quite feasible and for a surgeon to
operate<00:03:47.680> on<00:03:47.829> a<00:03:48.069> patient<00:03:48.130> totally<00:03:48.940> remotely<00:03:49.389> so

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
operate on a patient totally remotely so

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.390 
operate on a patient totally remotely so
the<00:03:50.049> surgeon<00:03:50.350> will<00:03:50.500> be<00:03:50.620> located<00:03:50.769> somewhere

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
the surgeon will be located somewhere

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.190 
the surgeon will be located somewhere
else<00:03:51.579> in<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.790> world<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.180> can<00:03:52.810> commit<00:03:53.049> it

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
else in the world and can commit it

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.900 
else in the world and can commit it
through<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.500> internet<00:03:53.829> possibly<00:03:54.280> with<00:03:54.730> some

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
through the internet possibly with some

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.420 
through the internet possibly with some
robotic<00:03:55.209> assistance<00:03:55.810> can<00:03:56.410> actually<00:03:56.799> feel<00:03:57.250> the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
robotic assistance can actually feel the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.370 
robotic assistance can actually feel the
operation<00:03:57.880> as<00:03:58.269> they<00:03:58.540> are<00:03:58.660> seeing<00:03:59.109> it<00:03:59.200> on<00:03:59.260> the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
operation as they are seeing it on the

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.280 
operation as they are seeing it on the
screen<00:04:00.329> creating<00:04:01.329> a<00:04:01.389> new<00:04:01.540> simulator<00:04:01.810> like

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
screen creating a new simulator like

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.710 
screen creating a new simulator like
this<00:04:02.470> may<00:04:02.680> not<00:04:02.859> be<00:04:02.920> brain<00:04:03.400> surgery<00:04:03.970> but<00:04:04.600> it

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
this may not be brain surgery but it

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.069 
this may not be brain surgery but it
really<00:04:04.959> is<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.380> next<00:04:05.620> best<00:04:05.769> thing
