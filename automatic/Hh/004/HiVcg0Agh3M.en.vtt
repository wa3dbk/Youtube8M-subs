00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 the previous gold cup always repeated 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.569
 alignment the only thing in the first 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.680
 match to the second there was a player who 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.120
 I was not in the first one I was a starter 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.690
 as a tower roman that did not have the first 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.890
 and appeared in the second appeared in the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.800
 second because 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.080
 We were with Machado who was in 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.410
 any party but I always thought 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.119
 in the previous glass 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.240
 I was suddenly making a change but it was 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.610
 because for some reason 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.810
 but always land nations is not what 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.750
 same play the tie every two 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.210
 months to war every four days a match 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.280
 every week the same as the golden cup 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.190
 I almost always repeat relationships when 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.870
 we play very close matches like each 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.129
 two months the player maybe today is 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.430
 well within two months it 's fine 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.030
 then there 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.930
 if we change tournament thermometer almost 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.720
 I always repeat neither 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.520
 if the party was beyond that 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.620
 we had 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.870
 a man over 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.000
 it was something balanced beyond 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.290
 we had a little more the ball 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.210
 that of Martinique but we were missing something 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.310
 I thought we were missing something was missing 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.000
 at that time and I think it was something of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.040
 freshness we do not take Alberto quintero a 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.380
 a little worn because he had done 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.270
 a great first part and I think it was the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.640
 just time to enter a 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.080
 player like jairo who has young but 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.940
 he has conditions and he has shown 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.440
 in a built- in connection to be able 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.450
 participate in a game as demanding as 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.450
 the one who was playing here is that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.500
 and well you have to congratulate him because 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.120
 frankly he sees me 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.850
 it was what we had talked about afterwards 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.980
 Mexico's game that victory was going to 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.140
 be very important as long as it 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.180
 considers an important result today the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.640
 team you have to congratulate it was delivered to 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.140
 maximum work the whole party we knew 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.520
 it was going to be difficult 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.410
 kingfisher and that has a large selection 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.110
 great players who play in big 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.390
 teams also in European football 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.369
 but Panama behaved very well played 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.410
 seriously played with humility and demonstrate 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.390
 between the field a complicated opponent in his 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.039
 moment if we knew it was going to be 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.090
 complicated we had seen the videos 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.920
 of the cup of them in the Caribbean of what 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.860
 individual who are like as as a team 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.780
 and the collective if we know that it is a 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.850
 strong team a caribbean team but 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.650
 the team knew how to interpret that played very 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.170
 come and thank God things are coming 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.270
 coming out 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.300
 is the 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.860
 Music motivating the team 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.310
 identifies a lot with the music too 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.690
 we use it to clear the mind for 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.760
 relax a little and good 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.980
 fortunately always 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.130
 we share with good music sings 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.860
 merino gavilÃ¡n 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.480
 david you are the tournament's scorer by 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.760
 now so say the three goals that 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.680
 I have marked the ones I'm not happy anymore 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.600
 that all not for the goals but because 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.770
 the group deserves it as worked 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.570
 well for for victory 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.720
 well thank you let's get it to you 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.250
 I dedicate what I say to God first 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.430
 also to my whole family that knows what 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.430
 do
