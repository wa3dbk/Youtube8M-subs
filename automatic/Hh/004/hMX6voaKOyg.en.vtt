suits<00:06:33.530> the<00:06:33.680> song<00:06:33.919> I<00:06:34.280> think<00:06:34.729> there<00:06:34.820> was<00:06:34.940> one

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
suits the song I think there was one

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.700 
suits the song I think there was one
part<00:06:35.330> where<00:06:35.449> they<00:06:35.509> actually<00:06:35.539> edited<00:06:36.320> like<00:06:36.530> I

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
part where they actually edited like I

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.649 
part where they actually edited like I

think yeah it was the beginning right
where<00:06:38.840> were<00:06:38.990> the<00:06:39.710> hot<00:06:39.860> suits<00:06:40.159> on<00:06:40.340> right<00:06:40.580> but
