00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.509
 room or you balls 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.900
 but it is a ball it was a bath 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.590
 it burned partially but there inside 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.230
 all beat off 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.619
 that is, it is almost warm 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.930
 It turned out that this sensor is worth it 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:33.270
 sensor from the industrial refrigerator there 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.079
 shows from shows 0 almost and such 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.489
 same 0 it shows at minus on the street 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.170
 about 15 degrees I don't even turn on 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.469
 heating system 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.190
 Here I stand from vodka that is 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.620
 I have them in winter 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.230
 moved here thought that they would be here 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.320
 better here about ten layering can and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.739
 more than three which were more relaxed 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.189
 the rest of the family on the street like this 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.670
 turned zimovnik here is the temperature 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:13.700
 it turned out some kind of probably 0 and 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.700
 humidity good humidity almost 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.680
 how many there are 60 it is even less then 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.130
 there is even more need for humidity 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.950
 a bit of a hole made there 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:33.150
 such a branch and fell not enough to 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:37.829
 the damp came out when he wasn't here 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.820
 there was 95 humidity and then did it 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.950
 and everything became normal here I have 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.460
 the bends began to worry and roared 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.820
 pretty much and i had him 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.490
 put candy here they are to bring them out 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.250
 draw it on the sly 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:01.420
 that is, I did not open it too much 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.190
 partially the bees of this flooring from several 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.860

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:22.600
 you can watch quietly not worried 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.120
 that is, that's the thing I was 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.580
 when the temperature -20 put the sensor 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.340
 automatically turned on then all of it 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.760
 disconnected and the bees support such a small 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.910
 the rooms they keep the temperature 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.280
 about zero 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:46.630
 not even including this heater 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.070
