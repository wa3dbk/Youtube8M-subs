really<00:00:28.279> was<00:00:28.429> a<00:00:28.460> pretty<00:00:28.759> easy<00:00:28.880> little<00:00:29.300> project

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:29.749 
really was a pretty easy little project

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.749 
really was a pretty easy little project
and<00:00:29.990> then<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:31.009> other<00:00:31.159> cool<00:00:31.339> thing<00:00:31.519> about<00:00:31.550> this

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
and then the other cool thing about this

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.060 
and then the other cool thing about this
is<00:00:32.119> that<00:00:32.150> when<00:00:32.570> you're<00:00:32.689> done<00:00:32.840> playing<00:00:33.170> you<00:00:33.890> can

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
is that when you're done playing you can

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.830 
is that when you're done playing you can
just<00:00:34.220> flip<00:00:34.370> this<00:00:34.550> down<00:00:34.730> you<00:00:35.600> can<00:00:35.630> actually

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
just flip this down you can actually

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.940 
just flip this down you can actually
just<00:00:36.080> sort<00:00:36.260> of<00:00:36.320> store<00:00:36.800> your<00:00:36.920> marbles<00:00:37.280> inside

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
my block or my detective game what I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.650 
my block or my detective game what I
needed<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.470> do<00:00:54.590> first<00:00:54.800> was<00:00:54.980> figure<00:00:55.490> out<00:00:55.700> the

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
needed to do first was figure out the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.880 
needed to do first was figure out the
math<00:00:56.870> you<00:00:57.200> know<00:00:57.320> where<00:00:57.560> I'm<00:00:57.680> going<00:00:57.830> to

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
math you know where I'm going to

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.210 
math you know where I'm going to
actually<00:00:58.040> cut<00:00:58.550> my<00:00:58.580> lines<00:00:59.200> on<00:01:00.200> my<00:01:00.380> block<00:01:00.650> and<00:01:00.680> so

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
actually cut my lines on my block and so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.130 
actually cut my lines on my block and so
for<00:01:01.460> mine<00:01:01.610> it's<00:01:01.940> going<00:01:02.090> to<00:01:02.180> be<00:01:02.270> at<00:01:02.390> about<00:01:02.480> 1<00:01:02.900> and

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
for mine it's going to be at about 1 and

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.570 
for mine it's going to be at about 1 and
5/16<00:01:03.980> of<00:01:04.070> an<00:01:04.129> inch

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
5/16 of an inch

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.670 
5/16 of an inch
and<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.630> do<00:01:05.900> that<00:01:06.080> cut<00:01:06.350> I'm<00:01:06.439> gonna<00:01:06.560> actually

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
and to do that cut I'm gonna actually

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.130 
and to do that cut I'm gonna actually
use<00:01:06.860> my<00:01:07.130> router<00:01:07.400> table<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:07.939> use<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.240> 5/8<00:01:08.960> inch

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
use my router table and use a 5/8 inch

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.480 
use my router table and use a 5/8 inch
beat<00:01:10.130> groove<00:01:10.460> pit<00:01:11.299> and<00:01:11.749> I'm<00:01:12.560> using<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:12.950> size

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
beat groove pit and I'm using that size

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.239 
beat groove pit and I'm using that size
because<00:01:13.729> it's<00:01:14.030> kind<00:01:14.210> of<00:01:14.240> all<00:01:14.329> I<00:01:14.359> had<00:01:14.950> and<00:01:15.950> I

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.249 
because it's kind of all I had and I

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:18.219 
because it's kind of all I had and I
guess<00:01:16.460> I<00:01:16.549> could<00:01:16.700> have<00:01:16.789> used<00:01:16.880> my<00:01:16.969> table<00:01:17.390> saw<00:01:17.539> I<00:01:17.840> I

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
guess I could have used my table saw I I

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.489 
guess I could have used my table saw I I
did<00:01:18.619> try<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:18.950> test<00:01:19.850> block<00:01:20.179> to<00:01:20.420> see<00:01:20.630> what<00:01:21.409> it

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
did try a test block to see what it

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:22.779 
did try a test block to see what it
would<00:01:21.590> look<00:01:21.710> like<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.340> honestly<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:22.700> just

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
would look like and honestly I just

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.190 
would look like and honestly I just
thought<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.149> looked<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.420> little<00:01:23.539> it<00:01:24.049> was<00:01:24.170> a

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
thought it looked a little it was a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.340 
thought it looked a little it was a
little<00:01:24.289> too<00:01:24.859> wide<00:01:25.069> and<00:01:25.729> I<00:01:26.090> just<00:01:26.899> didn't<00:01:27.200> look

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
little too wide and I just didn't look

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.809 
little too wide and I just didn't look
you<00:01:27.649> know<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:27.770> don't<00:01:28.100> want<00:01:28.249> the<00:01:28.399> way<00:01:28.490> I<00:01:28.520> wanted

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
you know I don't want the way I wanted

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:30.700 
you know I don't want the way I wanted
it<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:29.060> look<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:29.929> I'm<00:01:30.079> going<00:01:30.259> to<00:01:30.289> try<00:01:30.409> that<00:01:30.590> with

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
it to look so I'm going to try that with

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.609 
it to look so I'm going to try that with
a<00:01:30.770> 5/8<00:01:31.369> inch<00:01:31.490> group<00:01:31.819> it<00:01:32.030> or<00:01:32.359> beat<00:01:32.600> groove<00:01:32.960> bit

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
a 5/8 inch group it or beat groove bit

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:58.920 
a 5/8 inch group it or beat groove bit
and<00:01:34.060> we'll<00:01:35.060> see<00:01:35.179> how<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.359> goes

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.710 

okay<00:01:59.930> so<00:01:59.990> I've<00:02:00.380> got<00:02:00.410> my<00:02:01.400> lines<00:02:01.670> now<00:02:01.970> from<00:02:02.570> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
want to find my center point for each of

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.720 
want to find my center point for each of
the<00:02:11.180> squares<00:02:12.160> honestly<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.370> could<00:02:13.520> just

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
the squares honestly you could just

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.470 
the squares honestly you could just
eyeball<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.750> mean<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:15.650> really<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.280> i<00:02:16.550> I

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
tend to want to be a little more precise

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.550 
tend to want to be a little more precise
and<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.710> well<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.730> decided<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:23.240> do<00:02:23.360> for<00:02:23.390> me<00:02:23.720> was

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
just kind of find the center by drawing

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.090 
just kind of find the center by drawing
the<00:02:27.620> line<00:02:29.200> through<00:02:30.200> on<00:02:30.380> line<00:02:31.240> throw<00:02:32.240> my<00:02:32.420> boxes

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
okay so now I've got my crosses on each

okay so now I've got my crosses on each
of<00:03:05.340> my<00:03:05.460> boxes<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.150> I've<00:03:06.840> got<00:03:07.050> my<00:03:07.200> sinner<00:03:07.530> line

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
my holes and I've set my depth so that

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.030 
my holes and I've set my depth so that
I'm<00:03:21.420> just<00:03:22.080> going<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.500> little<00:03:22.620> under<00:03:22.950> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
I'm just going a little under the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.570 
I'm just going a little under the
surface<00:03:24.170> don't<00:03:25.170> need<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.440> go<00:03:25.560> too<00:03:25.620> far<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:28.580> I'm

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
surface don't need to go too far and I'm

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.720 
surface don't need to go too far and I'm
using<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.910> half<00:03:30.120> inch<00:03:30.300> drill<00:03:30.690> bit<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.730> honestly

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
using a half inch drill bit and honestly

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.010 
using a half inch drill bit and honestly
I<00:03:32.760> wish<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.000> had<00:03:33.150> one<00:03:33.300> that<00:03:33.420> was<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.630> little<00:03:33.720> bit

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.390 
I wish I had one that was a little bit
bigger<00:03:34.200> because<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.590> think<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.860> marbles<00:03:35.220> would

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
bigger because I think the marbles would

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.550 
bigger because I think the marbles would
look<00:03:35.970> better<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.480> kind<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.020> the<00:03:37.080> further<00:03:37.350> they

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
look better the kind of the further they

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.710 
look better the kind of the further they
set<00:03:37.890> in<00:03:38.070> there<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:39.030> is<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.270> largest<00:03:39.540> one<00:03:39.660> I

set in there this is the largest one I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.030 
set in there this is the largest one I
got<00:03:39.989> someone<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.320> go<00:03:40.470> with<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:40.770> for<00:03:40.920> now

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
went ahead and already cut this I used a

went ahead and already cut this I used a
just<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:06.930> three<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:07.860> a<00:05:07.890> half<00:05:08.070> by<00:05:08.430> one<00:05:08.760> inch

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
just a three and a half by one inch

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.470 
just a three and a half by one inch
piece<00:05:11.160> of<00:05:11.190> oak<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.880> I

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
piece of oak and I

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.390 
piece of oak and I
I<00:05:12.510> chose<00:05:12.990> oak<00:05:13.200> just<00:05:13.380> because<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.800> had<00:05:14.220> some

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
I chose oak just because I had some

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.160 
I chose oak just because I had some
scrap<00:05:14.730> that<00:05:14.760> was<00:05:15.120> laying<00:05:15.300> around<00:05:15.420> and<00:05:16.080> I

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
scrap that was laying around and I

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.270 
scrap that was laying around and I
thought<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:16.440> might<00:05:16.590> be<00:05:16.680> an<00:05:16.770> entertaining

thought it might be an entertaining
interesting<00:05:17.850> contrast<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.540> see<00:05:19.100> you<00:05:20.100> know

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190
