00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and you know I think when you look at

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340 
and you know I think when you look at
over<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> past<00:01:23.909> seven<00:01:24.330> years<00:01:24.360> we've<00:01:25.110> had

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
over the past seven years we've had

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.140 
over the past seven years we've had
numerous<00:01:25.590> players<00:01:26.130> go<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.909> play<00:01:26.939> in

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
numerous players go on to play in

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.230 
numerous players go on to play in
college<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.950> ranges<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.549> Division

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
college and that ranges from Division

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.260 
college and that ranges from Division
one<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.750> down<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.259> NAIA<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.100> junior<00:01:32.850> college

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
one on down to NAIA and junior college

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.039 
one on down to NAIA and junior college
and<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.680> those<00:01:35.549> seven<00:01:35.970> years<00:01:36.270> would

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and I think that those seven years would

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.780 
and I think that those seven years would
match<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.710> anybody<00:01:38.009> else<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.640> is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
match up with anybody else that is
