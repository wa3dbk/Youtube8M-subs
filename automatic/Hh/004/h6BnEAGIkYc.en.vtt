into her push I think Beth is gonna

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.780 
into her push I think Beth is gonna
retain<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.079> one<00:01:40.430> they<00:01:41.430> might<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.729> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
retain on this one they might have a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.499 
retain on this one they might have a
rematch<00:01:42.150> at<00:01:42.420> some<00:01:42.810> point<00:01:43.140> maybe<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.210> rivin<00:01:45.210> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.350 
I still think if they if they're gonna
have<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> rematch<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.740> Raw<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:50.909> after<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
have a rematch on Raw right after the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.880 
have a rematch on Raw right after the
Elimination<00:01:51.810> Chamber<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.200> still<00:01:52.439> think<00:01:52.710> Beth

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
Elimination Chamber I still think Beth

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.730 
Elimination Chamber I still think Beth
Phoenix<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.430> gonna<00:01:53.520> retain<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.240> why<00:01:54.960> that's

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
Phoenix is gonna retain and why that's

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.459 
Phoenix is gonna retain and why that's
because<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:57.060> Beth<00:01:57.240> Phoenix<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:58.049> plan<00:01:58.290> is

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
because I think Beth Phoenix the plan is

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.380 
because I think Beth Phoenix the plan is
for<00:01:58.649> her<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> keep<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.880> tight<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
for her to keep it tight on to

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.969 
for her to keep it tight on to
Wrestlemania<00:02:00.780> where<00:02:01.290> she's<00:02:01.500> gonna<00:02:01.619> face

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
Wrestlemania where she's gonna face

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.249 
Wrestlemania where she's gonna face
karma<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.490> think<00:02:02.729> most<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.840> most<00:02:04.079> of

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
karma I think most of you know most of

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.580 
karma I think most of you know most of
you<00:02:04.320> would<00:02:05.070> agree<00:02:05.219> with<00:02:05.430> me<00:02:05.610> here<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.930> think<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
you would agree with me here I think the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.380 
you would agree with me here I think the
most<00:02:07.770> likely<00:02:08.009> scenario<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:08.789> we're<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
most likely scenario here we're going to

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.990 
most likely scenario here we're going to
see<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.869> my<00:02:10.289> Phoenix<00:02:10.709> vs.<00:02:11.520> karma<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
see is my Phoenix vs. karma a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.990 
see is my Phoenix vs. karma a
Wrestlemania<00:02:12.720> obviously<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.349> can't<00:02:13.379> happen

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
Wrestlemania obviously that can't happen

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.920 
Wrestlemania obviously that can't happen
and<00:02:14.090> if<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.930> meaning<00:02:15.140> wins<00:02:15.400> now<00:02:16.660> some<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.690> you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
and if the meaning wins now some of you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.350 
and if the meaning wins now some of you
might<00:02:18.080> say<00:02:18.440> well<00:02:18.470> what<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.370> Tamina<00:02:19.700> wins<00:02:20.000> and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
might say well what if Tamina wins and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.340 
might say well what if Tamina wins and
she<00:02:20.840> could<00:02:20.990> defend<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.320> championship

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
she could defend the championship

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.300 
she could defend the championship
