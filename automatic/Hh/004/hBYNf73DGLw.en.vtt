00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 spectacular aerodynamics the seat 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.230
 lion razer is a prototype of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.750
 careers in development but that 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.950
 already points ways eduardo good has it 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.950
 tested for us 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.150
 since you are leaving 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.009
 official the world championship of 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.869
 Tourism has been dedicated to support 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.600
 private pilots and to develop new 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.580
 projects like this the lion carr racers 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.989
 I have not tried it yet but first thing 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.309
 What can I say is that it is the most 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.500
 nice that so far has created the 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.970
 Spanish brand 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.710
 it's just spectacular does not matter 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.720
 where you look at the front skirt 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.480
 a few wheel arches noticeably 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.030
 widens two 18-inch wheels on 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.430
 rear diffuser the spoiler is a car 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.900
 that marks a before and after 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.150
 aerodynamically 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.550
 Of course, this car is aesthetically 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.410
 nice up inside has some 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.880
 Minimalist touch that I like another of 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.850
 The great novelties that it brings is the 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.860
 display here you can see the map of the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.840
 circuit the time it is doing by 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.810
 back here the marches are appearing 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.520
 all digital with these buttons you can go 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.770
 changing screen and choose the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.810
 parameters that you choose this is the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.730
 third generation of the seat lion in his 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.680
 racing version and the jump that the 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.070
 engineers have given forward is 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.070
 big 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.880
 like all race cars there 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.850
 to start with decision because if not 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.060
 start to jerk right away you can 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.060
 penetrate 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.330
 is a sample of the experience that is 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.190
 through his department 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.530
 competition has accumulated over 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.060
 the years is a sign of the passion that 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.060
 the brand feels towards the races 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.950
 while still being developed one of 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.619
 the parts that will change soon is 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.450
 the engine that's why despite having 330 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.759
 horses is not what fascinates me the most 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.590
 nor what most impresses me the chassis 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.350
 it's very well done here I would endure more 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.360
 power 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.220
 as it is still a prototype in phase of 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.230
 I developed one of the things that most 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.980
 remains to be improved is on the subject of 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.980
 suspensions 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.820
 Masters 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.260
 do not fear there was not enough 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.260
 trust to play 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.239
 of the aspects in which they have most 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.609
 worked so far where more in the 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.609
 fast curves in the curves of 15 and 6 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.829
 one of the great advantages of the box 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.840
 6-speed gearbox that mounts 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.670
 the system is top that is to say with this 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.620
 mechanism it is not necessary to lift the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.450
 gas foot when climbing gears 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.250
 and those who want to buy is by car 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.240
 they can do it with two types of cash 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.030
 changes 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.740
 a sequence like this and it will be used 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.270
 especially for racing 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.270
 the song 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.520
 instead dsg on the steering wheel 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.190
 in any case it is a prize more than 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.020
 justified because the technological level 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.020
 of this car is at the same 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.330
 and they are not worth half measures 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.750
 will be at the beginning of the year when 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.670
 unit is completely finished 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.469
 ready to run and then we can 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.769
 assess the progress that has occurred 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:44.250
 even so it can already be said that the base is 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.250
 very good 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.140
 Although it is still in the phase of 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.480
 development this is the lion as you would say 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.060
 vulgarly it has been born well that is to say 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.410
 points out ways that although not currently 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.570
 enter the sports plans of the 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.220
 brand would be a perfect car so that 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.550
 he went back to the world championship of 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.550
 tourism
