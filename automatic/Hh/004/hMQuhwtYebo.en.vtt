00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
want to talk about a couple of things

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.720 
want to talk about a couple of things
that<00:00:26.039> are<00:00:26.220> related<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.580> technique<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:28.730> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
that are related to technique and the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.569 
that are related to technique and the
first<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.350> this<00:00:31.350> is<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.530> common<00:00:31.860> mistake<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.340> see

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
first one this is a common mistake I see

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.729 
first one this is a common mistake I see
especially<00:00:32.879> for<00:00:33.270> beginners<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.899> that's

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
especially for beginners and that's

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.169 
especially for beginners and that's
applying<00:00:35.039> too<00:00:35.250> much<00:00:35.280> pressure<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:36.089> the

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:36.179 
applying too much pressure on the

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.739 
applying too much pressure on the
strings<00:00:37.019> and<00:00:37.760> I<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:39.120> given<00:00:39.359> a<00:00:39.420> lesson<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
strings and I was given a lesson a

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:41.479 
strings and I was given a lesson a
couple<00:00:40.019> of<00:00:40.109> days<00:00:40.289> ago<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.859> came<00:00:41.100> up<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
couple of days ago this came up in the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.910 
couple of days ago this came up in the
lesson<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.449> this<00:00:43.319> is<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.589> of<00:00:43.620> those<00:00:43.710> things

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
lesson and this is one of those things

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.250 
lesson and this is one of those things
you<00:00:44.100> can't<00:00:44.249> take<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.609> granted<00:00:45.199> that<00:00:46.199> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
you can't take for granted that you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.049 
you can't take for granted that you
think<00:00:46.499> everybody<00:00:46.800> knows<00:00:46.979> and<00:00:47.429> this<00:00:47.699> person

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
think everybody knows and this person

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.819 
think everybody knows and this person
did<00:00:48.179> not<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:48.960> I'm<00:00:49.229> now<00:00:49.409> thinking<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
did not know it so I'm now thinking that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.919 
did not know it so I'm now thinking that
maybe<00:00:50.149> there<00:00:51.149> are<00:00:51.179> others<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.899> there

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
maybe there are others of you out there

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:53.209 
maybe there are others of you out there
that<00:00:52.229> don't<00:00:52.319> know<00:00:52.409> this<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.859> I<00:00:52.920> want<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.069> throw

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that don't know this so I want to throw

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.009 
that don't know this so I want to throw
it<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.519> for<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.909> and<00:00:54.210> hopefully<00:00:54.780> this

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
it out there for you and hopefully this

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:55.700 
it out there for you and hopefully this
will<00:00:55.109> help<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.409> out

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
will help you out

once you just play that note with your
finger<00:01:33.750> why<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.710> mix<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.070> sprite<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.399> close

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
finger why not mix the sprite as close

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:36.889 
finger why not mix the sprite as close
as<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:35.969> get<00:01:36.179> it<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.479> might<00:01:36.600> even<00:01:36.750> look

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
as you can get it it might even look

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.039 
as you can get it it might even look
like<00:01:36.960> you're<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.229> top<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> fret<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:39.049> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
like you're on top of the fret that the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.779 
like you're on top of the fret that the
pad<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.350> your<00:01:40.380> finger<00:01:40.469> will<00:01:40.829> actually<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.250> just

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
pad of your finger will actually be just

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.340 
pad of your finger will actually be just
behind<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.299> fret<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.689> get<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.929> top<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.289> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
behind the fret if I get on top of the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.679 
behind the fret if I get on top of the
fret<00:01:43.609> it's<00:01:44.609> going<00:01:44.789> to<00:01:44.850> start<00:01:45.090> getting<00:01:45.179> buzzy

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
fret it's going to start getting buzzy

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.209

the point where it goes from this we're

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.740 
the point where it goes from this we're
making<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.319> blue<00:02:32.530> bit<00:02:32.680> buzzy<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.540> where<00:02:34.660> you

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
making the blue bit buzzy so where you

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.380 
have a clean sound what I want you to
discover<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:40.989> want<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.200> discover<00:02:41.650> the

discover is I want you to discover the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.339 
discover is I want you to discover the
least<00:02:43.390> amount<00:02:43.569> of<00:02:43.660> pressure<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.230> can

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
least amount of pressure that you can

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.930 
least amount of pressure that you can
apply<00:02:44.560> in<00:02:44.799> order<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.040> get<00:02:45.190> that<00:02:45.310> note<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.670> sound

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
apply in order to get that note to sound

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.640 
apply in order to get that note to sound
and<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.660> think<00:02:46.900> you're<00:02:46.989> going<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.170> be<00:02:47.230> surprised

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
and I think you're going to be surprised

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.680 
and I think you're going to be surprised
it<00:02:47.860> doesn't<00:02:47.950> take<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.280> much<00:02:48.549> pressure<00:02:48.880> to

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
it doesn't take that much pressure to

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.780 
it doesn't take that much pressure to
get<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.959> notes<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.349> sound<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:51.310> hopefully<00:02:51.670> that

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
get the notes to sound so hopefully that

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.210 
get the notes to sound so hopefully that
will<00:02:51.849> help<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.150> out<00:02:52.239> in<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.450> future<00:02:53.220> don't

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
will help you out in the future don't

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.670 
will help you out in the future don't
feel<00:02:54.459> like<00:02:54.579> you<00:02:54.700> have<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.850> press<00:02:55.180> too<00:02:55.420> hard

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
feel like you have to press too hard

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.110 
feel like you have to press too hard
again<00:02:56.680> that's<00:02:56.859> a<00:02:56.920> big<00:02:57.100> mistake<00:02:57.489> that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
again that's a big mistake that

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.259 
again that's a big mistake that
beginners<00:02:58.840> make<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.290> even<00:02:59.950> like<00:03:00.910> if<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.120> get

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
beginners make and even like if I get

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.640 
beginners make and even like if I get
out<00:03:01.390> on<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.570> gig<00:03:01.780> or<00:03:01.930> something<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.470> bands

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
out on a gig or something and the bands

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.140 
out on a gig or something and the bands
playing<00:03:02.920> too<00:03:03.130> loud<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:03.609> start<00:03:03.880> trying<00:03:04.120> to

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
playing too loud and I start trying to

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.509 
playing too loud and I start trying to
dig<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.600> little<00:03:04.660> bit<00:03:04.900> more<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:06.190> play<00:03:06.459> too

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
dig in a little bit more and play too

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.259 
dig in a little bit more and play too
hard

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
hard

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.699 
hard
I<00:03:07.299> find<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.780> my<00:03:07.900> technique<00:03:08.260> kind<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.590> goes

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
I find that my technique kind of goes

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.000 
I find that my technique kind of goes
away<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.069> that<00:03:09.790> applies<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.060> all<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.690> so

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
away so that applies to all this so

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.430 
away so that applies to all this so
remember<00:03:12.010> again<00:03:12.910> just<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.569> find<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.049> exact

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
remember again just that find that exact

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.160 
remember again just that find that exact
spot<00:03:14.609> where<00:03:15.609> you're<00:03:16.120> applying<00:03:16.269> just<00:03:16.569> just

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
spot where you're applying just just

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.479 
spot where you're applying just just
enough<00:03:17.380> pressure<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.739> get<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.010> note<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.280> sound

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
enough pressure to get the note to sound

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.650 
enough pressure to get the note to sound
and<00:03:18.670> that's<00:03:18.790> all<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.150> need<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.389> don't<00:03:19.480> need

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
and that's all you need you don't need

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.449 
and that's all you need you don't need
any<00:03:19.840> more<00:03:19.989> than<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.319> now<00:03:21.010> another<00:03:21.220> question

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
any more than that now another question

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.330 
any more than that now another question
that<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.819> get<00:03:21.880> is<00:03:22.470> about<00:03:23.470> how<00:03:23.829> do<00:03:23.889> you<00:03:24.069> keep<00:03:24.220> your

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
that I get is about how do you keep your

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.090 
that I get is about how do you keep your
fingers<00:03:24.639> close<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.060> fret<00:03:25.299> board

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
fingers close to the fret board

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.860 
fingers close to the fret board
typically<00:03:27.100> I'm<00:03:27.280> not<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> big<00:03:27.609> fan<00:03:27.819> of<00:03:27.880> exercises

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
typically I'm not a big fan of exercises

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.840 
typically I'm not a big fan of exercises
but<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.620> is<00:03:29.769> one<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.100> my<00:03:30.130> classical<00:03:30.609> guitar

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
but this is one that my classical guitar

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.970 
but this is one that my classical guitar
instructor<00:03:31.269> taught<00:03:31.420> me<00:03:31.600> in<00:03:31.690> college<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:32.230> this

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
instructor taught me in college and this

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.099 
instructor taught me in college and this
is<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.190> really<00:03:33.459> valuable<00:03:33.609> one<00:03:34.049> especially<00:03:35.049> if

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
is a really valuable one especially if

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.690 
is a really valuable one especially if
it's<00:03:35.230> done<00:03:35.410> right<00:03:35.680> so<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.069> idea<00:03:36.370> behind<00:03:36.519> this

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
it's done right so the idea behind this

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.099 
it's done right so the idea behind this
exercise<00:03:37.150> is<00:03:37.329> you're<00:03:37.450> going<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.630> take<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.810> four

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
exercise is you're going to take a four

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.379 
exercise is you're going to take a four
frets<00:03:38.350> pain<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:39.579> here<00:03:39.760> I'm<00:03:39.910> going<00:03:40.060> from<00:03:40.299> the

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
frets pain so here I'm going from the

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.890 
frets pain so here I'm going from the
third<00:03:40.569> fret<00:03:40.930> fourth<00:03:41.500> fifth<00:03:42.069> and<00:03:42.370> sixth<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.810> you

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
third fret fourth fifth and sixth so you

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.960 
third fret fourth fifth and sixth so you
got<00:03:44.049> your<00:03:44.380> first<00:03:44.590> finger<00:03:45.069> in<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.730> third

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.600 
strings as I can possibly keep them now
when<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:42.530> first<00:04:42.680> try<00:04:42.949> this<00:04:43.190> your<00:04:43.370> little

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
when you first try this your little

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.080 
when you first try this your little
finger

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
finger

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.450 
finger
you<00:04:44.210> might<00:04:44.419> notice<00:04:44.919> take<00:04:45.919> that<00:04:46.070> little<00:04:46.250> finger

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
you might notice take that little finger

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
off in it it just immediately wants to

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.010 
off in it it just immediately wants to
fly<00:04:48.440> way<00:04:48.680> out<00:04:48.889> here<00:04:49.100> in<00:04:49.130> your<00:04:49.280> 13<00:04:49.910> and<00:04:50.510> you<00:04:50.900> know

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
fly way out here in your 13 and you know

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.240 
fly way out here in your 13 and you know
then<00:04:51.199> you<00:04:51.289> end<00:04:51.410> up<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.680> your<00:04:51.800> fingers<00:04:52.130> are

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
then you end up and your fingers are

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.040 
then you end up and your fingers are
like<00:04:52.340> way<00:04:52.580> out<00:04:52.610> here<00:04:53.060> far<00:04:53.570> away<00:04:53.690> from<00:04:53.810> the

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
like way out here far away from the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.330 
like way out here far away from the
guitar<00:04:54.669> so<00:04:55.669> you<00:04:55.729> really<00:04:56.060> have<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.330> concentrate

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
guitar so you really have to concentrate

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.150 
guitar so you really have to concentrate
on<00:04:58.340> keeping<00:04:58.550> your<00:04:58.850> fingers<00:04:59.680> right<00:05:00.680> above<00:05:00.979> the

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
on keeping your fingers right above the

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.409 
on keeping your fingers right above the
strings<00:05:03.220> just<00:05:04.220> try<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.430> keep<00:05:04.580> them<00:05:04.760> like<00:05:04.910> an<00:05:05.060> 18

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
strings just try to keep them like an 18

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.270 
strings just try to keep them like an 18
inch<00:05:05.539> eighth<00:05:06.320> of<00:05:06.470> an<00:05:06.560> inch<00:05:06.620> above<00:05:06.889> the<00:05:06.950> strings

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
inch eighth of an inch above the strings

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.440 
inch eighth of an inch above the strings
if<00:05:07.400> you<00:05:07.460> can<00:05:07.610> now<00:05:07.729> you<00:05:07.789> can't<00:05:08.060> really<00:05:08.120> see<00:05:08.300> how

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
if you can now you can't really see how

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.170 
if you can now you can't really see how
far<00:05:08.720> I'm<00:05:08.840> getting<00:05:09.080> off<00:05:09.229> the<00:05:09.380> strings<00:05:09.710> there

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
far I'm getting off the strings there

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.180 
far I'm getting off the strings there
because<00:05:11.180> of<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.330> camera<00:05:11.630> angle<00:05:12.070> but<00:05:13.070> I'm

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
because of the camera angle but I'm

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.040 
because of the camera angle but I'm
really<00:05:13.789> working<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.270> keep<00:05:14.389> my<00:05:14.510> fingers<00:05:14.840> close

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
really working to keep my fingers close

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.170 
really working to keep my fingers close
to<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:15.289> guitar<00:05:15.590> if<00:05:16.400> you<00:05:16.520> just<00:05:16.639> do<00:05:16.760> this<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:16.940> few

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
to the guitar if you just do this a few

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.310 
to the guitar if you just do this a few
minutes<00:05:17.270> every<00:05:17.539> day<00:05:18.220> and<00:05:19.220> again<00:05:20.260> it's<00:05:21.260> not

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
minutes every day and again it's not

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.460 
minutes every day and again it's not
about<00:05:21.590> speed<00:05:21.830> in<00:05:22.250> fact<00:05:22.490> it's<00:05:22.669> better<00:05:23.320> if<00:05:24.320> you

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
about speed in fact it's better if you

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.740 
about speed in fact it's better if you
do<00:05:24.590> this<00:05:24.770> slowly<00:05:25.300> because<00:05:26.300> it<00:05:26.419> makes<00:05:26.570> those

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
do this slowly because it makes those

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.029 
do this slowly because it makes those
muscles<00:05:27.139> work<00:05:27.289> harder

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:48.930 

especially<00:05:31.039> your<00:05:31.160> coming<00:05:31.430> off

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.970 

alright<00:05:49.940> so<00:05:50.150> there's<00:05:50.330> that<00:05:50.450> exercise<00:05:50.900> and<00:05:51.260> I

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
alright so there's that exercise and I

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.350 
alright so there's that exercise and I
think<00:05:52.340> you'll<00:05:52.430> find<00:05:52.610> that<00:05:52.730> that's<00:05:53.000> much<00:05:53.180> more

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
think you'll find that that's much more

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.660 
think you'll find that that's much more
difficult<00:05:53.840> than<00:05:53.900> it<00:05:54.050> looks<00:05:54.220> but<00:05:55.220> if<00:05:55.310> you<00:05:55.400> spend

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
difficult than it looks but if you spend

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.280 
difficult than it looks but if you spend
a<00:05:55.730> few<00:05:55.850> minutes<00:05:55.970> doing<00:05:56.300> that<00:05:56.480> every<00:05:56.780> day<00:05:56.810> and

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
a few minutes doing that every day and

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.470 
a few minutes doing that every day and
even<00:05:58.100> if<00:05:58.280> you're<00:05:58.370> practicing<00:05:58.790> scales<00:05:59.060> or

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
even if you're practicing scales or

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.360 
even if you're practicing scales or
whatever<00:05:59.780> you<00:05:59.840> have<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.050> be<00:06:00.200> working<00:06:00.530> on<00:06:00.680> if

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
whatever you have to be working on if

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.680 
whatever you have to be working on if
you<00:06:01.520> really<00:06:01.790> focus<00:06:02.120> on<00:06:02.240> keeping<00:06:02.270> those

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
you really focus on keeping those

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.260 
you really focus on keeping those
fingers<00:06:03.080> close<00:06:03.320> to<00:06:03.470> the<00:06:03.560> fretboard<00:06:04.270> you'll

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
fingers close to the fretboard you'll

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.550 
fingers close to the fretboard you'll
find<00:06:05.540> that<00:06:05.660> you<00:06:05.780> can<00:06:05.810> over<00:06:06.140> time<00:06:06.320> you<00:06:06.470> can

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
find that you can over time you can

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.060 
find that you can over time you can
train<00:06:06.830> them<00:06:07.010> and<00:06:08.260> you'll<00:06:09.260> be<00:06:09.410> able<00:06:09.470> to<00:06:09.620> keep

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
train them and you'll be able to keep

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.470 
train them and you'll be able to keep
them<00:06:10.280> closer<00:06:10.670> to<00:06:10.850> the<00:06:10.940> fretboard<00:06:11.150> without

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
them closer to the fretboard without

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.570 
them closer to the fretboard without
having<00:06:11.780> to<00:06:11.870> think<00:06:11.990> about<00:06:12.110> it<00:06:12.290> and<00:06:12.590> that's

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
having to think about it and that's

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.280 
having to think about it and that's
really<00:06:13.700> crucial<00:06:14.030> you<00:06:14.810> know<00:06:14.900> there's<00:06:15.110> no

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
really crucial you know there's no

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.080 
really crucial you know there's no
reason<00:06:15.710> to<00:06:15.740> expend<00:06:16.130> any<00:06:16.460> more<00:06:16.670> effort<00:06:16.820> or

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
reason to expend any more effort or

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.310 
reason to expend any more effort or
energy<00:06:17.180> than<00:06:17.570> you<00:06:17.600> need<00:06:17.870> when<00:06:18.050> you're<00:06:18.170> playing

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
energy than you need when you're playing

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.040 
energy than you need when you're playing
the<00:06:18.470> guitar<00:06:18.770> and<00:06:19.420> having<00:06:20.420> your<00:06:20.540> fingers<00:06:20.840> fly

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
the guitar and having your fingers fly

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.450 
the guitar and having your fingers fly
way<00:06:21.200> off<00:06:21.350> the<00:06:21.470> fretboard<00:06:21.650> is<00:06:21.890> just<00:06:22.070> wasted

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
way off the fretboard is just wasted

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.240 
way off the fretboard is just wasted
movement<00:06:22.850> all<00:06:23.510> right<00:06:23.780> that's<00:06:24.710> it<00:06:24.860> for<00:06:25.010> today

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250
