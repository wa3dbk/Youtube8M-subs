we're just waiting over time and people
say<00:02:32.830> ah<00:02:33.240> what<00:02:34.240> why<00:02:34.510> why<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.050> that<00:02:35.200> these

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
say ah what why why is it that these

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.920 
say ah what why why is it that these
these<00:02:35.830> go<00:02:36.070> up<00:02:36.100> in<00:02:36.310> price<00:02:36.430> it's<00:02:37.180> because<00:02:37.450> more

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
these go up in price it's because more

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.380 
these go up in price it's because more
people<00:02:37.990> want<00:02:38.620> them<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.730> people<00:02:40.060> who<00:02:40.150> want

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
people want them the people who want

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.580 
people want them the people who want
them<00:02:40.540> for<00:02:40.720> Christmas<00:02:41.050> are<00:02:41.170> keeping<00:02:41.500> they're

them for Christmas are keeping they're

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.960 
them for Christmas are keeping they're
not<00:02:41.770> selling<00:02:42.130> them<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:42.400> there's<00:02:42.550> less<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.790> them

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
not selling them so there's less of them

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.000 
not selling them so there's less of them
on<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.180> market<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:44.200> they<00:02:44.290> become<00:02:44.500> more<00:02:44.710> rare

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
on the market so they become more rare

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.060 
on the market so they become more rare
basically<00:02:45.640> in<00:02:46.000> them<00:02:46.180> sort<00:02:46.420> herbs<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.070> more

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
basically in them sort herbs and more

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.830 
basically in them sort herbs and more
people<00:02:48.220> buy<00:02:48.490> them<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.880> then<00:02:49.300> they<00:02:49.450> go<00:02:49.600> up<00:02:49.630> in

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
people buy them and then they go up in

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.420 
people buy them and then they go up in
price<00:02:49.990> because<00:02:50.260> there's<00:02:50.710> less<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:51.070> them<00:02:51.280> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
price because there's less of them to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.520 
price because there's less of them to
buy<00:02:51.580> there's<00:02:52.390> some<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.660> button<00:02:52.870> people<00:02:53.230> want

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.290 
buy there's some of a button people want
them<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:54.340> it's<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.580> need<00:02:54.790> for<00:02:54.820> them<00:02:55.150> that
