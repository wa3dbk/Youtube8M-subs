00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

was a little adverse situation it's

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.620 
was a little adverse situation it's
managed<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.909> crawl<00:01:15.119> back<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.509> game

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
managed to crawl back in the game

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.749 
managed to crawl back in the game
shortly<00:01:16.049> after<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.470> goal<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.399> think

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
shortly after the goal and then I think

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.270 
shortly after the goal and then I think
the<00:01:18.090> upper<00:01:18.330> hand<00:01:18.890> throughout<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> rest<00:01:20.190> of

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the upper hand throughout the rest of

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.669 
the upper hand throughout the rest of
the<00:01:20.340> first<00:01:20.520> half<00:01:20.759> after<00:01:21.060> maybe<00:01:21.569> 15<00:01:22.259> minutes<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
the first half after maybe 15 minutes I

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.730 
the first half after maybe 15 minutes I
thought<00:01:22.830> more<00:01:23.009> clearly<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:24.090> top<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:25.350> score<00:01:25.560> two

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
thought more clearly on top to score two

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.760 
thought more clearly on top to score two
goals<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.280> making<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.759> 3-1<00:01:27.200> when<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.350> first

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
goals so making it 3-1 when we first

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
goals so making it 3-1 when we first
walked<00:01:28.979> onto<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.459> field<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.909> don't<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.270> we

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
walked onto the field I don't think we

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.059 
walked onto the field I don't think we
were<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.569> ready<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.080> scored<00:01:31.619> an<00:01:31.679> early<00:01:31.740> goal

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
were that ready I scored an early goal

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.100 
were that ready I scored an early goal
on<00:01:32.310> us<00:01:32.459> which<00:01:32.789> brought<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.959> we're<00:01:34.080> all

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
on us which brought out and we're all

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.199 
on us which brought out and we're all
down<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.250> picked<00:01:35.459> it<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.670> we<00:01:35.819> showed<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.060> lot

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:36.209 
down but we picked it up we showed a lot

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:38.240 
down but we picked it up we showed a lot
of<00:01:36.240> character<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.590> came<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:37.950> top

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
of character and it came out on top

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.940 
of character and it came out on top
their<00:01:39.119> style<00:01:39.899> of<00:01:40.019> players<00:01:40.259> are<00:01:40.470> different

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
their style of players are different

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.029 
their style of players are different
because<00:01:41.039> they<00:01:41.310> were<00:01:41.509> faster<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.039> physical

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
because they were faster and physical

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.929 
because they were faster and physical
very<00:01:44.610> strong

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.420 

very<00:01:48.570> physical<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.619> had<00:01:50.009> physical

very physical and I had physical

00:01:50.430 --> 00:02:00.200 
very physical and I had physical
dominance<00:01:50.579> over<00:01:50.909> us<00:01:58.549> when<00:01:59.549> they<00:01:59.670> scored<00:01:59.939> first

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
dominance over us when they scored first

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.910 
dominance over us when they scored first
I<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> little<00:02:00.750> nervous<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.439> when<00:02:01.770> we

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
I was a little nervous but when we

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.980 
I was a little nervous but when we
explored<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.460> got<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> little<00:02:03.299> confidence<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
explored I got a little confidence and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.370 
explored I got a little confidence and
then<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.200> scored<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.490> second<00:02:05.850> half<00:02:05.970> was<00:02:06.380> highly

mr. penalty kick that's a little
disappointing<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.860> could<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.220> made<00:02:26.340> the

high-quality<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:56.599> saw<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:56.930> game<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.349> thought

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
high-quality you saw the game I thought

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.780 
high-quality you saw the game I thought
they<00:03:57.709> were<00:03:57.769> excellent

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
they were excellent

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.729 
they were excellent
I<00:03:58.819> thought<00:03:59.510> our<00:03:59.569> boys<00:03:59.930> did<00:04:00.200> exceptionally

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
I thought our boys did exceptionally

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.599 
I thought our boys did exceptionally
well<00:04:00.799> to<00:04:01.450> gain<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.480> nil<00:04:02.900> nil<00:04:03.049> draw<00:04:03.370> but<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:04.459> was<00:04:04.549> a

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
well to gain a nil nil draw but it was a

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.520 
well to gain a nil nil draw but it was a
game<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.940> wasn't<00:04:05.390> without<00:04:05.599> chances<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.290> think

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
game that wasn't without chances I think

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.770 
game that wasn't without chances I think
we<00:04:06.739> in<00:04:07.010> first<00:04:07.280> half<00:04:07.489> we<00:04:07.760> had<00:04:08.000> three<00:04:08.629> or<00:04:08.660> four

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
we in first half we had three or four

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.960 
we in first half we had three or four
clear<00:04:09.349> chances<00:04:09.829> that<00:04:09.950> could<00:04:10.489> have<00:04:10.609> gone<00:04:10.760> in

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
clear chances that could have gone in

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.030 
clear chances that could have gone in
and<00:04:11.180> in<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:11.989> second<00:04:12.349> half<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.560> think<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:12.890> they

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
and in the second half I think that they

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.000 
and in the second half I think that they
had<00:04:13.250> one<00:04:13.549> or<00:04:13.579> two<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:14.090> obviously<00:04:14.890> gave<00:04:15.890> us

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
had one or two that obviously gave us

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.430 
had one or two that obviously gave us
some<00:04:16.130> trouble<00:04:16.310> but<00:04:16.850> overall<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.209> thought<00:04:17.539> for

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
some trouble but overall I thought for

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.349 
some trouble but overall I thought for
given<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:18.949> circumstances<00:04:19.519> for<00:04:19.669> our<00:04:19.820> guys<00:04:20.000> and

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
given the circumstances for our guys and

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.960 
given the circumstances for our guys and
third<00:04:20.900> game<00:04:21.139> in<00:04:21.289> four<00:04:21.590> days<00:04:21.799> third<00:04:22.460> high-level

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
third game in four days third high-level

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.029 
third game in four days third high-level
game<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.240> four<00:04:23.419> days<00:04:23.539> I<00:04:23.720> thought<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.169> our

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
game in four days I thought that our

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.279 
game in four days I thought that our
response<00:04:25.400> was<00:04:25.580> excellent<00:04:25.970> Inter<00:04:26.449> Milan<00:04:26.600> was<00:04:27.260> a

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
response was excellent Inter Milan was a

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.350 
response was excellent Inter Milan was a
tight<00:04:27.770> and<00:04:28.099> hard<00:04:28.490> game<00:04:29.050> we<00:04:30.050> pushed<00:04:30.380> hard<00:04:31.360> score

tight and hard game we pushed hard score

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:44.600 
tight and hard game we pushed hard score
but<00:04:32.720> we<00:04:32.750> just<00:04:33.110> couldn't<00:04:33.349> get<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.590> in

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.790 

today's<00:04:45.240> game<00:04:45.539> was<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.870> very<00:04:46.139> tough<00:04:46.289> one<00:04:46.680> they

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800
