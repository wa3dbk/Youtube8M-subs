the<00:01:05.600> rubidium<00:01:06.100> here<00:01:07.100> it<00:01:07.220> is<00:01:07.310> is<00:01:08.180> that<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:08.539> well

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
the rubidium here it is is that it well

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:10.960 
the rubidium here it is is that it well
he<00:01:09.320> might<00:01:09.409> not<00:01:09.649> look<00:01:09.890> like<00:01:09.950> much<00:01:10.190> Richard<00:01:10.820> but

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
he might not look like much Richard but

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.820 
he might not look like much Richard but
it's<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.149> highly<00:01:11.509> reactive<00:01:11.659> metal<00:01:12.289> it's<00:01:12.500> sealed

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
it's a highly reactive metal it's sealed

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
right so what's going to happen when you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.120 
right so what's going to happen when you
drop<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:17.899> in<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.110> water<00:01:18.289> well<00:01:18.680> imagine<00:01:18.890> if

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
drop that in the water well imagine if

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.740 
drop that in the water well imagine if
you<00:01:19.250> will<00:01:19.369> letting<00:01:19.789> off<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:19.909> hand<00:01:20.210> grenade<00:01:20.360> in<00:01:20.659> a

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
you will letting off a hand grenade in a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.559 
you will letting off a hand grenade in a
bathtub<00:01:20.960> right<00:01:21.710> out<00:01:21.920> I'm<00:01:22.130> off<00:01:22.369> have<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.940> okay

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
bathtub right out I'm off have that okay

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:31.059 
bathtub right out I'm off have that okay
good<00:01:23.899> luck<00:01:28.119> okay<00:01:29.119> tickle<00:01:29.560> drop<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.710> rubidium

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
good luck okay tickle drop the rubidium

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.210 
good luck okay tickle drop the rubidium
in<00:01:31.429> the<00:01:31.759> water<00:01:32.470> stand<00:01:33.470> back<00:01:33.649> everybody<00:01:33.979> this

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
in the water stand back everybody this

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.550 
in the water stand back everybody this
one's<00:01:34.460> gonna<00:01:34.670> be<00:01:34.759> bad<00:01:35.000> two<00:01:35.690> grams<00:01:36.020> of<00:01:36.259> rubidium

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
one's gonna be bad two grams of rubidium

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.350 
one's gonna be bad two grams of rubidium
will<00:01:36.890> only<00:01:37.039> react<00:01:37.520> when<00:01:37.759> our<00:01:37.880> specially

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
will only react when our specially

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.210 
will only react when our specially
designed<00:01:38.539> vial<00:01:39.200> dissolves<00:01:39.979> in<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.130> water

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
designed vial dissolves in the water

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.639 
designed vial dissolves in the water
which<00:01:41.000> gives<00:01:41.209> John<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.450> few<00:01:41.750> crucial<00:01:42.049> seconds

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
which gives John a few crucial seconds

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:59.090 
which gives John a few crucial seconds
to<00:01:42.799> get<00:01:42.890> into<00:01:43.159> our<00:01:43.280> safety<00:01:43.759> zone

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.940 

yes<00:02:00.660> that<00:02:01.660> is<00:02:01.690> more<00:02:02.080> like<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.380> only<00:02:02.830> on

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
yes that is more like it only on

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.670 
yes that is more like it only on
Brainiac<00:02:03.490> do<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:03.730> get<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:03.910> kind<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.680> science

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
Brainiac do you get that kind of science

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.620 
Brainiac do you get that kind of science
but<00:02:06.100> I<00:02:06.130> believe<00:02:06.430> we<00:02:06.670> can<00:02:06.700> go<00:02:06.940> one<00:02:07.180> better<00:02:07.390> there

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
but I believe we can go one better there

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.150 
but I believe we can go one better there
is<00:02:07.690> one<00:02:07.900> more<00:02:08.110> alkaline<00:02:08.500> metal<00:02:08.890> we<00:02:08.979> can

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
is one more alkaline metal we can

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.340 
is one more alkaline metal we can
legally<00:02:09.670> rooms<00:02:09.940> yes<00:02:10.390> we<00:02:10.540> should<00:02:10.600> cesium<00:02:11.200> the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
legally rooms yes we should cesium the

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.140 
legally rooms yes we should cesium the
Emperor<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:11.890> alkali<00:02:12.340> metals<00:02:12.700> particularly
