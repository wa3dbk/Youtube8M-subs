00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.269
 the vibrations are electromagnetic 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.059
 there is a lot more 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.700
 Frequency spectrum and only a minimal 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.450
 part of this electromagnetic 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.880
 is visible as light at all 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.369
 more than 100 years we transmit with 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.830
 help electromagnetic fields 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.140
 Information for example in the radio and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.189
 on TV 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 also the mobile uses 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.989
 electromagnetic fields in austria 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.170
 send the operators with radio waves in the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.140
 range of 900 and 1800 megahertz in the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.110
 umts network in the frequency range of 2000 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.469
 megahertz and lte sends in the 2600 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.270
 megahertz area you wanted the whole 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.790
 Austria with only one 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.500
 you would supply mobile radio transmission mast 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.070
 a mobile radio system with very high 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.090
 need near the power 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.780
 mobile radio system, the performance would be very 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.030
 high on the edge but only very weak 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.549
 your own mobile phone would have to significantly 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.990
 send higher power 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.689
 In addition mountains and tall houses stand in the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.229
 throw away the shadows and a funk hole 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.770
 Leave areas so the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.530
 electromagnetic waves are not 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.119
 achieve the goal of one 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.819
 nationwide and efficient 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.079
 Mobile communication throughout Austria 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.030
 So it would be with only one central 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.759
 mobile radio system not to meet 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.840
 because almost 70 percent of all phone calls 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.130
 be conducted over the mobile network 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.429
 the alternative is the installation 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.740
 a cellular network so lets itself 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.909
 the shadows illuminate the obstacles 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.380
 work around and avoid dead spots 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.899
 And that's exactly how the mobile radio builds 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.329
 Operate your networks instead of one 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.149
 There are many small mobile communications systems 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.149
 currently around 20,000 throughout Austria 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.250
 when calling with smartphone or 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.410
 mobile phone, the data is not directly from 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.320
 transferred from one terminal to another 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.850
 the closest 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.830
 mobile radio station picks up the signals 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.710
 and directs them via radio and 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.730
 cable networks to other phones landline 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.010
 participants or in the internet on 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.230
 it fit mobile radio and mobile phone 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.180
 your broadcasting power is dynamic 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.700
 the closer the mobile phone gets to the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.180
 Mobile communications system is the lower 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.340
 is the required transmit power therefore 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.900
 beat the network operators 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.690
 Aerial locations in central location of 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.880
 radio cell in front of the target with minimal 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.420
 the service area of ​​the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.400
 complete radio cell is covered 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.470
 the antenna of the mobile radio station on the edge 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.240
 a radio cell to be higher 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.560
 required because the 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.840
 distance are greater 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.220
 I knew a comparison if 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.470
 they talk to somebody of them 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.440
 then sitting across from me, I can whisper 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.870
 there we are still getting higher 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.780
 Way is up there on the mountain 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.489
 then I have to let him understand me 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.489
 and that's exactly how it is with the 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.530
 mobile radio stations the closer the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.540
 mobile stations on her hands 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.860
 the less his mobile station 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.050
 and of course you also send less 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.980
 mobile 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.840
 but we can not just mobile 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.910
 phoning sms writing and surfing 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.100
 when we are inside a radio cell 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.959
 but also if we are with the 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.959
 train or car 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.670
 while the cell phone from radio cell to 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.860
 radio cell passed without us 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.400
 notice something of that and without that 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.140
 connection is interrupted 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.900
 but it does not matter if we move 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.079
 or not a single mobile station 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.970
 can only do a limited amount of data 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.340
 transport by the amount of data 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.780
 the mobile broadband internet usage 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.519
 grows experts expect to 2015 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.359
 an increase in mobile 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.140
 transported amount of data to about 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:03.569
 220,000 terabytes per year 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.609
 in order to cope with this the net of 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.730
 the wireless network planning optimally expanded 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.049
 computer programs will simulate the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.690
 localization of each individual 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.900
 mobile radio until you get the right one 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.060
 location has found in the sum of 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.760
 radio cells is created as a network that 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.580
 minimum transmission power with high 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.500
 Data capacity connects are the 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.320
 individual radio cells in the country at 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.940
 lower data volumes are greater than in 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.639
 densely populated areas with high 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.169
 Capacity requirements here are the cells 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.900
 until has smaller and a muddy 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.610
 organized in metropolitan areas are the 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.370
 Number of participants very dense 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.510
 is called the number of participants one 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.240
 last limited and that 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.400
 supply area so very small 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.990
 advantage is that thereby the 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.310
 actual transmission power for the cell 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.310
 can be much smaller
