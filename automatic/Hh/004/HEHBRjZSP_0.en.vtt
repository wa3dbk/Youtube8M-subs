stick around you it never you'd be
surprised<00:02:31.610> how<00:02:31.640> many<00:02:31.819> times<00:02:31.940> I've<00:02:32.300> found

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
surprised how many times I've found

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.170 
surprised how many times I've found
money<00:02:32.840> just<00:02:33.200> like

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.699 

what's<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:39.900> interesting<00:02:40.379> because<00:02:40.530> we're

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
what's this interesting because we're

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.350 
what's this interesting because we're
going<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.860> try<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.189> same<00:02:41.549> thing<00:02:41.610> when<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.120> met

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
going to try the same thing when I met

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360 
going to try the same thing when I met
Monroeville<00:02:43.049> two<00:02:43.260> guys<00:02:43.530> because<00:02:43.799> Monroeville

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
Monroeville two guys because Monroeville

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.869 
Monroeville two guys because Monroeville
has<00:02:44.870> bunch<00:02:45.870> more<00:02:46.079> coins<00:02:46.379> in<00:02:46.590> here<00:02:46.709> their<00:02:47.040> their

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
has bunch more coins in here their their

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.640 
has bunch more coins in here their their
little<00:02:48.120> divider<00:02:48.510> back<00:02:48.840> there<00:02:49.079> is<00:02:49.200> actually

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
little divider back there is actually

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.890 
little divider back there is actually
higher<00:02:49.860> than<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.159> one<00:02:50.370> that's<00:02:50.459> here<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.689> that

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
higher than the one that's here so that

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.160 
higher than the one that's here so that
may<00:02:52.170> prove<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.060> better<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:54.720> let's<00:02:54.900> see<00:02:55.140> if

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
may prove to be better but let's see if

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.820 
may prove to be better but let's see if
we<00:02:55.620> were

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.680 

as<00:03:01.040> input<00:03:01.430> five<00:03:01.670> walks<00:03:02.000> in<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:02.360> ended<00:03:02.810> up

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
as input five walks in and ended up

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.170 
as input five walks in and ended up
one

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.690 

three-fifty<00:03:08.180> backs<00:03:08.739> it's<00:03:09.739> not<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.069> total<00:03:10.670> loss

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
three-fifty backs it's not a total loss

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.270

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
but we did determine that one try $5 and

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.540 
but we did determine that one try $5 and
this<00:03:30.330> did<00:03:30.570> give<00:03:30.780> me<00:03:30.990> out<00:03:31.200> 350<00:03:31.890> back<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.340> just
