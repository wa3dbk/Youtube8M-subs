00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:14.070
 pious I have not 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.090
 pffffffffffffff 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.279
 good morning back 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.609
 power pleasure that I accepted today to talk to you 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.360
 why 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.460
 I must say that I am thrilled by the possibilities we have 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.280
 insiders 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.990
 bring the message to people that express quintessence at the quintessence 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.250
 of our experience you can buy guides of psychologists 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.710
 clear learn something of motivation we learn these things in the field 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.840
 with our experience 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.190
 and so it is something that I really like to share 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.120
 this experience hoping that 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.610
 it is a union of you and perhaps remains imprinted or not 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.970
 the single aspect in the singular that 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.530
 which becomes a strong lyre in your professional life 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.740
 bad photoset then 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.810
 I know that yesterday you already met alessandra sensini that starting from the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.850
 his experience of talking about lasting sailing live a career so many things that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.500
 ofa checking pippo spotr year maybe playing to family members however i think 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.950
 that the beauty and the charm of the experience of waiting for details 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.729
 of the path that in those that are winning so often resemble each other 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.350
 so if something sounds familiar to you 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.920
 and bay sitter to force a concert 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.010
 then I thought of the particular this a three-step intervention I seek 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.910
 I left when the motivations grew and we have it 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.729
 we manipulative we have molded with our hands I always say us 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.330
 because here as well as my husband and we have been inventing ourselves for twenty years 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.210
 together this enterprise 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.190
 and then you want me to rain and pull out. some key words ask you can bring 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.870
 own house with communal macs my bible compared to a check up that you can maybe 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.939
 Making your plant look like I enjoyed a very first year intervention 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.189
 a passage of those who preceded me when the PC goes to this aspect 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.650
 Particular of the German companies that allow it is an increase in compensation 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.689
 &amp; quot I am an example of slow growth 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.549
 I left you discovered by canoe because he had told my sister that I was 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.340
 protected by a mixer 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.370
 sti feature a little foreigner then head goes from the same moment as me 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.199
 hunting always gets in trouble 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.899
 and she is a miniature mom hunts me bini pulled me out of these 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:52.460
 so what things did I go canoeing 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.790
 because with her I felt protected with her was a testament to a group of 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.290
 paris spigno bound have not started with the motivation of becoming strong 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.979
 I get a good grade I vote to do what he was doing which he was going to 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.979
 opposite sense compared to what was the goal of the company 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.920
 you would be a talent scout on young talents for the sport of Calabria 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.079
 saved for other reasons 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.079
 validity and pulls out a sample for those who eventually became but 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.079
 who would have ever said that I always had water i 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.959
 so that is, they would not have bet on me when you want other things and then 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.520
 those days when you learned to stay around you 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.100
 it turned out that she had a young easter talent for the brand 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.180
 on TV it was a side effect it was not 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:45.549
 best precise project 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.489
 you became it 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.129
 love of parody motivation 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.519
 but also of what can of many warnings
