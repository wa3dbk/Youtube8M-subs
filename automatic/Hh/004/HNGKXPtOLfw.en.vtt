at<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.059> beginning<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> game<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:05.159> doesn't

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
at the beginning of the game it doesn't

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.300 
at the beginning of the game it doesn't
explode<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.170> want<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:08.040> throw<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.609 
explode so if you want to throw a
grenade<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.479> wait<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.930> least<00:01:09.990> five

grenade you have to wait at least five
seconds<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.310> pretty<00:01:11.490> sure<00:01:11.670> that's<00:01:11.820> what<00:01:11.939> it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
seconds I'm pretty sure that's what it

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.490 
seconds I'm pretty sure that's what it
is<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.689> quickly<00:01:15.810> before<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.320> actually

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
is so very quickly before I actually

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.080 
is so very quickly before I actually
started<00:01:16.740> talking<00:01:17.040> about<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.280> gameplay<00:01:17.549> I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
started talking about this gameplay I

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
started talking about this gameplay I

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
it's not really a fight because you

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.899 
it's not really a fight because you
don't<00:01:22.560> fight<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.250> best<00:01:23.400> friend<00:01:23.729> you

look at his back he's using an RPG as a

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.620 
look at his back he's using an RPG as a
secondary<00:03:45.519> I<00:03:45.670> don't<00:03:45.820> know<00:03:45.880> why<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.120> do<00:03:46.450> that

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
secondary I don't know why you do that

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.170 
secondary I don't know why you do that
anyway<00:03:47.410> i'm<00:03:47.530> using<00:03:47.769> lightweight<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.400> steady

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
anyway i'm using lightweight and steady

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.520 
anyway i'm using lightweight and steady
aim<00:03:49.450> also<00:03:49.989> lightweight<00:03:50.650> because<00:03:52.320> every<00:03:53.320> round

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
aim also lightweight because every round

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.229 
aim also lightweight because every round
is<00:03:53.830> very<00:03:54.040> short<00:03:54.400> so<00:03:54.489> i<00:03:54.700> don't<00:03:54.880> need<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.090> worry

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
is very short so i don't need to worry

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.230 
is very short so i don't need to worry
about

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
about

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.550 
about
running<00:03:58.240> out<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.420> ammo<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.140> that's<00:03:59.290> why<00:03:59.440> i'm

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
running out of ammo so that's why i'm

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.860 
running out of ammo so that's why i'm
not<00:03:59.590> using<00:03:59.860> scavenger<00:04:00.520> and<00:04:00.670> steady<00:04:01.510> aim<00:04:01.720> is

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
not using scavenger and steady aim is

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.750 
not using scavenger and steady aim is
important<00:04:02.319> but<00:04:02.380> get<00:04:02.530> long<00:04:02.770> running<00:04:03.130> around<00:04:03.490> i

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
important but get long running around i

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.750 
important but get long running around i
might<00:04:04.450> want<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:05.140> run<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.650> gun<00:04:05.890> which<00:04:06.610> is

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
pretty simple it's just running around

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
i'm going to use steadying so i got my

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.730

fault<00:04:34.510> that<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.169> game<00:04:35.350> was<00:04:35.650> designed<00:04:35.860> this

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
fault that the game was designed this

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.370 
fault that the game was designed this
way<00:04:36.520> this<00:04:37.300> is<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.510> first<00:04:37.840> game<00:04:38.050> I've<00:04:38.260> ever

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
way this is the first game I've ever

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.140 
way this is the first game I've ever
done<00:04:38.800> that<00:04:38.860> and<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.460> wasn't<00:04:39.730> just<00:04:39.820> like<00:04:40.030> I

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
done that and it wasn't just like I

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.420 
done that and it wasn't just like I
thought<00:04:40.300> of<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:40.990> before<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.890> I<00:04:41.980> wanted<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.340> do

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
thought of it before and I wanted to do

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.340 
thought of it before and I wanted to do
it<00:04:42.520> when<00:04:42.640> I<00:04:42.669> got<00:04:42.850> on<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:43.240> was<00:04:43.750> just<00:04:43.870> throwing<00:04:44.140> the

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
it when I got on I was just throwing the

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.840 
it when I got on I was just throwing the
grenade<00:04:44.440> over<00:04:44.919> there<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.250> seeing<00:04:45.580> if<00:04:45.730> I<00:04:45.790> can

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
grenade over there and seeing if I can

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.850 
grenade over there and seeing if I can
get<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.060> kill<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.540> did<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:46.900> then<00:04:46.930> I<00:04:47.020> did<00:04:47.740> it

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
get a kill and I did and then I did it

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.610 
get a kill and I did and then I did it
again<00:04:47.979> so<00:04:48.880> if<00:04:49.450> you're<00:04:49.630> on<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.870> other<00:04:49.900> side<00:04:50.140> all

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
again so if you're on the other side all

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.950 
again so if you're on the other side all
I<00:04:50.680> can<00:04:50.919> tell<00:04:51.100> you<00:04:51.160> is<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.700> avoid<00:04:52.300> going<00:04:52.570> that

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
I can tell you is to avoid going that

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.340 
I can tell you is to avoid going that
way<00:04:53.140> or<00:04:53.560> just<00:04:54.070> wait<00:04:55.000> a<00:04:55.240> couple<00:04:55.540> seconds<00:04:56.110> before

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
way or just wait a couple seconds before

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.040 
way or just wait a couple seconds before
you<00:04:57.220> go<00:04:57.460> because<00:04:57.880> if<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:58.840> don't<00:04:58.900> have

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
you go because if you don't have

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.200 
you go because if you don't have
scavenger<00:04:59.590> on<00:04:59.740> you<00:05:00.250> only<00:05:00.400> have<00:05:00.610> one<00:05:00.850> grenade

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
scavenger on you only have one grenade

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.240 
scavenger on you only have one grenade
so<00:05:01.720> assuming<00:05:02.200> that<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.500> other<00:05:02.650> team<00:05:02.950> doesn't

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
so assuming that the other team doesn't

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.250 
so assuming that the other team doesn't
have<00:05:03.490> scavenger<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:04.270> there<00:05:04.750> really<00:05:04.870> is<00:05:05.110> no

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
have scavenger and there really is no

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.630 
have scavenger and there really is no
reason<00:05:05.410> for<00:05:05.680> them<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.830> have<00:05:06.010> it<00:05:06.040> on<00:05:06.430> me

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
reason for them to have it on me

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.640 
reason for them to have it on me
assuming<00:05:07.600> they<00:05:07.690> do<00:05:07.870> have<00:05:08.020> scavenger<00:05:08.500> that's

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
assuming they do have scavenger that's

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.950 
assuming they do have scavenger that's
six<00:05:08.919> or<00:05:09.100> nades<00:05:09.280> and<00:05:09.610> out<00:05:10.330> of<00:05:10.570> those<00:05:10.660> six

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
six or nades and out of those six

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.779 
six or nades and out of those six
grenades<00:05:11.350> how<00:05:11.890> many<00:05:12.100> do<00:05:12.280> you<00:05:12.340> really<00:05:12.610> think

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
grenades how many do you really think

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:13.920 
grenades how many do you really think
you're<00:05:12.850> going<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.090> come<00:05:13.150> flying<00:05:13.419> at<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:13.870> in

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
you're going to come flying at you in

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.430 
you're going to come flying at you in
the<00:05:14.020> beginning<00:05:14.140> of<00:05:14.410> the<00:05:14.500> game<00:05:14.650> not<00:05:15.370> too<00:05:15.550> many

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
the beginning of the game not too many

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.830 
the beginning of the game not too many
so<00:05:17.440> I<00:05:17.729> want<00:05:18.729> you<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:18.940> let<00:05:19.090> me<00:05:19.120> know<00:05:19.240> what<00:05:19.720> you

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
so I want you to let me know what you

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.090 
so I want you to let me know what you
think<00:05:20.080> about<00:05:20.229> that<00:05:20.530> grenade<00:05:20.830> throwing

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
think about that grenade throwing

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.390 
think about that grenade throwing
technique<00:05:21.640> because<00:05:22.150> I<00:05:22.450> found<00:05:23.380> it<00:05:23.650> very<00:05:24.010> very

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
technique because I found it very very

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.150 
technique because I found it very very
useful<00:05:25.050> so<00:05:26.050> this<00:05:26.200> brings<00:05:26.380> me<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.860> last

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
useful so this brings me to the last

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.060 
useful so this brings me to the last
