00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
that want to control synthesizers it's

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.910 
that want to control synthesizers it's
not<00:00:09.510> meant<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.780> replace<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.290> electric<00:00:10.620> guitar

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
not meant to replace the electric guitar

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.770 
not meant to replace the electric guitar
or<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.190> acoustic<00:00:11.700> guitar<00:00:12.000> although<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.599> can

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
or the acoustic guitar although it can

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.780 
or the acoustic guitar although it can
sound<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.200> bit<00:00:13.230> like<00:00:13.410> them<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.889> idea<00:00:14.250> though<00:00:14.429> is

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
sound a bit like them the idea though is

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.120 
sound a bit like them the idea though is
that<00:00:15.000> if<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.630> play<00:00:15.809> guitar<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.740> can<00:00:16.920> very

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
that if you can play guitar you can very

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.680 
that if you can play guitar you can very
quickly<00:00:17.310> get<00:00:17.640> used<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.119> instrument

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
quickly get used to this instrument

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.660 
quickly get used to this instrument
because<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.050> familiar<00:00:19.260> aspects<00:00:20.100> for

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
because of the familiar aspects for

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.550 
because of the familiar aspects for
example<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.180> neck<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.689> structure<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
example the neck is the structure the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.620 
example the neck is the structure the
same<00:00:22.830> way<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> normal<00:00:23.460> car<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.330> if<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.510> can

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
same way as a normal car so if you can

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.570 
same way as a normal car so if you can
play<00:00:24.750> chords<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.529> regular<00:00:25.980> guitar<00:00:26.250> you'll

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
play chords on a regular guitar you'll

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.070 
play chords on a regular guitar you'll
be<00:00:26.670> able<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.820> play<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.570> give<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
be able to play on this I give you a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.200 
be able to play on this I give you a
quick<00:00:28.289> example<00:00:31.520> so<00:00:32.520> what<00:00:32.669> I'm<00:00:32.759> doing<00:00:33.000> there<00:00:33.149> is

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
quick example so what I'm doing there is

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940 
quick example so what I'm doing there is
controlling<00:00:33.840> it's<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.140> an<00:00:34.440> onboard

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
controlling it's in an onboard

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.200 
controlling it's in an onboard
synthesizer<00:00:35.430> by<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.700> way<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.059> all

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
synthesizer by the way it's all

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.049 
synthesizer by the way it's all
electronic<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> idea<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.640> chords

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
electronic but the idea is the chords

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.459 
electronic but the idea is the chords
are<00:00:39.180> exactly<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> same<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> regular

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
are exactly the same as in a regular

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.350 
are exactly the same as in a regular
guitar<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:41.190> where<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.340> tap<00:00:41.700> changes<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
guitar but where I tap changes of the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.299 
guitar but where I tap changes of the
sound<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.260> see<00:00:43.410> if<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.620> tap<00:00:43.829> from<00:00:44.010> high

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
sound so you can see if I tap from high

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.880 
sound so you can see if I tap from high
low<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> lower<00:00:45.420> your<00:00:46.050> actually<00:00:46.469> hear<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
low I to lower your actually hear the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.810 
low I to lower your actually hear the
not<00:00:47.039> get<00:00:47.219> louder

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.580 

if<00:00:52.120> I<00:00:52.300> go<00:00:52.480> from<00:00:52.600> one<00:00:52.810> side<00:00:53.050> to<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.230> other<00:00:53.350> i'm

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
if I go from one side to the other i'm

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.290 
if I go from one side to the other i'm
going<00:00:53.739> to<00:00:53.800> morph<00:00:54.070> one<00:00:54.370> sound<00:00:54.730> into<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.150> other

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
going to morph one sound into the other

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.279 
going to morph one sound into the other
like<00:00:55.540> this

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.630 

so<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.500> hear<00:01:01.710> how<00:01:01.770> actually<00:01:02.190> controlling

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
so you can hear how actually controlling

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.450 
so you can hear how actually controlling
to<00:01:02.879> synth<00:01:03.180> patches<00:01:04.129> without<00:01:05.129> actually

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
to synth patches without actually

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.039 
to synth patches without actually
telling<00:01:05.580> any<00:01:05.820> control<00:01:06.420> knobs<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:06.930> okay<00:01:09.049> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
telling any control knobs at all okay so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.710 
telling any control knobs at all okay so
then<00:01:11.009> let<00:01:11.520> me<00:01:11.610> bring<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> sound<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.570> just

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
then let me bring up the sound and just

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.180 
then let me bring up the sound and just
show<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.259> do<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.650> various

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
show you what you can do with various

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.760 
show you what you can do with various
controls<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.229> let<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.409> up<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.649> new

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
controls so I just let it up a new

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.290 
controls so I just let it up a new
preset<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.550> instrument<00:01:21.119> sounds

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
preset now the instrument sounds

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.280 
preset now the instrument sounds
completely<00:01:21.509> different<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.170> let's<00:01:22.350> try<00:01:22.530> it

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
completely different so let's try it

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.160 
completely different so let's try it
invite

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.359 

I'm<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.290> tapping<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.799> lot<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> energy

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
I'm just tapping a lot of energy

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.270 
I'm just tapping a lot of energy
drumming<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:31.140> concept<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.680> three<00:01:31.920> different

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
drumming the concept of three different

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.770 
drumming the concept of three different
this<00:01:33.460> is<00:01:33.610> more<00:01:33.880> about<00:01:34.030> controlling

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
this is more about controlling

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.109 
this is more about controlling
electronic<00:01:35.380> music<00:01:35.409> so<00:01:36.280> as<00:01:36.610> you<00:01:36.820> can<00:01:36.909> see<00:01:37.060> the

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
electronic music so as you can see the

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.760 
electronic music so as you can see the
ball<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.659> screen<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:38.110> now<00:01:38.290> i'm<00:01:38.560> going<00:01:38.710> to

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
ball on the screen and now i'm going to

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:48.200 
ball on the screen and now i'm going to
move<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.700> around<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:40.330> control<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.690> filter

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 

that's<00:01:49.210> controlling<00:01:49.540> two<00:01:49.750> parameters

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that's controlling two parameters

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.780 
that's controlling two parameters
simultaneously<00:01:51.100> there's<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.490> filter

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
simultaneously there's the filter

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.490 
simultaneously there's the filter
frequency<00:01:51.970> cutoff<00:01:52.450> in<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:52.780> filter<00:01:52.990> resonance

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
frequency cutoff in the filter resonance

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.590 
frequency cutoff in the filter resonance
to<00:01:53.950> come<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.130> combination<00:01:54.790> that<00:01:55.000> gets<00:01:55.509> a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
to come a combination that gets a

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.620 
to come a combination that gets a
chemical<00:01:56.020> species<00:01:56.500> out<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.850> if<00:01:58.030> you<00:01:58.240> want<00:01:58.479> now

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
chemical species out but if you want now

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.510 
chemical species out but if you want now
I<00:01:58.869> can<00:01:59.020> actually<00:01:59.140> change<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.799> preset<00:02:00.130> which

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
I can actually change the preset which

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.740 
I can actually change the preset which
will<00:02:00.700> completely<00:02:01.119> change<00:02:01.299> how<00:02:01.600> the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
will completely change how the

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.680 
will completely change how the
instrument<00:02:02.259> sounds<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:02.860> how<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.340> reacts<00:02:06.690> so

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
instrument sounds and how it reacts so

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.510 
instrument sounds and how it reacts so
now<00:02:07.840> we've<00:02:08.020> got<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.170> guitar<00:02:08.350> sound<00:02:08.860> plugged<00:02:09.369> in

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
now we've got a guitar sound plugged in

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.059 
now we've got a guitar sound plugged in
and<00:02:09.759> this<00:02:10.660> ball<00:02:10.959> doesn't<00:02:11.230> control<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.650> filter

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
and this ball doesn't control the filter

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.800 
and this ball doesn't control the filter
anymore<00:02:12.370> it's<00:02:12.489> controlling<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.090> distortion

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
anymore it's controlling the distortion

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.559 
anymore it's controlling the distortion
of<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.920> gain<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.760> distortion<00:02:16.300> to

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
of the the gain of the distortion to

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:25.620 
of the the gain of the distortion to
watch<00:02:23.760> instead<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.910> strumming<00:02:25.209> I'm<00:02:25.420> tapping

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
watch instead of strumming I'm tapping

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.330 
watch instead of strumming I'm tapping
and<00:02:25.959> where<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.170> tap<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.590> screen<00:02:26.769> changes<00:02:27.280> a

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
and where I tap on the screen changes a

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.920 
and where I tap on the screen changes a
sound<00:02:27.610> for<00:02:27.790> example<00:02:27.850> tap<00:02:28.420> on<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.569> right-hand

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
sound for example tap on the right-hand

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.240 
sound for example tap on the right-hand
side<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.319> screen<00:02:29.350> it's<00:02:29.680> going<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.890> swell

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
side of the screen it's going to swell

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.840 
side of the screen it's going to swell
the<00:02:30.280> cord<00:02:31.739> graduates<00:02:32.739> have<00:02:32.890> left<00:02:33.430> hand<00:02:33.670> side

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
the cord graduates have left hand side

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.100 
the cord graduates have left hand side
of<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.030> screen<00:02:34.120> because<00:02:34.420> you're<00:02:34.660> right<00:02:34.900> it's

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
of the screen because you're right it's

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:44.490 
of the screen because you're right it's
going<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.319> have<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> fast<00:02:35.920> attack

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.820 

hello

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.920 

I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.869 

so<00:02:52.349> to<00:02:52.439> play<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.920> sort<00:02:53.159> of<00:02:53.189> like<00:02:53.370> synthesis

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
so to play this sort of like synthesis

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.270 
so to play this sort of like synthesis
stuff<00:02:54.120> really<00:02:54.689> fast<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:55.349> a<00:02:55.409> keyboard<00:02:55.650> is

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
stuff really fast on a keyboard is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.009 
stuff really fast on a keyboard is
actually<00:02:56.670> good<00:02:56.969> so<00:02:57.000> repetitive<00:02:57.420> it's<00:02:57.780> not

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
actually good so repetitive it's not

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.869 
actually good so repetitive it's not
very<00:02:58.140> comfortable<00:02:58.349> but<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.159> idea<00:02:59.489> is<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.640> it

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
very comfortable but the idea is that it

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.039 
very comfortable but the idea is that it
is<00:03:00.000> comfortable<00:03:00.390> when<00:03:00.540> you're<00:03:00.659> tapping<00:03:00.930> like

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
is comfortable when you're tapping like

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.460 
is comfortable when you're tapping like
this

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.110 

alright<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:08.010> that's<00:03:08.129> one<00:03:08.340> mode<00:03:08.549> that's<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.879> ball

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
alright so that's one mode that's a ball

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.729 
alright so that's one mode that's a ball
mode<00:03:09.329> there's<00:03:09.510> also<00:03:09.689> a<00:03:09.840> string<00:03:10.290> mode<00:03:10.500> if<00:03:10.650> you

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
mode there's also a string mode if you

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.020 
mode there's also a string mode if you
go<00:03:10.829> like<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.129> now<00:03:11.400> suddenly<00:03:11.700> we're<00:03:11.939> in

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
go like this now suddenly we're in

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.309 
go like this now suddenly we're in
string<00:03:12.329> mode<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.629> that<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.840> main<00:03:13.019> mode

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
string mode is that the main mode

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.750 
string mode is that the main mode
because<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.680> can't<00:03:13.890> control<00:03:14.189> the<00:03:14.340> sounds<00:03:14.670> as

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
because you can't control the sounds as

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.449 
because you can't control the sounds as
easily<00:03:15.079> but<00:03:16.079> it<00:03:16.470> does<00:03:16.739> it's<00:03:17.010> there<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:17.370> you

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
easily but it does it's there if you

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.850 
easily but it does it's there if you
want<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:17.670> play<00:03:17.819> typical<00:03:18.540> open<00:03:19.170> pores<00:03:19.620> and

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
want to play typical open pores and

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.670 
want to play typical open pores and
stuff<00:03:20.040> like<00:03:20.159> that<00:03:23.269> as<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.629> can<00:03:24.750> see<00:03:24.930> here<00:03:25.349> if<00:03:25.560> I

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
stuff like that as you can see here if I

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.619 
stuff like that as you can see here if I
strum<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.099> the<00:03:26.159> middle<00:03:26.430> it's<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.760> very<00:03:26.940> low

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
strum in the middle it's a very low

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.229 
strum in the middle it's a very low
distortion<00:03:28.470> sound<00:03:28.799> but<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.609> strum<00:03:29.909> more<00:03:30.120> to

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
distortion sound but as I strum more to

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.789 
distortion sound but as I strum more to
the<00:03:30.359> left<00:03:30.480> or<00:03:30.720> right<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.140> distortion<00:03:31.709> is

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
the left or right the distortion is

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:38.059 
the left or right the distortion is
actually<00:03:32.159> getting<00:03:32.340> higher<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.579> higher

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.140 

so<00:03:38.969> to<00:03:39.030> demonstrate<00:03:39.689> with<00:03:40.109> a<00:03:40.200> cleaner<00:03:40.439> sound

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
so to demonstrate with a cleaner sound

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.489 
so to demonstrate with a cleaner sound
I've<00:03:42.150> just<00:03:42.209> loaded<00:03:42.629> up<00:03:42.689> a<00:03:42.780> really<00:03:42.930> clean<00:03:43.230> sound

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:43.499 
I've just loaded up a really clean sound

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:44.839 
I've just loaded up a really clean sound
and<00:03:43.680> now<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:43.859> sounds<00:03:43.980> completely<00:03:44.310> different

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
and now it sounds completely different

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.320 
and now it sounds completely different
and<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.359> presets<00:03:46.290> morph<00:03:46.560> differently

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
and the presets morph differently

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.080 
and the presets morph differently
as<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.930> go<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.290> left<00:03:49.550> immortal<00:03:50.550> really<00:03:50.910> with

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
as I go to the left immortal really with

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:00.350 
as I go to the left immortal really with
soundscape<00:03:51.750> fine<00:03:52.080> except<00:03:52.470> lot<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.280> delaying

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.640 

so<00:04:01.360> you<00:04:01.480> can<00:04:01.630> experiment<00:04:02.050> with<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.470> do

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
so you can experiment with that do

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.690 
so you can experiment with that do
different<00:04:02.740> things<00:04:02.950> everything's<00:04:03.460> completely

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
different things everything's completely

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.540 
different things everything's completely
configurable<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.480> customizable<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:05.800> you<00:04:05.860> can

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
configurable and customizable so you can

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.220 
configurable and customizable so you can
pretty<00:04:06.760> much<00:04:06.850> make<00:04:07.000> this<00:04:07.420> your<00:04:07.660> instrument

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
pretty much make this your instrument

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.170 
pretty much make this your instrument
however<00:04:08.500> you<00:04:08.590> want<00:04:08.800> there's<00:04:09.730> an<00:04:09.820> onboard

however you want there's an onboard

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.060 
however you want there's an onboard
