they like they like we lost track tank
truck<00:01:12.780> things<00:01:13.369> right<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.729> had<00:01:14.909> those

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
truck things right if they had those

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.880 
truck things right if they had those
because<00:01:15.570> they're<00:01:15.720> faster<00:01:16.200> than<00:01:16.320> thanks<00:01:16.740> but

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
because they're faster than thanks but

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.830 
because they're faster than thanks but
they've<00:01:17.009> also<00:01:17.159> got<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.640> bloody<00:01:18.030> massive<00:01:18.450> gun<00:01:18.689> on

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
they've also got a bloody massive gun on

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.480 
they've also got a bloody massive gun on
the<00:01:18.960> top<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.409> they'd<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.770> pretty<00:01:19.950> good<00:01:20.159> they

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the top so they'd be pretty good they

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.270 
the top so they'd be pretty good they
could<00:01:20.670> be<00:01:20.759> taken<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.119> easily<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.280> think

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
could be taken out easily see I think

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.010 
could be taken out easily see I think
that'd<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.580> interesting<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.299> they<00:01:24.750> trying<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that'd be interesting but they trying to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.380 
that'd be interesting but they trying to
strive<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.350> realism<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.430> maybe<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.090> military

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
strive for realism so maybe if military

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.609 
strive for realism so maybe if military
vehicles<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.930> come<00:01:28.110> after<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.380> after<00:01:28.560> a
