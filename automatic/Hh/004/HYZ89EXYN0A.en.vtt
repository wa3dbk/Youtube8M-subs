in<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:03.070> tutorial<00:00:03.340> we'll<00:00:04.000> show<00:00:04.300> you<00:00:04.330> how<00:00:04.480> to

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:04.600 
in this tutorial we'll show you how to

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.870 
in this tutorial we'll show you how to
create<00:00:04.930> section<00:00:05.769> views<00:00:06.040> of<00:00:06.189> your<00:00:06.430> model<00:00:06.729> that

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
create section views of your model that

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.790 
create section views of your model that
can<00:00:07.029> be<00:00:07.059> interactively<00:00:08.050> moved<00:00:08.290> and<00:00:08.559> rotated

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:08.800 
can be interactively moved and rotated

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.820 
can be interactively moved and rotated
in<00:00:09.370> real<00:00:09.820> time<00:00:10.120> right<00:00:10.930> inside<00:00:11.290> your<00:00:11.440> modeling

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
in real time right inside your modeling

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.339 
in real time right inside your modeling
window<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.880> is<00:00:15.940> real<00:00:16.330> time<00:00:16.599> boolean<00:00:17.080> that

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
window this is real time boolean that

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.170 
window this is real time boolean that
are<00:00:17.439> cutting<00:00:17.800> your<00:00:17.890> objects<00:00:18.400> not<00:00:18.789> just<00:00:19.060> a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
are cutting your objects not just a

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.040 
are cutting your objects not just a
visualization<00:00:19.780> of<00:00:20.230> a<00:00:20.350> section<00:00:20.710> cut<00:00:21.869> let's<00:00:22.869> see

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
visualization of a section cut let's see

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.840 
visualization of a section cut let's see
how<00:00:23.170> this<00:00:23.320> works<00:00:23.560> first<00:00:24.369> thing<00:00:24.610> we'll<00:00:24.730> do<00:00:24.820> is

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
how this works first thing we'll do is

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.730 
how this works first thing we'll do is
select<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.270> big<00:00:25.420> tool<00:00:25.570> and<00:00:26.320> then<00:00:26.440> we'll<00:00:26.560> hold

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
select the big tool and then we'll hold

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.470 
select the big tool and then we'll hold
the<00:00:26.920> shift<00:00:27.100> key<00:00:27.220> down<00:00:27.580> and<00:00:27.910> pick<00:00:28.060> all<00:00:28.300> the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
the shift key down and pick all the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.150 
the shift key down and pick all the
objects<00:00:28.869> that<00:00:29.020> we<00:00:29.140> would<00:00:29.260> like<00:00:29.350> to<00:00:29.470> create<00:00:29.710> a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
objects that we would like to create a

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.389 
objects that we would like to create a
section<00:00:30.730> through<00:00:31.529> then<00:00:32.529> we'll<00:00:32.710> select<00:00:33.129> the

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
section through then we'll select the

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.130 
section through then we'll select the
section<00:00:33.850> tool<00:00:34.089> which<00:00:34.329> is<00:00:34.449> located<00:00:34.780> in<00:00:35.050> the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
section tool which is located in the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.919 
section tool which is located in the
modify<00:00:35.530> suite<00:00:35.859> of<00:00:36.010> tools<00:00:36.569> then<00:00:37.569> we<00:00:37.659> simply

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:37.929 
modify suite of tools then we simply

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:39.569 
modify suite of tools then we simply
click<00:00:38.050> on<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.289> face<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.710> any<00:00:38.920> object<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.550> that

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
click on the face of any object and that

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.739 
click on the face of any object and that
becomes<00:00:39.969> our<00:00:40.179> section<00:00:40.780> plane<00:00:42.329> if<00:00:43.329> you<00:00:43.510> want<00:00:43.659> to

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
becomes our section plane if you want to

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:45.329 
becomes our section plane if you want to
interactively<00:00:44.199> move<00:00:44.440> that<00:00:44.679> section<00:00:45.100> we<00:00:45.219> can

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
interactively move that section we can

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.789 
interactively move that section we can
grab<00:00:45.789> the<00:00:45.909> blue<00:00:46.059> arrow<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:46.600> move<00:00:47.589> it<00:00:47.710> around

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:47.799 
grab the blue arrow and move it around

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:50.369 
grab the blue arrow and move it around
we<00:00:48.729> can<00:00:48.850> grab<00:00:48.999> the<00:00:49.179> green<00:00:49.510> dot<00:00:49.780> which<00:00:50.049> actually

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
we can grab the green dot which actually

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.590 
we can grab the green dot which actually
rotates<00:00:50.829> that<00:00:51.699> section<00:00:52.089> view<00:00:52.329> through<00:00:52.569> the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
rotates that section view through the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.629 
rotates that section view through the
objects<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.679> I<00:00:53.920> can<00:00:54.010> click<00:00:54.159> the<00:00:54.280> red<00:00:54.429> dot
