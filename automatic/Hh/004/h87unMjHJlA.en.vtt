it away you want to fake win because

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.499 
it away you want to fake win because
they<00:01:50.250> could<00:01:50.520> end<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.759> banning<00:01:51.090> your<00:01:51.210> account

right there and then for messing with

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.020 
right there and then for messing with
them<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> never<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.670> saying<00:01:53.850> we

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
have to look at the worst case scenario

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.810

so if you have in fact being
legitimately<00:01:57.420> been<00:01:57.659> hacked<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.290> they<00:01:58.530> will

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
legitimately been hacked so they will

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.179 
legitimately been hacked so they will

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
doesn't matter if you're kind of a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.420 
doesn't matter if you're kind of a
little<00:02:52.630> off<00:02:52.900> because<00:02:53.500> they<00:02:53.739> they<00:02:53.980> just<00:02:54.010> want<00:02:54.370> a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
little off because they they just want a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.330 
little off because they they just want a
rough<00:02:54.820> idea<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:56.440> they<00:02:56.560> can<00:02:56.709> get<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:56.890> good<00:02:57.070> gist

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
rough idea so they can get a good gist

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.490 
rough idea so they can get a good gist
of<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.820> it's<00:02:58.480> mostly<00:02:58.780> because<00:02:59.019> they<00:02:59.350> want

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
of it and it's mostly because they want

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.380 
of it and it's mostly because they want
to<00:02:59.560> be<00:02:59.769> they<00:03:00.010> want<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.280> verify<00:03:00.550> it's<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.180> you

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
to be they want to verify it's you you

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.729 
to be they want to verify it's you you
know<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:01.780> not<00:03:01.900> because<00:03:02.050> they<00:03:02.380> don't<00:03:02.410> know

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
know it's not because they don't know

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.680 
know it's not because they don't know
where<00:03:03.010> your<00:03:03.130> account<00:03:03.489> is<00:03:03.670> of<00:03:03.760> course<00:03:04.000> not<00:03:04.209> this

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
where your account is of course not this

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.790 
where your account is of course not this
is<00:03:04.810> because<00:03:04.959> they<00:03:05.019> want<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.230> verify<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.680> once

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
is because they want to verify and once

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.600 
is because they want to verify and once
they<00:03:05.950> do<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.459> takes<00:03:06.900> 10<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.709> 15<00:03:09.100> days<00:03:09.310> to

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
they do this it takes 10 to 15 days to

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.930 
they do this it takes 10 to 15 days to
do<00:03:09.730> it

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
do it

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.040 
do it
I<00:03:10.000> mean<00:03:10.180> don't<00:03:10.330> feel<00:03:10.480> discouraged<00:03:10.780> if<00:03:10.959> it

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
I mean don't feel discouraged if it

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.300 
I mean don't feel discouraged if it
takes<00:03:11.200> twenty<00:03:11.500> days<00:03:11.650> maybe<00:03:11.860> there's<00:03:12.130> some

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
takes twenty days maybe there's some

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.210 
takes twenty days maybe there's some
more<00:03:12.519> is<00:03:12.880> uh<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.810> know<00:03:13.840> it's<00:03:14.110> kind<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.500> like<00:03:14.680> it

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
more is uh you know it's kind of like it

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
they'll go after the hacker but I say

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.330 
they'll go after the hacker but I say
it's<00:03:19.989> because<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.650> have<00:03:20.799> to<00:03:20.920> put<00:03:21.070> you<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.280> a

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
it's because you have to put you in a

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.800 
it's because you have to put you in a
queue<00:03:21.610> that's<00:03:21.850> why<00:03:22.060> there's<00:03:22.299> a<00:03:22.360> big<00:03:22.570> waiting

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
queue that's why there's a big waiting

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.650 
queue that's why there's a big waiting
period<00:03:23.320> that's<00:03:23.500> why<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:24.120> look<00:03:25.120> if<00:03:25.299> you<00:03:25.420> lost

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
period that's why so look if you lost

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.430 
period that's why so look if you lost
50k<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.470> hundred<00:03:27.010> K<00:03:27.190> 200k<00:03:28.120> 300k<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:29.019> don't<00:03:29.350> know

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
50k a hundred K 200k 300k I don't know

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.350 
50k a hundred K 200k 300k I don't know
how<00:03:29.590> he<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.829> will<00:03:30.100> work<00:03:30.280> on<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:30.489> I<00:03:30.760> think<00:03:31.209> they

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
how he a will work on that I think they

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.810 
how he a will work on that I think they
might<00:03:31.540> just<00:03:31.780> bum<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.230> out<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.590> just<00:03:33.190> look<00:03:33.640> for
