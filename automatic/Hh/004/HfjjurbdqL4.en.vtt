addiction<00:00:26.160> customers<00:00:26.849> here<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.270> we've

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
addiction customers here and we've

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.660 
addiction customers here and we've
dissected<00:00:28.680> some<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> common<00:00:29.490> problems

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
dissected some of the common problems

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.119 
dissected some of the common problems
that<00:00:29.970> happen<00:00:30.599> while<00:00:31.199> people<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.769> learning

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
that happen while people are learning

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.220 
that happen while people are learning
their<00:00:32.220> front<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.640> ladies<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.720> idea<00:00:34.110> is

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
their front so ladies and the idea is

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.290 
their front so ladies and the idea is
that<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.470> can<00:00:34.620> compare<00:00:35.070> these<00:00:35.309> problems<00:00:35.790> to

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that you can compare these problems to

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
that you can compare these problems to
our<00:00:36.330> writing<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.379> see<00:00:37.590> where<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.100> need<00:00:38.250> to

you<00:00:41.220> may<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.400> when<00:00:41.820> learning<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.120> frontside

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510

you may have when learning a frontside
180<00:00:42.720> is<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.470> you're<00:00:43.559> having<00:00:43.800> trouble

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
180 is that you're having trouble

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.149 
180 is that you're having trouble
getting<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.670> full<00:00:44.940> 180<00:00:45.120> around<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.979> watch

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
getting a full 180 around if you watch

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.670 
getting a full 180 around if you watch
this<00:00:47.400> guy<00:00:47.580> here<00:00:47.909> as<00:00:48.059> he<00:00:48.540> goes<00:00:48.720> up<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.989> jump<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
this guy here as he goes up the jump is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.439 
this guy here as he goes up the jump is
upper<00:00:50.070> body<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.400> lower<00:00:50.580> body<00:00:50.699> a<00:00:51.059> counter

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
upper body and lower body a counter

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.539 
upper body and lower body a counter
rotating<00:00:51.869> against<00:00:52.320> each<00:00:52.440> other<00:00:52.650> and<00:00:52.830> it<00:00:53.309> looks

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:53.549 
rotating against each other and it looks

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.000 
rotating against each other and it looks
like<00:00:53.729> he's<00:00:53.879> doing<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.180> shifty<00:00:54.570> that's<00:00:55.379> stopping

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
like he's doing a shifty that's stopping

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.829 
like he's doing a shifty that's stopping
him<00:00:56.159> from<00:00:56.309> being<00:00:56.729> able<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.089> get<00:00:57.269> a<00:00:57.299> full<00:00:57.600> 180

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
him from being able to get a full 180

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:58.490 
him from being able to get a full 180
around

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
around

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.979 
around
now<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.820> 180<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.360> counter<00:01:00.629> rotation

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
now you can 180 with counter rotation

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.140 
now you can 180 with counter rotation
but<00:01:01.799> when<00:01:02.010> you're<00:01:02.159> learning<00:01:02.400> I<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:03.030> it's

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
but when you're learning I think it's

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.450 
but when you're learning I think it's
easier<00:01:03.659> to<00:01:03.780> use<00:01:03.960> rotation<00:01:04.739> where<00:01:05.280> your<00:01:05.369> upper

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
easier to use rotation where your upper

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.850 
easier to use rotation where your upper
body<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.939> lower<00:01:06.119> body<00:01:06.420> rotate<00:01:06.869> into<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.530> same

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
body and lower body rotate into the same

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.490 
body and lower body rotate into the same
direction<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.610> make<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.880> 180<00:01:09.119> happen<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.750> you

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
direction to make a 180 happen if you

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.730 
direction to make a 180 happen if you
watch<00:01:10.710> our<00:01:10.950> riding<00:01:11.670> you'll<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.570> how<00:01:13.200> smooth

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
watch our riding you'll see how smooth

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.249 
watch our riding you'll see how smooth
it<00:01:13.920> looks<00:01:13.950> through<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> air<00:01:15.180> our<00:01:15.810> upper<00:01:16.020> body

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
it looks through the air our upper body

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.899 
it looks through the air our upper body
and<00:01:16.409> lower<00:01:16.530> body<00:01:16.740> go<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.219> same<00:01:17.579> direction

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and lower body go in the same direction

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.819 
and lower body go in the same direction
all<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> way<00:01:18.780> until<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.380> land

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
all the way until we land

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.530 
all the way until we land
that's<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.820> 180<00:01:21.119> using<00:01:21.479> rotation

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.570 

one<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> next<00:01:25.620> problems<00:01:26.010> that<00:01:26.190> I<00:01:26.220> found

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
one of the next problems that I found

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.940 
one of the next problems that I found
was<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.910> people<00:01:27.420> do<00:01:27.630> way<00:01:28.020> too<00:01:28.080> many<00:01:28.620> turns

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
was that people do way too many turns

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.560 
was that people do way too many turns
and<00:01:29.190> speed<00:01:29.430> checks<00:01:29.730> as<00:01:29.910> they're<00:01:30.480> approaching

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and speed checks as they're approaching

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.910 
and speed checks as they're approaching
the<00:01:31.080> jump<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.560> 180<00:01:32.480> mellow<00:01:33.480> it<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.440> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the jump for a 180 mellow it out if you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.710 
the jump for a 180 mellow it out if you
watch<00:01:35.100> how<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.760> we'll<00:01:36.150> usually<00:01:36.330> try<00:01:36.690> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
watch how we do it we'll usually try to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.450 
watch how we do it we'll usually try to
find<00:01:37.050> where<00:01:37.260> we're<00:01:37.410> gonna<00:01:37.470> go<00:01:37.740> from<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.190> speed

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
find where we're gonna go from for speed

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.970 
find where we're gonna go from for speed
and<00:01:38.640> go<00:01:39.300> more<00:01:39.780> or<00:01:39.930> less<00:01:40.080> straight<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:40.710> jump

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
and go more or less straight to the jump

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.760 
and go more or less straight to the jump
with<00:01:41.370> perhaps<00:01:41.610> some<00:01:42.000> very<00:01:42.570> smooth<00:01:43.110> edging<00:01:43.650> as

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
with perhaps some very smooth edging as

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.120 
with perhaps some very smooth edging as
we<00:01:43.890> take<00:01:44.070> off<00:01:45.140> now<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.440> front<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:46.980> off

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
we take off now you can front one off

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.790 
we take off now you can front one off
your<00:01:47.340> heel<00:01:47.550> edge<00:01:47.930> or<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.290> front<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.710> off

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
your heel edge or you can front one off

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.370 
your heel edge or you can front one off
your<00:01:49.950> toe<00:01:50.160> edge<00:01:50.190> I<00:01:50.780> prefer<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.930> teach<00:01:52.140> people

your toe edge I prefer to teach people

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.590 
your toe edge I prefer to teach people
to<00:01:52.920> front<00:01:53.190> one<00:01:53.340> off<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.580> heel<00:01:53.790> edge<00:01:53.940> as<00:01:54.120> that's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
to front one off the heel edge as that's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.810 
to front one off the heel edge as that's
gonna<00:01:54.840> build<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.860> learning<00:01:56.190> frontside<00:01:56.370> 360

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
gonna build in to learning frontside 360
