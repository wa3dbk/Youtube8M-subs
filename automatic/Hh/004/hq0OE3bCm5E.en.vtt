00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
motorcycle repair comm in today's video

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.000 
motorcycle repair comm in today's video
we're<00:00:10.660> going<00:00:10.750> to<00:00:10.809> be<00:00:10.959> doing<00:00:11.139> an<00:00:11.349> old<00:00:11.559> ring<00:00:11.769> mod

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
we're going to be doing an old ring mod

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.970 
we're going to be doing an old ring mod
on<00:00:12.309> an<00:00:12.670> FC<00:00:13.029> our<00:00:13.150> carb<00:00:14.760> this<00:00:15.760> this<00:00:16.269> is<00:00:16.420> a<00:00:16.449> no.9

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
on an FC our carb this this is a no.9

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.460 
on an FC our carb this this is a no.9
yz250<00:00:17.980> f<00:00:18.630> basically<00:00:19.630> what<00:00:19.779> the<00:00:19.900> o-ring<00:00:20.289> mod

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
yz250 f basically what the o-ring mod

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.020 
yz250 f basically what the o-ring mod
does<00:00:20.800> is<00:00:21.039> it<00:00:21.160> brings<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:23.490> throttle<00:00:24.490> cam<00:00:24.730> and

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
does is it brings the throttle cam and

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.790 
does is it brings the throttle cam and
the<00:00:25.690> pump<00:00:26.670> arm<00:00:27.990> cam<00:00:28.990> whatever<00:00:29.380> they<00:00:29.590> it

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
the pump arm cam whatever they it

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.099 
the pump arm cam whatever they it
marries<00:00:30.250> them<00:00:30.400> together<00:00:30.580> in<00:00:31.090> a<00:00:31.539> tighter<00:00:31.810> bond

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:32.109 
marries them together in a tighter bond

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.099 
marries them together in a tighter bond
and<00:00:32.469> it<00:00:33.460> during<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.210> movement<00:00:34.629> they<00:00:34.809> stick

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:35.109 
and it during the movement they stick

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:36.869 
and it during the movement they stick
together<00:00:35.260> and<00:00:35.620> basically<00:00:35.920> that<00:00:36.070> will<00:00:36.340> give

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
together and basically that will give

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.759 
together and basically that will give
you<00:00:36.969> a<00:00:37.059> much<00:00:38.019> more<00:00:38.079> powerful<00:00:38.469> squirt<00:00:39.100> so<00:00:40.769> let's

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
you a much more powerful squirt so let's

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.919 
you a much more powerful squirt so let's
go<00:00:41.920> ahead<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.190> get<00:00:42.280> started<00:00:42.659> first<00:00:43.659> let's

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
go ahead and get started first let's

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.270 
go ahead and get started first let's
take<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.109> look<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.469> see<00:00:44.679> what<00:00:44.829> that<00:00:44.920> squirt

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
take a look and see what that squirt

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.169 
take a look and see what that squirt
looks<00:00:45.519> like<00:00:45.729> without<00:00:46.659> the<00:00:46.960> old<00:00:47.079> ring<00:00:47.289> mod<00:00:47.469> and

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
looks like without the old ring mod and

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.789 
looks like without the old ring mod and
I'll<00:00:49.179> try<00:00:49.389> to<00:00:49.449> edit<00:00:49.659> this<00:00:49.929> in<00:00:50.079> slow-mo<00:00:50.559> but<00:00:50.739> I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:50.799 
I'll try to edit this in slow-mo but I

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:53.309 
I'll try to edit this in slow-mo but I
don't<00:00:51.190> know<00:00:51.280> how<00:00:51.460> well<00:00:51.639> we'll<00:00:51.819> work<00:00:51.969> out<00:00:52.319> but

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
don't know how well we'll work out but

00:00:53.319 --> 00:01:01.709 
don't know how well we'll work out but
any<00:00:53.499> case<00:00:53.649> here<00:00:53.889> we<00:00:53.979> go<00:00:59.579> alright<00:01:00.579> so<00:01:00.819> now<00:01:01.690> let's

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
any case here we go alright so now let's

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:11.200 
any case here we go alright so now let's
do<00:01:02.049> the<00:01:02.139> mod

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.500 

you

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.040 

all<00:01:18.350> right<00:01:18.440> so<00:01:18.590> here's<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.830> view<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:20.050> right

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
all right so here's a view of the right

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.950 
all right so here's a view of the right
side<00:01:21.290> side<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.920> carburetor<00:01:22.690> just<00:01:23.690> above

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
side side of the carburetor just above

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.800 
side side of the carburetor just above
the<00:01:24.140> exhaust<00:01:24.440> here<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:25.910> black<00:01:26.210> thing<00:01:26.540> is

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
the exhaust here and this black thing is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.890 
the exhaust here and this black thing is
the<00:01:27.110> cam<00:01:27.530> that<00:01:28.520> pushes<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.090> rod<00:01:29.270> down<00:01:29.570> for<00:01:29.810> the

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
the cam that pushes the rod down for the

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.850 
the cam that pushes the rod down for the
accelerator<00:01:30.350> pump

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
accelerator pump

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.240 
accelerator pump
here's<00:01:31.460> your<00:01:31.670> AP<00:01:32.060> timing<00:01:32.510> screw<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.250> here's

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
here's your AP timing screw and here's

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.670 
here's your AP timing screw and here's
the<00:01:34.490> throttle<00:01:35.000> wheel<00:01:35.260> alright<00:01:36.260> so<00:01:36.440> you<00:01:36.530> can

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
the throttle wheel alright so you can

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.410 
the throttle wheel alright so you can
see<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:38.000> these<00:01:38.300> two<00:01:39.730> move<00:01:40.730> independently<00:01:41.360> of

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
see that these two move independently of

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.420 
see that these two move independently of
each<00:01:41.570> other<00:01:41.810> there's<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.110> spring<00:01:42.560> behind<00:01:42.980> here

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
each other there's a spring behind here

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.670 
each other there's a spring behind here
that<00:01:43.630> forces<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:44.750> thing<00:01:44.990> around<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.530> the

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
that forces this thing around to the

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.840 
that forces this thing around to the
timing<00:01:46.340> screw<00:01:46.870> but<00:01:47.870> without<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.380> o-ring

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
timing screw but without the o-ring

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.310 
timing screw but without the o-ring
you'll<00:01:49.850> notice<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.510> when<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:50.900> whack<00:01:51.110> the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
you'll notice that when you whack the

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
you'll notice that when you whack the
throttle<00:01:52.000> this<00:01:53.350> moves<00:01:54.350> slower<00:01:54.740> than<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.130> time

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
throttle this moves slower than the time

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.050 
throttle this moves slower than the time
then<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.640> then<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.570> throttle<00:01:56.990> wheel<00:01:58.060> thing

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
then the then the throttle wheel thing

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.600 
then the then the throttle wheel thing
so<00:01:59.830> basically<00:02:02.350> if<00:02:03.350> we<00:02:03.410> tie<00:02:04.190> these<00:02:04.250> together

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
so basically if we tie these together

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.020 
so basically if we tie these together
with<00:02:04.970> an<00:02:05.060> o-ring<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:07.550> know<00:02:07.670> it'll<00:02:07.880> move

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
with an o-ring you know it'll move

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.060 
with an o-ring you know it'll move
quicker<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.570> move<00:02:08.750> faster<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.200> produce<00:02:09.890> a

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
quicker and move faster and produce a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.130 
quicker and move faster and produce a
more<00:02:10.250> powerful<00:02:10.429> shot<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.180> first<00:02:11.810> let's<00:02:12.020> see

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
more powerful shot so first let's see

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.780 
more powerful shot so first let's see
how<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.380> looks<00:02:12.590> without<00:02:12.740> it<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.310> you'll<00:02:13.580> see

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
how it looks without it and you'll see

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.550 
how it looks without it and you'll see
that<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.180> thing<00:02:14.420> there's<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.230> gap<00:02:15.530> between

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
that this thing there's a gap between

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.330 
that this thing there's a gap between
there<00:02:16.070> for<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.700> short<00:02:16.970> period<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.360> time<00:02:18.220> see<00:02:19.220> how

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
there for a short period of time see how

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.420 
there for a short period of time see how
it<00:02:19.990> moves<00:02:20.990> with<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:24.880> alright<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:27.400> what<00:02:28.400> you

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
it moves with it alright so what you

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.650 
it moves with it alright so what you
want<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.700> do<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.910> go<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.270> hardware<00:02:29.540> store

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
want to do is go to the hardware store

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.000 
want to do is go to the hardware store
and<00:02:30.430> get<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.459> number<00:02:31.670> 78<00:02:32.330> oh<00:02:32.630> ring<00:02:33.010> seven

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
and get a number 78 oh ring seven

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.580 
and get a number 78 oh ring seven
sixteenths<00:02:34.610> OD<00:02:34.940> corridor<00:02:35.750> ID<00:02:35.959> three

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
sixteenths OD corridor ID three

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.990 
sixteenths OD corridor ID three
thirty-seconds<00:02:37.250> thick<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:38.750> went<00:02:39.350> ahead<00:02:39.410> and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
thirty-seconds thick I went ahead and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.640 
thirty-seconds thick I went ahead and
put<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.030> little<00:02:41.180> silicone<00:02:41.510> spray<00:02:41.959> on<00:02:42.200> this<00:02:42.350> so

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
put a little silicone spray on this so
