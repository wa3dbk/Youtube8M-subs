00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.220
 new technique sloth video 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 I have mail from the boys and girls 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.110
 from electronics star.de get the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.820
 just asked me 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.250
 want to make their shop better known and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.770
 I offered to get one 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.789
 product to test and to keep 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.130
 giving away 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.680
 and of course for the extensive 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.630
 I was able to test for one 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.480
 studio microphone decide and thought 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.850
 me that maybe we will for the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.520
 sound synonymous name for a few videos entirely 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.190
 nice to play with it and watch 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.190
 how far that brings an improvement 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.870
 and what makes such a part at all 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 and then we look in 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.300
 the packaging and out of the box comes 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.840
 a new box so the gema again 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.180
 and we already see usb-port microphone 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.690
 black and there we have the good piece 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.640
 even now we are watching 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.020
 's start cautiously 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.000
 we have a leather cover and there it was 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.490
 everything in it I think there it is 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.170
 real microphone was in it 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.759
 short to the side we are very exciting 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.830
 then our user manual 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.250
 electronics star back then okay too 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.400
 also look at it for a while 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.560
 because it would expect so 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.689
 ok mac os windows big and and and so 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.200
 probably just plug in 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.270
 and then select as audio source and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.810
 then get started 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.460
 what else is left in the packaging 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.600
 there is more there will be more 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.400
 there is nothing in it now though 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.460
 packaging empty 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.620
 This will help us once 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.600
 apparently properly long usb cable 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.100
 that's promising 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.140
 he knows where to go as a microphone 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.440
 would like to ask and then such a 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.990
 bracket and I know myself at the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.610
 whole film equipment not at all 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.670
 and there are quite a lot of those 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.780
 really high tech really cool things 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.530
 record but I've been told 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.030
 that is a spider 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.620
 that should be so that the microphone 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.260
 cushioned when you are at the table 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.200
 or on the document comes with this 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.050
 these booms then, so to speak, not in the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.150
 audio recording is okay here still mine 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.260
 bracket lead tripod lead stand 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.600
 or elsewhere 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.030
 okidoki but now we want to 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.030
 finally that the microphone look at 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:47.320
 packed again and we have one 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.770
 nice black variation so there we have 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.070
 it and as I said it is a usb 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.570
 microphone but with a thin soles 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.019
 otherwise I know only connection 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:03.190
 from any older printer model 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:06.489
 yes okay and then on usb so nothing with 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.790
 clinker nothing with audio cable reiners usb 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:13.209
 microphone costs but only in 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.989
 quotation marks 50 euros or around 50 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.300
 a little over it with that shipping 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:23.620
 and I'm very curious how 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.459
 had the thing will strike with me 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.840
 I already somehow in 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.190
 quotes what to say 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.680
 Although nice that then here is such a cover 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.910
 for the microphone is it then 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.709
 not scratched and transported safely 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.120
 becomes 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.620
 but it is red cable I have to 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.630
 not really transport now so 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.950
 I have a whole bag for the accessories 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.630
 well in the moment where I have such a 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.550
 I want to transport spider then 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.959
 Also a stand a tripod that I am with 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.070
 I rumschleppen you for that also 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.000
 bag and I can then the stuff 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.370
 also wrap up 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.220
 So fit for 50 euros what you expect 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.250
 there is the thing went absolutely fine 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.280
 okay so next video then 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.590
 probably 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.060
 better sound recording quality than me 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.890
 the thing has to be around a bit 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.750
 test so many thanks for watching 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.750
