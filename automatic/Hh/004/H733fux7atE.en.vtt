00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:46.889 
functional portable device that you

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.230 
functional portable device that you

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
same thing as the tablets do so it's

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.379 
same thing as the tablets do so it's
much<00:06:54.509> easier<00:06:54.539> to<00:06:55.050> carry<00:06:55.229> around<00:06:55.610> so<00:06:56.610> really<00:06:57.270> if

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
much easier to carry around so really if

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:59.689 
much easier to carry around so really if
you<00:06:57.509> think<00:06:57.539> about<00:06:57.900> it<00:06:58.229> there's<00:06:58.830> just<00:06:58.919> a<00:06:59.280> niche

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
you think about it there's just a niche

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.450 
you think about it there's just a niche
market<00:06:59.969> for<00:07:00.599> the<00:07:00.689> tablets<00:07:01.199> and<00:07:01.349> I<00:07:01.830> think<00:07:02.129> that

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
market for the tablets and I think that

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.640 
market for the tablets and I think that
I<00:07:02.729> think<00:07:03.210> that<00:07:03.780> the<00:07:03.900> people<00:07:04.020> developing<00:07:04.379> the

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
I think that the people developing the

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.499 
I think that the people developing the
tablets<00:07:05.069> besides<00:07:05.430> Apple<00:07:05.789> know<00:07:05.939> this<00:07:06.180> Apple

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:06.509 
tablets besides Apple know this Apple

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.170 
tablets besides Apple know this Apple
knows<00:07:06.659> us<00:07:06.840> too<00:07:07.050> but<00:07:07.490> they're<00:07:08.490> just<00:07:08.729> kids

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
knows us too but they're just kids

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.909 
knows us too but they're just kids
they're<00:07:09.300> trying<00:07:09.629> to<00:07:09.750> ride<00:07:10.080> the<00:07:10.110> wave<00:07:10.530> right

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 
they're trying to ride the wave right

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.469 
they're trying to ride the wave right
now<00:07:10.979> because<00:07:11.340> everyone<00:07:11.669> thinks<00:07:11.819> tablets<00:07:12.389> are

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 
now because everyone thinks tablets are

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:13.550 
now because everyone thinks tablets are
the<00:07:12.509> future<00:07:12.870> just<00:07:13.110> like<00:07:13.289> they<00:07:13.379> thought

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
the future just like they thought

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.659 
the future just like they thought
netbooks<00:07:14.069> were<00:07:14.219> the<00:07:14.400> future<00:07:14.759> but<00:07:15.509> reality<00:07:15.900> I

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:16.669 
netbooks were the future but reality I

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:19.909 
netbooks were the future but reality I
just<00:07:17.669> don't<00:07:17.909> see<00:07:18.180> a<00:07:18.479> tablet<00:07:19.409> being<00:07:19.680> as

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 
just don't see a tablet being as

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:24.559 
just don't see a tablet being as
practical<00:07:20.520> and<00:07:20.729> as<00:07:21.539> functional<00:07:22.169> as<00:07:23.120> even<00:07:24.120> you

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:24.569 
practical and as functional as even you

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.510 
practical and as functional as even you
know<00:07:24.689> an<00:07:24.960> hopper<00:07:25.319> at<00:07:25.469> netbook<00:07:25.919> I'd<00:07:26.340> rather

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.050 
think I'm right do you think that
tablets<00:07:37.199> are<00:07:37.319> going<00:07:37.529> to<00:07:37.620> be<00:07:37.680> a<00:07:37.710> fad<00:07:38.039> or<00:07:38.279> do<00:07:38.909> you

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 
tablets are going to be a fad or do you

of<00:07:41.099> computing<00:07:41.699> I<00:07:41.879> just<00:07:42.719> don't<00:07:42.960> see<00:07:43.229> it<00:07:43.259> I<00:07:43.560> don't

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 
of computing I just don't see it I don't

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.230 
of computing I just don't see it I don't
think<00:07:43.889> they're<00:07:44.129> practical<00:07:44.669> but<00:07:44.849> hey<00:07:45.029> I'm

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 
think they're practical but hey I'm

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.119 
think they're practical but hey I'm
human<00:07:45.599> I<00:07:45.719> could<00:07:45.900> be<00:07:46.020> wrong<00:07:46.199> anyway<00:07:46.529> guys

00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:47.129
