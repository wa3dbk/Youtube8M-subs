correctly although India pride does have

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.770 
correctly although India pride does have
two<00:00:52.680> more<00:00:52.860> units<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.370> them<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.510> gonna<00:00:54.629> be

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
which yes it would be very difficult for

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.460 
which yes it would be very difficult for
the<00:01:51.000> command<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.360> cover<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.930> really<00:01:52.320> get

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the command you cover to really get

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.649 
the command you cover to really get
behind<00:01:52.729> if<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.970> micro<00:01:54.210> them<00:01:54.360> enough<00:01:54.540> you

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
behind if you can micro them enough you

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.450 
behind if you can micro them enough you
can<00:01:54.810> protect<00:01:55.110> us<00:01:55.229> flanks<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.310> big

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
can protect us flanks that's a very big

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.240 
can protect us flanks that's a very big
possibility<00:01:56.670> indeed<00:01:57.740> we've<00:01:58.740> seen<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> lot

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
possibility indeed we've seen in a lot

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.249 
possibility indeed we've seen in a lot
of<00:01:59.310> games<00:01:59.549> before<00:01:59.759> people<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.390> been<00:02:00.570> kind<00:02:01.140> of

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
of games before people have been kind of

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.670 
of games before people have been kind of
throwing<00:02:01.469> away<00:02:01.740> their<00:02:01.920> cavalry<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:03.680> yeah

absolutely<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.729> kind<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.270> one-shot<00:02:06.960> thing

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
absolutely it's kind of a one-shot thing

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.510 
absolutely it's kind of a one-shot thing
that<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.500> throw<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.039> kind<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.340> rid<00:02:08.459> of

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that you throw in and kind of get rid of

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
aren't just on this flank here though it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.990 
aren't just on this flank here though it
seems<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:42.870> he<00:02:43.170> has<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.319> significant<00:02:44.010> infantry

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
yeah but can these two years have

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.620 
yeah but can these two years have
hoplites<00:02:49.920> really<00:02:50.250> even<00:02:50.580> deal<00:02:50.819> with<00:02:50.849> 20<00:02:51.209> swore

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630

hoplites really even deal with 20 swore
i<00:02:52.040> don't<00:02:53.040> think<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.400> actually<00:02:53.670> especially<00:02:53.970> not

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
i don't think so actually especially not

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.240 
i don't think so actually especially not
with<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.480> support<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.079> spear<00:02:55.799> warriors

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
with the support that the spear warriors

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.400 
with the support that the spear warriors
another<00:02:56.549> spare<00:02:56.819> noble<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.180> nearby<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.319> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
another spare noble to nearby is so the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.080 
another spare noble to nearby is so the
left<00:02:58.620> flank<00:02:58.829> for<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.099> goal<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.579> definitely

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
left flank for the goal is definitely

where prussian prince is going to have
the<00:03:01.380> advantage<00:03:01.470> but<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.069> right<00:03:02.310> flank<00:03:02.579> is

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
the advantage but the right flank is

is<00:04:59.490> just<00:04:59.670> taking<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.330> home<00:05:00.570> using<00:05:01.230> an

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
is just taking this home using an

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.640 
is just taking this home using an
ability<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:02.040> boost<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.550> morale<00:05:02.730> and

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
ability that the boost the morale and

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.080 
ability that the boost the morale and
we'll<00:05:04.650> see<00:05:04.830> what<00:05:04.950> happens<00:05:05.130> though<00:05:05.580> anything

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
we'll see what happens though anything

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.300 
we'll see what happens though anything
is<00:05:06.210> possible<00:05:06.240> it's<00:05:06.990> also<00:05:07.230> chasing<00:05:07.770> down<00:05:07.920> units

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
is possible it's also chasing down units

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.530 
is possible it's also chasing down units
now<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.520> make<00:05:08.790> sure<00:05:08.940> that<00:05:09.090> none<00:05:09.300> of<00:05:09.330> these

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
now to make sure that none of these

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.660 
now to make sure that none of these
piking<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.170> start<00:05:10.380> to<00:05:10.500> rally<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.950> units<00:05:11.550> he

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
piking and start to rally the units he

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.790 
piking and start to rally the units he
still<00:05:11.850> has<00:05:12.030> alive<00:05:12.330> at<00:05:12.540> one<00:05:12.990> unit<00:05:13.260> of<00:05:13.320> hoplites

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
still has alive at one unit of hoplites

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.670 
still has alive at one unit of hoplites
obviously<00:05:14.580> Israel<00:05:14.910> pelt<00:05:15.210> asked<00:05:15.660> one<00:05:16.350> eunuch

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
obviously Israel pelt asked one eunuch

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.200 
obviously Israel pelt asked one eunuch
Aveline<00:05:17.130> you<00:05:17.250> can<00:05:17.400> safe<00:05:17.610> to<00:05:17.760> say<00:05:17.940> that<00:05:17.970> this

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
Aveline you can safe to say that this

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.180 
Aveline you can safe to say that this
game<00:05:18.450> is<00:05:18.480> already<00:05:19.080> well<00:05:19.590> in<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.860> hands<00:05:20.130> of

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
game is already well in the hands of

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.370 
game is already well in the hands of
Russian<00:05:20.550> prince<00:05:20.790> precisely<00:05:23.930> so<00:05:24.930> where<00:05:25.230> was

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
Russian prince precisely so where was

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.080 
Russian prince precisely so where was
the<00:05:25.440> decisive<00:05:25.860> moment<00:05:26.100> it<00:05:26.550> looks<00:05:26.760> like<00:05:26.850> he

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
the decisive moment it looks like he

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.750 
the decisive moment it looks like he
broke<00:05:27.390> in<00:05:28.320> deep<00:05:28.530> right-center<00:05:28.770> much<00:05:29.460> quicker

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
broke in deep right-center much quicker

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.670 
broke in deep right-center much quicker
and<00:05:30.030> both<00:05:30.720> his<00:05:30.930> Frank's<00:05:31.230> would<00:05:31.350> manage<00:05:31.620> to

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
and both his Frank's would manage to

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.070 
and both his Frank's would manage to
hold<00:05:31.890> I<00:05:32.220> think<00:05:32.940> in<00:05:33.060> d<00:05:33.150> Pryde<00:05:33.330> was<00:05:33.480> a<00:05:33.510> little<00:05:33.870> too

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
hold I think in d Pryde was a little too

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.350 
hold I think in d Pryde was a little too
spread<00:05:34.530> out<00:05:34.590> or<00:05:34.980> he<00:05:35.160> spent<00:05:35.490> a<00:05:35.610> little<00:05:35.850> too<00:05:36.120> much

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
spread out or he spent a little too much

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.040 
spread out or he spent a little too much
sort<00:05:37.169> of<00:05:37.290> unit<00:05:37.740> space<00:05:37.950> on<00:05:38.190> cavalry<00:05:39.050> sit

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
sort of unit space on cavalry sit

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.630 
sort of unit space on cavalry sit
Cavalry's<00:05:40.560> really<00:05:40.860> obviously<00:05:41.190> a<00:05:41.280> big<00:05:41.400> part

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
Cavalry's really obviously a big part

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.280 
Cavalry's really obviously a big part
but<00:05:41.700> when<00:05:41.850> the<00:05:42.090> infantry<00:05:42.600> when<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:43.110> don't

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
but when the infantry when you don't

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.630 
but when the infantry when you don't
have<00:05:43.410> much<00:05:43.620> other<00:05:43.800> cab<00:05:44.040> to<00:05:44.220> counter<00:05:44.550> it<00:05:44.580> with

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
have much other cab to counter it with

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.430 
have much other cab to counter it with
us<00:05:44.910> especially<00:05:45.240> skirmishes<00:05:45.960> for<00:05:46.110> that<00:05:46.200> part

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
us especially skirmishes for that part

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.050 
us especially skirmishes for that part
which<00:05:46.590> capital<00:05:47.070> e<00:05:47.160> is<00:05:47.340> just<00:05:47.669> excellent

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
which capital e is just excellent

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.230 
which capital e is just excellent
against<00:05:48.950> they<00:05:49.950> kind<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.520> rendered<00:05:50.760> useless<00:05:50.940> in

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
against they kind of rendered useless in

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.030 
against they kind of rendered useless in
a<00:05:51.300> fight<00:05:51.330> like<00:05:51.600> this<00:05:51.750> they<00:05:52.080> cannot<00:05:52.410> stand<00:05:52.740> and

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
a fight like this they cannot stand and

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.220 
a fight like this they cannot stand and
fight<00:05:53.250> against<00:05:54.030> infantry<00:05:54.330> four<00:05:54.750> minutes<00:05:55.110> and

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
fight against infantry four minutes and

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.950 
fight against infantry four minutes and
minutes<00:05:55.440> which<00:05:56.250> well<00:05:56.850> obviously<00:05:57.030> gave<00:05:57.780> the

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
minutes which well obviously gave the

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.290 
minutes which well obviously gave the
victory<00:05:58.290> to<00:05:58.410> Prince<00:05:58.650> I<00:05:58.950> I<00:05:59.250> think<00:05:59.850> it<00:05:59.940> was<00:06:00.030> very

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
victory to Prince I I think it was very

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.000 
victory to Prince I I think it was very
impressive<00:06:00.600> to<00:06:00.750> see<00:06:00.960> Prince<00:06:01.200> able<00:06:01.560> to<00:06:01.620> hold<00:06:01.800> on

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
impressive to see Prince able to hold on

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.680 
impressive to see Prince able to hold on
to<00:06:02.160> his<00:06:02.250> cavalry<00:06:02.610> for<00:06:02.880> such<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.030> long<00:06:03.240> period<00:06:03.300> of

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
to his cavalry for such a long period of

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.320 
to his cavalry for such a long period of
time<00:06:03.750> as<00:06:04.050> well<00:06:04.230> yes<00:06:04.770> exactly<00:06:04.950> and<00:06:05.460> but<00:06:06.060> I<00:06:06.090> think

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
time as well yes exactly and but I think

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.540 
time as well yes exactly and but I think
how<00:06:06.780> big<00:06:07.020> an<00:06:07.140> issue<00:06:07.260> was<00:06:07.680> fighting<00:06:08.220> in<00:06:08.430> the

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
how big an issue was fighting in the

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.490 
how big an issue was fighting in the
woods<00:06:08.760> because<00:06:09.180> he<00:06:09.540> does<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:09.960> second<00:06:10.350> time

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
woods because he does the second time

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.870 
woods because he does the second time
I've<00:06:10.650> seen<00:06:10.800> Persian<00:06:11.160> prince<00:06:11.370> anchoring

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
I've seen Persian prince anchoring

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.400 
I've seen Persian prince anchoring
himself<00:06:12.240> in<00:06:12.390> the<00:06:12.480> woods<00:06:12.660> and<00:06:12.780> fighting<00:06:13.230> there

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
himself in the woods and fighting there

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.210 
himself in the woods and fighting there
yeah<00:06:13.710> well<00:06:14.669> Indies<00:06:15.570> began<00:06:16.410> sort<00:06:16.770> of<00:06:16.860> placing

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
yeah well Indies began sort of placing

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.740 
yeah well Indies began sort of placing
his<00:06:17.310> units<00:06:17.640> into<00:06:17.910> the<00:06:18.000> wood<00:06:18.150> but<00:06:18.390> then<00:06:18.510> he<00:06:18.570> sort

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
his units into the wood but then he sort

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.210 
his units into the wood but then he sort
of<00:06:18.810> pulled<00:06:19.080> out<00:06:19.320> I<00:06:19.680> thought<00:06:19.830> it<00:06:19.890> was<00:06:19.950> going<00:06:20.130> to

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
of pulled out I thought it was going to

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.370 
of pulled out I thought it was going to
be<00:06:20.280> hiding<00:06:20.640> and<00:06:20.760> using<00:06:21.060> it<00:06:21.120> at<00:06:21.300> his<00:06:21.900> advantage

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
be hiding and using it at his advantage

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.420 
be hiding and using it at his advantage
but<00:06:22.530> then<00:06:22.650> he<00:06:22.740> probably<00:06:22.919> realized<00:06:23.190> that

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
but then he probably realized that

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.550 
but then he probably realized that
cabinetry<00:06:23.790> does<00:06:24.060> worse<00:06:24.390> in<00:06:24.720> woods<00:06:24.990> and<00:06:25.260> since

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
cabinetry does worse in woods and since

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.890 
cabinetry does worse in woods and since
indeed<00:06:26.010> did<00:06:26.220> have<00:06:26.430> more<00:06:26.669> cab<00:06:26.880> I<00:06:27.150> don't<00:06:27.690> think

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
indeed did have more cab I don't think

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.659 
indeed did have more cab I don't think
he<00:06:27.990> wanted<00:06:28.230> to<00:06:28.290> pick<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.680> woods<00:06:28.890> for<00:06:29.040> a<00:06:29.430> combat

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
he wanted to pick the woods for a combat

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.590 
he wanted to pick the woods for a combat
sort<00:06:30.510> of<00:06:30.600> location<00:06:31.440> so<00:06:32.030> on<00:06:33.030> that<00:06:33.240> side<00:06:33.480> he<00:06:33.570> did

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
sort of location so on that side he did

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.040 
sort of location so on that side he did
the<00:06:33.810> better<00:06:33.960> choice<00:06:34.200> pulling<00:06:34.710> out<00:06:34.830> and<00:06:36.050> crush

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
the better choice pulling out and crush

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.630 
the better choice pulling out and crush
moments<00:06:37.440> was<00:06:37.590> the<00:06:37.710> attacker<00:06:38.070> in<00:06:38.310> that<00:06:38.460> game

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
moments was the attacker in that game
