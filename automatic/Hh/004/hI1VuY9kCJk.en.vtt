Modi<00:02:14.400> DAC<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:16.500> doesn't<00:02:17.129> really<00:02:17.310> do<00:02:17.580> anything

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
Modi DAC it doesn't really do anything

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.930 
Modi DAC it doesn't really do anything
except<00:02:18.540> keep<00:02:18.810> your<00:02:19.049> files<00:02:19.650> your<00:02:20.340> your<00:02:20.670> audio

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
except keep your files your your audio

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.720 
except keep your files your your audio
files<00:02:21.209> true<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.349> how<00:02:22.440> they<00:02:22.620> sound<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.130> mean<00:02:23.250> it

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
files true to how they sound I mean it

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.440 
files true to how they sound I mean it
doesn't<00:02:23.970> add

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
doesn't add

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.880 
doesn't add
kind<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.750> warmth<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.200> doesn't<00:02:25.440> add<00:02:25.560> any<00:02:25.740> kind

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
kind of warmth it doesn't add any kind

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.400 
kind of warmth it doesn't add any kind
of<00:02:25.980> coloring<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.790> your<00:02:26.910> sound<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.510> tries<00:02:27.780> it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
of coloring to your sound it tries it

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.740 
of coloring to your sound it tries it
tries<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.950> keep<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.250> exactly<00:02:29.400> as<00:02:29.940> as<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.660> was

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
tries to keep it exactly as as it was

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.290 
tries to keep it exactly as as it was
recorded<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.910> know<00:02:33.000> if<00:02:33.150> you've<00:02:33.270> never

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
recorded and you know if you've never

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.940 
recorded and you know if you've never
had<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.690> DAC<00:02:33.930> before<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.680> going<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.860> be

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
had a DAC before this is going to be

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.970 
had a DAC before this is going to be
something<00:02:35.280> really<00:02:35.430> impressive<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.030> you

now the Magni it looks great with the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.330 
now the Magni it looks great with the
Mahdi<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.020> it's<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.260> really<00:02:40.680> really<00:02:40.800> cheap<00:02:41.069> amp

drive headphones if you're using this

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.390 
drive headphones if you're using this
Modi<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.720> your<00:02:48.959> Mahdi<00:02:49.560> I'm<00:02:49.950> not<00:02:50.160> sure<00:02:50.310> which

Modi and your Mahdi I'm not sure which
one<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.730> if<00:02:51.000> you're<00:02:51.209> using<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:51.800> DAC<00:02:52.800> and

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
one it is if you're using this DAC and

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.220 
one it is if you're using this DAC and
you're<00:02:53.250> going<00:02:53.489> into<00:02:53.640> an<00:02:53.910> underpowered<00:02:54.660> amp<00:02:55.019> or

a cheap amp you know you don't have

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.580 
a cheap amp you know you don't have
enough<00:02:57.600> power<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.900> power<00:02:58.140> instead<00:02:58.530> of

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
enough power to power instead of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.960 
enough power to power instead of
headphones<00:02:59.010> it's<00:02:59.250> not<00:02:59.370> going<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.610> sound<00:02:59.760> that

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
headphones it's not going to sound that

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.479

good<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.959> one<00:03:01.170> gripe<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.190> set

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
good the one gripe I have with the set

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.920 
good the one gripe I have with the set
is<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:04.620> light<00:03:05.040> right<00:03:05.459> here<00:03:06.019> this<00:03:07.019> light<00:03:07.910> is

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
is this light right here this light is

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.470 
is this light right here this light is
so<00:03:09.930> bright<00:03:09.959> even<00:03:10.739> though<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.069> so<00:03:11.250> small<00:03:11.519> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
so bright even though it's so small and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.910 
so bright even though it's so small and
there's<00:03:12.660> no<00:03:12.840> switch<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.350> turn<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.560> off<00:03:13.739> the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
there's no switch to turn it off the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.830 
there's no switch to turn it off the
only<00:03:14.100> way<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.310> turn<00:03:14.489> this<00:03:14.670> off<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.150> if<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.630> take

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
only way to turn this off is if you take

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.199 
only way to turn this off is if you take
out<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.290> USB<00:03:16.739> cord<00:03:16.950> which<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.670> pain<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.120> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
out the USB cord which is a pain in the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.630 
out the USB cord which is a pain in the
butt<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.569> do<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:19.440> know<00:03:19.560> multiple<00:03:19.920> times<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.310> day

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.620 

so<00:03:23.640> if<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:23.880> if<00:03:24.120> you're<00:03:24.209> gonna<00:03:24.330> have<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.569> a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
sleep with this thing on you know you

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.349 
sleep with this thing on you know you
need<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:28.859> get<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.280> piece<00:03:29.519> of<00:03:29.579> tape<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.090> put<00:03:30.329> it

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
need to get a piece of tape and put it

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.349 
need to get a piece of tape and put it
over<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:31.320> little<00:03:31.620> light<00:03:32.070> now<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.329> a

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
over the this little light now is that a

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.330 
over the this little light now is that a
big<00:03:33.540> deal<00:03:33.720> no<00:03:33.959> not<00:03:34.230> really<00:03:34.410> at<00:03:34.560> all<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:35.190> is

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
big deal no not really at all this is

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.710 
big deal no not really at all this is
still<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.700> best<00:03:35.820> value<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.269> can<00:03:36.450> get<00:03:36.600> for

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720

$200<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.440> also<00:03:37.799> have<00:03:38.190> tried<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.640> JDS<00:03:39.510> labs<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
$200 I also have tried the JDS labs the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.349 
$200 I also have tried the JDS labs the
o2<00:03:41.420> amp<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.720> DAC<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.709> they<00:03:44.609> you<00:03:45.209> know<00:03:45.239> they

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
o2 amp and DAC and they you know they

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.720 
o2 amp and DAC and they you know they
sounded<00:03:46.019> almost<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:47.010> same<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.430> me<00:03:47.519> like

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
sounded almost the same to me like

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.930 
sounded almost the same to me like
exactly<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.420> same<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.519> those<00:03:50.700> that

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
exactly the same and you know those that

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.420 
exactly the same and you know those that
was<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.090> little<00:03:51.299> bit<00:03:51.420> more<00:03:51.570> expensive<00:03:52.109> so<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.130> you

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
was a little bit more expensive so I you

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.069 
was a little bit more expensive so I you
know<00:03:53.549> as<00:03:53.670> much<00:03:54.000> as<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.239> wanted<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.600> be<00:03:54.810> behind

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
know as much as I wanted to be behind

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:01.400 
know as much as I wanted to be behind
the<00:03:57.140> o2<00:03:58.140> design<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:59.780> like<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:00.959> better<00:04:01.170> because

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
the o2 design I like this better because

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.229 
the o2 design I like this better because
it's<00:04:01.560> cheaper<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.010> it<00:04:02.549> looks<00:04:02.760> better<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:03.060> mean

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
it's cheaper and it looks better I mean

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.900 
it's cheaper and it looks better I mean
aesthetically<00:04:03.989> it's<00:04:04.170> more<00:04:04.530> pleasing<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:05.489> RCA

bucks no if you get another set of RCA
cables<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.030> ended<00:04:21.239> up<00:04:21.269> getting<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.600> monoprice

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
cables I ended up getting the monoprice

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.690 
cables I ended up getting the monoprice
ones<00:04:22.320> from<00:04:22.500> Amazon<00:04:22.860> I'll<00:04:23.039> put<00:04:23.340> them<00:04:23.400> in<00:04:23.490> here

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
ones from Amazon I'll put them in here

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.700 
ones from Amazon I'll put them in here
real<00:04:23.850> quick

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.230 

and<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:28.770> think<00:04:28.860> these<00:04:29.100> were<00:04:29.310> maybe<00:04:29.460> like<00:04:29.699> seven

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
and I think these were maybe like seven

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.670 
and I think these were maybe like seven
bucks<00:04:30.419> so<00:04:30.840> it's<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.020> big<00:04:31.199> difference

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
bucks so it's a big difference

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.600 
bucks so it's a big difference
but<00:04:32.460> anyways<00:04:32.880> as<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.180> can<00:04:33.360> see<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:34.740> doesn't<00:04:35.130> it

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
but anyways as you can see it doesn't it

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.330 
but anyways as you can see it doesn't it
doesn't<00:04:35.790> stack<00:04:36.150> correctly<00:04:37.040> until<00:04:38.040> you<00:04:38.160> get

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
doesn't stack correctly until you get

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.510 
doesn't stack correctly until you get
this<00:04:38.520> thing<00:04:39.000> really<00:04:39.419> worn<00:04:40.410> in<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.919> mean<00:04:41.400> I've

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
had this these amps for like six months

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.870

that<00:06:00.360> low<00:06:00.690> of<00:06:00.720> a<00:06:01.020> level<00:06:01.190> to<00:06:02.300> have<00:06:03.300> it<00:06:03.450> really

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
that low of a level to have it really

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.890 
that low of a level to have it really
affect<00:06:03.960> me<00:06:04.110> and<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:05.550> don't<00:06:06.210> think<00:06:06.479> you're<00:06:06.720> going

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
affect me and I don't think you're going

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.510 
affect me and I don't think you're going
to<00:06:07.020> either<00:06:07.169> because<00:06:07.470> I<00:06:07.560> use<00:06:07.740> it<00:06:07.770> I<00:06:08.010> use<00:06:08.190> these

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
to either because I use it I use these

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.510 
to either because I use it I use these
primarily<00:06:09.030> with<00:06:09.330> the<00:06:09.950> he4<00:06:10.950> hundredths<00:06:11.430> and

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
primarily with the he4 hundredths and

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.250 
primarily with the he4 hundredths and
those<00:06:12.270> are<00:06:12.419> pretty<00:06:12.599> easy<00:06:12.840> to<00:06:13.020> drive

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
those are pretty easy to drive

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.930 
those are pretty easy to drive
headphones<00:06:13.770> and<00:06:14.039> I<00:06:14.220> don't<00:06:14.400> have<00:06:14.550> a<00:06:14.580> problem

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
headphones and I don't have a problem

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.760 
headphones and I don't have a problem
with<00:06:15.030> the<00:06:15.120> imbalances<00:06:15.660> and<00:06:15.870> the<00:06:16.050> and<00:06:16.590> the

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
with the imbalances and the and the

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.860 
with the imbalances and the and the
channels<00:06:17.300> overall<00:06:18.300> I<00:06:18.330> think<00:06:18.539> this<00:06:18.720> is<00:06:18.810> the

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
channels overall I think this is the

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.180 
channels overall I think this is the
