this particular firearm was made back in
the<00:03:11.599> late<00:03:11.810> 80s<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:13.120> it's<00:03:14.120> been<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.359> great

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
the late 80s and it's been a great

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.520 
the late 80s and it's been a great
shooter<00:03:15.280> however<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:17.390> really<00:03:18.019> struggled

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
shooter however I have really struggled

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.140 
shooter however I have really struggled
to<00:03:18.590> find<00:03:18.739> any<00:03:18.950> high-capacity<00:03:19.220> clips<00:03:19.879> that

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
to find any high-capacity clips that

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.410 
to find any high-capacity clips that
would<00:03:20.269> work<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.790> really<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.879> best<00:03:23.000> luck<00:03:23.269> I've

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
would work so really the best luck I've

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.409 
would work so really the best luck I've
had<00:03:23.450> is<00:03:23.750> with<00:03:23.870> Eagle<00:03:24.140> magazines<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:25.419> it's

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
had is with Eagle magazines and it's

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.240 
had is with Eagle magazines and it's
kind<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.780> hitting<00:03:26.989> this<00:03:27.230> for<00:03:27.440> some<00:03:27.620> reason<00:03:28.010> so

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
kind of hitting this for some reason so

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.819 
kind of hitting this for some reason so
I'm<00:03:28.639> really<00:03:28.910> hoping<00:03:31.000> that<00:03:32.000> these<00:03:32.150> rumor

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
I'm really hoping that these rumor

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.289 
I'm really hoping that these rumor
factory<00:03:33.829> high-capacity<00:03:34.250> magazines<00:03:35.030> going<00:03:35.239> to

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
factory high-capacity magazines going to

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:42.099 
factory high-capacity magazines going to
work<00:03:35.450> good<00:03:37.810> initially<00:03:38.810> putting<00:03:39.169> in<00:03:40.840> they<00:03:41.840> seem

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
work good initially putting in they seem

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.569 
work good initially putting in they seem
to<00:03:42.200> fit<00:03:42.410> decent<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:43.040> mean<00:03:43.069> it's<00:03:43.280> a<00:03:43.310> little<00:03:43.400> bit

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
to fit decent I mean it's a little bit

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.509 
to fit decent I mean it's a little bit
of<00:03:43.700> wobble<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.650> we'll<00:03:45.769> see<00:03:45.919> if<00:03:46.010> that<00:03:46.040> has<00:03:46.340> any

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
of wobble but we'll see if that has any

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.509

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
just taking this and shooting it with a

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.820 
just taking this and shooting it with a
ten<00:05:19.520> round<00:05:19.669> magazine<00:05:20.410> it's<00:05:21.410> nothing<00:05:21.710> like

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
ten round magazine it's nothing like

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.540 
ten round magazine it's nothing like
this<00:05:22.070> so<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:22.460> got<00:05:22.880> one<00:05:23.090> more<00:05:23.210> clip<00:05:24.370> I'm<00:05:25.370> gonna

cheap<00:05:29.900> I<00:05:30.169> think<00:05:30.320> you<00:05:30.530> can<00:05:30.650> get<00:05:30.740> him<00:05:30.860> at<00:05:30.950> cheaper

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
cheap I think you can get him at cheaper

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.129 
cheap I think you can get him at cheaper
than<00:05:31.400> dirt

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
than dirt

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.279 
than dirt
last<00:05:33.139> time<00:05:33.260> I<00:05:33.410> look<00:05:33.620> they<00:05:33.830> were<00:05:33.889> like<00:05:34.099> $8.99

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
last time I look they were like $8.99

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.650 
last time I look they were like $8.99
and<00:05:36.460> like<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.550> said<00:05:37.729> sometimes<00:05:37.940> they've<00:05:38.539> worked

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
and like I said sometimes they've worked

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.469 
and like I said sometimes they've worked
good<00:05:38.990> sometimes<00:05:39.650> they<00:05:39.800> haven't<00:05:40.220> so<00:05:40.940> this<00:05:41.240> one

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
good sometimes they haven't so this one

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.260 
good sometimes they haven't so this one
I<00:05:41.510> think<00:05:41.780> I've<00:05:41.870> used<00:05:42.050> it<00:05:42.169> once<00:05:42.349> before<00:05:43.270> and

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
I think I've used it once before and

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.650 
I think I've used it once before and
right<00:05:44.449> off<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.780> bat<00:05:44.990> just<00:05:46.180> feeding<00:05:47.180> off<00:05:47.479> the

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
right off the bat just feeding off the

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:55.340 
right off the bat just feeding off the
top<00:05:47.870> of<00:05:48.050> the<00:05:48.110> clip<00:05:48.380> I<00:05:50.050> get<00:05:51.050> a<00:05:51.080> miss<00:05:51.289> feed

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.690 

why<00:05:56.350> I<00:05:56.740> got<00:05:57.040> no<00:05:57.160> idea

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
why I got no idea

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.160 
why I got no idea
maybe<00:05:57.970> it's<00:05:58.150> because<00:05:58.240> it's<00:05:58.450> not<00:05:58.510> a<00:05:58.600> factory

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
maybe it's because it's not a factory

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.950 
maybe it's because it's not a factory
