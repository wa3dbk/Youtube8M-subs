00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.439
 the max and the next galley the rolled up 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.390
 strange band showing the new event 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.609
 champions aires which is the way of baby and 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.309
 So what are you going to do next? 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.110
 the house of the wolves and in this video here I 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.770
 I'll show you everything that went along this line. 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.590
 stream 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.059
 I've tried to get as much information 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.950
 possible to pass on to you 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.750
 so let's get that galley 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.520
 first for us to participate 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.100
 this event but we will need this 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.690
 item here that is the Trojan's feet and says that 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.539
 It's more or less a type of passport. 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.340
 that will give access to the event and the people 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.079
 you may notice that there are some polka dots 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.440
 yellow and also some balls 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.910
 means that every time a 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.710
 your team each time your team 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.840
 to win a match you will win a 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.610
 yellow ball of the one that every time 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.720
 your team lose you will win a 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.340
 red bubble 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.229
 if you receive three flags 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.049
 red or in case you miss three 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.490
 times you deleted the event then 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.250
 You'll have to buy a new one. 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.650
 passport and your victory will be generated 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.299
 but you can do as many times as you want 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.400
 the event the guys are going to happen 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.490
 weekly every weekend 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.680
 started on Friday and ended 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.320
 Tuesday when the game resets 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.930
 then it will be Friday Tuesday we will 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.780
 to play it will be very cool to 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.579
 But we won the games. 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.070
 we are releasing new indexes here 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.659
 no brother wins that seller who 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.280
 disciple of Osiris that he who goes 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.740
 pass the videos to us 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.600
 then we can observe that what 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.740
 some items require five 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.159
 victories 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.049
 other items require 67 and 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.430
 also eight in total are nine 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.049
 victor does not have any personal items 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.450
 showing you need nine wins 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.390
 but possibly in the future may come up 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.329
 some can have up to eight will also have 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.789
 consumable items and these items will be 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.410
 the following way people will use the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.120
 we will have some advantages like 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.500
 for example we will use an item 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.300
 We can cancel 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.550
 a defeat or else we will 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.950
 use another and we are going to start 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.870
 match with a win and we can 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.690
 note that we need an item 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.130
 called part of dogs that are as if 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.710
 were the coins of money that people 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.360
 will buy these consumable items and 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.170
 this coin will group in the event itself 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.060
 jewelry and users , and we here what 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.760
 the more interesting the guys that really are 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.280
 the game mode how it will work and 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.810
 is the following will be matches of 3 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.280
 several three players 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.950
 at first they said that they will have 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.860
 only this three-verse mode 3 and not 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.840
 there will be a matchmaking system or 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.300
 game will not form a match 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.489
 placing allies for you you will have 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.230
 obligatorily to enter with their 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.780
 friends there people you know you 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.230
 has on your list for you formed a 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.130
 beauty time is every match will last 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.530
 two minutes and if those two minutes 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.900
 and the members of the two 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.300
 teams are alive even if they are 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.280
 only one on each side will appear a 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.470
 flag to stimulate with the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.459
 control knows the multiplayer module 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.100
 control 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.019
 He appeared to flag in the middle of the map and 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.690
 team that can dominate that area 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.970
 first will lead the match will win 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.450
 the starting scoring system it is 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.299
 done by rounds or is five 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.340
 rounds for you to win a match at 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.040
 each time you delete the three 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.230
 opponents your team will win a 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.660
 round and at the end of five rounds 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.310
 losers will win the match and 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.230
 consequently they will win that 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.720
 that score I showed on the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.850
 beginning of the video that will give access to 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.380
 new items there at brother wins that 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.870
 can be purchased 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.940
 the main goal here is us 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.500
 eliminate opponents without leaving 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.700
 that they are received by their 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.620
 companions 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.890
 here it works more or less as a mode 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.840
 The crucible dispute is not like you 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.790
 revives automatically and you can only 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.630
 be relived by a companion of his 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.630
 team 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.209
 if you can eliminate the three without 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.750
 that they are revived you win a 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.450
 round and at the end of each match your 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.430
 team will face new players and 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.740
 never today 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.070
 even from the last match that you finished 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.690
 to face this is pretty cool because 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.580
 ends up avoiding that you suddenly get caught 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.020
 the front a very difficult team a 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.780
 Very easy time is that you do not get 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.330
 repeating over and over again like this 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.280
 as in the iron flag also the level 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.889
 will make difference the level of the player 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.990
 It will make a difference, yes. But they spoke. 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.870
 that matches are married by the 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.150
 hla system of the game in a more 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.009
 balanced with avoiding having 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.560
 very high-level players while 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.139
 very low level players and 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.729
 about the looks they said it was going to be 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.199
 quite rewarding 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.020
 You may even get some 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.180
 legendary items at the end of matches 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.460
 that you do not have to buy them from 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.259
 Blogger I won there on the reef I do not know 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.070
 How is this exactly going to work? 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.750
 type 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.090
 the album benÃ© that for example sometimes 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.160
 it comes certain item that you 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.280
 get the last drop or go 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.560
 get all that the 'brother' wins 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.270
 Are you going to get dropped too? 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.250
 I do not know exactly but they spoke 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.080
 that it will be possible until you have 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.539
 legendary there in victories 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.210
 but one thing is also about the scenarios 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:37.310
 that every week will be just one 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.949
 Friday scenario of the event will 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.020
 start until Tuesday there will not be 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.840
 variations of this scenario only in the 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.639
 scenario will change and will be 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.560
 so consecutively 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.320
 So people, you're excited and 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.150
 pressed the game mode I confess 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.280
 I 'm very excited, I 'm not 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.889
 a lot of pvp play but I really enjoyed it 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.900
 this way here I think it will have 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.180
 a very fast dynamic if it is going to have 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.849
 a very differentiated dynamic of the others 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.710
 modes despite having some similarity 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.030
 But I think it's going to be pretty cool. 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.590
 curious to see 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.630
 I'll bring all the news that 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.800
