00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 forest garden master new bringing is 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.240
 one more video to the channel for this year 2014 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.770
 I had no plans to do any special 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.320
 Christmas but I hope you are 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.580
 going very well with your family that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.230
 I am have had many gifts and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.790
 just that you have some good 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.070
 holidays in these Christmas holidays 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.920
 no and well I already said I did not want 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.410
 make a special but upload the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.900
 collection of sleeves I think a lot 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.820
 people will not have the interest to know 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.830
 simply my collection since good 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.070
 are 52 sleeves as you can read in 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.530
 the title but I had good wanted 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.730
 show you the collection that I have of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.250
 sleeves and good if you have any 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.110
 recommendation to ask me why not in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.090
 the comments leave me the sleeves that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
 you have really invested 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.500
 money and you think it's worth it 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.570
 people do the same good before 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.579
 that I do not forget because this is the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.890
 close-up I've taken from the sleeves that 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.070
 I have here three edition sleeves 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.870
 special or not limited edition but yes 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.220
 a tired edition they go that is called 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.440
 alien japan 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.449
 This is the first volume that includes 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.530
 first two of the first edition of 12 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.570
 the first volume of dragonball and the first 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.460
 monster tome this manga really is 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.460
 a manga that I really liked this 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.229
 style well police genre and good is 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.390
 quite interesting you see as a 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.299
 mystery thriller also really 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.770
 I liked this this naoki manga 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.219
 urasawa and I think that good 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.860
 I've seen many videos like manga 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.810
 twenty century boys that also deserves 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.590
 I 'm sorry they did not tell me that it's quite 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.479
 good 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.020
 this author then here we have for 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.240
 supposed naruto scattered volumes 61 62 and 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.050
 67 brings me a little closer I do not know if it 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.930
 you will see well 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.330
 then he took one of torico a manga that 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.200
 I really do not recommend reading without having 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.870
 eaten before two tomes of croze that 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.510
 It really is one that I bought because 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.300
 well it was recent had come out of this 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.070
 same year the season was one of the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.930
 good the last ones that had 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.000
 published and well then I'm going to buy one 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.149
 of this type but really the plot in 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.950
 the one that develops this manga is 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.420
 just to hang out I do not think 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 that this manga has much more 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.700
 transcendence in the future as it 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.280
 based on the plot in a good guy that 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.100
 he moves to an institute and is a 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.560
 institute in which there is as certain 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.380
 rivalry between different groups of 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.970
 gang friends and want to get 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.070
 all the territory and be the strongest 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.170
 inside that institute is not a plot 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.910
 a bit strange and it will matchmaker 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.340
 institute and street but above all 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.630
 focused on the world of students 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.010
 and teens is not a manga 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.950
 I would simply say to hang out 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.990
 then of course hunter is hunter is 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.740
 a fabulous manga good here you have 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.080
 Kiva figurine is a fabulous manga 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.620
 as the manga was telling the story 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.470
 the drawing is very good 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.140
 it's not at all a work of art is a 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.239
 very simple drawing and what good I think 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.980
 that if we compare it with the anime 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.840
 last animation that has been made of the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.430
 study of MatthÃ¤us is that he has nothing 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.470
 that see the drawing is the quality is 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.599
 spectacular that of the anime and the drawing 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.400
 here is how simple and sometimes as 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.900
 child could not say but the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.610
 manga the story is very good and 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.970
 really some sones that I more 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.400
 I recommend then the four guide volumes 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.709
 that will teach tabuk the one piece what 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.150
 you also have in the list that I'm going to 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.220
 leave this same video of your stores 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.349
 true and in which data is displayed 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.569
 hidden that are not shown in the manga 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.980
 that he himself has written 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.989
 ichiro gives not as you can see here in the 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.370
 title and we already started with all wampis it 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.799
 said my collection is not very 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.819
 Wide simply by the amount of 52 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.190
 tomes 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.460
 but already what comes just wampis I have 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:50.150
 from volume 1 to number 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:53.560
 we went down here as number 12 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.569
 followed by the number of 15-16 take a leap 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.120
 39 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.120
 and then from 40 to the 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:09.220
 49 50 to 5 52 60 61 64 and from 64 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.770
 reaches the 71 that is the last volume 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.550
 which is published here in Spain is , 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.130
 Volume 71 is the beginning of three rose 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.000
 as you can see there we have a 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.550
 fantastic cover and nothing that's all 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.100
 my collection good those three that I've 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.380
 said at the beginning of the video and all this 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.880
 naruto torico collection really 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.890
 theoretical is one of the sleeves I have 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.600
 thought of buying back wampis for 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:40.849
 course I want to collect the whole 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:43.249
 good naruto I bought 71-67 really 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.349
 I do not know, I think the entire Aryan collection 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.270
 but I'm not in a hurry, not the one 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.129
 Of course, I'm not going to buy more. 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.849
 the croze and I say to hang out 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:55.249
 I do not have much desire to follow 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.289
 reading that manga and hunter the camper and 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.629
 Well the manga is a very good story 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.819
 then I will continue buying little by little and 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:05.599
 nothing I hope you liked this 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:08.599
