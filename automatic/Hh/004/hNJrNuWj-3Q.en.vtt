00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
so you can carry multiple batteries if

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.400 
so you can carry multiple batteries if
you're<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.300> bit<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.750> road<00:00:48.930> warrior<00:00:49.140> it's

you're a bit of a road warrior it's
quite<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.120> useful<00:00:51.170> feature<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.829> swap

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
quite a useful feature so you can swap

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.380 
quite a useful feature so you can swap
them<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.610> can<00:00:53.640> also<00:00:53.879> plug<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> in

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
them in and out you can also plug it in

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
them in and out you can also plug it in
if<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.570> want<00:00:54.690> extended<00:00:55.530> usage<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.399> you're

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
if you want extended usage if you're

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.660 
if you want extended usage if you're
near<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> power<00:00:56.910> outlet<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.289> Wi-Fi<00:00:58.859> 2200

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
hooking it up here to an iPad and we can

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.310 
hooking it up here to an iPad and we can
see<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.000> kind<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.390> speed<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.110> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
see the kind of speed that you get to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.050 
see the kind of speed that you get to

unbuttons website and it's fairly image
intensive<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.939> can<00:01:17.939> take<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> few<00:01:18.750> seconds<00:01:19.140> to

data at the bottom there but it's

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.990

certainly<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.350> lot<00:01:31.470> faster<00:01:31.950> than<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.310> AT&amp;T

based which is in New York City but for
most<00:01:41.700> usages<00:01:42.329> found<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.409> speed<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> my

most usages found the speed of the my
fight<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.579> very<00:01:45.240> good<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.170> see

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
fight to be very good and you can see

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.289 
fight to be very good and you can see
it's<00:01:46.470> loaded<00:01:46.799> up<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.100> whole<00:01:47.820> page<00:01:48.030> there

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
it's loaded up the whole page there

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.950 
it's loaded up the whole page there
pretty<00:01:48.600> quickly<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:50.090> let's<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> look<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
pretty quickly and let's have a look to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.100 
pretty quickly and let's have a look to
see<00:01:52.280> what<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.610> using<00:01:53.850> Google<00:01:54.630> Maps<00:01:54.810> so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
see what it's like using Google Maps so

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.760 
see what it's like using Google Maps so
we're<00:01:55.649> going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.920> zoom<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.340> on

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
we're going to zoom in here on

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
we're going to zoom in here on
California<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.070> then<00:01:59.250> San<00:02:00.149> Francisco<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
California or and then San Francisco and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.600 
California or and then San Francisco and
let's<00:02:01.049> see<00:02:01.200> how<00:02:01.290> quickly<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:02.250> render<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
let's see how quickly we can render the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.340 
let's see how quickly we can render the
data<00:02:02.820> there<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.270> actually<00:02:03.420> pretty

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
data there it's actually pretty

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
data there it's actually pretty
responsive<00:02:06.649> again<00:02:07.649> not<00:02:08.039> quite<00:02:08.640> as<00:02:08.819> quick<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
responsive again not quite as quick as a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.600 
responsive again not quite as quick as a
sort<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.349> home

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
sort of home

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.420 
sort of home
cable<00:02:12.240> connection<00:02:12.630> but<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.430> certainly

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
cable connection but it's certainly

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.940 
cable connection but it's certainly
quick<00:02:14.730> enough<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.210> you're<00:02:15.450> out<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.470> about<00:02:16.530> on

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
quick enough if you're out and about on

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.610 
quick enough if you're out and about on
the<00:02:17.070> road<00:02:17.220> was<00:02:18.180> also<00:02:18.450> able<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.780> watch<00:02:19.050> Netflix

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the road was also able to watch Netflix

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.120 
the road was also able to watch Netflix
on<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> iPads<00:02:21.200> Netflix<00:02:22.200> app<00:02:22.440> pretty<00:02:22.920> easily

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
on the iPads Netflix app pretty easily

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.550 
on the iPads Netflix app pretty easily
using<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.910> MiFi<00:02:24.420> which<00:02:24.660> was<00:02:24.930> something

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
using the MiFi which was something

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.990 
using the MiFi which was something
that's<00:02:25.800> very<00:02:25.950> useful<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.460> you're<00:02:26.640> going<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.910> be

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
that's very useful if you're going to be

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.960 
that's very useful if you're going to be
on<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.240> road<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.660> away<00:02:27.750> from<00:02:27.900> home<00:02:28.790> let's<00:02:29.790> see

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
on the road and away from home let's see

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.330 
on the road and away from home let's see
here<00:02:30.210> if<00:02:30.240> we<00:02:30.510> can<00:02:30.830> see<00:02:31.830> what<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.130> view<00:02:32.310> looks

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
here if we can see what the view looks

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.340 
here if we can see what the view looks
like<00:02:32.790> on<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.090> Golden<00:02:33.420> Gate<00:02:33.540> Bridge<00:02:33.600> so<00:02:34.020> we<00:02:34.170> can

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
like on the Golden Gate Bridge so we can

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.640 
like on the Golden Gate Bridge so we can
we<00:02:34.710> can<00:02:34.740> zoom<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.190> there<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.580> Google<00:02:35.940> Maps<00:02:36.150> and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
we can zoom in there on Google Maps and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.530 
we can zoom in there on Google Maps and
let's<00:02:37.650> see<00:02:37.830> if<00:02:37.920> we<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.160> get<00:02:38.430> Street<00:02:39.150> View<00:02:39.390> up

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
let's see if we can get Street View up

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.750 
let's see if we can get Street View up
and<00:02:39.720> running<00:02:40.020> here<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:41.400> doesn't<00:02:41.610> look<00:02:41.700> like

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
and running here it doesn't look like

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.010 
and running here it doesn't look like
we're<00:02:41.940> going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.240> able<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.510> get<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.660> view<00:02:42.900> in

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
we're going to be able to get a view in

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.600 
we're going to be able to get a view in
the<00:02:43.140> sea<00:02:43.350> but<00:02:43.740> there<00:02:43.920> see<00:02:44.100> if<00:02:44.160> we<00:02:44.280> can<00:02:44.400> drop<00:02:44.580> a

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
the sea but there see if we can drop a

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.240 
the sea but there see if we can drop a
pin<00:02:44.790> actually<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.390> bridge<00:02:45.650> there<00:02:46.650> we<00:02:46.890> go

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
pin actually on the bridge there we go

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.270 
pin actually on the bridge there we go
and<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:48.480> will<00:02:49.050> take<00:02:49.290> us<00:02:49.470> now<00:02:49.680> onto<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
and that will take us now onto the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.370 
and that will take us now onto the
bridge<00:02:50.430> itself<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.090> again<00:02:51.780> we're<00:02:52.110> putting

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
bridge itself and again we're putting

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.500 
bridge itself and again we're putting
all<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.650> data<00:02:52.890> over<00:02:53.340> at<00:02:53.820> Sprint's<00:02:54.150> Network

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
all this data over at Sprint's Network

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.310 
all this data over at Sprint's Network
