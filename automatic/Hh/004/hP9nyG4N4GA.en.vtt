 the pomegranate is composed mostly 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.449
 part for water and provides very few 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.039
 calories we will discover all of them 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.300
 The benefits and healing properties 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.300

 Studies have shown that this fruit 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.520
 could be key in the prevention of 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.740
 Cancer 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.720
 well then 7 exposed information and I 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.540
 I'll center with that of the grenade with 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.370
 eduardo vidal that as we are 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.369
 and you are well 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.130
 Murcia do not know what happens in Murcia 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.829
 lately investigating a lot 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.270
 some unity from the top council 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.340
 of scientific research there 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.610
 in Murcia and you always leave with 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.049
 nutraceuticals observe of that type 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.460
 tell me we know what to use 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.560
 the pomegranate juice how did this 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.450
 good story really were 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.130
 Spanish researchers of the csic what 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.649
 discovered in 12 years ago that the grenade 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.319
 It is the fruit with the greatest amount of 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.229
 variety of antioxidants contains a 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.979
 polyphenol which is the largest polyphenol 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.770
 discovered to date that is the 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.890
 punicalagina and good from starting from 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.330
 that base for 12 years numerous 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.939
 research teams from around the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.729
 world are opening lines of 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.360
 research on its properties to me 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.020
 they had asked me once for grenades 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.340
 this is true grenades of my people 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.860
 for a friend who had a disease 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.560
 inflammatory bowel and that was very 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.140
 good diet provide good grenade there 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.479
 He stayed after that was when I met him 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.880
 you and I tried the pomegranate juice then 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.070
 we connect with concretely with a great 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.860
 specialist of the dexeus de 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.959
 barcelona doctor gilberto chéchile and we 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.120
 brought his work on the treatment 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.370
 of prostate cancer or prevention 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.290
 of the one of benign noma and concretely 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.570
 of prostate cancer with good pomegranate 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.980
 how are things now good the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.720
 true that we are quite happy 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.050
 five years ago we opened a 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.190
 project called great tuna europa 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.030
 specifically one of the products that 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.200
 we have developed that granatum plus 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.440
 natural 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.720
 a natural juice of pomegranate with parts of 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.430
 the shell has been selected by 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.140
 the university of kansas is 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.540
 university is going to finance a study 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.040
 worldwide among consumers 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.080
 specifically our pomegranate juice 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.730
 Because of its quality, it has been the only one 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.880
 been selected by throughout the union 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.290
 European what is curious is that 90% 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.810
 of the pomegranates are in the community 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.330
 Valencian effectively what happens 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.340
 is that 90% is not consumed in Spain 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.660
 when it's Granada season ardennes 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.360
 Spanish are consumed in the five 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.030
 continents because it is one of the most 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.849
 valued the world and the recommendation 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.030
 of what is a jar of what is a 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.079
 boat that is like a glass which is the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.069
 consumption recommended by 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.910
 specialists for patients then 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.340
 approximately all 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.290
 investigations are based on what 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.410
 are 200 milliliters of sand juice goes 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.000
 clear until today in the market 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.330
 there are many products or many and 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.160
 müller nothing that they are not really 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.650
 pomegranate juice to such said are 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.600
 mixed products but what is a 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.720
 quality pomegranate juice would be about 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.610
 200 milliliters we have also extracted a 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.470
 type of capsules in which we have 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.150
 concentrated the antioxidants by 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.500
 example each capsule according to the study 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.620
 what the university has done 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.270
 Hernández equals 100 milliliters of 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.460
 juice each capsule with which with two 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.710
 daily capsules we will be doing 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.230
 the consumption with which they are doing 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.350
 investigations or patients 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.460
 take that amount 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.790
 we know that it also has an effect 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.640
 anti-inflammatory the pomegranate juice but 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.780
 we know that the majority behind tumors 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.209
 there are always inflammatory processes 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.850
 chronic in a percentage of the day of 15 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.820
 percent but the applications would be 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.030
 one of the prostate cancer would be a 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.050
 in Andrology it is also very useful for 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.620
 what for what problems for example 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.460
 in andrology because of processes we say 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.110
 of 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.490
 spermatogenesis erectile dysfunction by 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.569
 example is a 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.550
 there is a study made in the USA 47% 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.980
 of the patients who took juice from 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.900
 granada yes 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.570
 clear is why vascular cause that 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.400
 we would say by accumulation of per author 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.880
 oxidative in bodies every good emotion 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.440
 if the ego if something I'm going to the 18th day of 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.350
 November was presented in the option 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.380
 American nephrology study that 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.900
 It has been done in 101 patients 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.150
 what happens in dialysis every three days of 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.220
 the week all those patients are 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.560
 has given pomegranate juice is a study 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.930
 double blind 101 patients took juice 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.530
 of grenade and the hundred data for 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.740
 patients a placebo as the ones 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.680
 patients who took juice was nothing 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.050
 the improvement was substantial or they had 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.390
 a lot less income with 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.770
 infection problems that are 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.169
 common problems in patients of 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.750
 with what happens in dialysis and good has been 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.389
 recently presented that study gives 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.909
 around the world and we say again the 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.259
 we cultivate 90% of the sand but this 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.840
 It is totally unknown in Spain 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.940
 clear, that's why we're here and I 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.639
 will count in the coming days this 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.129
 this book that has brought me you 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.900
 curiously is the cover is the 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.940
 Granada is a book of different 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.909
 scientific investigations that have 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.289
 made in different countries and now 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.509
 we will talk about this matter I thank you 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.520
 very much your presence thank you very much 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:11.930
 we really wanted to know 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.180
 who had been the person who had 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.060
 started this process because the doctor 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.250
 gilberto chéchile of concretely the 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.690
 university clinic wishes 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.540
 barcelona had told us a lot about 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.480
 this matter thank you very much until soon 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:30.010
 granatum plus committed to the 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.010
 quality and research
