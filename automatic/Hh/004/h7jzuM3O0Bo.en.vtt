00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
take that under or last one me that's
way<00:02:19.730> it's<00:02:19.760> twisted<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.820> my<00:02:22.970> things<00:02:23.270> hard

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
way it's twisted just to my things hard

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:32.699 
way it's twisted just to my things hard
for<00:02:23.810> me<00:02:25.840> that's<00:02:26.840> okay

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.390

all the way back down then the other the

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.920 
all the way back down then the other the
next<00:03:09.310> strand

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.120 

yeah<00:03:16.500> wonder

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
is get a file and just follow them a bit

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.240 
is get a file and just follow them a bit
flat<00:04:01.690> there<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.290> polish<00:04:02.739> them<00:04:02.920> up<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.099> little

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
bit all right

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.319 
bit all right
but<00:04:04.480> bluffing<00:04:04.840> will<00:04:04.959> if<00:04:05.079> you've<00:04:05.230> got<00:04:05.440> one<00:04:06.329> with

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
but bluffing will if you've got one with

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.199 
but bluffing will if you've got one with
a<00:04:07.360> bit<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.660> Rouge<00:04:07.870> on<00:04:08.110> a<00:04:08.140> piece<00:04:08.530> of<00:04:08.709> leather

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
a bit of Rouge on a piece of leather

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.400 
a bit of Rouge on a piece of leather
just<00:04:10.209> so<00:04:10.329> they<00:04:10.450> sit<00:04:10.720> through<00:04:10.930> nice<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.140> easy

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
just so they sit through nice and easy

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.430 
just so they sit through nice and easy
and<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:13.120> way<00:04:13.269> you<00:04:13.329> get<00:04:13.569> into<00:04:13.720> these<00:04:13.930> finest

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
and that way you get into these finest

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.150 
and that way you get into these finest
streams

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
streams

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.900 
streams
otherwise<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.120> makes<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.450> a<00:04:16.479> bit<00:04:16.630> hard<00:04:17.910> and

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
otherwise it makes it a bit hard and

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:31.230 
otherwise it makes it a bit hard and
even<00:04:19.269> now<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:25.690> might<00:04:25.900> need<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.260> use<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.440> food

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.279 

and<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.870> course<00:04:32.050> as<00:04:32.319> you<00:04:32.470> go<00:04:32.650> down<00:04:34.050> this<00:04:35.050> will

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
and of course as you go down this will

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:43.159 
and of course as you go down this will
tighten<00:04:35.590> up<00:04:35.860> too<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:41.680> gives<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:41.919> a<00:04:41.949> nice<00:04:42.190> tight

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
tighten up too it gives you a nice tight

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:50.920 
tighten up too it gives you a nice tight
finish

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930
