00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.700
 it is an important point only 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.009
 we need our computer and 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.649
 our good phone let's start 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.280
 The first step is to open the application 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:24.450
 call and we mark the following command 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.520

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.860
 important of all make sure 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.219

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.270
 digits we will need later 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.970
