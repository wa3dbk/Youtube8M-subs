00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 when Fabrizio came to see me 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.719

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.310
 from the gate of his where he lived 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.770
 my father- in- law came out because of mine 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.830
 father in law we always said not to open a 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.750
 all because you know how to trust 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.740
 wait before opening the gate 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.769
 ask who my father-in-law is then 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.850

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.210

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.280
 said in dialect aino knows 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.700
 because my southern mother-in-law I don't 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.690

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.600

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.409
 see it and that certainly in the courtyard that 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.200
 I was cutting some peppers there 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.580
 in the shade not with my front apron 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.740
 my husband hears my father-in-law's dogs 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.180
 barking faces the corner of the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.520
 home and makes me know who is in the yard of 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.350
 type fano there is de andrè 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.570
 I said but it must be said but don't take me 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.329
 around you get smart what and what comes to you 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.710
 in mind today in the meantime I see it 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.850
 arrive 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.400
 and then there 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.540
 Linen no I have not understood anything I 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.360
 so excited and how I don't know for myself 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.159
 it was all a dream 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.540
 and then I said them but ma 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.159
 fabrizio bicio has passed have passed 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.670
 many years no longer show up 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.100
 eto'o but theo remembered a song there 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.430
 he said I know 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.450
 we were both excited though 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:10.310
 in the song yes there is something that has me 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:13.140
 hit because we lived in two families 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.920
 completely different as you use as 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.130
 habit like ways of thinking and me 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.660
 I was rather say almost enslaved 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.290
 here I had no way of having 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.030
 contact with others and when I was 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.989
 almost ten years 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:38.420
 I think he saw how rowe like 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.090
 I lived my childhood and 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.160
 and as if he wanted to take me away 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.160
 he wanted to take me away from here
