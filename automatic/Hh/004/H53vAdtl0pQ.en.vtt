00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
okay let's learn how to do a giant fan

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.430 
okay let's learn how to do a giant fan
which<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.730> conveniently<00:00:06.270> my<00:00:06.540> profile<00:00:07.109> picture

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
which is conveniently my profile picture

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.159 
which is conveniently my profile picture
on<00:00:07.740> youtube<00:00:08.069> right<00:00:08.280> now<00:00:08.780> it's<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.839> picture<00:00:10.019> I

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:10.169 
on youtube right now it's a picture I

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:11.779 
on youtube right now it's a picture I
took<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.499> me<00:00:10.679> holding<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.039> giant<00:00:11.190> fan<00:00:11.490> from<00:00:11.669> a

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:11.789 
took of me holding a giant fan from a

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.359 
took of me holding a giant fan from a
couple<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.119> years<00:00:12.209> ago<00:00:12.589> so<00:00:13.589> let's<00:00:13.889> learn<00:00:14.190> it

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:14.369 
couple of years ago so let's learn it

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.640 
couple of years ago so let's learn it
there's<00:00:14.789> three<00:00:15.209> ways<00:00:15.419> to<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.080> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
there's three ways to do it and the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.370 
there's three ways to do it and the
first<00:00:16.890> way<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.099> easy<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.599> last<00:00:18.869> way<00:00:19.140> is

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
first way is easy and the last way is

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.950 
first way is easy and the last way is
hard<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.009> I<00:00:20.730> won't<00:00:20.939> show<00:00:21.269> you<00:00:21.330> how<00:00:21.480> my<00:00:21.630> fingers

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
hard and I won't show you how my fingers

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.009 
hard and I won't show you how my fingers
what<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.289> intermediate<00:00:23.070> way<00:00:23.429> is<00:00:23.609> but<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.869> in

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
what the intermediate way is but it's in

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.839 
what the intermediate way is but it's in
between<00:00:25.279> easy<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.519> hard

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
between easy and hard

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.279 
between easy and hard
okay<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.539> let's<00:00:28.699> box<00:00:29.699> learn<00:00:29.909> how<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:29.999> do<00:00:30.150> it

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
okay so let's box learn how to do it

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.810 
okay so let's box learn how to do it
we're<00:00:31.289> going<00:00:31.409> to<00:00:31.529> take<00:00:31.679> our<00:00:32.070> deck<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.579> we're

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
we're going to take our deck and we're

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.600 
we're going to take our deck and we're
going<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.000> lay<00:00:33.149> one<00:00:33.180> card<00:00:33.390> down<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.739> lay<00:00:35.399> one

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
going to lay one card down and lay one

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.180 
going to lay one card down and lay one
card<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.620> we're<00:00:37.620> going<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.829> do<00:00:38.010> that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
card up and we're going to do that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.540 
card up and we're going to do that
through<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.149> entire<00:00:39.390> deck<00:00:40.760> all<00:00:41.760> 52<00:00:42.420> cards<00:00:43.550> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
through the entire deck all 52 cards and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.759 
through the entire deck all 52 cards and
what<00:00:45.090> we're<00:00:45.239> doing<00:00:45.800> here<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:48.140> our<00:00:49.140> preparation

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
what we're doing here as our preparation

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.889 
what we're doing here as our preparation
is<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.280> are<00:00:50.399> faking<00:00:50.910> what's<00:00:51.239> called<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.629> Faro

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
is we are faking what's called a Faro

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.290 
is we are faking what's called a Faro
shuffle<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> don't<00:00:54.030> know<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:54.269> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
shuffle and if you don't know what a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.229 
shuffle and if you don't know what a
Faro<00:00:54.539> shuffle<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.710> will<00:00:56.219> cover<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
Faro shuffle is I will cover that in the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
Faro shuffle is I will cover that in the
advanced<00:00:57.750> version<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.440> or<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:58.949> hard

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
advanced version of this or the hard

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.360 
advanced version of this or the hard
version<00:01:00.289> it's<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.410> intended<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.339> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
version it's not intended to be really a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.150 
version it's not intended to be really a
tutorial<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:03.269> how<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.929> because<00:01:04.320> quite

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
tutorial of how to do it because quite

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.530 
tutorial of how to do it because quite
frankly<00:01:05.520> I<00:01:05.640> don't<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:06.030> there's<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.300> an

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
frankly I don't think there's really an

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.470 
frankly I don't think there's really an
easy<00:01:06.840> way<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.230> do<00:01:07.620> it<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.730> the<00:01:08.880> more

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
easy way to do it it's one of the more

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.110 
easy way to do it it's one of the more
difficult<00:01:10.490> things<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.730> with<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.910> deck<00:01:12.090> of

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
difficult things to do with a deck of

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.070 
difficult things to do with a deck of
cards<00:01:12.240> quickly<00:01:13.230> and<00:01:13.860> efficiently<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:15.080> anyway

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
cards quickly and efficiently but anyway

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.410 
cards quickly and efficiently but anyway
now<00:01:16.200> we've<00:01:16.320> got<00:01:16.470> our<00:01:16.590> cards<00:01:16.890> all<00:01:17.010> laid<00:01:17.220> out

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
now we've got our cards all laid out

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.840 
now we've got our cards all laid out
we're<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.010> square<00:01:20.010> them<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.550> we're

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
we're going to square them up and we're

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.570 
we're going to square them up and we're
going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> push<00:01:21.390> them<00:01:21.630> into<00:01:22.110> each<00:01:22.230> other<00:01:22.580> but

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
going to push them into each other but

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.110 
going to push them into each other but
not<00:01:23.730> all<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> way<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.450> we're<00:01:25.410> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.120> angle

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
not all the way and we're going to angle

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.630 
not all the way and we're going to angle
them<00:01:27.600> into<00:01:28.530> each<00:01:28.650> other<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.490> use

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
them into each other so that we can use

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.050 
them into each other so that we can use
our<00:01:29.730> thumbs<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.710> square<00:01:31.710> them<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.160> up<00:01:32.670> into

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
our thumbs and square them all up into

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.820 
our thumbs and square them all up into
two<00:01:33.480> nice<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.830> even<00:01:35.520> packets<00:01:36.000> okay

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
two nice and even packets okay

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.540 
two nice and even packets okay
so<00:01:37.830> once<00:01:38.010> we<00:01:38.160> have<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:39.860> get<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.280> back

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
so once we have that get this one back

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.310 
so once we have that get this one back
there<00:01:41.850> okay<00:01:42.560> we're<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.920> pull<00:01:44.280> them<00:01:44.550> back

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
there okay we're going to pull them back

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.310 
there okay we're going to pull them back
to<00:01:46.320> even<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.570> we<00:01:48.570> want<00:01:48.780> them<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:48.990> be

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to even and we want them to be

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.750 
to even and we want them to be
interlaced<00:01:50.030> about<00:01:51.030> an<00:01:51.980> inch<00:01:52.980> or<00:01:53.430> an<00:01:53.490> inch<00:01:53.550> and

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
interlaced about an inch or an inch and

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.290 
interlaced about an inch or an inch and
a<00:01:53.790> half<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:55.010> then<00:01:56.010> since<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.370> have<00:01:56.400> 52<00:01:56.880> cards

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
a half and then since we have 52 cards

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.690 
a half and then since we have 52 cards
if<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.350> started<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> bottom<00:01:59.280> we're<00:01:59.580> going

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
if we started on the bottom we're going

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.850 
if we started on the bottom we're going
to<00:01:59.760> end<00:01:59.910> on<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.120> top<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.320> we're<00:02:01.470> going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.650> take

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
to end on the top so we're going to take

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.680 
to end on the top so we're going to take
one<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> sides<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.060> doesn't<00:02:03.090> matter<00:02:03.450> which

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
one of the sides it doesn't matter which

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.180 
one of the sides it doesn't matter which
and<00:02:04.550> slide<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.700> down<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.480> you<00:02:06.630> have

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
and slide it down so that you have

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.690 
and slide it down so that you have
bottom<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.340> bottom<00:02:08.909> on<00:02:09.090> front<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.170> back

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
bottom and bottom on front and back

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.069 
bottom and bottom on front and back
that's<00:02:11.700> going<00:02:11.969> to<00:02:12.060> give<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.299> your<00:02:12.390> grip<00:02:12.689> for

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
that's going to give you your grip for

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.230 
that's going to give you your grip for
the<00:02:13.109> two<00:02:13.319> ends<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.739> giant<00:02:14.010> fan

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
the two ends of the giant fan

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.150 
the two ends of the giant fan
so<00:02:15.570> from<00:02:16.140> there<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:16.500> just<00:02:16.530> take<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.980> whole

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
so from there you just take the whole

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160 
so from there you just take the whole
thing<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:18.270> put<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.570> in<00:02:18.660> your<00:02:18.750> hand<00:02:18.960> just

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
thing and you put it in your hand just

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.500 
thing and you put it in your hand just
as<00:02:19.380> if<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.620> were<00:02:19.650> doing<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.010> fan<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.150> bottom

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
as if you were doing a fan on the bottom

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.250 
as if you were doing a fan on the bottom
half<00:02:21.690> only

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
half only

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.800 
half only
I<00:02:22.670> use<00:02:23.670> my<00:02:23.850> thumb<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.300> can<00:02:24.450> use<00:02:24.570> whatever

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
I use my thumb you can use whatever

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.270 
I use my thumb you can use whatever
finger<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.140> want<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.590> actually<00:02:25.680> do<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.070> fan

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
finger you want to actually do the fan

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.280 
finger you want to actually do the fan
but<00:02:26.610> basically<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.360> just<00:02:27.390> spread<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.080> cards

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
but basically you just spread the cards

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.350 
but basically you just spread the cards
out<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:31.530> end<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.800> with<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.190> big<00:02:32.790> huge<00:02:33.000> fan

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
out and you end up with a big huge fan

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.000 
out and you end up with a big huge fan
that's<00:02:33.570> got<00:02:33.810> two<00:02:33.990> sets<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.290> cards<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.800> and

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
that's got two sets of cards in it and

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.590 
that's got two sets of cards in it and
here<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.520> end<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.880> can<00:02:36.030> see<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.390> have

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
here on the end you can see that I have

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.780 
here on the end you can see that I have
two<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.230> that's<00:02:37.860> because<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.280> had<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.580> slide

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
two and that's because I had to slide

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.250 
two and that's because I had to slide
one<00:02:38.970> down<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.540> could<00:02:39.690> actually<00:02:39.810> do<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.110> with

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
one down you could actually do this with

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.250 
one down you could actually do this with
51<00:02:40.770> cards<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:42.120> would<00:02:42.240> be<00:02:42.390> completely<00:02:42.900> even

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
51 cards and it would be completely even

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.590 
51 cards and it would be completely even
if<00:02:43.440> you're<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.970> compulsive<00:02:45.750> about<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.430> but

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
if you're that compulsive about it but

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.000 
if you're that compulsive about it but
you<00:02:48.600> can<00:02:48.750> close<00:02:48.960> this<00:02:49.140> up<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.530> know<00:02:49.620> just<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
you can close this up you know just the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.920 
you can close this up you know just the
same<00:02:50.160> way<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.400> could<00:02:50.760> with<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> normal-sized

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
same way you could with a normal-sized

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.360 
same way you could with a normal-sized
fan<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.500> they'll<00:02:52.620> stay<00:02:52.830> together<00:02:52.890> pretty

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
fan and they'll stay together pretty

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.670 
fan and they'll stay together pretty
well<00:02:53.490> once<00:02:54.390> you're<00:02:54.540> done<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.080> grab<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.470> to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
well once you're done you can grab on to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.280 
well once you're done you can grab on to
them<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.070> do<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.060> nice<00:02:57.270> fridge<00:02:57.690> or<00:02:57.960> something

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
them and do a nice fridge or something

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.860 
them and do a nice fridge or something
like<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:59.040> square<00:02:59.580> them<00:02:59.700> up<00:02:59.790> alright<00:03:00.690> so

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
like that to square them up alright so

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.610 
like that to square them up alright so
the<00:03:01.020> intermediate<00:03:01.290> way<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:04.230> take<00:03:04.440> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
the intermediate way is to take the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.340 
the intermediate way is to take the
cards<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.460> split<00:03:05.730> them<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.120> half<00:03:06.180> as<00:03:06.930> even<00:03:07.230> as

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
cards to split them in half as even as

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.910 
cards to split them in half as even as
you<00:03:07.410> can<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:09.260> you're<00:03:10.260> actually<00:03:10.650> going<00:03:10.800> to

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
you can and you're actually going to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.190 
you can and you're actually going to
shuffle<00:03:11.370> both<00:03:12.240> of<00:03:12.480> these<00:03:12.570> halves<00:03:12.840> together<00:03:13.280> as

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
shuffle both of these halves together as

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.100 
shuffle both of these halves together as
even<00:03:16.200> as<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.980> can<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:20.420> this<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.570> not<00:03:21.750> going<00:03:21.959> to

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
even as you can and this is not going to

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.530 
even as you can and this is not going to
be<00:03:22.200> as<00:03:22.290> perfect<00:03:22.680> as<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:23.310> Faro<00:03:23.610> shuffle<00:03:23.700> which

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
be as perfect as a Faro shuffle which

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.080 
be as perfect as a Faro shuffle which
we'll<00:03:24.690> cover<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.110> minute<00:03:25.350> but<00:03:26.130> it's<00:03:26.610> pretty

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
we'll cover in a minute but it's pretty

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.350 
we'll cover in a minute but it's pretty
good<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:29.220> better<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.610> are<00:03:29.640> at<00:03:29.820> doing<00:03:30.270> an

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
good and the better you are at doing an

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.360 
good and the better you are at doing an
interlaced<00:03:30.750> shuffle<00:03:31.260> like<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.680> then<00:03:32.100> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
interlaced shuffle like that then the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.240 
interlaced shuffle like that then the
better<00:03:32.610> your<00:03:32.940> giant<00:03:33.570> fan<00:03:33.780> will<00:03:33.959> be<00:03:34.080> so<00:03:35.040> we've

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
better your giant fan will be so we've

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.850 
better your giant fan will be so we've
got<00:03:35.430> our<00:03:35.580> cards<00:03:35.880> together<00:03:36.239> here<00:03:36.510> we<00:03:37.440> are<00:03:37.560> going

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
got our cards together here we are going

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.960 
got our cards together here we are going
to<00:03:38.239> put<00:03:39.239> them<00:03:39.330> in<00:03:39.420> fan<00:03:39.600> position<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.200> fan<00:03:41.010> and

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
to put them in fan position and fan and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.910 
to put them in fan position and fan and
right<00:03:42.390> away<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.630> can<00:03:42.900> see<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.380> know<00:03:43.500> here

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
right away you can see you know here

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.540 
right away you can see you know here
I've<00:03:44.100> got<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.370> gap<00:03:45.440> here<00:03:46.440> I've<00:03:46.650> got<00:03:46.860> three<00:03:46.890> cards

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
I've got a gap here I've got three cards

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.000 
I've got a gap here I've got three cards
together<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.660> it's<00:03:48.780> not<00:03:48.930> perfect<00:03:49.410> but<00:03:49.860> it's

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
together so it's not perfect but it's

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.880 
together so it's not perfect but it's
pretty<00:03:50.070> good<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.870> that's<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.230> intermediate

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
pretty good and that's the intermediate

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.870 
pretty good and that's the intermediate
way<00:03:54.620> okay<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.860> advanced<00:03:56.310> way<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.760> do

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
way okay so the advanced way is to do

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.690 
way okay so the advanced way is to do
what's<00:03:57.090> called<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.510> Faro<00:03:57.840> shuffle<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.430> Faro

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
what's called a Faro shuffle and a Faro

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.960 
what's called a Faro shuffle and a Faro
shuffle<00:03:59.790> is<00:04:00.330> when<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.200> take<00:04:01.410> two<00:04:02.040> absolutely

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
shuffle is when you take two absolutely

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.110 
shuffle is when you take two absolutely
equal<00:04:04.070> packets<00:04:05.160> all<00:04:05.370> right<00:04:05.550> so<00:04:05.790> 26<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.900> 26<00:04:07.470> and

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
equal packets all right so 26 and 26 and

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.470 
equal packets all right so 26 and 26 and

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
you take one in each hand you line them

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.000 
you take one in each hand you line them
up<00:04:13.370> completely<00:04:14.370> even<00:04:15.030> with<00:04:15.180> each<00:04:15.330> other<00:04:16.010> you

up completely even with each other you
apply<00:04:17.310> pressure<00:04:17.580> so<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.060> they<00:04:18.180> bridge

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
apply pressure so that they bridge

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.640 
apply pressure so that they bridge
either<00:04:18.690> upwards<00:04:19.230> or<00:04:19.470> downwards<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:21.650> the

cards will push into each other all
donating<00:04:27.460> left<00:04:28.460> right<00:04:28.730> left<00:04:28.970> right<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:30.740> it's

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
donating left right left right and it's

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.640 
donating left right left right and it's
a<00:04:31.760> very<00:04:32.000> difficult<00:04:32.240> thing<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.750> do<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.350> it

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
a very difficult thing to do and it

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.670 
a very difficult thing to do and it
doesn't<00:04:33.860> work<00:04:34.130> all<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.340> time<00:04:34.510> and<00:04:35.510> if<00:04:36.230> you<00:04:36.410> jam

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
doesn't work all the time and if you jam

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.960 
doesn't work all the time and if you jam
them<00:04:36.890> too<00:04:37.040> hard<00:04:37.250> you're<00:04:37.430> actually<00:04:37.670> going<00:04:37.820> to

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
them too hard you're actually going to

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.200 
them too hard you're actually going to
bend<00:04:38.210> up<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.540> edges<00:04:38.870> of<00:04:38.990> your<00:04:39.020> cards<00:04:39.880> but<00:04:40.880> if

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
bend up the edges of your cards but if

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.970 
bend up the edges of your cards but if
you<00:04:41.360> do<00:04:41.480> it<00:04:41.600> correctly<00:04:41.720> you'll<00:04:42.470> get<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.710> perfect

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
you do it correctly you'll get a perfect

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.420 
you do it correctly you'll get a perfect

orientation<00:04:46.430> like<00:04:46.550> that<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.030> then<00:04:47.480> from

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
orientation like that and then from

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.090 
orientation like that and then from
there<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.260> can<00:04:48.290> push<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:48.830> your<00:04:48.890> inch

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
there you can push to your inch

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.570 
there you can push to your inch
inch-and-a-half<00:04:50.560> take<00:04:51.560> them<00:04:51.770> into<00:04:52.070> fan

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
inch-and-a-half take them into fan

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.510 
inch-and-a-half take them into fan
position<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:54.490> make<00:04:55.490> your<00:04:55.640> giant<00:04:55.970> fin<00:04:57.460> now<00:04:58.460> you

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
position and make your giant fin now you

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.280 
position and make your giant fin now you
won't<00:04:58.730> get<00:04:58.850> that<00:04:59.000> every<00:04:59.240> time<00:04:59.480> but<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.140> more

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
won't get that every time but the more

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.230 
won't get that every time but the more
you<00:05:00.410> practice<00:05:00.440> your<00:05:00.950> Faro<00:05:01.160> shuffle<00:05:01.240> the

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
you practice your Faro shuffle the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.240 
you practice your Faro shuffle the
easier<00:05:02.600> it'll<00:05:02.780> be<00:05:02.840> just<00:05:03.800> make<00:05:04.010> sure<00:05:04.130> you're

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
easier it'll be just make sure you're

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.220 
easier it'll be just make sure you're
using<00:05:04.280> new<00:05:04.670> cards<00:05:05.180> that<00:05:05.450> are<00:05:05.600> have<00:05:05.930> a<00:05:05.960> lot<00:05:06.200> of

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
using new cards that are have a lot of

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.760 
using new cards that are have a lot of
spring<00:05:06.620> in<00:05:06.740> them<00:05:06.890> and<00:05:07.130> have<00:05:07.370> very<00:05:07.520> crisp<00:05:07.880> edges

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
spring in them and have very crisp edges

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.950 
spring in them and have very crisp edges
okay<00:05:09.770> so<00:05:09.830> that's<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.310> advanced<00:05:10.850> way<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:11.810> do

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
okay so that's the advanced way to do

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.610 
okay so that's the advanced way to do
the<00:05:12.520> Faro<00:05:13.520> shuffle
