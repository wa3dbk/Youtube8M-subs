I<00:00:04.170> had<00:00:05.170> no<00:00:05.380> idea<00:00:05.830> things<00:00:06.220> had<00:00:06.490> gotten<00:00:06.700> so

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:06.820 
I had no idea things had gotten so

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.980 
I had no idea things had gotten so
serious<00:00:09.060> who<00:00:10.060> could<00:00:10.269> have<00:00:10.330> imagined<00:00:10.900> that

so<00:00:16.840> the<00:00:17.019> missing<00:00:17.380> procedure<00:00:17.830> and<00:00:18.100> the<00:00:18.190> Grigori

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
so the missing procedure and the Grigori

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.540 
so the missing procedure and the Grigori
are<00:00:18.850> the<00:00:18.940> root<00:00:19.150> of<00:00:19.270> all<00:00:19.390> this<00:00:19.449> evil<00:00:19.930> good<00:00:20.860> that
