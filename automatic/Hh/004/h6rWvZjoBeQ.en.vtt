00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.069
 our record now and tonight it 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.379
 is devoted an object or rather a 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.599
 small machine that should upset 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.849
 our lives imagine if you could 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.049
 make your own items forks 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.150
 glasses knives 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.500
 well that's what the printer does 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.210
 in three dimensions the first 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 devices arrive in stores 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.779
 here is what it looks like 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.269
 case you see it this one is 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.840
 craft is a revolution that is 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.430
 working 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.740
 some even say that the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.939
 upheaval will be more important than 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.130
 the internet 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.420
 christophe de vallans arms with Marie 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.610
 cazals imagine your cups decorate with 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.800
 your profile or that of your children your 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.340
 vases candle holders design all this 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.210
 made by yourself at home 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.160
 imagine this house 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.020
 built with a mouse click after 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.680
 your own IT plans 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.940
 imagine again a spare heart 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.370
 made from scratch by a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.010
 machine the reality in is maybe 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.670
 not very far 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.989
 and here's the tool that put reality 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.180
 on a corner of a desk a printer 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.840
 three dimensions she can manufacture 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.369
 alone any object exercise 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.270
 practice at this passionate 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.890
 IT 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.539
 these examples that I bought is 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.299
 unfortunately did not go very solid in 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.190
 anyway it's broken and to be able to 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.090
 fix I decided to recreate 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.460
 directly a crank 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.229
 in a few clicks he draws his piece or 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.840
 recover posted on the internet 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.090
 the printer makes their comfortable peak 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.039
 ultra-precise deposit of the material of the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.159
 plastic often but also metal or 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.909
 layer-by-layer ceramic 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.220
 the object takes shape 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.409
 the piece is printed simply 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.929
 this use is democratized 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.340
 enormously by the fact that the machines 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.409
 are becoming more robust the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.549
 software more and more integrated and 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.560
 then also the cost of the machines 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.899
 lower a model like this one is 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.350
 now accessible for around 1500 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.000
 euros 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.670
 few individuals are equipped with 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.149
 companies have felt the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.629
 good deal so here now I'm going 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.759
 search and search for the pieces we 

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:08.129
 printed in this company 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.349
 French 3d printing is done at base 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.489
 laser sculpted plastic powder 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.250
 layer by layer 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.069
 here we make custom objects 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.720
 like these telephone shells decorated to 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.800
 his way by the customer on the internet 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.349
 it's probably a technology 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.640
 that allows the most things that allows 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.840
 the most varied complex forms of 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.209
 things that they could not be 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.010
 manufactured in other technologies 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.450
 this new technology announces so 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.239
 a profound change 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.129
 in France for example no one 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.409
 produced his phone shells 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.840
 for a long time we imports 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.970
 basically from india where asia from 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.690
 southeast is 3d printing yes is a way 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.060
 of 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.650
 remanufacturing objects in France and 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.030
 3d printing technologies oms is this 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.710
 particular that we can manufacture 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.970
 unique objects that is to say that it 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.950
 does not cost more to manufacture 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.470
 different objects than to make 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.060
 really all identical objects and so 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.430
 no longer need to mass manufacture 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.050
 abroad in China for example according to 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.210
 some economists many 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.650
 productions could be relocated 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.980
 and that's the whole economic system 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.660
 global that would be upset locally 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.620
 our habits too could evolve 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.120
 with new types of jobs created 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.940
 you will also have the appearance of a 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.310
 new craft craft craftsmen craftsman 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.920
 craftsmen 2.0 who will offer you 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.440
 at home locally to make a 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.470
 knife to make an object of 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.810
 make a house a house 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.030
 whole print from the plans the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.520
 concept is even already being tested a 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.040
 giant 3d printer would do the job 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.450
 and there is still a lot more amazing 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.250
 in this lab the researchers 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.450
 fill their cartridges with 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.670
 biological cells 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.340
 the printer does his work and create 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.320
 living tissue the making of 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.959
 pots would have already progressed well 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.410
 so why not see one day a heart 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.280
 or a strand printed in three dimensions to 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.280
 the organic inked
