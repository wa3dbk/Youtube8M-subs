00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hi guys its lethal 22 before and here is

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.559 
hi guys its lethal 22 before and here is
some<00:00:04.350> knife<00:00:04.799> only<00:00:05.100> game<00:00:05.460> clown<00:00:05.759> ascension<00:00:06.359> and

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
some knife only game clown ascension and

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.530 
some knife only game clown ascension and
this<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.770> believe<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.490> highest<00:00:08.940> recorded

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
this is I believe the highest recorded

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.730 
this is I believe the highest recorded
so<00:00:09.840> low<00:00:10.309> score<00:00:11.309> or<00:00:11.670> not<00:00:12.059> school<00:00:12.300> level<00:00:12.740> that

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
so low score or not school level that

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.730 
so low score or not school level that
I've<00:00:13.889> seen<00:00:14.599> and<00:00:15.599> I've<00:00:15.780> looked<00:00:16.139> around<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
I've seen and I've looked around for a

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.560 
I've seen and I've looked around for a
bit<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.279> seems<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.699> be<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.820> highest<00:00:18.270> i

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
bit and this seems to be the highest i

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.980 
bit and this seems to be the highest i
get<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.140> level<00:00:19.320> 18<00:00:19.949> solo<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.820> by<00:00:21.689> only<00:00:21.960> using

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
get to level 18 solo and by only using

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.790 
get to level 18 solo and by only using
my<00:00:22.470> knife<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.189> mean<00:00:23.850> purely<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.289> knife<00:00:25.470> in

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
my knife I mean purely just the knife in

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.589 
my knife I mean purely just the knife in
the<00:00:25.949> sickle<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:27.210> means<00:00:27.420> no<00:00:27.750> traps<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:29.599> auto

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the sickle that means no traps and auto

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.580 
the sickle that means no traps and auto
snow<00:00:30.990> guns<00:00:31.230> obviously<00:00:31.890> no<00:00:32.279> grenades<00:00:33.260> just<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
snow guns obviously no grenades just the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.119 
snow guns obviously no grenades just the
knife<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> sickle<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.770> this<00:00:37.770> this

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
knife and the sickle and this this

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.040 
knife and the sickle and this this
turbine<00:00:38.700> thing<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.600> doesn't<00:00:39.780> really

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
turbine thing here it doesn't really

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.299 
turbine thing here it doesn't really
matter<00:00:40.230> about<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.100> don't

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
matter about that because you don't

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.660 
matter about that because you don't
control<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:42.200> but<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.739> doesn't<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.280> help

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
control that but it doesn't really help

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.360 
control that but it doesn't really help
if<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.870> let<00:00:46.350> them<00:00:46.530> get<00:00:46.739> killed<00:00:47.100> by<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
if you just let them get killed by the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.770 
if you just let them get killed by the
turbine<00:00:47.789> because<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.210> got<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.539> enough

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
turbine because you got to get enough

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.889 
turbine because you got to get enough
points<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.430> get<00:00:50.430> juggernog<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.539> sickle

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
points to get juggernog and the sickle

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.299 
points to get juggernog and the sickle
and<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.910> was<00:00:54.379> extremely<00:00:55.379> difficult<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:56.100> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and this was extremely difficult like it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.979 
and this was extremely difficult like it
was<00:00:56.399> probably<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> hardest<00:00:57.270> thing<00:00:57.449> I've<00:00:57.780> ever

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
was probably the hardest thing I've ever

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.250 
was probably the hardest thing I've ever
tried<00:00:58.699> on<00:00:59.699> Ascension<00:01:00.239> or<00:01:00.390> out<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.660> any<00:01:00.809> zombies

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
tried on Ascension or out of any zombies

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.009 
tried on Ascension or out of any zombies
that<00:01:01.500> actually<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> lot<00:01:03.329> harder<00:01:03.539> monkey

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
that actually it's a lot harder monkey

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.870 
that actually it's a lot harder monkey
no<00:01:04.199> because<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:07.110> Juggernog<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
no because to get to Juggernog or the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.280 
no because to get to Juggernog or the
sickle<00:01:09.270> whichever<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> want<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.170> buy

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
sickle whichever one you want to buy

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.740 
sickle whichever one you want to buy
first<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> cost<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
first it's going to cost you like it

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.550 
first it's going to cost you like it
rounds<00:01:13.590> 7,000<00:01:14.430> points<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> you've<00:01:16.140> got<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.439> get

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
rounds 7,000 points so you've got to get

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.010 
rounds 7,000 points so you've got to get
seven<00:01:17.070> thousand<00:01:17.549> points<00:01:17.869> before<00:01:19.430> like<00:01:20.840> we<00:01:21.840> got

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
seven thousand points before like we got

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.600 
seven thousand points before like we got
to<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> seven<00:01:22.619> thousand<00:01:23.040> points<00:01:23.250> before

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
to get the seven thousand points before

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.539 
to get the seven thousand points before
you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.240> juggernog<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:25.380> that's<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you can get juggernog so that's that's a

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.620 
you can get juggernog so that's that's a
lot<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.790> levels<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:29.130> anyway<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:30.509> I've

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
lot of levels but anyway so what I've

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.780 
lot of levels but anyway so what I've
done<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.439> was<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> 43<00:01:32.280> minute<00:01:32.549> gameplay

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
done to this it was a 43 minute gameplay

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.149 
done to this it was a 43 minute gameplay
and<00:01:33.270> I've<00:01:33.329> condensed<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.110> into<00:01:34.229> seven<00:01:34.890> minutes

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
and I've condensed it into seven minutes

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.399 
and I've condensed it into seven minutes
i<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.520> upload<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.720> now<00:01:36.869> people<00:01:37.110> are<00:01:37.259> going

quadruple speed or something because i

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.060 
quadruple speed or something because i
don't<00:01:51.180> want<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.390> make<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> big<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.920> this

imparts<00:01:53.460> i<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:53.970> want<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.720> video<00:01:55.549> but

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
imparts i just want it in one video but

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.440 
imparts i just want it in one video but
you<00:01:57.750> people<00:01:58.469> may<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:58.979> believe<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.280> but<00:01:59.490> then

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
you people may not believe this but then

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.080 
you people may not believe this but then
i'll<00:02:00.630> post<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.049> video<00:02:01.460> but<00:02:02.460> i'm<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.579> saying

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
i'll post the video but i'm just saying

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.430 
i'll post the video but i'm just saying
this<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:04.079> legit

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.969 

so<00:02:07.980> basically<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.900> to<00:02:10.140> stay<00:02:10.770> as

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
so basically you just have to stay as

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.010 
so basically you just have to stay as
long<00:02:11.100> as<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.880> in<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.150> room<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.690> you

annoying<00:02:23.510> if<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> did<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.320> couple<00:02:25.680> of

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
annoying if so I did like a couple of

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.500 
annoying if so I did like a couple of
temps<00:02:26.010> at<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.430> was<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.940> temp<00:02:27.240> 5

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
temps at this I was on like a temp 5

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.780 
temps at this I was on like a temp 5
this<00:02:27.900> time<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.410> I'd<00:02:28.680> finally<00:02:29.040> had<00:02:29.310> enough<00:02:29.430> so

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
this time and I'd finally had enough so

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.900 
this time and I'd finally had enough so
I<00:02:29.820> had<00:02:30.260> 7300<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.710> I<00:02:32.340> go<00:02:32.520> around<00:02:32.610> this<00:02:32.850> way

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
I had 7300 and I go around this way

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.910 
I had 7300 and I go around this way
because<00:02:33.270> it's<00:02:33.600> cheaper<00:02:34.230> well<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.530> think<00:02:34.590> it's

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
because it's cheaper well I think it's

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.530 
because it's cheaper well I think it's
cheaper<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.550> don't<00:02:36.180> really<00:02:36.300> know<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:39.330> is

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
cheaper I don't really know and this is

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.270 
cheaper I don't really know and this is
the<00:02:39.720> difficult<00:02:40.170> bit<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.440> think<00:02:40.710> it's<00:02:40.830> harder<00:02:41.190> at

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
the difficult bit I think it's harder at

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.670 
the difficult bit I think it's harder at
the<00:02:41.370> start<00:02:41.730> because<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:43.380> don't<00:02:43.590> have

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
the start because you don't have

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.790 
the start because you don't have
Juggernog<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.570> they<00:02:45.570> take<00:02:46.530> like<00:02:46.740> four<00:02:47.100> knives

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
Juggernog and they take like four knives

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.340 
Juggernog and they take like four knives
so<00:02:49.800> it's<00:02:49.950> definitely<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:51.120> lot<00:02:51.540> harder<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:52.050> start

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
so it's definitely a lot harder to start

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.230 
so it's definitely a lot harder to start
until<00:02:52.560> eight<00:02:52.950> sickle<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.940> recommend

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
until eight sickle and I recommend

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.300 
until eight sickle and I recommend
buying<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.750> sickle<00:02:55.080> first<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.740> then<00:02:56.070> buying

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
buying the sickle first and then buying

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.810 
buying the sickle first and then buying
juggernog<00:02:56.820> because<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:58.740> sickle<00:02:59.190> is<00:02:59.340> going<00:02:59.730> to

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
juggernog because the sickle is going to

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.420 
juggernog because the sickle is going to
be<00:02:59.910> lunch<00:03:00.120> one<00:03:00.420> knife<00:03:00.840> kill<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.350> then<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.250> can

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
be lunch one knife kill and then you can

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.610 
be lunch one knife kill and then you can
kill<00:03:02.940> them<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.150> lot<00:03:03.360> quicker<00:03:03.570> which<00:03:04.020> means<00:03:04.320> a

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
kill them a lot quicker which means a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.010 
kill them a lot quicker which means a
lot<00:03:04.920> more<00:03:05.760> chance<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.240> be<00:03:06.360> surviving

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
lot more chance to be surviving

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.660 
lot more chance to be surviving
surviving<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:07.950> then<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.130> can<00:03:08.280> save<00:03:08.490> up<00:03:08.520> to

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
surviving and then you can save up to

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.030 
surviving and then you can save up to
buy<00:03:08.910> Juggernog<00:03:11.600> yeah<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.170> extremely

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
buy Juggernog yeah so this is extremely

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.920 
buy Juggernog yeah so this is extremely
difficult<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.060> guys<00:03:15.209> want<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.690> try<00:03:15.840> it

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
difficult and if you guys want to try it

perks<00:03:35.850> but<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.269> can't<00:03:36.480> use<00:03:36.660> Peter<00:03:37.070> gh<00:03:38.070> flopper

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
perks but you can't use Peter gh flopper

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.110 
perks but you can't use Peter gh flopper
PhD<00:03:39.450> flopper<00:03:40.160> it's<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.310> only<00:03:41.730> way<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:41.910> can

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
PhD flopper it's the only way you can

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.000 
PhD flopper it's the only way you can
kill<00:03:42.360> zombies<00:03:42.810> is<00:03:43.110> with<00:03:43.500> your<00:03:43.709> knife

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.970 

so<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.490> main<00:03:49.730> thing<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:50.060> patience<00:03:50.780> by<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.680> end

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
so the main thing is patience by the end

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.610 
so the main thing is patience by the end
when<00:03:52.460> I<00:03:52.490> was<00:03:52.700> at<00:03:52.850> like<00:03:52.970> level<00:03:53.330> 17<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.470> you'll

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
when I was at like level 17 and you'll

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.400 
when I was at like level 17 and you'll
see<00:03:54.830> by<00:03:55.040> 18<00:03:55.610> how<00:03:55.790> I'd<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.200> kind<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.260> lost

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
see by 18 how I'd I kind of lost

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.160 
see by 18 how I'd I kind of lost
interest<00:03:57.710> in<00:03:58.070> a<00:03:58.340> bit<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:59.720> does<00:03:59.900> get<00:04:00.110> pretty

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
interest in a bit it does get pretty

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.660 
interest in a bit it does get pretty
boring<00:04:01.930> so<00:04:02.930> it's<00:04:03.080> more<00:04:03.290> down<00:04:03.560> if<00:04:03.920> it<00:04:04.250> isn't<00:04:04.520> if

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
boring so it's more down if it isn't if

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.060 
boring so it's more down if it isn't if
you<00:04:04.910> can<00:04:05.120> get<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:06.410> sickle<00:04:06.800> then<00:04:06.950> the

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
you can get the sickle then the

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.990 
you can get the sickle then the
Juggernog<00:04:07.580> it's<00:04:07.820> more<00:04:08.120> down<00:04:08.330> to<00:04:08.570> patients<00:04:09.170> and

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
Juggernog it's more down to patients and

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.700 
Juggernog it's more down to patients and
all<00:04:11.000> skills<00:04:11.690> involved<00:04:11.990> too<00:04:12.260> but<00:04:12.290> it's<00:04:12.530> more

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
all skills involved too but it's more

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.130 
all skills involved too but it's more
down<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.100> patients<00:04:13.610> because<00:04:14.390> it<00:04:14.750> takes<00:04:14.930> you

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
down to patients because it takes you
