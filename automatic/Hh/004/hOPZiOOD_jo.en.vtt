crank up the amount all the way then in

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.539 
crank up the amount all the way then in
the<00:01:03.780> filters<00:01:04.110> inspector<00:01:04.619> increase<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the filters inspector increase the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.370 
the filters inspector increase the
expansion<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> Rays<00:01:06.750> don't<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.110> cut<00:01:07.260> off

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
expansion so the Rays don't get cut off

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
expansion so the Rays don't get cut off
also<00:01:08.159> increase<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> globe<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.119> 2<00:01:09.680> if<00:01:10.850> I<00:01:11.850> skim

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
also increase the globe to 2 if I skim

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.719 
also increase the globe to 2 if I skim
the<00:01:12.240> project<00:01:12.689> there<00:01:13.229> are<00:01:13.260> too<00:01:13.470> many<00:01:13.590> rays<00:01:13.860> so

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the project there are too many rays so

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
the project there are too many rays so
I'll<00:01:14.850> select<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.210> clouds<00:01:15.509> layer<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
I'll select the clouds layer and in the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.530 
I'll select the clouds layer and in the
generator<00:01:17.040> inspector<00:01:17.549> I'll<00:01:17.729> turn<00:01:18.240> off<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
generator inspector I'll turn off the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
generator inspector I'll turn off the
first<00:01:18.810> two<00:01:18.990> layers<00:01:19.170> set<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> third<00:01:20.400> layer<00:01:20.640> to
