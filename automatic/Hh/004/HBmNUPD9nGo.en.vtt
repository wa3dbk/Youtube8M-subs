00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
and of course I guess it's the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.550 
and of course I guess it's the
description<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.900> found<00:02:14.110> out<00:02:14.200> about<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.409> and

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
description I found out about it and

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.990 
description I found out about it and
then<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.739> saw<00:02:14.950> Jay<00:02:15.250> where<00:02:15.430> uploaded<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.849> video

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
then I saw Jay where uploaded a video

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.339 
then I saw Jay where uploaded a video
talking<00:02:16.239> about<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.569> concept<00:02:16.900> art<00:02:17.049> and<00:02:17.170> stuff

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
talking about the concept art and stuff

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.960 
talking about the concept art and stuff
so<00:02:17.590> feel<00:02:18.069> like<00:02:18.219> a<00:02:18.250> thief<00:02:18.549> I<00:02:18.760> don't
