the<00:00:12.849> sword<00:00:13.090> builder<00:00:13.450> collection<00:00:14.019> basically

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
the sword builder collection basically

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.040 
the sword builder collection basically
it's<00:00:14.920> like<00:00:15.070> a<00:00:15.129> connected<00:00:15.910> combined<00:00:16.360> system

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
it's like a connected combined system

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.810 
it's like a connected combined system
you<00:00:17.529> think<00:00:17.770> of<00:00:17.830> it<00:00:17.920> like<00:00:18.039> Legos<00:00:18.400> my<00:00:18.640> rather

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
you think of it like Legos my rather

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.640 
you think of it like Legos my rather
than<00:00:19.029> blocks<00:00:19.330> for<00:00:19.599> building<00:00:19.630> action<00:00:20.260> figures

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
than blocks for building action figures

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.909 
than blocks for building action figures
okay<00:00:20.980> it<00:00:21.759> comes<00:00:21.910> down<00:00:22.119> into<00:00:22.330> three<00:00:22.599> categories

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:22.919 
okay it comes down into three categories

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.429 
okay it comes down into three categories
you<00:00:23.919> have<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.490> Megazords<00:00:25.360> you<00:00:25.869> have<00:00:26.020> Zords

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
you have the Megazords you have Zords

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.979 
you have the Megazords you have Zords
cycles<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.430> over<00:00:27.849> here<00:00:28.150> and<00:00:28.329> absorbed

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
cycles and over here and absorbed

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.589 
cycles and over here and absorbed
vehicles<00:00:29.470> now<00:00:30.160> any<00:00:30.430> of<00:00:30.669> these<00:00:30.820> items<00:00:31.149> can<00:00:31.450> be

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
vehicles now any of these items can be

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.660 
vehicles now any of these items can be
connected<00:00:32.079> and<00:00:32.410> combined<00:00:32.829> to<00:00:33.070> create<00:00:33.340> an

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
connected and combined to create an

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.530 
connected and combined to create an
infinite<00:00:34.390> number<00:00:34.420> of<00:00:34.690> combinations<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:37.300> far

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
infinite number of combinations as far

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.430
