shed less and grow longer and I have
noticed<00:00:36.480> especially<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> past<00:00:38.489> six

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
noticed especially in the past six

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.799 
noticed especially in the past six
months<00:00:39.450> or<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.320> my<00:00:40.710> hair<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.570> starting<00:00:42.570> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
months or so that my hair is starting to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.410 
months or so that my hair is starting to
fill<00:00:43.200> out<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.710> mean<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.190> don't<00:00:44.760> think<00:00:45.090> I'm<00:00:45.149> ever

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
fill out I mean I don't think I'm ever

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.830 
fill out I mean I don't think I'm ever
going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.940> waist-length<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
going to be waist-length and I have to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.189 
going to be waist-length and I have to
just<00:00:49.110> sort<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.440> reconcile<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
just sort of reconcile with the the the

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.279 
just sort of reconcile with the the the
truism<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:57.120> know<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.930> all<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
truism that you know we do we all have a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.910 
truism that you know we do we all have a
terminal<00:00:58.859> length<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.629> as<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.870> observe<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.649> my

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
terminal length and as I observe like my

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.320 
terminal length and as I observe like my
other<00:01:02.390> children<00:01:03.390> especially<00:01:03.780> my<00:01:04.110> mixed-raced

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
other children especially my mixed-raced

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
other children especially my mixed-raced
children<00:01:06.330> they<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> terminal<00:01:07.740> length<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
children they have a terminal length and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.390 
children they have a terminal length and
it's<00:01:09.119> probably<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:09.750> mid-back<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.130> that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's probably about mid-back and so that

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.310 
it's probably about mid-back and so that
gives<00:01:11.549> me<00:01:11.670> some<00:01:11.970> indication<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:15.320> I'm

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
gives me some indication that I'm

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.179 
gives me some indication that I'm
probably<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:17.220> little<00:01:17.970> bit<00:01:18.299> shorter<00:01:18.900> than<00:01:19.189> then

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
probably a little bit shorter than then

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.800 
probably a little bit shorter than then
that<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.549> terms<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.939> turtling<00:01:21.390> they'll<00:01:21.630> never

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
that in terms of turtling they'll never

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.310 
that in terms of turtling they'll never
be<00:01:22.049> waist<00:01:22.259> length<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.490> know<00:01:23.610> whatever<00:01:24.320> I've

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.420 
find that Hairfinity does for me is it
reduces<00:02:42.629> shedding<00:02:43.049> so<00:02:44.090> that's<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.239> big<00:02:45.599> part<00:02:46.049> of

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
reduces shedding so that's a big part of

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.800 
reduces shedding so that's a big part of
you<00:02:47.430> know<00:02:47.519> keeping<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.150> length<00:02:48.389> of<00:02:48.659> your<00:02:48.750> hair

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
you know keeping the length of your hair

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.589 
you know keeping the length of your hair
and<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.319> thickness<00:02:49.889> of<00:02:50.099> your<00:02:50.159> hair<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.790> that

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
and the thickness of your hair is that

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.129 
and the thickness of your hair is that
it<00:02:51.900> does<00:02:52.170> reduce<00:02:52.590> shedding<00:02:52.829> so<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.220> have<00:02:53.489> seen

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
it does reduce shedding so I have seen

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.819 
it does reduce shedding so I have seen
definitely<00:02:55.139> a<00:02:55.170> marked<00:02:55.680> reduction<00:02:56.129> in<00:02:56.760> and

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
definitely a marked reduction in and

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.849

I've<00:07:36.970> noticed<00:07:37.180> my<00:07:37.479> hair<00:07:37.720> is<00:07:37.900> more<00:07:38.229> elastic

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:39.069 
I've noticed my hair is more elastic

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:42.480 
I've noticed my hair is more elastic
it's<00:07:39.340> breaking<00:07:40.000> less<00:07:40.360> and<00:07:41.070> when<00:07:42.070> your<00:07:42.190> hair<00:07:42.370> is

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:42.490 
it's breaking less and when your hair is

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.339 
it's breaking less and when your hair is
breaking<00:07:42.789> less<00:07:43.180> that<00:07:43.690> means<00:07:43.810> it's<00:07:44.080> growing

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:44.349 
breaking less that means it's growing

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:46.969 
breaking less that means it's growing
more<00:07:44.500> so<00:07:45.599> those<00:07:46.599> are<00:07:46.780> my<00:07:46.870> recommendations
