00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello now matthias and gabriel of 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.660
 stabilo gabriels signer like 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.630
 I welcome to the stable tutorial like 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.190
 I draw a zombie servus fork 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.769
 how do you do that if you have one 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.179
 zombie time last a lot of experience 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.770
 how I do is I'm actually going 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.900
 times in three steps ahead with one 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.220
 pencil drawing where to say that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.460
 can only once such a kind 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.160
 Construction of the head big with one 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 circle and then his eyes once the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.460
 main stories 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.769
 before I really got into detail 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.420
 a detailed pencil drawing and 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.190
 when I have something like that where 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.140
 All the money I like and what 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.270
 not then I take my fineliner 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 draw the whole thing up nicely 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.379
 then erases if I feel like the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.730
 Pencil drawing away and at the end 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.050
 goes over it with color 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.719
 especially with a zombie I think so much 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.940
 important step because such a zombie yes 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.750
 but a lot of the color the chance 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.399
 that now tackle that video 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.840
 in some ways one of your times 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.300
 art yes exactly 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.879
 So start with a circle and 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.939
 made two lines, the one horizontal 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.159
 So I show where the middle of circle 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.540
 your eyes will be on it , too 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.310
 the other is vertical and the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.229
 vertical shows in which direction the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.580
 Scalp on the horizontal line 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.830
 I place my eyes the same way 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.020
 and get in the horizontal then later 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.840
 also draw the ears after 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.909
 Down comes that pine and there can 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.979
 I go beyond this circle 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.290
 circle really just a little bit like 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.439
 the crowns form for the skull of everything 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.850
 what then goes down 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.189
 I have all the artistic ones 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 Freedoms what you see here is once 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.869
 there and the macro was drawn 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.600
 even the lower lip and left 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.040
 comes as said the ear turn if 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.329
 This earcup is always one 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.220
 little experience always the sign for 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.670
 me it is a mirrored 5 Series 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.820
 I'm just painting it so easy 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.640
 okay so far so that he can 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.950
 still a very ordinary figure 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.899
 what are actually doing in the song now 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.650
 it or zombie has for me 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.540
 somehow very 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.580
 pronounced facial features so and so 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.140
 has a lot of zombies or very special 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.260
 Of course you do not have any more 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.520
 my body is fat content 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.520
 it does not stop very far either 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.130
 the eyes, of course 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.530
 because the first very small pupil 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.150
 because he has no songs can not 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.459
 Protecting yourself from the sun is very clever 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.989
 the value is of course the no 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.880
 muscle markets to move 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.819
 All around these little ones are coming 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.739
 fine veins actually blood too 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.610
 we always soaked that there actually 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.069
 should work and then now as 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.660
 big topic the nose i have 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.610
 Determined here only in the interior too 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.220
 show as well as burn skeleton where you are 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.430
 just the traces are over it 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.019
 actually the nasal cavity sits and 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.860
 maybe a little bit the cartilage 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.200
 omit 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.390
 then here we draw the brain now 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.370
 I just decided 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.030
 to cut a bit of the head 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.980
 as well as at hannibal lecter and sometimes there 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.610
 4 1 and that's really something 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.220
 easy to do you can see so 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.819
 thirsty always produce so great it 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.730
 draw shapes into it then that looks 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.049
 will relatively quickly once out 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.299
 a good tip at all 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.950
 Experienced very many references to 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.790
 Looks like others continue such 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.150
 draw things 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:39.220
 that's where you learn the most or one 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:40.980
 walnut is great here faces a well 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.090
 little blood karl kraus dripping 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.180
 wonderful that is so that the 1 1 but 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.220
 Of course, that's the only way, of course 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.900
 blood in a zombie that still 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.440
 actually that's fresh from his 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.540
 to sacrifice 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.889
 that so its veins are flowing this 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.410
 probably that's the legs now 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:05.590
 drafting the drawing with the 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.810
 fineliner from here it is really only 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.109
 once again a touch up a little bit 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.910
 a nice draw of course fits now 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:17.470
 Let's see what's in the foreground 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.970
 background and there could really be now 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.639
 hours and hours in your picture 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.950
 invest will be ok so now have 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.650
 our pencil sketch was made then 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.910
 we have the whole with ink 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.979
 could draw the pencil sketch 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.420
 we actually erase it now 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.820
 and do it now 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.740
 the zombie in color there even more 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.520
 live under quotes, so to speak 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.350
 Yes, the answer to color is answered 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.720
 First of all, if you are planning things 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.550
 to erase away then a good tip 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.760
 do that before applying the paint 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.020
 after that it will not work anymore 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.850
 I've decided to go with you now 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.740
 a brown top to go over it 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.370
 the inside for the sake of showing so 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.560
 nasal cavity and oral cavity comes later 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.380
 then a red of course for it 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.860
 blood of a single blood drop and 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.720
 on the other hand, a little bit upstairs with me 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.760
 on lighter skin tone I used 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:17.600
 for the brain itself and then in green 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.550
 turquoise green for the skin itself 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.830
 zombie senses always matthias white 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.830
 probably also from the darkest ones 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.710
 either somehow be a green 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.620
 is quite good has blue will become 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.660
 also very good own like to draw something 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.880
 yes a bit are female ever 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.760
 After all, we will definitely do it for you yes 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.950
 the respective one has the stabilo range 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.320
 every case the right color what 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.650
 did you have a drawing for pens 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.430
 So yes, yes, as I said before 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.200
 just pencil fineliner and then 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.010
 felt pen in the case of everything from stabilo 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.300
 the before was the player and the ergo 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.900
 are ergonomically shaped throughout 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.880
 pleasant pencil with a docu me 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.930
 Quite good for children especially fat 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.090
 and blood stable 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.150
 these are the classics the point 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.930
