your answer now when you go to your
power<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.480> turns<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> trunk<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.410> is

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
power and turns in the trunk and this is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.990 
power and turns in the trunk and this is
going<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.800> basically<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.340> same<00:00:23.699> for<00:00:23.970> a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
going to be basically the same for a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.960 
going to be basically the same for a
skosh<00:00:24.300> Metra<00:00:25.039> you<00:00:26.039> name<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.670> here<00:00:26.910> is

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
skosh Metra you name it this one here is

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.339 
skosh Metra you name it this one here is
a<00:00:27.000> pipe<00:00:27.269> ins<00:00:27.510> which<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.050> made<00:00:28.230> by<00:00:29.660> audio<00:00:30.660> pipe<00:00:31.170> I

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
a pipe ins which is made by audio pipe I

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.860 
a pipe ins which is made by audio pipe I
think<00:00:31.650> they<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.610> these<00:00:32.880> three<00:00:33.180> wires<00:00:33.420> some

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
think they have these three wires some

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.090 
think they have these three wires some
of<00:00:33.960> these<00:00:34.050> units<00:00:34.350> are<00:00:34.410> going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
of these units are going to have the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.950 
of these units are going to have the
regulator<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:35.820> relay<00:00:36.149> built<00:00:36.390> right<00:00:36.540> into<00:00:36.719> the

regulator or relay built right into the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.569 
regulator or relay built right into the
actual<00:00:37.200> antenna<00:00:37.620> which<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.010> one<00:00:38.190> here<00:00:38.430> has

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
actual antenna which this one here has

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.119 
actual antenna which this one here has
some<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.480> have<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> little<00:00:39.989> box<00:00:40.260> which<00:00:40.950> is

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
some of them have a little box which is

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.040 
some of them have a little box which is
running<00:00:41.460> separately<00:00:42.059> all<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.480> little<00:00:42.690> boxes

that 12 volts on it and this one has

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.499 
that 12 volts on it and this one has
either<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.740> absence<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.490> power<00:01:23.700> or<00:01:24.000> goes<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
either the absence of power or goes to

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.749 
either the absence of power or goes to
ground<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> antenna<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
ground then the antenna is going to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.260 
ground then the antenna is going to
retract<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.450> watch<00:01:27.630> how<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> works

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
retract so watch how it works

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.789 
retract so watch how it works
red<00:01:30.270> has<00:01:30.509> power<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> say<00:01:31.619> we'll

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
red has power just want to say we'll

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.210 
red has power just want to say we'll
turn<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> key<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:33.060> turn<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> radio<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:34.220> so

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
turn the key on now turn the radio on so

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.640 
turn the key on now turn the radio on so
now<00:01:35.430> both<00:01:36.180> wires<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.750> 12<00:01:37.049> volts<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.500> see

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
now both wires have 12 volts so you see

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.819 
now both wires have 12 volts so you see
the<00:01:37.770> antenna<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:39.320> it's<00:01:40.320> fully<00:01:40.560> extended

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the antenna is going it's fully extended

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.590 
the antenna is going it's fully extended
so<00:01:41.280> what's<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.670> happen<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.479> can

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
so what's going to happen is you can

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.899 
so what's going to happen is you can
have<00:01:42.750> your<00:01:42.899> car<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.770> turn<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> radio<00:01:44.880> off

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
have your car on and turn the radio off

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.499 
have your car on and turn the radio off
which<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.049> make<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.409> happen<00:01:47.509> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
which will and make this happen the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.650 
which will and make this happen the
antenna<00:01:48.840> will<00:01:48.990> go<00:01:49.079> off<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:51.530> retract

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.840 

and<00:01:55.660> that's<00:01:56.620> really<00:01:56.830> all<00:01:57.070> there<00:01:57.160> is<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.640> so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
and that's really all there is to it so

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.180 
and that's really all there is to it so
just<00:01:58.000> keep<00:01:58.300> in<00:01:59.200> mind<00:01:59.230> that<00:01:59.500> red<00:01:59.800> is<00:02:00.010> your

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
just keep in mind that red is your

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.710 
just keep in mind that red is your
constant<00:02:00.580> power<00:02:00.730> source<00:02:01.000> when<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.240> key<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.540> on

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
constant power source when the key is on

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.050 
constant power source when the key is on
blue<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.560> going<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.800> be<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.040> trigger<00:02:03.280> 12<00:02:03.850> volt

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
blue is going to be the trigger 12 volt

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.330 
blue is going to be the trigger 12 volt
wire<00:02:04.270> black<00:02:05.080> is<00:02:05.230> constant<00:02:05.710> ground<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.130> that's

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
wire black is constant ground and that's

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.370 
wire black is constant ground and that's
really<00:02:06.520> lowers<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.240> some<00:02:07.630> antennas<00:02:08.259> I

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
really lowers to it some antennas I

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.050 
really lowers to it some antennas I
can't<00:02:08.649> speak<00:02:08.860> for<00:02:09.040> everyone<00:02:09.250> but<00:02:09.580> some<00:02:09.970> of

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
can't speak for everyone but some of

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.790 
can't speak for everyone but some of
them<00:02:10.179> might<00:02:10.360> actually<00:02:10.390> get<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.990> ground<00:02:11.230> from

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
them might actually get the ground from

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.740 
them might actually get the ground from
the<00:02:11.920> base<00:02:12.130> on<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:13.030> fender

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
the base on the fender

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.330 
the base on the fender
I've<00:02:13.960> never<00:02:14.290> liked<00:02:14.530> those<00:02:14.620> kinds<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:14.950> antennas

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
I've never liked those kinds of antennas

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.740 
I've never liked those kinds of antennas
but<00:02:15.490> there<00:02:15.670> are<00:02:15.730> also<00:02:15.820> metals<00:02:16.210> all<00:02:16.390> these<00:02:16.600> are

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
but there are also metals all these are

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.630 
but there are also metals all these are
still<00:02:16.930> running<00:02:17.170> around<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.710> make<00:02:18.250> sure<00:02:18.280> that

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
still running around so make sure that

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.970 
still running around so make sure that
your<00:02:18.850> base<00:02:19.210> has<00:02:19.570> ground<00:02:19.930> if<00:02:20.110> you're<00:02:20.230> doing<00:02:20.800> the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
your base has ground if you're doing the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.320 
your base has ground if you're doing the
wiring<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.340> as<00:02:21.610> I'm<00:02:21.730> explaining<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.240> you're

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
wiring just as I'm explaining and you're

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.240 
wiring just as I'm explaining and you're
still<00:02:22.480> having<00:02:22.750> some<00:02:22.870> trouble<00:02:23.230> take<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.920> look<00:02:24.130> at

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
still having some trouble take a look at

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.130 
still having some trouble take a look at
that<00:02:24.370> but<00:02:24.820> that's<00:02:25.270> basically<00:02:25.600> how<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.840> wire

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
that but that's basically how you wire

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.550 
that but that's basically how you wire
up<00:02:26.320> this<00:02:26.470> or<00:02:26.650> any<00:02:26.950> power<00:02:27.220> antenna
