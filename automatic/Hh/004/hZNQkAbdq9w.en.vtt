00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
cup of vinegar now it's the vinegar

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.390 
cup of vinegar now it's the vinegar
that's<00:04:10.819> going<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.389> help<00:04:11.750> leach<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.950> minerals

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
that's going to help leach the minerals

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.050 
that's going to help leach the minerals
like<00:04:13.909> calcium<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.889> phosphorus<00:04:15.889> out<00:04:16.459> of<00:04:16.910> the

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
like calcium and phosphorus out of the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.089 
like calcium and phosphorus out of the

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
using that are the largest so that's why

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.110
