00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.360
 good guys continuing with our 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.389
 Use guide and tricks for the samsung 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.250
 galaxy s 5 today we want to show you a 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.099
 of the options that we liked the most 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.590
 of the new top range of the company the 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.600
 Private mode even though we can 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.119
 protect access to the terminal with 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.189
 passwords patterns or even with the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.080
 fingerprint there are times when 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.390
 we leave the phone to someone 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.250
 Any reason at that time 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.890
 we open the doors to all the content 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.379
 that we have stored as photos 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.750
 private videos or personal files 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.719
 that should not be seen by anyone 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.059
 samsung has thought about this aspect and we 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.850
 offers a very interesting option to the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.680
 that private mode has called this mode not 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.360
 it's nothing more than a kind of box 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.239
 strong where we can save 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.520
 contents of this type and hide those of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.430
 anyone unless you know 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.680
 expressly allow us to activate the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.140
 private mode we go to the settings panel or 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.320
 we unfold the panel of widgets 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.420
 galaxy s5 move the switch and 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.680
 we choose the type of security control 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.560
 that we want to establish 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.290
 and the fingerprint recognition now yes 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.370
 let's go to the photo gallery for example 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.070
 we select one or several images 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.290
 click on the menu and act icon 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.110
 followed about moving private this one 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.510
 will hide those photos from people who do not 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.090
 have the proper access if we deactivate 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.700
 the private mode we will see that the images 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.220
 they are no longer visible in the gallery 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.830
 that's because they will only appear again 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.260
 when we re-identify ourselves in the 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.240
 Private mode we will also know which 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.070
 they have the attribute of hidden because 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.649
 a kind of door will appear 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.460
 half-open on the miniature of these 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.460
 offered
