put<00:02:58.919> on<00:02:58.950> auction<00:02:59.459> accidentally<00:03:00.150> because<00:03:00.419> they

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
put on auction accidentally because they

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.539 
put on auction accidentally because they
don't<00:03:00.659> price<00:03:00.840> check<00:03:01.139> so<00:03:01.799> verna<00:03:02.069> right<00:03:02.370> there

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549

even if I got Verner I wouldn't even

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.319 
even if I got Verner I wouldn't even
know<00:03:04.470> I'd<00:03:04.709> probably<00:03:04.859> put<00:03:05.099> him<00:03:05.159> out<00:03:05.340> for<00:03:05.519> 2k<00:03:05.879> and

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
know I'd probably put him out for 2k and

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.220 
know I'd probably put him out for 2k and
I'd<00:03:06.419> be<00:03:06.599> wasting<00:03:06.810> 200<00:03:07.200> k<00:03:08.689> but<00:03:09.689> let's<00:03:09.930> complete

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
I'd be wasting 200 k but let's complete

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.670 
I'd be wasting 200 k but let's complete
these<00:03:10.409> sets<00:03:11.569> show<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.629> guys<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.049> stats<00:03:13.319> I

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
these sets show you guys the stats I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.099 
these sets show you guys the stats I
mean<00:03:14.040> my<00:03:15.030> safeties<00:03:15.450> are<00:03:15.599> all<00:03:15.689> right<00:03:15.900> they're

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
mean my safeties are all right they're

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.939 
mean my safeties are all right they're
not<00:03:16.260> great<00:03:17.030> but<00:03:18.030> I'm<00:03:18.930> making<00:03:19.260> huge<00:03:19.500> profit<00:03:19.859> on

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
not great but I'm making huge profit on

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.300 
not great but I'm making huge profit on
each<00:03:20.099> of<00:03:20.220> these<00:03:20.930> because<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.229> think<00:03:22.349> most<00:03:22.829> MVPs

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
each of these because I think most MVPs

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.809 
each of these because I think most MVPs
go<00:03:23.549> for<00:03:23.729> at<00:03:23.819> least<00:03:23.849> 200,000<00:03:25.459> but<00:03:26.459> let's<00:03:26.639> check

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
go for at least 200,000 but let's check

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.550 
go for at least 200,000 but let's check
out<00:03:26.970> major<00:03:27.180> rights<00:03:27.479> that's<00:03:27.780> really<00:03:28.260> not<00:03:28.409> that

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
out major rights that's really not that

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.140 
out major rights that's really not that
great<00:03:29.449> average<00:03:30.449> speed<00:03:31.669> average<00:03:32.669> everything

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
great average speed average everything

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.969 
great average speed average everything
so<00:03:33.389> yeah<00:03:33.690> really<00:03:33.900> not<00:03:34.109> that<00:03:34.229> great<00:03:34.349> he's<00:03:34.769> going

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
so yeah really not that great he's going

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:39.259 
so yeah really not that great he's going
to<00:03:35.040> be<00:03:35.159> sold<00:03:35.400> automatically<00:03:38.060> turn<00:03:39.060> up<00:03:39.150> the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.330 
but just didn't have the coins to get
him<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.139> think<00:04:04.409> he's<00:04:04.530> worth<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.799> decent<00:04:04.979> amount

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
him I think he's worth a decent amount

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.569 
him I think he's worth a decent amount
I'm<00:04:05.549> not<00:04:05.760> sure<00:04:06.000> anymore<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:07.069> think<00:04:08.069> I<00:04:08.159> can<00:04:08.310> still

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
I'm not sure anymore I think I can still

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.499 
I'm not sure anymore I think I can still
do<00:04:08.699> one<00:04:08.909> more<00:04:10.400> not<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.549> Chiefs<00:04:11.849> because<00:04:12.359> the

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
do one more not the Chiefs because the

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:14.960 
do one more not the Chiefs because the
Chiefs<00:04:12.750> requires<00:04:13.139> this<00:04:13.379> punter<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:13.979> the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
Chiefs requires this punter and the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.080 
Chiefs requires this punter and the
price<00:04:15.180> for<00:04:15.359> punters<00:04:15.720> has<00:04:15.900> gone<00:04:16.049> way<00:04:16.259> up

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
price for punters has gone way up

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.890 
price for punters has gone way up
because<00:04:18.409> brett<00:04:19.409> kern<00:04:19.650> isn't<00:04:20.190> in<00:04:20.659> pro<00:04:21.659> packs

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
because brett kern isn't in pro packs

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.879 
because brett kern isn't in pro packs
anymore<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:22.409> you<00:04:22.500> can't<00:04:22.740> pull<00:04:22.950> him<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.820> people

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
anymore so you can't pull him so people

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.290 
anymore so you can't pull him so people
really<00:04:25.889> need<00:04:26.190> there

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
really need there

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.270

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
the high ridden punters to increase

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.580 
the high ridden punters to increase
their<00:04:29.430> overall<00:04:29.930> but<00:04:30.930> they<00:04:31.139> can't<00:04:31.319> get<00:04:31.500> them
