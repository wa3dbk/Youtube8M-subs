that chicken and as you can see at the

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.280 
that chicken and as you can see at the
bottom<00:01:07.549> there's<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:09.909> little<00:01:10.909> mechanic<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:11.990> i'm

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
bottom there's a little mechanic and i'm

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.539 
bottom there's a little mechanic and i'm
not<00:01:12.439> sure<00:01:12.500> what<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.770> call<00:01:12.799> it<00:01:12.950> i<00:01:13.159> guess<00:01:13.340> it's

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
not sure what to call it i guess it's

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.210 
not sure what to call it i guess it's
the<00:01:13.750> command<00:01:14.750> block<00:01:14.869> scale<00:01:15.439> of<00:01:15.680> awesomeness

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
the command block scale of awesomeness

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.780 
the command block scale of awesomeness
that'll<00:01:16.729> show<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:16.880> how<00:01:17.180> hard<00:01:18.159> this<00:01:19.159> mechanic

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
that'll show you how hard this mechanic

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.850 
that'll show you how hard this mechanic
is<00:01:20.000> going<00:01:20.299> to<00:01:20.420> be<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:22.640> then<00:01:23.570> this<00:01:23.720> is<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.079> next

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
is going to be and then this is the next

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.710 
is going to be and then this is the next
stage<00:01:25.130> which<00:01:25.430> is<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.640> chuisle<00:01:26.090> item<00:01:26.600> on<00:01:26.689> a

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
stage which is a chuisle item on a

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.770 
stage which is a chuisle item on a
chicken<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:27.650> you<00:01:27.740> can<00:01:28.100> now<00:01:28.250> have<00:01:28.729> any<00:01:29.119> item<00:01:29.540> and

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
chicken so you can now have any item and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.080 
chicken so you can now have any item and
i'm<00:01:29.899> just<00:01:30.049> using<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.409> iron<00:01:30.740> axe<00:01:30.920> again<00:01:31.280> so

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
i'm just using the iron axe again so

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.700 
i'm just using the iron axe again so
it's<00:01:32.420> just<00:01:32.570> it's<00:01:32.869> pretty<00:01:33.049> much<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.320> same<00:01:33.530> as

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
it's just it's pretty much the same as

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.850 
it's just it's pretty much the same as
the<00:01:34.189> one<00:01:35.000> before<00:01:35.149> except<00:01:35.720> it's<00:01:35.869> now<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.350> choose

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
the one before except it's now I choose

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.260 
the one before except it's now I choose
evil<00:01:37.040> item<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.640> again<00:01:37.820> I'm<00:01:37.939> going<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.119> kill

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
evil item and again I'm going to kill

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.410 
evil item and again I'm going to kill
that<00:01:38.299> chicken<00:01:39.610> now<00:01:40.610> let's<00:01:40.850> say<00:01:40.939> choose<00:01:41.149> herbal

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
that chicken now let's say choose herbal

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.420 
that chicken now let's say choose herbal
item<00:01:41.720> I'm<00:01:42.290> pick<00:01:42.890> up<00:01:43.040> a<00:01:43.070> bowl<00:01:43.310> on<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:44.180> chicken

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
item I'm pick up a bowl on the chicken

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.950 
item I'm pick up a bowl on the chicken
so<00:01:46.430> now<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:46.610> can't<00:01:46.909> pick<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.180> up<00:01:47.299> but<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.689> item

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
so now you can't pick it up but the item

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.649 
so now you can't pick it up but the item
will<00:01:48.229> despawn<00:01:48.790> so<00:01:49.790> I'm<00:01:49.969> going<00:01:50.299> to<00:01:50.329> kill<00:01:50.630> that

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
will despawn so I'm going to kill that

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.249 
will despawn so I'm going to kill that
chicken<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:52.450> we'll<00:01:53.450> just<00:01:53.570> leave<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:53.869> guy

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
chicken and we'll just leave that guy

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.719 
chicken and we'll just leave that guy
there<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:55.090> then<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:56.360> two<00:01:56.630> blocks<00:01:56.869> high

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
there and then this is two blocks high

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.670 
there and then this is two blocks high
so<00:01:58.729> he<00:01:59.680> is<00:02:01.630> just<00:02:02.630> basically<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.140> villager<00:02:03.560> if

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
so he is just basically a villager if

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.160 
so he is just basically a villager if
you<00:02:03.799> could<00:02:03.920> hear<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.280> sound<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:05.979> he

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.390 

this<00:02:10.170> should<00:02:10.409> be<00:02:10.590> infinite<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:12.950> then<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.340> is

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
this should be infinite and then this is

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.690 
this should be infinite and then this is
with<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.909> name<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:15.870> now<00:02:16.079> we<00:02:16.499> specify<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.430> as<00:02:17.639> a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
with a name so now we specify it as a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.800 
with a name so now we specify it as a
pet<00:02:18.060> which<00:02:18.870> then<00:02:19.200> we'll<00:02:19.620> give<00:02:19.859> it<00:02:19.889> an<00:02:20.810> effect

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
pet which then we'll give it an effect

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.750 
pet which then we'll give it an effect
so<00:02:22.139> it<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.409> now<00:02:22.560> infinite<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.219> don't<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.579> to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
so it is now infinite you don't have to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.729 
so it is now infinite you don't have to
do<00:02:23.909> this<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.750> I'm<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:27.870> gonna<00:02:28.109> spawn<00:02:28.439> this<00:02:28.590> guy

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
do this so I'm just gonna spawn this guy

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.559 
do this so I'm just gonna spawn this guy
in<00:02:28.920> he<00:02:29.129> has<00:02:29.219> a<00:02:29.250> name<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:29.760> now<00:02:29.909> he<00:02:29.969> will<00:02:30.299> follow

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
in he has a name and now he will follow

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.909 
in he has a name and now he will follow
me<00:02:32.510> right<00:02:33.510> which<00:02:33.719> is<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:34.049> basically<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:34.919 
me right which is just basically a

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.530 
me right which is just basically a
couple<00:02:35.340> command<00:02:35.609> blocks<00:02:35.819> so<00:02:35.969> this<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:36.419> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
couple command blocks so this is so the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.580 
couple command blocks so this is so the
villager<00:02:37.019> will<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:38.719> specified<00:02:39.719> him<00:02:39.870> as<00:02:40.019> pet<00:02:40.319> so

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
villager will I specified him as pet so

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.879 
villager will I specified him as pet so
he<00:02:40.829> won't<00:02:41.069> though<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.780> then<00:02:43.349> this<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.680> just

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
he won't though and then this is just

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.140 
he won't though and then this is just
what<00:02:44.010> we're<00:02:44.129> doing<00:02:44.370> I'm<00:02:44.489> just<00:02:44.519> constantly

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
what we're doing I'm just constantly

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.170 
what we're doing I'm just constantly
tp'ing<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.650> name<00:02:46.829> of<00:02:46.980> pet<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.549> me<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.969> you<00:02:48.030> can

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
tp'ing the name of pet to me and you can

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.860 
tp'ing the name of pet to me and you can
kind<00:02:48.329> of<00:02:48.449> hear<00:02:48.599> those<00:02:48.810> little<00:02:49.049> chicken<00:02:49.439> clicks

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
kind of hear those little chicken clicks

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.089 
kind of hear those little chicken clicks
that's<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.049> only<00:02:52.290> weird<00:02:52.530> part<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.859> that<00:02:52.919> you

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
that's the only weird part is that you

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.830 
that's the only weird part is that you
can't<00:02:53.519> actually<00:02:53.699> tell<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.299> he's<00:02:54.449> chicken

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
can't actually tell that he's chicken

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.890 
can't actually tell that he's chicken
and<00:02:55.280> then<00:02:56.280> we<00:02:56.489> also<00:02:56.609> have<00:02:56.730> TP<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.359> d-type

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
and then we also have TP a d-type

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.929 
and then we also have TP a d-type
chicken<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.709> me<00:02:59.299> so<00:03:00.980> that's<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.189> basis<00:03:02.579> of<00:03:02.730> how

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
chicken to me so that's the basis of how

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.349 
chicken to me so that's the basis of how
it<00:03:03.060> works<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.449> just<00:03:03.689> a<00:03:03.840> spawned<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:05.400> chicken

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
it works is just a spawned in a chicken

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.750 
it works is just a spawned in a chicken
with<00:03:06.629> invisibility<00:03:07.169> with<00:03:08.010> an<00:03:08.159> item<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:08.579> its

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
with invisibility with an item on its

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.530 
with invisibility with an item on its
back<00:03:09.290> that's<00:03:10.290> invisible<00:03:10.889> and<00:03:11.430> now<00:03:11.849> I<00:03:11.879> have<00:03:12.239> of

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
back that's invisible and now I have of

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.179 
back that's invisible and now I have of
course<00:03:12.750> my<00:03:12.989> pet<00:03:13.259> which<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.709> butter<00:03:13.919> and

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
course my pet which is butter and

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.999 
course my pet which is butter and
they're<00:03:14.939> absolutely<00:03:15.689> majestic<00:03:16.439> I<00:03:17.009> mean<00:03:17.750> truly

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:19.009 
they're absolutely majestic I mean truly

they're absolutely majestic I mean truly
truly<00:03:20.009> majestic<00:03:20.310> creatures<00:03:22.159> and<00:03:23.159> they're

truly majestic creatures and they're

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.909 
truly majestic creatures and they're
pretty<00:03:23.879> cool<00:03:24.120> because<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.780> these<00:03:25.290> ones<00:03:25.620> won't

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
pretty cool because the these ones won't

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:30.020 
pretty cool because the these ones won't
die<00:03:26.189> so<00:03:26.579> you<00:03:27.120> can<00:03:27.389> smack<00:03:27.900> them<00:03:28.169> as<00:03:28.729> much<00:03:29.729> as<00:03:29.909> you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
die so you can smack them as much as you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.699 
die so you can smack them as much as you
want<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:32.810> they<00:03:33.810> just<00:03:34.019> don't<00:03:34.290> die<00:03:34.439> they're

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
want and they just don't die they're

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.319 
want and they just don't die they're
completely<00:03:35.040> infinite<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.759> don't<00:03:35.939> have<00:03:36.150> to

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
completely infinite you don't have to

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.339 
completely infinite you don't have to
have<00:03:36.509> them<00:03:36.689> be<00:03:36.900> infinite<00:03:38.509> but<00:03:39.509> I<00:03:39.720> choose<00:03:40.049> to

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
have them be infinite but I choose to

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.920 
have them be infinite but I choose to
because<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:41.159> seems<00:03:41.400> more<00:03:42.120> logical<00:03:42.329> because<00:03:42.720> if

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
because it seems more logical because if

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.749 
because it seems more logical because if
you're<00:03:43.079> in<00:03:43.199> combat<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.919> someone<00:03:44.370> hits<00:03:44.579> your

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:44.759 
you're in combat and someone hits your

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.990 
you're in combat and someone hits your
pet<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.479> might<00:03:45.720> get<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.959> little<00:03:46.109> pissed<00:03:46.379> off<00:03:47.000> or

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
pet you might get a little pissed off or

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.099 
pet you might get a little pissed off or
in<00:03:48.509> my<00:03:48.569> case<00:03:48.780> if<00:03:49.259> I'm<00:03:49.409> working<00:03:49.739> around<00:03:50.959> over<00:03:51.959> in

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
in my case if I'm working around over in

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.780 
in my case if I'm working around over in
my<00:03:52.290> other<00:03:52.439> read<00:03:52.650> some<00:03:52.889> pieces<00:03:53.069> and<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.489> hit<00:03:53.699> them

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
my other read some pieces and I hit them

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.890 
my other read some pieces and I hit them
it's<00:03:54.389> not<00:03:54.540> gonna<00:03:54.629> be<00:03:54.750> very<00:03:54.780> pretty<00:03:55.459> all<00:03:56.459> right

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
it's not gonna be very pretty all right

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.929 
it's not gonna be very pretty all right
another<00:03:57.900> thing<00:03:58.199> with<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:59.250> chickens<00:03:59.609> is<00:03:59.819> they

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
another thing with the chickens is they

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.020 
another thing with the chickens is they
will<00:04:00.180> fly<00:04:00.569> in<00:04:00.629> the<00:04:00.870> air<00:04:01.019> unlike<00:04:01.650> other<00:04:02.030> objects

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
will fly in the air unlike other objects

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.379 
will fly in the air unlike other objects
such<00:04:03.329> as<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:04.049> villager<00:04:04.590> he<00:04:05.579> will<00:04:05.789> fall<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.299> his

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
such as the villager he will fall to his

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.789 
such as the villager he will fall to his
death<00:04:06.629> so<00:04:06.989> that's<00:04:07.169> why<00:04:07.349> I<00:04:07.379> picked<00:04:07.650> the

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
death so that's why I picked the

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.559 
death so that's why I picked the
chickens<00:04:08.189> if<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.729> want<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.180> make<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.419> two

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
chickens if you want to make it two

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.539 
chickens if you want to make it two
blocks<00:04:09.750> high<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.379> can<00:04:10.620> stack<00:04:10.889> an<00:04:11.069> invisible

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
blocks high you can stack an invisible

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.110 
blocks high you can stack an invisible
chicken<00:04:11.909> on<00:04:12.120> an<00:04:12.689> invisible<00:04:13.229> chicken<00:04:13.729> but<00:04:14.729> that

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
chicken on an invisible chicken but that

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.289 
chicken on an invisible chicken but that
seemed<00:04:15.449> kind<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.560> little<00:04:17.459> bit<00:04:17.579> too<00:04:17.789> long<00:04:18.000> for
