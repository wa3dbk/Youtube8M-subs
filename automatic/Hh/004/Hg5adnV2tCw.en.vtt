 40 weeks and each of these weeks is 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.420
 for the training of infants 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.480
 sometimes some risk factor such as 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.240
 example high blood pressure or diabetes 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.570
 decisive for the completion of the 40 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.989
 weeks when gestation was interrupted 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.039
 before the 37th week the baby considered 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.289
 premature your health needs more 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.320
 than a baby who is born 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.510
 in the correct period , that's where the 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.489
 the neonatal team of the 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.370
 darcy vargas maternity 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.039
 premature babies are 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.309
 uti x getting all the care of the team 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:00.269
 medical nurses mother and father 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.250
 there they are heated receive 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.860
 medicines and oxygen and mother's milk 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.180
 which is provided by a syringe containing 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.939
 only 23 ml of breast milk as soon as 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.900
 the baby stabilizes the oxygen levels 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.570
 in the blood 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.270
 The mother and the little boy start the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.360
 expected contact through the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.150
 kangaroo kangaroo method is already enshrined 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.520
 I am already historical but it has within the 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.829
 its evolution in as a policy of 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.899
 state and also of own 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.729
 maternity leave with the 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.549
 humanization and will bring a 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.460
 of the predominantly premature babies in the 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.909
 where they stay in touch with their mother and 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.890
 father and also with the family for a 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.590
 period until the baby is able to 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.450
 to gain weight and get more out 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.509
 of the neonatal unit and many 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.399
 times even earlier of protein and 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.770
 then completed the second stage 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.840
 jaime and neonatal unit 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.570
 after the movie in the outpatient clinic are three 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.420
 steps then in Santa Catarina to 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.969
 darcy vargas maternity in joinville is 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.870
 reference in this work which reduce 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:13.200
 50% of neonatal deaths and infants with 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.000
 two pounds 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.470
 and the method comprises a kangaroo 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.260
 Motherhood feels very proud 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.260
 today is receiving this certificate 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.459
 reference and kangaroo method of 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.190
 ministry of health 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.730
 other benefits are attributed to the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.120
 kangaroo method as a 40% reduction of 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.870
 mortality after high reduction by 60% 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.420
 the risk of infections from 80% to 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.060
 hypothermia increased rates of 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.930
 breastfeeding and improving the link between 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.260
 mother and baby to ensure a 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.510
 healthy 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.269
 on Thursday morning the hospital 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.060
 gained recognition from the ministry of 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.269
 health becoming a model in this type 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.489
 of treatment for all Santa Catarina 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.910
 not today, there is only one thing that comes 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.120
 many years but in a crescendo comes 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.910
 improving the quality and 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.329
 conditions for this to be 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.730
 a benefit with quality and humanized 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.030
 for the population of the joinville region 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.850
 this method makes all the difference to the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.410
 franciele eloise mothers who are with their 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.049
 interned babies 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.980
 franciele became maisa mother there is a 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:32.190
 month pregnancy lasted only six months 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.299
 when little came to the world measuring 38 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.700
 cm and weighing 920 grams in 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.340
 last Saturday when I was still 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.940
 maysa went into the lap of her 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.970
 mother by the kangaroo method the next day 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.940
 their oxygen stabilized the tubes were 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.910
 removed and now have little warrior 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.480
 makes even the suction movements the 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.400
 moments together are still few 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.000
 franciele maysa remain in that position 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:10.410
 for one hour twice a day and the 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.680
 moment is exciting to be able to handle know 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.450
 then she went through the incubation phase 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.950
 and it's been only a short time since the four days 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.060
 I'm able to take up arms is the best 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.539
 world thing 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.710
 mothers are not hospitalized at this stage 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.020
 with babies 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.910
 they arrive at 7 o'clock in the morning to 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.790
 do the manual milking 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.840
 and remain in the hospital until 8 o'clock 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:37.080
 of the night some after taking the 23 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.780
 enough for your babies to take 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.000
 more milk and breastfeeding for the gift 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.110
 first shifts are every three 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.450
 hours 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.360
 if the routine with a premature baby is already 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.150
 heavy imagine with 2 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.350
 is the case of eloise who is mother of the twins 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:58.140
 premature win and vinÃ­cius but she 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.780
 says it 's a rewarding job 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.810
 we make an hour, we do with 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.590
 another time with the other but it is good power 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.190
 to feel both of them is coming 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.190
