00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
is a great switch in Pokemon - do you

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.860 
is a great switch in Pokemon - do you

see them using a physical contact move

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.259 
see them using a physical contact move
you<00:04:04.260> just<00:04:04.410> go<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:04.950> know<00:04:04.980> what<00:04:05.310> I'm<00:04:05.549> gonna<00:04:05.970> dive

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
you just go you know what I'm gonna dive

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.330 
you just go you know what I'm gonna dive
in<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:06.870> make<00:04:07.410> them<00:04:07.590> lose<00:04:07.799> most<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.190> their

health<00:04:08.549> while<00:04:08.790> taking<00:04:09.030> none<00:04:09.360> in<00:04:09.600> return<00:04:10.610> and

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
health while taking none in return and

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.789 
health while taking none in return and
so<00:04:12.150> that's<00:04:12.480> how<00:04:12.630> Ferrothorn<00:04:12.989> works<00:04:13.380> a<00:04:13.530> very

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
so that's how Ferrothorn works a very

of Hazzard Pokemon you can put curse on
him<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:30.800> prefer<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:31.890> put<00:04:32.040> curse<00:04:32.340> with<00:04:32.640> spikes<00:04:33.060> I

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
him I prefer to put curse with spikes I

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.340 
him I prefer to put curse with spikes I
don't<00:04:33.540> know<00:04:33.630> why<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.810> switch<00:04:34.110> those<00:04:34.320> around

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350
