welcome to another car clinic tire class

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.240 
welcome to another car clinic tire class
and<00:00:03.990> when<00:00:04.230> we<00:00:04.350> want<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.620> show<00:00:04.830> you<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.069> how

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
and when we want to show you is how

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.460 
and when we want to show you is how
tires<00:00:05.730> have<00:00:06.029> developed<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.839> changed<00:00:06.899> over

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
tires have developed and changed over

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.330 
tires have developed and changed over
the<00:00:07.529> years<00:00:08.960> back<00:00:09.960> 30<00:00:10.349> years<00:00:10.469> ago<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.190> was

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
the years back 30 years ago that was

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.400 
the years back 30 years ago that was
probably<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.880> handful<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.420> tires<00:00:12.780> maybe<00:00:13.230> a

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
probably a handful of tires maybe a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.029 
probably a handful of tires maybe a
dozen<00:00:13.679> tires<00:00:14.130> 15<00:00:14.730> tires<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.269> cars<00:00:15.560> now<00:00:16.560> some

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
dozen tires 15 tires for cars now some

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.640 
dozen tires 15 tires for cars now some
cars<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.970> two<00:00:18.449> or<00:00:18.630> three<00:00:18.660> or<00:00:19.140> four<00:00:19.170> different

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
cars have two or three or four different

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.640 
cars have two or three or four different
models<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.369> tires<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:21.960> they've<00:00:22.170> done<00:00:22.380> is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
models of tires and what they've done is

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.849 
models of tires and what they've done is
they've<00:00:22.859> gone<00:00:23.100> taller<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.449> wider<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.650> give

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
they've gone taller and wider to give

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.519 
they've gone taller and wider to give
vehicles<00:00:26.640> better<00:00:26.880> handling<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.380> an

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
vehicles better handling this is an

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.220 
vehicles better handling this is an
average<00:00:28.800> tire<00:00:29.369> by<00:00:29.880> average<00:00:30.359> tire<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
average tire by average tire is one of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.150 
average tire by average tire is one of
the<00:00:31.349> mid<00:00:32.009> mid<00:00:32.460> range<00:00:32.730> sizes<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.590> it's<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:35.750> 215

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
the mid mid range sizes and it's a 215

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.280 
the mid mid range sizes and it's a 215
6516<00:00:38.160> which<00:00:38.430> means<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.940> aspect<00:00:39.510> ratio<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
6516 which means the aspect ratio the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.630 
6516 which means the aspect ratio the
width<00:00:40.559> r<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.610> radial<00:00:42.149> 16<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.290> rim<00:00:44.040> width

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
width r is radial 16 is the rim width

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.240 
width r is radial 16 is the rim width
and<00:00:45.000> that's<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.739> changed

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and that's really what they have changed

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.160 
and that's really what they have changed
drastically<00:00:47.460> over<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.180> last<00:00:48.450> 10-15<00:00:49.020> years

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
drastically over the last 10-15 years

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.930 
drastically over the last 10-15 years
this<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.770> example<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:54.149> same<00:00:54.750> 65<00:00:55.940> ratio

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
this for example is the same 65 ratio

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.760 
this for example is the same 65 ratio
but<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.629> see<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.260> much<00:00:58.469> smaller

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
but as you can see it's a much smaller

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.310 
but as you can see it's a much smaller
tire<00:00:59.190> because<00:00:59.520> it's<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.940> 185<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.199> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
tire because it's a 185 and it's a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.520 
tire because it's a 185 and it's a
15-inch<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.359> used<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:04.019> an<00:01:04.110> average

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
15-inch so this used to be an average

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.789 
15-inch so this used to be an average
size<00:01:05.479> this<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.689> about<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> average<00:01:07.170> size

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
size this is about the average size

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.429 
size this is about the average size
right<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> lot<00:01:10.140> wider

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
right now you can see it's a lot wider

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.080 
right now you can see it's a lot wider
than<00:01:11.689> that<00:01:12.689> tire<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.610> old<00:01:14.820> days

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
than that tire and then in the old days

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.740 
than that tire and then in the old days
and<00:01:15.450> I'm<00:01:15.960> talking<00:01:16.170> about<00:01:16.409> 20<00:01:17.340> years<00:01:17.549> ago<00:01:17.750> this

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
and I'm talking about 20 years ago this

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840 
and I'm talking about 20 years ago this
was<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> tire<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.950> how<00:01:20.100> narrow<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.580> is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
was a tire you can see how narrow it is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.190 
was a tire you can see how narrow it is
and<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.500> 20<00:01:23.330> 570<00:01:24.330> 15<00:01:24.810> 15<00:01:25.500> inch<00:01:25.710> rim<00:01:26.060> now<00:01:27.200> in

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and we have 20 570 15 15 inch rim now in

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.270 
and we have 20 570 15 15 inch rim now in
today's<00:01:28.500> cars<00:01:30.409> this<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.680> what's<00:01:31.890> considered

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
today's cars this is what's considered

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.550 
today's cars this is what's considered
an<00:01:32.610> average<00:01:33.000> tire<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.900> see<00:01:34.110> how<00:01:34.320> big

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
an average tire and you can see how big

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.010 
an average tire and you can see how big
it<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:35.360> 235<00:01:37.400> 5519<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> 19-inch<00:01:39.509> room

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it is 235 5519 so it's a 19-inch room

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.600 
it is 235 5519 so it's a 19-inch room
you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.950> almost<00:01:41.130> fit<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:44.340> tire<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:45.119> there<00:01:45.329> so

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
you can almost fit this tire in there so

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.280 
you can almost fit this tire in there so
what<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.670> they<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.110> so

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
what do they do this they do this so

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.590 
what do they do this they do this so
cars<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.799> handle<00:01:50.189> better<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.729> wet<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.390> dry

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
cars can handle better in wet and dry

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.929 
cars can handle better in wet and dry
traction<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:53.070> believe<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.610> not<00:01:53.729> as

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
traction and this believe it or not as

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.410 
traction and this believe it or not as
off<00:01:54.119> off<00:01:54.420> an<00:01:54.780> SUV<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:56.130> instead<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.640> changing<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
off off an SUV so instead of changing a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.950 
off off an SUV so instead of changing a
lot<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:59.189> suspensions<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> car<00:02:00.390> what

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
lot of the suspensions on the car what

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.660 
lot of the suspensions on the car what
they<00:02:01.110> do<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.290> they<00:02:01.530> change<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.009> tire<00:02:02.250> size

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
they do is they change the tire size

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700 
they do is they change the tire size
make<00:02:03.149> them<00:02:03.329> wider<00:02:03.600> make<00:02:03.930> them<00:02:04.049> bigger<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.590> they

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
make them wider make them bigger so they

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.649 
make them wider make them bigger so they
handle<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.219> little<00:02:05.369> better<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.450> need

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
handle a little better you need

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.479 
handle a little better you need
specialized<00:02:07.259> equipment<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.890> work<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.340> these

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
bouncing around with the giant tires in

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.220 
bouncing around with the giant tires in
a<00:02:23.380> moment<00:02:23.800> we're<00:02:23.920> going<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.130> show<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.930> how<00:02:25.930> low

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
a moment we're going to show you how low

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.330 
a moment we're going to show you how low
the<00:02:26.470> tires<00:02:26.770> have<00:02:27.100> gotten<00:02:27.460> and<00:02:28.350> why<00:02:29.350> they<00:02:30.130> have

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
the tires have gotten and why they have

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.930 
the tires have gotten and why they have
done<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.640> on<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.510> on<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.290> sports<00:02:32.890> cars<00:02:33.190> the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
bigger the room the smaller the tire the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.650 
bigger the room the smaller the tire the
better<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.580> handling<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.120> we'll<00:02:37.330> show<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.540> a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
better the handling and we'll show you a

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.800 
better the handling and we'll show you a
picture<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:38.260> in<00:02:38.410> just<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.740> moment<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:40.450> here

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
picture that in just a moment in here

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.840 
picture that in just a moment in here
we're<00:02:41.020> going<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.230> show<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.640> what<00:02:42.640> we<00:02:42.760> were

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
we're going to show you what we were

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.790 
we're going to show you what we were
talking<00:02:43.210> about<00:02:43.270> earlier<00:02:43.450> about<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.500> low

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
talking about earlier about the low

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.400 
talking about earlier about the low
profile<00:02:45.370> tires<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.090> what<00:02:46.180> they've<00:02:46.390> done<00:02:46.630> this

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
profile tires and what they've done this

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.460 
profile tires and what they've done this
is<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.770> old<00:02:48.120> 70<00:02:49.120> series<00:02:49.360> tires<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:50.080> can<00:02:50.260> see

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
is the old 70 series tires you can see

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.320 
is the old 70 series tires you can see
that<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.680> sidewall<00:02:51.280> on<00:02:51.490> it<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:51.820> pretty<00:02:52.060> big

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
that the sidewall on it is pretty big

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.250 
that the sidewall on it is pretty big
and<00:02:52.680> then<00:02:53.680> look<00:02:54.010> at<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.220> difference<00:02:54.640> here

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
and then look at the difference here

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.350 
and then look at the difference here
this<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.440> probably<00:02:56.740> about<00:02:56.920> three<00:02:57.459> inches<00:02:57.850> so

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
this is probably about three inches so

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.080 
this is probably about three inches so
what<00:02:58.540> does<00:02:58.690> this<00:02:58.810> do<00:02:59.130> this<00:03:00.130> give<00:03:00.459> us<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.820> car

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
what does this do this give us a car

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.960 
what does this do this give us a car
better<00:03:01.660> handling<00:03:02.020> better<00:03:02.530> traction<00:03:02.980> this

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
better handling better traction this

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.110 
better handling better traction this
tire<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.630> tread<00:03:04.959> on<00:03:04.990> it<00:03:05.350> is<00:03:05.530> twice<00:03:06.490> as<00:03:06.520> wide<00:03:06.850> as

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
tire the tread on it is twice as wide as

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.080 
tire the tread on it is twice as wide as
this<00:03:07.270> one<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.890> downside<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.580> something<00:03:09.970> like

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
this one the downside to something like

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.810 
this one the downside to something like
this<00:03:10.330> is<00:03:10.570> that<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.870> tires<00:03:11.140> were<00:03:11.980> out<00:03:12.220> very

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
this is that the tires were out very

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.640 
this is that the tires were out very
fast<00:03:13.090> some<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.660> these<00:03:13.750> tires<00:03:14.080> on<00:03:14.320> some<00:03:14.530> of

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
fast some of these tires on some of

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.260 
fast some of these tires on some of
these<00:03:14.709> sports<00:03:15.040> cards<00:03:15.400> only<00:03:15.520> last<00:03:15.670> fifteen

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
these sports cards only last fifteen

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.870 
these sports cards only last fifteen
twenty<00:03:16.630> thousand<00:03:17.080> miles<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:18.550> in<00:03:18.730> this

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
twenty thousand miles and in this

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.699 
twenty thousand miles and in this
particular<00:03:19.090> car<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.900> have<00:03:20.050> different<00:03:20.530> sizes

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
particular car you have different sizes

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.070 
particular car you have different sizes
on<00:03:21.100> front<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.550> rear<00:03:21.910> for<00:03:22.630> healing<00:03:22.870> purposes

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
on front and rear for healing purposes

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.310 
on front and rear for healing purposes
according<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.190> BMW<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.600> can't<00:03:25.989> even

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
according to BMW so you can't even

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.400 
according to BMW so you can't even
rotate<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.890> tires<00:03:27.100> so<00:03:28.090> that's<00:03:28.989> what<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.200> low

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
rotate the tires so that's what a low

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.160 
rotate the tires so that's what a low
profile<00:03:29.890> tire<00:03:30.160> looks<00:03:30.489> like<00:03:30.840> expect<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.959> see

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
profile tire looks like expect to see

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.770 
profile tire looks like expect to see
