a<00:00:29.939> tripod<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.660> sort<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.929> misnomer<00:00:31.140> because

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
a tripod is sort of a misnomer because

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.139 
a tripod is sort of a misnomer because
it's<00:00:31.859> more<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> stand<00:00:32.460> there's<00:00:32.880> no<00:00:32.969> way<00:00:33.090> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
it's more of a stand there's no way to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.020 
it's more of a stand there's no way to
pan<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.719> head<00:00:33.930> right<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.500> tilts

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
pan this head right here it just tilts

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.490 
pan this head right here it just tilts
into<00:00:36.030> about<00:00:36.239> 10<00:00:36.540> different<00:00:36.690> positions<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
into about 10 different positions and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.380 
into about 10 different positions and
locks<00:00:37.770> now<00:00:38.010> there's<00:00:38.280> no<00:00:38.399> fine<00:00:38.760> adjustment

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
locks now there's no fine adjustment

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.959

like<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> real<00:00:39.840> tripod<00:00:40.460> but<00:00:41.460> that's<00:00:41.640> okay

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
like a real tripod but that's okay

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.400 
like a real tripod but that's okay
because<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.390> don't<00:00:42.540> really<00:00:42.660> use<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.260> that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
because I don't really use it for that

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.860 
because I don't really use it for that

you're going to do some kind of simple
stabilization<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:52.049> another<00:01:52.740> point

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
used my frugal stabilizer to but if I'm

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.390 
used my frugal stabilizer to but if I'm
shooting<00:02:19.020> stills<00:02:19.410> I'm<00:02:19.710> definitely<00:02:19.920> holding

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
shooting stills I'm definitely holding

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.450 
shooting stills I'm definitely holding
it<00:02:20.490> like<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.820> so<00:02:21.830> one<00:02:22.830> thing<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.070> didn't<00:02:23.430> like

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
it like this so one thing I didn't like

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.780 
it like this so one thing I didn't like
about<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:24.390> camera<00:02:24.990> well<00:02:25.380> just<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.070> size<00:02:26.580> of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
about this camera well just the size of

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.090 
about this camera well just the size of
it<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.090> really<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> camera<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:28.770> if<00:02:28.950> you

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
it I really like the camera but if you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.590 
it I really like the camera but if you
hold<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.490> if<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.610> have<00:02:29.700> large<00:02:29.880> hands<00:02:30.240> like<00:02:30.450> me

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
hold it if you have large hands like me

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.030 
hold it if you have large hands like me
and<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.750> try<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.020> hold<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.260> small<00:02:31.500> camera<00:02:31.800> like

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
and you try and hold a small camera like

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.340 
and you try and hold a small camera like
this<00:02:32.070> for<00:02:32.820> extended<00:02:33.180> period<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.510> time<00:02:33.570> your

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
this for extended period of time your

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.990 
this for extended period of time your
hand<00:02:34.590> gets<00:02:34.830> sore<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.280> gets<00:02:35.460> kind<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.760> cramped

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
hand gets sore and gets kind of cramped

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.060 
hand gets sore and gets kind of cramped
up<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.510> it's<00:02:36.990> always<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.470> being<00:02:37.680> squashed

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
up and it's always just being squashed

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.060 
up and it's always just being squashed
like<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.480> I've<00:02:39.690> always<00:02:39.870> wanted<00:02:40.140> wanted

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
like this so I've always wanted wanted

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.070 
like this so I've always wanted wanted
kind<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.580> something<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.000> would<00:02:42.180> add<00:02:42.390> more

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
kind of a something that would add more

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.320 
kind of a something that would add more
bulk<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.040> camera<00:02:44.520> like<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.730> battery<00:02:45.120> grip

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
bulk to the camera like a battery grip

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.700 
bulk to the camera like a battery grip
or<00:02:45.480> something<00:02:45.810> they<00:02:45.930> do<00:02:45.990> have<00:02:46.260> aftermarket

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
or something they do have aftermarket

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.500 
or something they do have aftermarket
battery<00:02:47.100> grips<00:02:47.520> but<00:02:47.760> they're<00:02:47.940> like<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.240> hundred

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
battery grips but they're like a hundred

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.510 
battery grips but they're like a hundred
dollars<00:02:48.930> that's<00:02:49.800> not<00:02:50.040> really<00:02:50.340> i'm<00:02:50.430> not

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
dollars that's not really i'm not

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.950 
dollars that's not really i'm not
willing<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.760> pay<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.060> much<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.720> make<00:02:51.840> my

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
willing to pay that much just to make my

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.260 
willing to pay that much just to make my
camera<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.320> little<00:02:52.350> bit<00:02:52.590> bigger<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:53.070> i<00:02:53.970> thought

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
camera a little bit bigger so i thought

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.630 
camera a little bit bigger so i thought
i<00:02:54.330> was<00:02:54.450> using<00:02:54.600> this<00:02:54.810> today<00:02:55.080> i<00:02:55.110> thought<00:02:55.380> about

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
i was using this today i thought about

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.360 
i was using this today i thought about
the<00:02:56.640> vivitar<00:02:57.000> grip<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.990> i<00:02:58.260> thought<00:02:58.560> well<00:02:58.920> you

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
the vivitar grip and i thought well you

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.530 
the vivitar grip and i thought well you
know<00:02:59.430> i<00:02:59.520> don't<00:02:59.610> really<00:02:59.790> like<00:03:00.000> using<00:03:00.210> it<00:03:00.450> like

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
know i don't really like using it like

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.530 
know i don't really like using it like
this<00:03:00.780> but<00:03:01.080> what<00:03:01.230> happens<00:03:01.560> if<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.790> swing<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.300> to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
this but what happens if you swing it to

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.150 
this but what happens if you swing it to
the<00:03:03.660> side<00:03:03.900> because<00:03:04.200> most<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.620> these<00:03:04.740> grips<00:03:04.980> are

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
the side because most of these grips are

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.220 
the side because most of these grips are
vertical<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:06.210> it<00:03:06.330> doesn't<00:03:06.480> matter<00:03:06.780> which<00:03:06.990> way

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
vertical and it doesn't matter which way

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.690 
vertical and it doesn't matter which way
they're<00:03:07.650> attached<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.190> camera<00:03:08.460> but<00:03:08.580> this

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
they're attached to the camera but this

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.610 
they're attached to the camera but this
one<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.030> dramatically<00:03:09.570> different<00:03:09.690> if<00:03:10.560> you

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
one is dramatically different if you

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.850 
one is dramatically different if you
swing<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.250> side<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:12.300> now<00:03:13.020> when<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.530> grab

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
swing it to the side so now when I grab

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.190 
swing it to the side so now when I grab
it<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.340> can<00:03:15.000> actually<00:03:15.270> wrap<00:03:15.450> my<00:03:15.600> fingers<00:03:15.660> around

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
it I can actually wrap my fingers around

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.170 
it I can actually wrap my fingers around
the<00:03:16.590> lower<00:03:16.800> portion<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.400> grip<00:03:17.610> here<00:03:17.970> and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
the lower portion of the grip here and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.870 
the lower portion of the grip here and
my<00:03:18.450> right<00:03:19.200> index<00:03:19.530> finger<00:03:20.100> still<00:03:20.580> over<00:03:20.790> the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
my right index finger still over the

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.880 
my right index finger still over the
shutter<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.360> that's<00:03:21.540> great<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.020> my<00:03:22.560> left<00:03:22.739> hand

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
shutter so that's great and my left hand

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.949 
shutter so that's great and my left hand
is<00:03:23.010> now<00:03:23.190> free<00:03:23.520> so<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.300> i<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:24.420> adjust<00:03:24.570> focus

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
is now free so that i can adjust focus

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.440 
is now free so that i can adjust focus
so<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.830> effect<00:03:26.160> i've<00:03:26.520> discovered<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:27.090> really

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
so in effect i've discovered a really

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.240 
so in effect i've discovered a really
inexpensive<00:03:27.660> way<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.500> giving<00:03:28.980> me<00:03:29.070> what<00:03:29.220> i

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
inexpensive way of giving me what i

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.920 
inexpensive way of giving me what i
wanted<00:03:29.610> which<00:03:29.820> was<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.060> my<00:03:30.450> camera<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.870> little

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
wanted which was to my camera a little

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.870 
wanted which was to my camera a little
bit<00:03:31.200> bigger<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:32.100> i<00:03:32.280> could<00:03:32.340> hold<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.760> for

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
bit bigger so that i could hold it for

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.390 
bit bigger so that i could hold it for
longer<00:03:33.030> periods<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.510> time<00:03:33.830> comfortably<00:03:34.830> so

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
longer periods of time comfortably so

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.920 
longer periods of time comfortably so
