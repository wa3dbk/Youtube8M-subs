 here 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.570
 and who does so nice movement in jc de 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.340
 slopes rise 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.340
 will knee explique theo how this 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.930
 workshop this piece little piece 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.500
 freddy your gays full or so ate look

 lidl deaf sales at the bottom of the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.390
 peace is almost impossible to see 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.470
 is something of the en waer matching 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.299
 daypart 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.720
 connections in the edge crisis so let me 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.540
 try and assemble it's okay all year 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.329
 That keeps to as settlement in place 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.409
 and of course scratching the flynn sine 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.579
 or the pieces teams still can fall apart 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.100
 with 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.310
 in the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.400
 the maar tales chicken in principle again 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.179
 toe above tales you can has the corner 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.179
 well in the place 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.800
 n as another new mechanism or costs 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.989
 function this is just a rubik's cube 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.050
 so it's not and you have to arrow something one 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.810
 proof of concept or the mechanism and 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.010
 migration to us more about the shape of 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.050
 this puzzle 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.190
 it looks nice rubik's cube white and 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.239
 proportional 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.010
 This is the site that expert Clay you 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.930
