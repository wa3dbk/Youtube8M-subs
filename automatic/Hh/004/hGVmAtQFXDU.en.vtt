00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
up and we're going to get the Milanese

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.840 
up and we're going to get the Milanese
loop<00:00:39.719> here<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.469> let's<00:00:41.160> put<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.700> one<00:00:41.790> side

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
loop here so let's put this to one side

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.450 
loop here so let's put this to one side
and<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:43.469> tried<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.890> put<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.160> back<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and I tried to put it back on the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.040 
and I tried to put it back on the
packaging<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> same<00:00:45.270> way<00:00:45.420> came<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.020> I

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
packaging the same way came and I

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.360 
packaging the same way came and I
believe<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.530> how<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.680> came<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
believe this is how it came but it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100 
believe this is how it came but it
definitely<00:00:47.820> feels<00:00:48.090> premium<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.899> looks

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
definitely feels premium and looks

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.260 
definitely feels premium and looks
pretty<00:00:49.170> cool<00:00:49.530> too<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.789> remove<00:00:51.120> this

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
pretty cool too so we just remove this

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.680 
pretty cool too so we just remove this
wrapper<00:00:51.690> right<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:53.730> silky<00:00:54.329> smooth

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
wrapper right here and the silky smooth

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.560 
wrapper right here and the silky smooth
metal<00:00:55.050> comes<00:00:55.800> right<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.910> let's<00:00:57.300> move

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
metal comes right out and let's move

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.979 
metal comes right out and let's move
this<00:00:58.199> all<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> way<00:00:58.859> over<00:00:59.460> there<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.719> don't

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
this all the way over there so we don't

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.110 
this all the way over there so we don't
have<00:01:01.170> any<00:01:01.410> distractions<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> you

and<00:01:45.409> let's<00:01:46.409> see<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.890> get<00:01:47.009> this

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and let's see if we can get this

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.340 
and let's see if we can get this
correctly<00:01:47.520> there<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.720> go<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
correctly there we go we go on to the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.010 
correctly there we go we go on to the
other<00:01:49.500> side<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.270> attach<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.810> there

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
other side and we just attach that there

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.889 
other side and we just attach that there
and<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.579> looks<00:01:54.509> pretty<00:01:54.720> cool

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
and here we have it looks pretty cool

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.050 
and here we have it looks pretty cool
what's<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> coolest<00:01:55.890> part<00:01:56.189> about<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.820> is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
what's the coolest part about this is

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.749 
what's the coolest part about this is
that<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.689> doesn't<00:01:58.020> come<00:01:58.110> out<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:59.159> band<00:01:59.399> always

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
that it doesn't come out the band always

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.459 
that it doesn't come out the band always
stays<00:02:00.270> attached<00:02:00.600> right<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:01.020> which<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.320> cool

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
stays attached right there which is cool

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.719 
stays attached right there which is cool

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
of like the leather loop in the way that

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.660 
of like the leather loop in the way that
it<00:02:10.670> connects<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:12.200> never<00:02:12.470> falls<00:02:12.920> out<00:02:13.160> which

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
it connects but it never falls out which

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.790 
it connects but it never falls out which
is<00:02:13.850> super<00:02:14.420> cool<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.290> open<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.740> the

is super cool so you open it to the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.330 
is super cool so you open it to the
biggest<00:02:16.100> size<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.930> go<00:02:18.110> ahead<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.650> kind

of wiggle yourself right there and you

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.850 
of wiggle yourself right there and you
put<00:02:22.490> it<00:02:22.580> on<00:02:22.810> yeah<00:02:23.810> grab<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.320> from<00:02:24.500> this<00:02:24.650> side

pretty good with this stainless steel

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.100 
pretty good with this stainless steel
model<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.240> 38<00:02:38.660> millimeter

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
model and this is the 38 millimeter

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.910 
model and this is the 38 millimeter
version<00:02:39.320> which<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:39.770> feel<00:02:40.010> like<00:02:40.330> most<00:02:41.410> men<00:02:42.410> will

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
version which I feel like most men will

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.000 
version which I feel like most men will
not<00:02:43.130> get<00:02:43.430> because<00:02:43.820> it<00:02:43.940> feels<00:02:44.150> like<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.420> very<00:02:45.010> I

not get because it feels like a very I
feel<00:02:46.100> like<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> lot<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.670> women<00:02:47.030> could<00:02:47.180> sport

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
feel like a lot of women could sport

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.940 
feel like a lot of women could sport
this<00:02:47.630> but<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.080> lot<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.320> men<00:02:48.500> could<00:02:48.770> really

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
this but not a lot of men could really

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.040

you like the color and you like
everything<00:02:52.760> then<00:02:53.060> you're<00:02:53.780> going<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:53.959> be<00:02:54.050> able

to<00:02:54.230> support<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:54.740> fine<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:55.070> just

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
to support it just fine I just

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.940 
to support it just fine I just
personally<00:02:55.610> don't<00:02:55.940> believe<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:57.200> especially

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
personally don't believe that especially

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.670 
personally don't believe that especially
not<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.490> 38<00:02:58.850> millimeter<00:02:59.300> version<00:02:59.630> but<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.260> 42

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
not the 38 millimeter version but the 42

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.900 
not the 38 millimeter version but the 42
millimeter<00:03:01.040> version<00:03:01.220> might<00:03:01.550> be<00:03:01.700> better

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
millimeter version might be better

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.360 
millimeter version might be better
because<00:03:02.240> you<00:03:02.360> can<00:03:02.450> see<00:03:02.630> kind<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.870> how<00:03:03.590> small<00:03:04.190> it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
because you can see kind of how small it

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.520 
because you can see kind of how small it
looks<00:03:04.400> on<00:03:04.700> my<00:03:04.820> hand<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.330> I<00:03:05.660> have<00:03:05.840> thin<00:03:06.110> wrists

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
looks on my hand and I have thin wrists

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.120 
looks on my hand and I have thin wrists
so<00:03:06.800> this<00:03:07.459> thing<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.820> tiny<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.890> yeah<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:09.950> can

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
so this thing is tiny and yeah you can

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.009 
so this thing is tiny and yeah you can
kind<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.400> see<00:03:10.550> how<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:10.730> looks<00:03:11.030> there<00:03:11.300> now<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
kind of see how it looks there now the

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.780 
kind of see how it looks there now the
most<00:03:12.170> important<00:03:12.560> thing<00:03:12.739> is<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.160> course<00:03:13.190> wrist

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
most important thing is of course wrist

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.720 
most important thing is of course wrist
movement<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:14.390> this<00:03:15.380> allows<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.769> good<00:03:16.400> amount

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
movement and this allows a good amount

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.150 
movement and this allows a good amount
maybe<00:03:17.000> even<00:03:17.300> more<00:03:17.570> than<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.900> leather<00:03:18.170> loop<00:03:18.440> to

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
maybe even more than the leather loop to

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.650 
maybe even more than the leather loop to
be<00:03:19.190> able<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.610> move<00:03:19.850> your<00:03:20.030> hand<00:03:20.239> before<00:03:20.570> it

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
be able to move your hand before it

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.140 
be able to move your hand before it
begins<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.140> hurt<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.610> still<00:03:23.000> don't

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
begins to hurt so I still don't

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.640 
begins to hurt so I still don't
recommend<00:03:23.510> working<00:03:23.750> out<00:03:24.080> with<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.290> one<00:03:24.470> but

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
recommend working out with this one but

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.560 
recommend working out with this one but
you<00:03:24.830> definitely<00:03:25.220> could<00:03:25.519> if<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.940> want<00:03:26.239> it<00:03:26.390> to

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
you definitely could if you want it to

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.930 
you definitely could if you want it to
but<00:03:27.350> uh<00:03:27.380> that<00:03:28.130> metal<00:03:28.400> isn't<00:03:28.550> going<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.790> feel

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
but uh that metal isn't going to feel

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.670 
but uh that metal isn't going to feel
all<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:29.180> great<00:03:29.510> after<00:03:29.750> your<00:03:30.170> sweat<00:03:30.410> goes

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
all that great after your sweat goes

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.979 
all that great after your sweat goes
into<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.130> which<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:31.519> why<00:03:31.820> it's<00:03:32.510> always<00:03:32.720> good<00:03:32.959> to

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
into it which is why it's always good to

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.750 
into it which is why it's always good to
use<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.230> sport<00:03:33.650> band<00:03:33.800> for<00:03:34.100> working<00:03:34.519> out<00:03:34.610> you

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
use a sport band for working out you

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.430 
use a sport band for working out you
don't<00:03:34.850> want<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.090> get<00:03:35.209> all<00:03:35.630> these<00:03:35.900> expensive

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
don't want to get all these expensive

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.310 
don't want to get all these expensive
bands<00:03:36.739> wet<00:03:37.010> or<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:38.150> mean<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.600> could<00:03:38.780> but<00:03:38.959> you

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
bands wet or I mean you could but you

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.660 
bands wet or I mean you could but you
wouldn't<00:03:39.470> want<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.739> especially<00:03:40.010> with<00:03:40.340> sweat

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
wouldn't want to especially with sweat

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.729 
wouldn't want to especially with sweat
but<00:03:41.330> uh<00:03:41.360> yeah<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.930> best<00:03:42.110> way<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.290> take<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.650> off

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
but uh yeah the best way to take it off

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.670 
but uh yeah the best way to take it off
that<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:42.980> found<00:03:43.280> out<00:03:43.459> was<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.940> pull<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.269> here<00:03:44.510> and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
that I found out was to pull it here and

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.380 
that I found out was to pull it here and
then<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:45.890> pull<00:03:46.430> this<00:03:46.640> here<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.090> let<00:03:47.239> it

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
then you pull this here and you let it

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.449 
then you pull this here and you let it
drop<00:03:47.650> because<00:03:48.650> if<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:48.860> don't<00:03:48.950> do<00:03:49.100> that<00:03:49.280> then

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
drop because if you don't do that then

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.890 
drop because if you don't do that then
the<00:03:49.550> magnet<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:49.970> gonna<00:03:50.120> stick<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.480> whore<00:03:50.690> hand

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
the magnet is gonna stick the whore hand

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.080 
the magnet is gonna stick the whore hand
and<00:03:51.140> it'll<00:03:51.860> be<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.040> little<00:03:52.220> bit<00:03:52.370> more<00:03:52.610> difficult

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
and it'll be a little bit more difficult

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.850 
and it'll be a little bit more difficult
but<00:03:53.239> yeah<00:03:53.420> if<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.050> do<00:03:54.170> get<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:54.440> take<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:54.769> off

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
but yeah if you do get it take it off

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.370 
but yeah if you do get it take it off
like<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.130> it's<00:03:55.370> much<00:03:55.489> quicker<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.260> there<00:03:57.260> it

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
like that it's much quicker and there it

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.310

just so you guys can see how that looks

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.810 
just so you guys can see how that looks
because<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:09.769> know<00:04:09.830> some<00:04:10.310> people<00:04:10.549> might<00:04:10.790> be

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
because I know some people might be

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.090 
because I know some people might be
interested<00:04:11.269> but<00:04:12.230> let's<00:04:12.470> go<00:04:12.590> ahead<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:12.860> attach

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
interested but let's go ahead and attach

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.520 
interested but let's go ahead and attach
it<00:04:13.280> here<00:04:13.660> just<00:04:14.660> goes<00:04:14.840> on<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.049> same<00:04:15.290> way<00:04:15.320> we

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
it here just goes on the same way we

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.219 
it here just goes on the same way we
said<00:04:15.709> before<00:04:15.880> and<00:04:16.880> this<00:04:17.120> is<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.330> 42

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
said before and this is the 42

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.300 
said before and this is the 42
millimeter<00:04:18.620> version

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
millimeter version

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.060 
millimeter version
so<00:04:20.320> this<00:04:21.320> is<00:04:21.440> going<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.620> be<00:04:21.680> a<00:04:21.709> little<00:04:21.889> bit

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
so this is going to be a little bit

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.129 
so this is going to be a little bit
small<00:04:22.310> on<00:04:22.340> that<00:04:22.610> but<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:23.389> can<00:04:23.600> still<00:04:23.900> kind<00:04:24.050> of

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
small on that but you can still kind of

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.370 
small on that but you can still kind of
see<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.410> color<00:04:24.800> combination<00:04:25.490> here<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.990> block

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
see the color combination here the block

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.180 
see the color combination here the block
in<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.389> silver<00:04:29.389> but<00:04:30.200> uh<00:04:30.230> yeah<00:04:30.950> I<00:04:30.980> don't<00:04:31.070> think

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
in the silver but uh yeah I don't think

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.190 
in the silver but uh yeah I don't think
it<00:04:31.370> really<00:04:31.460> goes<00:04:31.700> that<00:04:31.910> well<00:04:32.080> doesn't<00:04:33.080> really

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
it really goes that well doesn't really

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.409 
it really goes that well doesn't really
match<00:04:33.380> might<00:04:33.980> be<00:04:34.100> better<00:04:34.250> with<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.639> what

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
match might be better with the what

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.320 
match might be better with the what
Apple<00:04:35.750> watch<00:04:35.900> sport<00:04:36.850> let's<00:04:37.850> go<00:04:38.000> ahead<00:04:38.090> and

move it into place and you can see how

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.860 
move it into place and you can see how
it<00:04:45.380> looks<00:04:45.590> they're<00:04:46.150> definitely<00:04:47.150> not<00:04:47.630> that

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
doesn't seem like it goes with that

this<00:05:07.669> video<00:05:07.820> helps<00:05:08.300> in<00:05:08.389> some<00:05:08.630> way<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.280> yeah

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
this video helps in some way and yeah

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.740 
this video helps in some way and yeah
the<00:05:10.430> comfort<00:05:10.760> level<00:05:10.850> is<00:05:11.120> definitely<00:05:11.330> up<00:05:11.720> there

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
the comfort level is definitely up there

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.650 
the comfort level is definitely up there
and<00:05:12.169> it's<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.919> most<00:05:13.100> comfortable<00:05:13.610> metal<00:05:14.450> band

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
and it's the most comfortable metal band

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.290 
and it's the most comfortable metal band
that<00:05:14.780> I've<00:05:14.960> ever<00:05:15.080> tried<00:05:15.320> it's<00:05:15.590> incredibly

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
that I've ever tried it's incredibly

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.820 
that I've ever tried it's incredibly
smooth<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.600> it<00:05:17.690> doesn't<00:05:18.110> add<00:05:18.290> too<00:05:18.680> much

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
smooth and it doesn't add too much

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.469 
smooth and it doesn't add too much
weight<00:05:19.100> to<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.340> watch<00:05:19.490> which<00:05:19.700> is<00:05:19.729> nice<00:05:20.150> and

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
weight to the watch which is nice and

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.310 
weight to the watch which is nice and
yeah<00:05:20.960> that's<00:05:21.169> the<00:05:21.290> Milanese<00:05:21.860> loop<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:23.320> $450

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
yeah that's the Milanese loop and $450

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.680 
yeah that's the Milanese loop and $450
you<00:05:24.530> can<00:05:24.680> get<00:05:24.830> something<00:05:25.160> that<00:05:25.450> might<00:05:26.450> make

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
you can get something that might make

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.990 
you can get something that might make
your<00:05:27.110> Apple<00:05:27.410> watch<00:05:27.440> look<00:05:27.830> more<00:05:28.430> expensive<00:05:28.910> I

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
your Apple watch look more expensive I

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.180 
your Apple watch look more expensive I
guess<00:05:29.210> but<00:05:29.510> uh<00:05:29.570> you<00:05:30.380> know<00:05:30.500> I<00:05:30.680> feel<00:05:30.890> like<00:05:30.950> the

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
guess but uh you know I feel like the

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.920 
guess but uh you know I feel like the
Apple<00:05:31.520> watch<00:05:31.669> sport<00:05:32.060> bands<00:05:32.210> are<00:05:32.390> really<00:05:32.630> great

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
Apple watch sport bands are really great

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.690 
Apple watch sport bands are really great
and<00:05:33.140> these<00:05:33.350> you<00:05:33.710> might<00:05:33.860> only<00:05:34.220> end<00:05:34.370> up<00:05:34.520> using

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
and these you might only end up using

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.310 
and these you might only end up using
them<00:05:34.910> for<00:05:34.940> whenever<00:05:35.450> you're<00:05:35.660> not<00:05:35.900> working<00:05:36.229> out

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
them for whenever you're not working out

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.630 
them for whenever you're not working out
so<00:05:36.380> you're<00:05:36.710> getting<00:05:36.890> this<00:05:36.979> as<00:05:37.160> a<00:05:37.280> workout

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
so you're getting this as a workout

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.260 
so you're getting this as a workout
watch<00:05:37.850> then<00:05:39.280> whoops<00:05:40.280> you<00:05:40.700> definitely<00:05:41.120> don't

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
watch then whoops you definitely don't

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.469 
watch then whoops you definitely don't
want<00:05:41.510> to<00:05:41.630> get<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:42.370> more<00:05:43.370> expensive<00:05:43.729> bands<00:05:44.270> but

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
want to get the more expensive bands but

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.150 
want to get the more expensive bands but
uh<00:05:44.539> you're<00:05:45.200> going<00:05:45.320> to<00:05:45.410> use<00:05:45.500> it<00:05:45.650> also<00:05:45.830> as<00:05:46.130> a

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
uh you're going to use it also as a

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.400 
uh you're going to use it also as a
normal<00:05:46.610> watch<00:05:46.729> from<00:05:46.910> time<00:05:47.120> to<00:05:47.270> time<00:05:47.380> then<00:05:48.380> I

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
normal watch from time to time then I

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.680 
normal watch from time to time then I
guess<00:05:49.010> the<00:05:49.280> these<00:05:49.700> expensive<00:05:50.180> bands<00:05:50.389> might

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
guess the these expensive bands might

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.870 
guess the these expensive bands might
you<00:05:51.169> know<00:05:51.289> make<00:05:51.530> the<00:05:51.770> watch<00:05:51.950> look<00:05:52.250> more<00:05:52.700> like<00:05:52.850> a

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
you know make the watch look more like a

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.200 
you know make the watch look more like a
watch<00:05:53.120> and<00:05:54.010> less<00:05:55.010> like<00:05:55.190> a<00:05:55.220> fitness<00:05:55.520> band<00:05:55.910> but

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
watch and less like a fitness band but

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.940
