the<00:01:04.379> maneuver<00:01:04.739> dial<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.460> particular

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the maneuver dial for this particular

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120 
the maneuver dial for this particular
ship<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.470> move<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
ship as you can see it can move to a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.160 
ship as you can see it can move to a
slight<00:01:08.490> left<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.970> slight<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.510> by<00:01:09.720> one<00:01:09.990> it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
slight left or slight right by one it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.679 
slight left or slight right by one it
can't<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.500> straight<00:01:10.560> ahead<00:01:10.920> though<00:01:11.390> under<00:01:12.390> two

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
can't go straight ahead though under two

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.429 
can't go straight ahead though under two
it<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.170> bank<00:01:13.950> hard<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> left<00:01:15.000> go<00:01:15.869> straight

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
it can bank hard to the left go straight

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.140 
it can bank hard to the left go straight
that<00:01:16.680> will<00:01:16.830> remove<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.220> stress<00:01:17.520> token<00:01:17.939> there

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
that will remove a stress token there

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.590 
that will remove a stress token there
bank<00:01:18.900> card<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> right<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.920> two<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.640> three

bank card to the right at two on three

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.300 
bank card to the right at two on three
it<00:01:21.720> pretty<00:01:21.960> much<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> same<00:01:22.710> thing<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it pretty much can do the same thing it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.429 
it pretty much can do the same thing it
also<00:01:23.460> removes<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.030> stress<00:01:24.360> token<00:01:24.840> straight

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
also removes a stress token straight

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.910 
also removes a stress token straight
ahead<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.710> three<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:27.470> four<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.770> go

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
ahead on three on four it can go

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.149 
ahead on three on four it can go
straight<00:01:29.130> ahead<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.360> make<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.810> k<00:01:31.439> turn<00:01:31.799> on

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
straight ahead it can make a k turn on

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.010 
straight ahead it can make a k turn on
four<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.420> actually<00:01:33.600> go<00:01:33.960> straight

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
four and it can actually go straight

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.410 
four and it can actually go straight
ahead<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.619> five<00:01:35.189> without<00:01:35.579> any<00:01:35.759> sort<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.119> stress

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
ahead on five without any sort of stress

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.649 
ahead on five without any sort of stress
token<00:01:37.549> now<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> total<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.299> four

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
token now you have a total of four

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.149 
token now you have a total of four
different<00:01:39.869> pilot<00:01:40.500> cards<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.979> come<00:01:41.100> with

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
different pilot cards that come with

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.920 
different pilot cards that come with
this<00:01:41.340> particular<00:01:41.549> expansion<00:01:42.450> one<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.780> them

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this particular expansion one of them

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.780 
this particular expansion one of them
being<00:01:43.110> Darth<00:01:43.409> Vader<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.040> consider<00:01:44.430> this

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
being Darth Vader so I consider this

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.850 
being Darth Vader so I consider this
expansion<00:01:45.630> well<00:01:45.960> worth<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.409> my<00:01:46.500> opinion

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
expansion well worth it in my opinion

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.399 
expansion well worth it in my opinion
just<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:48.270> no<00:01:48.390> matter<00:01:48.509> what<00:01:48.930> pilot

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
just for that but no matter what pilot

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.990 
just for that but no matter what pilot
you<00:01:49.500> choose<00:01:49.799> you'll<00:01:50.040> find<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> same<00:01:50.610> base
