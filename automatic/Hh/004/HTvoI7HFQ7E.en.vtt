something that you know helps with

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.310 
something that you know helps with
puffiness<00:00:38.300> if<00:00:39.300> you're<00:00:39.540> starting<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.170> be

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
really expressive look for a neurotoxin

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.829 
really expressive look for a neurotoxin
you<00:00:44.280> know<00:00:44.400> we<00:00:44.580> use<00:00:44.790> something<00:00:45.120> called<00:00:45.300> snake

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
you know we use something called snake

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.899 
you know we use something called snake
and<00:00:46.199> it's<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.440> snake<00:00:46.739> venom<00:00:47.160> believe<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:47.790> not

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
and it's a snake venom believe it or not

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.420 
and it's a snake venom believe it or not
that<00:00:48.210> relaxes<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.290> muscles<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.369> of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that relaxes the muscles so it kind of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.670 
that relaxes the muscles so it kind of
just<00:00:50.489> helps<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.000> smooth<00:00:51.269> out<00:00:51.449> exactly<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.920 
just helps to smooth out exactly and
it's<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> topical<00:00:53.790> Botox<00:00:54.239> without<00:00:54.720> the

Botox<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.339> said<00:00:56.519> it<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.790> lips<00:00:57.089> are

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
almost every time we're going

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.620 
almost every time we're going
so<00:01:09.930> really<00:01:10.380> exfoliate<00:01:11.189> around<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.000> area<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
so really exfoliate around that area and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.980 
so really exfoliate around that area and
then<00:01:12.720> hydrate<00:01:13.590> moisturize<00:01:13.950> most<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.150> us<00:01:15.299> use<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
then hydrate moisturize most of us use a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
then hydrate moisturize most of us use a
lipstick<00:01:16.500> which<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.310> say<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.729> really

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
lipstick which I have to say is really

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.500 
lipstick which I have to say is really
drying<00:01:18.450> um<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.770> find<00:01:20.400> something<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:21.120> a<00:01:21.180> balm

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
drying um so find something like a balm

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.110 
drying um so find something like a balm
or<00:01:21.870> an<00:01:21.960> oil<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.410> you<00:01:22.890> put<00:01:23.160> on<00:01:23.280> at<00:01:23.490> night<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
or an oil that you put on at night to

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.170 
or an oil that you put on at night to
really<00:01:24.300> hydrate<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.740> your<00:01:25.980> lips<00:01:26.340> really

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
really hydrate because your lips really

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.810 
really hydrate because your lips really
show<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.660> age<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.260> it's<00:01:28.830> getting<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.610> most

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
exposure because you don't usually put

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.800 
exposure because you don't usually put
sunscreen<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.190> your<00:01:32.340> lips<00:01:32.550> either<00:01:32.760> so<00:01:33.570> look

becoming really dry but I still have
acne<00:02:45.930> yes<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.040> how<00:02:47.190> can<00:02:47.250> she<00:02:47.460> still<00:02:47.970> have

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.070 
supple skin without over-drying it this
is<00:02:50.190> probably<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.000> biggest<00:02:51.150> problem<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.840> I

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
is probably the biggest problem that I

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.080 
is probably the biggest problem that I
see<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.770> people<00:02:53.370> don't<00:02:53.460> know<00:02:53.610> how<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.760> treat

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
see and people don't know how to treat

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.180 
see and people don't know how to treat
it<00:02:54.120> because<00:02:54.450> they're<00:02:55.050> they<00:02:55.560> have<00:02:55.710> surface

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
it because they're they have surface

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.130 
it because they're they have surface
dryness<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:56.940> they're<00:02:57.150> still<00:02:57.480> breaking<00:02:57.960> out

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
dryness but they're still breaking out

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.110 
dryness but they're still breaking out
maybe<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.830> little<00:02:59.010> bit<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.310> oil<00:02:59.490> so<00:02:59.970> it's

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
maybe have a little bit of oil so it's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.750

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
exfoliate that's really important making

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.920

sure you have a great scrub um but the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.920 
sure you have a great scrub um but the
biggest<00:03:19.470> key<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.610> getting<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.750> right

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
biggest key is getting the right

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.350 
biggest key is getting the right
moisturizer<00:03:22.680> for<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:23.850> need<00:03:24.150> to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
moisturizer for you so you need to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.290 
moisturizer for you so you need to
hydrate<00:03:24.720> okay<00:03:25.650> but<00:03:26.280> maybe<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:26.760> don't<00:03:26.910> need<00:03:27.150> as

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
hydrate okay but maybe you don't need as

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.930 
hydrate okay but maybe you don't need as
many<00:03:27.450> oils<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.470> look<00:03:28.860> for<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> serum<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.700> has

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
many oils so look for a serum that has

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.040 
many oils so look for a serum that has
hyaluronic<00:03:30.660> acid<00:03:31.760> because<00:03:32.760> you're

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
hyaluronic acid because you're

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.600 
hyaluronic acid because you're
dehydrated<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.170> doesn't<00:03:34.530> mean<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.860> you<00:03:35.280> need

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
dehydrated it doesn't mean you you need

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.540 
dehydrated it doesn't mean you you need
a<00:03:35.640> lot<00:03:35.910> more<00:03:35.940> oils<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.870> don't<00:03:37.530> over<00:03:37.950> moisturize

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
a lot more oils so don't over moisturize

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.940 
a lot more oils so don't over moisturize
and<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.600> biggest<00:03:39.780> problem<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.440> see<00:03:40.739> a

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
and that is the biggest problem I see a

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.280 
and that is the biggest problem I see a
lot<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.489> women<00:03:41.970> making<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.750> they're<00:03:42.870> over

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
lot of women making is they're over

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.020 
lot of women making is they're over
moisturizing<00:03:43.530> when<00:03:44.340> they<00:03:44.459> don't<00:03:44.670> need<00:03:44.820> all

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
moisturizing when they don't need all
