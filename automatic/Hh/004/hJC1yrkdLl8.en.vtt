 Of course here he sweats 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 nuclear of a first half of course 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.930
 even with a quad at the beginning so 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 really knows really in any case 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.960
 I have a theme at the start today 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.530
 I have a lot of people 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.899
 so yes a little bit was not quite so 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.050
 disciplined well so yesterday at 18 o'clock 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.489
 came no video machine because I 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.989
 actually said yes at 18 o'clock on 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.190
 thursday the autumn camp does not come 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.449
 I'm done or sorry for everyone 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.159
 fall one day late for this video 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.210
 too high but first people and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.560
 Although I wanted to explain a bit 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.540
 why is it so if by question so 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.510
 you will feel and interesting topic 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.750
 but that reflects us again 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.920
 live in the moment rather people so that 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.299
 play a bit more time 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.710
 as I am so on and on 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.330
 because I am currently one of these 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.330
 a little bit on the motto so you 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.680
 So people already know sometimes 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.030
 do you plan something like that you think so ok 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.250
 I have to do that and somehow, but somehow 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.960
 You do not make people because to 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.610
 For example, with my move I brain 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.829
 still has so many things to do the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.360
 I am from the first day on the first day 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.090
 over a month ago 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.770
 I would not have to do it myself 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.600
 not even make my shit printer 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.130
 The arrived is simply from 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.869
 formations to join charlie 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.659
 is already too much of what is 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.610
 because this is where the wallis go with me 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.229
 So do not go on this path 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.799
 what are gone off plan behind 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.670
 Actually what is different from the fans 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.120
 fight 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.160
 okay people and also thanks must sign 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.750
 In any case, two milestones in the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.930
 Last days people without fucking right 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.010
 performance without hot really hot 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.870
 I would say little freestyle 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.070
 and indeed this is often it is also 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.020
 right on the side looks a bit 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.460
 They better leave it to everyone 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.800
 case people i'm in the bunch so people 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.790
 it's 334 at night and that's why 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.790
 I hurt a bit but that's alright 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.320
 okay people like two little ones mean something 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.570
 means small actually really crass 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.800

 Thank you so much I do not know 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.310

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.640
 I always do this highly what is there 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.290

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.060
 In any case, correctly correct people 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.739
 no fucking really means a lot 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.910
 I have already said a thousand times 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.590
 but I like to say it in the thousands 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.030
 first time for which not 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.930
 of course that should be me 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.489
 not understandable, I'm glad 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.320
 really over it and really 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.130
 really very correct so i feel 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.110
 almost here too 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.120
 if a headset had on the son 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.950
 exactly ten hand something was not on 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.450
 weird or I hope for everyone 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.220
 fall into this undisciplinedness today 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.019
 without jokes i will upload the two 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.850
 from now on but you have to 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.350
 So understandably , I sat had one 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.549
 day time because i was five days before 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.650
 Change had a day off as a video 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.750
 to do yesterday people i said i 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.030
 I went crazy without me today 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.650
 fucking I wanted a really cool 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.510
 live commenting on the people what was 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.260
 People happen what happens 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.819
 elgato does not recognize a signal after that 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.200
 I had about 20 minutes like that 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.750
 make time video as finally 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.760
 it worked out people just did not work 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.630
 I'm crazy old and shit 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.130
 this pressure and I thought so 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.870
 Deal with fucking like you like him 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.120
 still puzzled the day after tomorrow video out 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.830
 That sounds really good watson 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.419
 Video before I fuck video now 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.160
 rotzel I am a reasonable picture of 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.780
 Tomorrow, so to speak, will do today 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.250
 was not easy to get out of now 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.280
 shower out one usually goes around 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.330
 334 dynamic 336 came out of the shower 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.500
 just got me out of it just like that 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.490
 thought come ass et you have brocken 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.539
 come help him then if the 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.889
 Things are usually just fine, but me 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.850
 I hope you like it here on video 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.539
 and I just developed again 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.370
 home, at least something happened 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.100
 if the rest is still a relief 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.560
 I had to always have channel space lords 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:56.590
 that's what the boygroup does 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.729
 in any case, old marcel in any case 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.900
 see full house so subscribe 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.190
 the whole picture videos come every 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.210
 video again so I would wake up 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.289
 Do any case if I have not done so 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.860
 I just have people 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.300
 drop by 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.680
 As I said , the video should be yesterday 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.289
 did not come one more time really many 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.910
 thank you very much to the two 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.370
 Milestones and so on and so forth 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.380
 and that just explained so great and 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.820
 I am very happy if it is not 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.160
 also sunday is really nice 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.360
 made live.com telekom ag and then 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.370
 I want to say people if that's you 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.560
 I really liked the video 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.250
 19,000 is simply very harmful 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.250
 really so right 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.980
 so rewind 10,000 on the 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.510
 feld is so very important to me 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.670
 I would still like to say high three 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:44.590
 they forget people until next time 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.490
 I think that people say hey 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.440
 black ops 2 is always broken people 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.750
 say that just can not play 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.190
 so attacking such people is but 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.190
 Just a thing you have to
