there you are yay you actually get quite
a<00:04:57.910> bit<00:04:58.030> as<00:04:58.390> you<00:04:58.570> can<00:04:58.780> see<00:04:59.370> for<00:05:00.370> level<00:05:00.580> 72<00:05:00.970> 42

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
a bit as you can see for level 72 42

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.990 
a bit as you can see for level 72 42
that<00:05:02.380> gave<00:05:02.560> three<00:05:02.830> bars<00:05:03.090> so<00:05:05.700> you<00:05:06.700> can<00:05:06.850> easily

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
that gave three bars so you can easily

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.760 
that gave three bars so you can easily
solve<00:05:07.420> all<00:05:07.570> that<00:05:07.720> so<00:05:07.990> that's<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.470> good<00:05:08.590> way<00:05:08.740> of

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
dungeons uh okay let's guess I think

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.000 
dungeons uh okay let's guess I think
it's<00:05:34.330> for<00:05:34.420> a<00:05:34.480> little<00:05:34.660> 34<00:05:36.150> it<00:05:37.150> says<00:05:37.600> 27<00:05:38.500> oh<00:05:38.860> I

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
it's for a little 34 it says 27 oh I

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.130 
it's for a little 34 it says 27 oh I
think<00:05:39.430> that's<00:05:39.760> a<00:05:39.970> little<00:05:40.270> too<00:05:40.720> difficult

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
think that's a little too difficult

think that's a little too difficult
actually<00:05:41.850> you<00:05:42.870> probably<00:05:43.870> can't<00:05:44.200> do<00:05:44.320> this<00:05:44.470> at

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
actually you probably can't do this at

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.050 
actually you probably can't do this at
