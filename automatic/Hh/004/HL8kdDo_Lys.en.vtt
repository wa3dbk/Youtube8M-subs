00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.440
 good bye to everyone today I wanted to show 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:14.250
 as as promised as going online on 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:19.789
 minecraft 1.3.2 then lag secret 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.789
 sorry those who are using the imagination on the 8 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.439
 I'm looking for another site 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.429
 anyway for me with minecraft before 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.349
 we all have to find servers that up 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:38.460
 this site that I will leave in discussion 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.890
 there are writings 45 13 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.770
 I will leave you a server in descriptions 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.649
 that I created 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.870
 if I can create it anyway I'll do it 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.030
 also a video on how to create a server 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.239
 paragraph c is 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:04.760
 let's get started right away first 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.760
 obviously we open minecraft here they are 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.670
 it's done entirely 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.490
 no 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:25.530
 done in multiplayer and there are the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.240
 server you won't have anything right away 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.909
 there have not written anything you 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 only written I look for worlds they did it 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.590
 add serves go to a site 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:44.750
 copy a present house that I am 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:49.860
 Italian minecraft serves and copies it 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:55.129
 here instead copy who in Italy 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.549
 puntonet study the server address 

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:58.549
 it's done it's done 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.590
 once done, turn this computer into a sanctioned one 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.109
 the player connected the maximum player 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:13.220
 and you do enter the maid will ask you to 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:15.930
 registering with me is accessing them by 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.379
 log me in because I'm already registered that 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.379
 this serve 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.660
 here however before will ask you to 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.790
 registration to do so 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.060
 slash reggi star and here enter the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.230
 your veiled password writes again 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.820
 long allow this bar for 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.140
 write you have to do who generates bar 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.710
 then the future power matches 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.650
 glaciological insert your own 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:00.780
 nine passwords entered the server 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.420
 read the rules all the rules e 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.640
 win be it the four the rules there 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.160
 they will give even if I'm not mistaken kickstarter 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.100
 a sword of a shovel of firms a 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.800
 small stone and a stone ax 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.020
 then there are institutes all the rules 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.800
 if you enter with a texture and you will see 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:26.060
 all the others with your texture and 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.060
 I for example now this this texture 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.260
 in fact I veil everyone else there 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.340
 see nothing told me to open a diver 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.959
 it is true however that you have done the data 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:44.650
 from there because of wolf that to break 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:46.269
 nothing because you are in the protected air 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.840
 where I know that monsters can 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:54.700
 come in some servers there are also i 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.200
 poles where you can go to get there 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:04.950
 right away immediately a place here 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.150
 this is the online server where you go 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.630
 compare did not come out of this 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.630
 part 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.650
 as you can see the server works well 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.239
 here 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.790
 attentive increases family and life 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.430
 I don't even know if you can build here 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.430
 so do n't do it 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:52.740
 thanks in a kick anyway anyway 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.430
 searched for an island where he would be 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.069
 free written or something like a 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.039
 English where you can play online 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:06.210
 what he said to break up building 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:08.759
 now paths say I go there because 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.919
 I should go far if you're lucky 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.490
 you can both have a sweet server i 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.490
 bring them 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.610
 but here 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:31.330
 I was able to use some pies of 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:37.660
 coca cube that there are the rules of 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:41.890
 phases of the functions here we are immediately 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.310
 read the often semi-world regulation 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:48.570
 nothing can be destroyed 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.570
 how do you think the 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:13.569
 here is freedom where we can break 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:16.030
 start building look for a tree 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:21.159
 that looks like a desert I don't even know a 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:24.669
 tree so good that they serve online 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:28.599
 when you are finished you will be too many 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:31.900
 times you ca n't use it will tell you if not 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:34.780
 used to use to set the time not 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.460
 I trust this command and what for 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.529
 to do it you will have to be op 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:44.979
 ie lost then there is the creator of the server 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:46.449
 to be called dini well this is 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:50.590
 the serious when you are done is wanted 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:53.650
 go out do it here because otherwise for 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:59.680
 said all done no woman 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:07:04.270
