 the goal 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.990

 sanger is beautiful guys 

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:30.979
 the tunnel the champion 4 difficult 0 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.139
 It was a game we prepared and 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:49.229
 we had a strategy to stay 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.879
 organized from the beginning and try to 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.340
 find attacks on fast attack 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.689
 we could mark with the intention was to see 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.370
 here to win 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:59.819
 of course we have to take into account that 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.949
 we faced the first classified but 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.250
 who saw the game saw that even the supreme 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.590
 the first goal saw a trofense team 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.169
 organized the players to fight very 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.990
 and then we conceded a goal in a pitch 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.340
 a situation that we already had 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.680
 have been alerted and players have also 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.300
 were alerted and then we 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.219
 first goal the chickens soon after 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.159
 followed the second big goal 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:24.960
 penalty that is always complicated with 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:27.930
 a team that is in our position in the 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:31.229
 classification table to then react 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.789
 and so it turned out to be a result 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:37.409
 that was not playing the match 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:39.330
 if we look at the table 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:41.639
 classificatory course that was a 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.430
 first against rated the outset 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.379
 it would be an easy game 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.599
 Now what happened in fact was 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:50.819
 some of our ease but because we 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:54.389
 we have done ours, we have made the 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:56.580
 easy game because we did not do what we 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:59.460
 we are accustomed to see with rigor 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.240
 very aggressive concentration 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:04.020
 the first part was was mastered and 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.389
 complementing our side with a 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.830
 development by customers that is 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:10.169
 This is what we are already 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.330
 used to doing and after the first 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:14.669
 the second goal in the second half was more 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.680
 facilitated of course was to run one 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:18.270
 little game 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.800
 let's make two more weight goals with 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:24.000
 a merit tale now come here and 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.610
 talk that we have to win this way 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.319
 in a serious way because sometimes there is 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.900
 a perspective does not confuse what 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:34.490
 It happens on the pitch but we can 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.490
 make this game easy
