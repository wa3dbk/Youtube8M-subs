thing is if if you're looking at getting

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.590 
thing is if if you're looking at getting
a<00:00:48.350> set<00:00:48.559> of<00:00:48.710> these<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:49.519> dimensions<00:00:50.150> of<00:00:50.269> change

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
a set of these the dimensions of change

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.049 
a set of these the dimensions of change
significantly<00:00:50.900> on<00:00:51.409> these<00:00:51.620> these<00:00:52.280> measure<00:00:52.760> in

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
significantly on these these measure in

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.450 
significantly on these these measure in
the<00:00:53.180> medium<00:00:53.600> about<00:00:53.989> fifteen<00:00:54.739> millimeters

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
the medium about fifteen millimeters

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.770 
the medium about fifteen millimeters
narrower<00:00:56.420> than<00:00:56.839> my<00:00:57.559> original<00:00:57.860> set<00:00:58.729> did<00:00:59.000> so

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
narrower than my original set did so

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.609 
narrower than my original set did so
where<00:01:00.019> my<00:01:00.170> old<00:01:00.409> medians<00:01:00.890> were<00:01:01.250> a<00:01:02.320> good<00:01:03.320> fit

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
where my old medians were a good fit

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.800 
where my old medians were a good fit
maybe<00:01:03.979> just<00:01:04.400> slightly<00:01:04.729> on<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.119> large<00:01:05.449> side

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
maybe just slightly on the large side

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.010 
maybe just slightly on the large side
these<00:01:06.650> are<00:01:06.950> absolutely<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.880> very<00:01:08.180> smallest<00:01:08.720> I

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
these are absolutely the very smallest I

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.600 
these are absolutely the very smallest I
can<00:01:09.200> get<00:01:09.409> on<00:01:09.440> hopefully<00:01:10.130> they're<00:01:10.310> going<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.520> be

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
can get on hopefully they're going to be

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.170 
can get on hopefully they're going to be
okay<00:01:11.740> let's<00:01:12.740> talk<00:01:12.950> about<00:01:13.070> some<00:01:13.399> of<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.759> things

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
stretching it have to be a little

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.819 
stretching it have to be a little
careful<00:01:52.460> putting<00:01:52.969> them<00:01:53.270> on<00:01:53.450> because<00:01:53.829> the

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
careful putting them on because the

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.529 
careful putting them on because the
material<00:01:55.009> will<00:01:55.429> stretch<00:01:55.700> farther<00:01:56.060> than<00:01:56.359> the

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
material will stretch farther than the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.840 
material will stretch farther than the
soda<00:01:56.840> scene<00:01:57.350> will<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:58.490> have<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.759> be

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
soda scene will so you have to be

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.130 
soda scene will so you have to be
careful<00:01:58.999> not<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.479> pull<00:01:59.840> on<00:01:59.869> that<00:02:00.229> too<00:02:00.740> much<00:02:02.140> the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
careful not to pull on that too much the

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.599 
careful not to pull on that too much the
other<00:02:03.289> thing<00:02:03.560> I<00:02:03.619> like<00:02:03.829> about<00:02:03.859> these<00:02:04.249> is<00:02:04.310> they

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
other thing I like about these is they

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.990 
other thing I like about these is they
really<00:02:04.999> seem<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.270> have<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.539> good<00:02:06.039> anti<00:02:07.039> micro

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
real quality meaning that I can work at

real quality meaning that I can work at
them<00:02:10.970> for<00:02:11.180> multiple<00:02:11.630> days<00:02:11.660> without<00:02:12.140> them

them for multiple days without them
smelling<00:02:13.070> too<00:02:13.490> bad<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.630> couple<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.050> sets<00:02:15.290> of

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
wearing shorts socks it's really not

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.340 
wearing shorts socks it's really not
much<00:02:25.190> sense<00:02:25.520> having<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.940> big<00:02:26.150> tall<00:02:26.570> sock<00:02:27.020> that

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
much sense having a big tall sock that

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.730 
much sense having a big tall sock that

this<00:02:48.350> concept<00:02:49.600> it's<00:02:50.600> hard<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.020> believe<00:02:51.320> but

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
this concept it's hard to believe but

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.229 
this concept it's hard to believe but
you<00:02:51.560> really<00:02:51.650> do<00:02:52.100> feel<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.400> little<00:02:52.580> extra<00:02:53.000> range

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
you really do feel a little extra range

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
of motion not having the sleeves on

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.890 
of motion not having the sleeves on
there<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.410> works<00:02:57.590> out<00:02:57.739> really<00:02:57.800> well

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
there and that works out really well

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.050 
there and that works out really well
goggles<00:02:59.900> you<00:03:00.590> know<00:03:00.739> you<00:03:01.250> watch<00:03:01.459> any<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:01.940> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
goggles you know you watch any of the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.470 
goggles you know you watch any of the
videos<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.989> extreme<00:03:03.709> enduros<00:03:04.480> nobody's

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
videos of extreme enduros nobody's

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.210 
videos of extreme enduros nobody's
wearing<00:03:05.810> their<00:03:06.080> goggles<00:03:06.320> they<00:03:06.739> all<00:03:06.920> got<00:03:07.190> a

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
wearing their goggles they all got a

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.860 
wearing their goggles they all got a
looped<00:03:07.550> over<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.910> back<00:03:08.150> side<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.690> helmet

looped over the back side of the helmet

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.550 
looped over the back side of the helmet
and<00:03:09.850> really<00:03:10.850> it's<00:03:11.150> because<00:03:11.540> Europeans<00:03:12.200> don't

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
and really it's because Europeans don't

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.430 
and really it's because Europeans don't
use<00:03:12.950> thermal<00:03:13.340> pane<00:03:13.670> lenses<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:15.170> I'm<00:03:15.290> taking
