00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:27.410
 but what visitors 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:31.000

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.000
 Philadelphia cheese sticks 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.100
 cream something like half a liter green 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.000

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.000
 sugar 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:54.670
 little cornstarch vanilla and paper 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.670
 for cupcakes 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.350
 delicious 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.350
 d 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:19.520
 of cooking that serves 150 degrees by 40 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.520
 minutes but in this case 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.970
 first is all the cheese 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.950
 well, they have to beat people and 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.670
 this way 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.670
 s 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.650
 A) Yes 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.430
 although on paper 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.299
 and later 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.460
 to be more destitute remember 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:18.019
 it's an art 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.710
 now the rate of 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.360
 sugar 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.360
 and the sugar 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.219
 A) Yes 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.219
 yes 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.310
 You'll see a lot of wind that's going to say 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.760
 like a spoon 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.950
 yes 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.950
 and now you add the believe 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.450
 it is the gallant air 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.019
 yes 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.550
 this thing almost finished just missing 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.540
 new 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.540
 important 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.260
 so the fun part comes 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.439
 for 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.439
 all cookies 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.849
 before 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.270
 ah 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.810
 good point is that cookies 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.959
 Blackberry 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.260
 came in surprisingly large as well as 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.260
 this 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.970
 then we are there 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.959
 Y 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.229
 then we will continue to be able to 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.960
 the papers 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.650
 Water 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.420
 Kisses 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.889
 Y 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:03.850
 with that thing obviously 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.850
 make sure they do not fall for real 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.259
 and they have a common normal oven and 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:26.259
 current with the example 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.100
 you can buy these molds and all 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.290
 and put them here at 150 degrees as 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:44.260
 for 40 minutes and they will stay the same 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.260
 I suppose and try not to throw it seriously 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.480
 and if they throw it clean then that thing 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:54.420
 that when heated it 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:59.130
 little stove that burns and become very ugly and 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.130
 then it will cost more work to remove 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:09.220
 that he has spent 40 minutes in the 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.220
 oven and they take them out and there they are 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:23.490
 and now with a little bit of cream 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.240
 it varies 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.240
 good 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.020
 in fact it is 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.310
 it is step by step 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.170
 yes no 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.479
 and I'm going to put them on the bottom 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.490
 good 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.580
 commentary 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.080
 this 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.990
 wait 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.130
 and 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.220
 yes 

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.880
