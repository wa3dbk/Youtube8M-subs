00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.730
 I just want to play with my guitar 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.710
 quickly pick up an idea and need 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.010
 for that some drone support 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.920
 without complete tape playback I press 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.020
 I press the button song then I press 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.090
 the left arrow on the selection edge so 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.880
 long time until i look on my search window 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.400
 search arrive and choose here the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.870
 entry rip 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.790
 Now we will only play parts 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:41.480
 displayed with drums 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:45.800
 I'll listen to the parties okay 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.020
 I assume that record starts the record 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.489
 Rhythm trek and in the second passage 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.489
 I take it up 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.880
 when I'm done I'm still pushing 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.370
 once record or even stop both 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.110
 the recording will stop 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.150
 written in the cache 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.060
 After that I have the opportunity again 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.460
 to listen to the recording as a preview and 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.440
 then either discard it with race or 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.440
 to save with safe 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.660
 With the switch speed I come to the 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.460
 phrases trainer of phrases trainer 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.070
 allows me each independently 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.070
 each other's speed speed 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.320
 or to change the pitch pitch 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.270
 Speed â€‹â€‹is especially valuable when I am 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.700
 for example a very fast played 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.130
 guitar solo a bit slower 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.360
 I would like to hear it sound after tone 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.450
 to be able to play 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.030
 I can use the patch function 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.460
 Practice titles in a different pitch without 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.580
 while changing the speed 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.259
 I have the fine pitch function 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.119
 also the possibility title the 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.340
 maybe not in the perfect 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.590
 mood were taken on my 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.290
 to adjust the original tuning 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.709
 in phrasen trainer we also find one 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.900
 advanced center cancel function center 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.600
 Cancel is often called a karaoke 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.360
 function ultimately becomes 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.620
 through complex phase shift 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.630
 signals like vocals or too 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.450
 Guitar solos something in the background 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:35.269
 pushed so that you reduced the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:37.580
 bad even the jsc can play this has 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.500
 a hatch function with the one i 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.959
 certain part of a song in one 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.570
 practice 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.299
 by pressing the button ap at the beginning 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.370
 and at the end of an area will start 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.370
 and endpoint of praise set 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.880
 I should not do this look manually now 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.580
 quite correct with the rabin button 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.840
 have set the jsc the 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:18.250
 possibility over menu ends the loop 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.410
 length to the smallest frame adapt 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.950
 Actually, the jsc is not a multi track 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.180
 recorder but stop if I have a song 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.940
 take up 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.250
 Save this from and over again 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.230
 I can play games about it 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.170
 actually some ideas quickly 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.799
 We'll do it together 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.799
 try out
