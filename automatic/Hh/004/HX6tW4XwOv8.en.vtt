 long travel about it and says 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.250
 name gran turismo in the cabin a lot 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.190
 places especially behind the good stuff

 quality in general, everything looks gorgeous 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.930
 the model is designed for a specific taste and 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.600
 on well-defined clients therefore 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.290
 and it will be issued a small sector 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.910
 Cyan horizon microshaker is undoubtedly this 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.630
 the car is designed for the most 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.630
 demanding taste 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.660
 interior car 5 series gran turismo 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.209
 very beautiful, it is different from the usual 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.550
 fives dashboard all before 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.580
 eyes panel curved arc

 Series rear review is another topic 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.900
 I personally did not like it very much. 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.610
 the sides of the rear window narrows and from here 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.450
 front view of course leaves much to be 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.910
 the best 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.420
 so parking without rear view camera 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.950
 serious task for driver ozone5 aim 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.150

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.350
 our pilot test 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.330
 as in any other car in 5 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.160
 gran turismo series something to me 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.220
 liked it and did not like it 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.340
 first the pros are the dashboard 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.630
 center console control cons 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.150
 back view 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.580
