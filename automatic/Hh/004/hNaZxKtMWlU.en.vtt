this project is the long length here how

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:31.270 
this project is the long length here how
much<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:29.329> we<00:01:30.329> got<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> length<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.750> wire<00:01:30.900> here

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
much to it we got a length of wire here

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.050 
much to it we got a length of wire here
first<00:01:32.280> thing<00:01:32.369> we're<00:01:32.520> gonna<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.850> we're

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
first thing we're gonna do is we're

first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:01:33.119> make<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> fitting<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.960> fits<00:01:34.229> into

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
gonna make the fitting that fits into

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.850 
gonna make the fitting that fits into
this<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:36.229> it's<00:01:37.229> very<00:01:37.409> hot<00:01:37.590> near<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
this right here it's very hot near the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.960 
this right here it's very hot near the
fire<00:01:38.040> yeah<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.400> that's<00:01:38.520> right

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
fire yeah but that's right

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.609 
fire yeah but that's right
alright<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:39.990> we're<00:01:40.079> gonna<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.500> we're

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
alright what we're gonna do is we're

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.889 
alright what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:01:40.680> take<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:42.030> measurement<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:42.630> here

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
gonna take this measurement right here

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.560 
gonna take this measurement right here
the<00:01:43.170> length<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.590> thing<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:45.240> we're<00:01:45.479> gonna

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the length of this thing and we're gonna

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.910 
the length of this thing and we're gonna
bend<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:47.009> end<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.220> our<00:01:47.310> wire<00:01:48.920> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
bend that on the end of our wire to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.020 
bend that on the end of our wire to
angle

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.830 

something<00:01:59.030> like<00:01:59.150> that<00:02:01.510> now<00:02:02.510> we're<00:02:02.600> gonna<00:02:02.690> take

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
something like that now we're gonna take

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.440 
something like that now we're gonna take
that<00:02:02.990> same<00:02:03.230> length<00:02:03.440> again<00:02:04.150> we're<00:02:05.150> gonna<00:02:05.240> bend

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
that same length again we're gonna bend

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:17.920 
that same length again we're gonna bend
it<00:02:05.570> up<00:02:05.690> roughly<00:02:06.350> 90<00:02:06.620> degrees<00:02:12.940> like<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
it up roughly 90 degrees like so the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.750 
it up roughly 90 degrees like so the
reason<00:02:18.170> for<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:19.460> will<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:21.760> did

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
reason for this is that it will I did

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:34.870 
reason for this is that it will I did
this<00:02:22.910> right<00:02:32.470> it'll<00:02:33.470> lock<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:33.920> our<00:02:34.070> pot<00:02:34.310> and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
this right it'll lock it on our pot and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.170

right<00:02:50.750> our<00:02:50.960> second<00:02:51.710> Bend<00:02:53.380> it's<00:02:54.380> gonna<00:02:54.500> be<00:02:54.650> to

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
right our second Bend it's gonna be to

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.710 
right our second Bend it's gonna be to
match<00:02:54.920> your<00:02:55.640> latch<00:02:55.820> here<00:02:56.120> now<00:02:56.210> I<00:02:56.240> figured<00:02:56.600> out

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
match your latch here now I figured out

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.090 
match your latch here now I figured out
there's<00:02:57.050> kind<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.260> two<00:02:57.320> settings<00:02:57.770> for<00:02:57.980> this

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
there's kind of two settings for this

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.979 
there's kind of two settings for this
you<00:02:58.790> can<00:02:58.910> set<00:02:59.090> it<00:02:59.209> so<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.360> latch<00:02:59.630> will<00:02:59.840> stay

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
you can set it so the latch will stay

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.949 
you can set it so the latch will stay
closed<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:02.000> want<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.239> to<00:03:02.270> mount<00:03:02.450> there<00:03:02.660> or

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:36.210 

so<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.940> purpose<00:05:32.270> of<00:05:32.360> this<00:05:32.889> goes<00:05:33.889> up<00:05:34.039> here<00:05:34.069> and

opens up here your range of getting a
potholder<00:05:39.050> in<00:05:39.289> here<00:05:39.530> rather<00:05:39.949> than<00:05:40.069> trying<00:05:40.370> to

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
potholder in here rather than trying to

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.020 
potholder in here rather than trying to
hook<00:05:41.479> into<00:05:41.659> this<00:05:41.810> little<00:05:41.990> fitting<00:05:42.289> in<00:05:42.440> here<00:05:43.030> so
