00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.309 

all<00:00:01.110> right<00:00:01.230> so<00:00:01.620> let's<00:00:01.890> draw<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.939> grid<00:00:03.480> okay

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
all right so let's draw the grid okay

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.839 
all right so let's draw the grid okay
the<00:00:04.920> grid<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:06.480> group<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.649> six<00:00:08.069> meters

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
the grid is a group that is six meters

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.570 
the grid is a group that is six meters
by<00:00:09.389> eight<00:00:09.660> meters<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:11.040> reason<00:00:11.400> it's

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
by eight meters and the reason it's

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.730 
by eight meters and the reason it's
being<00:00:11.849> chose<00:00:12.179> chosen<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.110> six<00:00:13.320> meters<00:00:13.500> by

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
being chose chosen and six meters by

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.860 
being chose chosen and six meters by
eight<00:00:13.950> meters<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.820> those<00:00:15.509> are<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
eight meters is that those are the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.769 
eight meters is that those are the
dimensions<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.800> fit<00:00:17.550> comfortably<00:00:18.180> along

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
dimensions that fit comfortably along

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.519 
dimensions that fit comfortably along
the<00:00:18.930> width<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.890> length<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.730> site

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
the width and the length of the site

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.960 
the width and the length of the site
okay<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> draw<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.480> grid<00:00:25.430> we<00:00:26.430> first<00:00:26.699> need

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
okay so to draw the grid we first need

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.259 
okay so to draw the grid we first need
to<00:00:27.000> draw<00:00:27.390> our<00:00:27.660> first<00:00:28.080> line<00:00:28.830> which<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:30.119> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
to draw our first line which is going to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.260 
to draw our first line which is going to
be<00:00:30.480> number<00:00:30.840> one

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
be number one

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.420 
be number one
along<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.809> right<00:00:34.380> hand<00:00:34.410> side<00:00:35.100> edge<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
along the right hand side edge of the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.970 
along the right hand side edge of the
site<00:00:38.430> okay<00:00:38.850> which<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.660> yeah<00:00:40.110> really

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
site okay which is this one yeah really

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.310 
site okay which is this one yeah really
use<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> line<00:00:41.610> tool<00:00:41.660> I'm<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.989> make<00:00:43.170> sure

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
use the line tool I'm going to make sure

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
use the line tool I'm going to make sure
the<00:00:43.469> line<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> distinct<00:00:44.579> color<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.300> I

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the line is a distinct color so that I

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.630 
the line is a distinct color so that I
can<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> grid<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.100> I'm<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
can see the grid and then I'm going to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.670 
can see the grid and then I'm going to
draw<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.829> line<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.809> along<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.020> right-hand

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
draw a line just along this right-hand

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.490 
draw a line just along this right-hand
edge<00:00:52.890> okay<00:00:53.430> when<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.750> end<00:00:55.050> I'm

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
edge okay when I get to this end I'm

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.350 
edge okay when I get to this end I'm
going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> wait<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> construction<00:00:57.120> line

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
going to wait for the construction line

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.479 
going to wait for the construction line
to<00:00:57.570> appear<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.260> can<00:00:58.469> extend<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.280> line

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to appear so that I can extend the line

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.689 
to appear so that I can extend the line
knowing<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.739> still<00:01:01.739> parallel<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
knowing that it is still parallel to the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.530 
knowing that it is still parallel to the
grid<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:04.280> once<00:01:05.280> I've<00:01:05.580> drawn<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> line<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.270> am

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
grid and once I've drawn a line I am

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.050 
grid and once I've drawn a line I am
then<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.619> click<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> arrow<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
then going to click the arrow on the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.960 
then going to click the arrow on the
tool<00:01:09.240> box<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.570> select<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.470> line<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.970> stretch

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
tool box to select the line and stretch

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.840 
tool box to select the line and stretch
just<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.869> end<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.770> remains<00:01:14.220> parallel<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
just this end so it remains parallel to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.050 
just this end so it remains parallel to
the<00:01:14.939> grid<00:01:15.150> also<00:01:15.680> okay<00:01:16.680> you'll<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the grid also okay you'll know that it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.390 
the grid also okay you'll know that it
will<00:01:18.240> remain<00:01:18.600> parallel<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> grid<00:01:19.710> when

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
will remain parallel to the grid when

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.730 
will remain parallel to the grid when
you<00:01:20.549> click<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.850> black<00:01:21.299> dot<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.530> pet

three<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.360> four<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:20.220> know<00:02:20.430> then<00:02:20.840> that

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
three and four and you know then that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.740 
three and four and you know then that
these<00:02:22.380> are<00:02:22.740> spaced<00:02:23.190> evenly<00:02:23.520> at<00:02:24.150> six<00:02:24.390> minute

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
these are spaced evenly at six minute

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.600 
these are spaced evenly at six minute
intervals<00:02:25.470> if<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:25.950> want<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.160> measure<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
intervals if you want to measure it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.510 
intervals if you want to measure it
manually<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.870> press<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.230> M<00:02:28.410> key<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:29.070> your<00:02:29.220> top

to<00:02:31.980> here<00:02:32.390> right<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.680> 6<00:02:34.980> meters<00:02:35.990> now

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
to here right so that is 6 meters now

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.360 
to here right so that is 6 meters now
what<00:02:37.320> we<00:02:37.410> want<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:37.860> then<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.490> just<00:02:38.940> draw<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
what we want to do then is just draw the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.540 
what we want to do then is just draw the
horizontal<00:02:41.870> construction<00:02:42.870> lines<00:02:43.080> by

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.710 
and as you draw as you move your cursor
down<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:20.100> construction<00:03:20.700> line<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.269> will<00:03:21.420> bring

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
down the construction line it will bring

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.250 
down the construction line it will bring
up<00:03:22.340> new<00:03:23.340> lines<00:03:23.670> at<00:03:24.000> 8<00:03:24.269> meter<00:03:24.570> intervals

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.830 
up new lines at 8 meter intervals
ok<00:03:27.019> now<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.080> will<00:03:28.620> need<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.480> construction<00:03:30.480> line

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
ok now you will need a construction line

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.750 
ok now you will need a construction line
that<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.860> from<00:03:32.580> here<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.600> here<00:03:34.560> okay<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.400> not

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
that is from here to here okay so not

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.570 
that is from here to here okay so not
parallel<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.450> grid<00:03:36.690> but<00:03:37.380> running<00:03:37.769> along

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
parallel to the grid but running along

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.000 
parallel to the grid but running along
this<00:03:39.450> edge<00:03:39.780> like<00:03:40.820> this<00:03:41.820> okay<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.380> select<00:03:43.890> that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
this edge like this okay so select that

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.840 
this edge like this okay so select that
line<00:03:44.430> by<00:03:45.239> pressing<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.720> tab<00:03:45.959> key<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.290> select

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
line by pressing the tab key to select

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.790 
line by pressing the tab key to select
it<00:03:48.709> okay<00:03:49.709> remember<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.310> tab<00:03:50.580> key

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
it okay remember the tab key

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.220 
it okay remember the tab key
remember<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:53.010> tab<00:03:53.340> key<00:03:53.760> allows<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.810> to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
remember the tab key allows you to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.890 
remember the tab key allows you to
select<00:03:55.830> items<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.700> may<00:03:56.910> be<00:03:56.940> stacked<00:03:57.540> one<00:03:57.840> on

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
select items that may be stacked one on

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.930 
select items that may be stacked one on
top<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.350> each<00:03:58.560> other<00:03:58.769> by<00:03:59.040> cycling<00:03:59.640> through

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
top of each other by cycling through

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.410 
top of each other by cycling through
those<00:04:00.209> items<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.780> are<00:04:01.140> stacked<00:04:01.769> okay<00:04:02.640> just

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
those items that are stacked okay just

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.410 
those items that are stacked okay just
try<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.750> with<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.200> tab<00:04:04.440> key<00:04:04.820> now<00:04:05.820> what<00:04:06.150> we<00:04:06.239> want

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
try it with the tab key now what we want

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.259 
try it with the tab key now what we want
to<00:04:06.480> do<00:04:06.600> is<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.500> stretch<00:04:08.340> out<00:04:08.610> this<00:04:08.910> line

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
to do is is is stretch out this line

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.530 
to do is is is stretch out this line
okay<00:04:09.930> so<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.320> it's<00:04:10.440> parallel<00:04:10.820> but<00:04:11.820> this

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
okay so that it's parallel but this

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.500 
okay so that it's parallel but this
using<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.650> stretch<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.130> not<00:04:14.510> necessarily

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
using the stretch is not necessarily

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.440 
using the stretch is not necessarily
accurate<00:04:15.840> enough<00:04:16.680> because<00:04:17.370> if<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.669> notice<00:04:17.910> I

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
accurate enough because if you notice I

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.140 
accurate enough because if you notice I
may<00:04:19.410> accidentally<00:04:19.979> stretch<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.489> out<00:04:20.580> here<00:04:20.970> or

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
may accidentally stretch it out here or

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.400 
may accidentally stretch it out here or
may<00:04:21.330> accidentally<00:04:21.780> stretching<00:04:22.140> out<00:04:22.229> here

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
may accidentally stretching out here

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.250 
may accidentally stretching out here
because<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.800> guide<00:04:23.100> line<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:24.330> very<00:04:24.600> hard<00:04:24.990> to

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
because the guide line is very hard to

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.980 
because the guide line is very hard to
see

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
see

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.409 
see
okay<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:27.069> what<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.310> do<00:04:27.430> want<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:27.910> do<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.270> ensure

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
okay so what I do want to do to ensure

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.629 
okay so what I do want to do to ensure
that<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:28.990> continues<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:30.250> this<00:04:30.400> direction

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
that it continues in this direction

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.740 
that it continues in this direction
parallel<00:04:31.270> is<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:32.080> use<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:32.440> drafting<00:04:33.190> aid<00:04:33.750> which

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
parallel is to use a drafting aid which

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.980 
parallel is to use a drafting aid which
you<00:04:35.110> will<00:04:35.259> get<00:04:35.470> from<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:36.370> toolbars<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.930> then

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
you will get from the toolbars and then

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.080 
you will get from the toolbars and then
drafting<00:04:38.830> out<00:04:38.979> so<00:04:39.220> notice<00:04:39.550> how<00:04:39.729> I<00:04:39.759> haven't

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
drafting out so notice how I haven't

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.330 
drafting out so notice how I haven't
even<00:04:40.360> finished<00:04:40.810> this<00:04:41.650> command<00:04:41.979> but<00:04:42.099> I<00:04:42.160> can
