and<00:01:01.500> where<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:01.980> wouldn't<00:01:02.250> take<00:01:02.399> no<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.640> an

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and where they wouldn't take no for an

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.880 
and where they wouldn't take no for an
answer<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.600> kept<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:04.080> back<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> tire

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
answer they kept going back to the tire

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.580 
answer they kept going back to the tire
mender<00:01:05.220> until<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.030> got<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.080> they<00:01:07.170> finally

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
mender until they got it so they finally

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.280 
mender until they got it so they finally
got<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> tread<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.670> biggest<00:01:09.030> difference

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
got the tread the biggest difference

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.859 
got the tread the biggest difference
from<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.350> old<00:01:10.619> werewolf<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> new<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
from the old werewolf to the new is the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.230 
from the old werewolf to the new is the
the<00:01:13.530> channel<00:01:13.920> between<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.520> side<00:01:14.760> knob<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the channel between the side knob and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
the channel between the side knob and
the<00:01:15.299> crown<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.439> channel<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> old

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the crown that channel on the old

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.850 
the crown that channel on the old
werewolf<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:18.390> what<00:01:18.930> made<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.320> what<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.619> call

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
werewolf was what made it what we call

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.249 
werewolf was what made it what we call
an<00:01:20.100> aggressive<00:01:20.610> lean<00:01:20.790> tire<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.020> tire<00:01:22.229> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
an aggressive lean tire it's a tire that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
an aggressive lean tire it's a tire that
you<00:01:22.590> could<00:01:22.770> really<00:01:23.220> push<00:01:23.460> into<00:01:23.670> soft<00:01:24.000> soils

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
you could really push into soft soils

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.719 
you could really push into soft soils
but<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.049> had<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> swipe<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.890> slight<00:01:26.220> fall<00:01:26.580> away

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
but it had to swipe the slight fall away

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.390 
but it had to swipe the slight fall away
feeling<00:01:27.090> between<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.259> crown<00:01:28.890> knob<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
feeling between the crown knob and the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.850 
feeling between the crown knob and the
side<00:01:29.670> knob<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.509> tended<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> float<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> little

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
side knob it's tended to float a little

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.069 
side knob it's tended to float a little
bit<00:01:32.100> before<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.579> side<00:01:32.790> not<00:01:33.000> really<00:01:33.360> dug<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.840> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
bit before the side not really dug in a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.749 
bit before the side not really dug in a
lot<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.619> riders<00:01:34.860> were<00:01:35.130> scared<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.610> that

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
lot of riders were scared of that

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.969 
lot of riders were scared of that
feeling<00:01:36.150> they<00:01:36.360> couldn't<00:01:36.689> overcome<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.799> get

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
feeling they couldn't overcome it to get

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190 
feeling they couldn't overcome it to get
to<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> true<00:01:38.430> potential<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> tire<00:01:39.390> so

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
to the true potential of the tire so

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080 
to the true potential of the tire so
what<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.530> did<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:41.009> made<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.670> channel

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
what we did is we made that channel

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.480 
what we did is we made that channel
smaller<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.229> overall<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.009> knobs<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.460> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
smaller so overall the knobs are a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.700 
smaller so overall the knobs are a
little<00:01:44.670> bit<00:01:44.850> tighter<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.930> faster<00:01:46.439> roller

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
little bit tighter it's faster roller

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.200 
little bit tighter it's faster roller
because<00:01:47.280> there's<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.700> much<00:01:47.880> space

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
because there's not as much space

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.749 
because there's not as much space
between<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.840> middle<00:01:49.020> knobs<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:50.490> more

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
between the middle knobs and it's more

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.789 
between the middle knobs and it's more
consistent<00:01:51.420> at<00:01:51.540> any<00:01:51.720> lean<00:01:52.049> angle<00:01:52.470> because

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
consistent at any lean angle because

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.760 
consistent at any lean angle because

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
of a full ust tire with this TCS system

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.210 
of a full ust tire with this TCS system
we<00:02:13.280> take<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.550> dedicated<00:02:14.150> ust<00:02:14.810> bead<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.860> bead<00:02:16.069> of

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
we take a dedicated ust bead the bead of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.850 
we take a dedicated ust bead the bead of
the<00:02:16.250> tire<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:17.060> USD<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.780> then<00:02:18.290> we<00:02:18.380> added<00:02:18.590> that

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
the tire is USD and then we added that

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.309 
the tire is USD and then we added that
to<00:02:19.010> our<00:02:19.100> standard<00:02:19.490> casing<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.780> result<00:02:21.140> is

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
to our standard casing so the result is

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.350 
to our standard casing so the result is
a<00:02:21.350> tire<00:02:21.650> that's<00:02:21.950> pretty<00:02:22.670> much<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:22.910> same

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
a tire that's pretty much the same

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.680 
a tire that's pretty much the same
weight<00:02:23.720> as<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.290> standard<00:02:24.860> tube<00:02:25.340> type<00:02:25.640> tire<00:02:25.910> but

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
weight as a standard tube type tire but

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.160 
weight as a standard tube type tire but
easily<00:02:26.990> works<00:02:27.709> with<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.070> sealant<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.300> this<00:02:29.510> TCS

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
easily works with a sealant so this TCS

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.960
