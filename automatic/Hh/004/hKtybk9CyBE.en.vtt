 anniversary is about the salt palace 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.410
 the salt palace is basically a 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.280
 hotel built of salt a hotel very 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.680
 original the first hotel in the world 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.320
 built in salt and you'll ask for 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.450
 what this hotel is made of salt because 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.489
 very simple a few kilometers from 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.050
 hotel is located just one salar 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:56.149
 called salar de uyuni de uyuni which is 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.290
 the largest salt desert that 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.649
 we can find so that the boss 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.710
 the inventor of this idea decided to catch 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:10.420
 this salt pack it into blocks 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.580
 build an imposing building 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.840
 this hotel has all kinds of 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.970
 amenities for only about 86 euros 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.640
 roughly 86 euros I do not know how it will be 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.290
 in the year 2013 but a few years ago it varies 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:29.580
 this you can book a room 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.970
 Of course you have salt water baths 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.990
 you have 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.380
 of course massages you have services 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.860
 for that buffet food service 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.380
 free if you want to eat in the end I do not know 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.970
 how to be in 2013 but in the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.090
 previous years the truth is that the 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.560
 experiences were very positive there 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.799
 many buildings that have tried 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.259
 imitate this salt palace but all 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.929
 the world knows that the first palace of 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.560
 salt and the biggest and the most original is 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.000
 this is precisely a hotel that as 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.410
 you can see 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.789
 it is very well very well decorated 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.860
 Amenities as I said also has 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.790
 a golf course a dry sauna 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.160
 hydromassage steam you can see 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.800
 also the pool table 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.819
 and well something that I thought was very 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.219
 funny in this hotel 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.219
 is that you can not lick the walls 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:30.769
 there is a sign that says no lick 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.379
 the walls for what reason because they are 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.239
 Salt walls can suck everything is 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.909
 You can suck all the hotel that opens to 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.709
 go out many times this hotel has to 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.920
 be rebuilt because the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.129
 rains, let's say they spoil the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.769
 way of the hotel but good there has not been 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.930
 no collapse no problem is 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.269
 true that every year you have to 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.760
 perform a series of repairs but 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.459
 well this is like the ice hotel that 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.090
 it is found and in Sweden it is only 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.400
 hotels that are special and require 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.430
 of more intensive care than any 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.859
 another hotel a hotel built in salt is 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.629
 logical that you need more care than 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.730
 one that is built of brick is 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.830
 that has nothing to do 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.170
 finally you know here you have the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.239
 information about the salt palace you can 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.790
 document if you want you can find it 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.349
 in wikipedia and where you want and you 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.180
 you will be surprised of the great 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.299
 amount of things that are inside this 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.840
 hotel more than anything is an original idea 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:36.040
 to spend a good vacation or to 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.040
 love your partner
