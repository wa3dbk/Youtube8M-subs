for me which I thought was pretty cool

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.770

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
there and I wasn't going to be able to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.830 
there and I wasn't going to be able to
get<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.729> had<00:01:33.000> too<00:01:33.210> many<00:01:33.329> zombies

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
get to it because I had too many zombies

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.450 
get to it because I had too many zombies
around<00:01:34.799> me<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.990> drone<00:01:37.259> swooped<00:01:38.189> down<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
around me but the drone swooped down and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.730 
around me but the drone swooped down and
picked<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.570> me<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.530> thought

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
picked it right up for me and I thought

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.899
