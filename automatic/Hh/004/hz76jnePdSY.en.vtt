00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
hey guys this is the test footage for

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.469 
hey guys this is the test footage for
the<00:01:02.820> Jazz<00:01:03.199> HDV<00:01:04.199> 140<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> was<00:01:05.939> reading<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the Jazz HDV 140 so I was reading the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.480 
the Jazz HDV 140 so I was reading the
viewfinder<00:01:07.290> which<00:01:07.500> does<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:07.950> turn<00:01:08.369> around

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
viewfinder which does not turn around

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.899 
viewfinder which does not turn around
unfortunately<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.360> thought<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.780> might<00:01:10.049> but

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
unfortunately I thought it might but

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.630 
unfortunately I thought it might but
this<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.560> HD<00:01:14.270> filming<00:01:15.270> setting<00:01:16.229> it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
this is the HD filming setting it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.070 
this is the HD filming setting it
records<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.850> lower<00:01:18.119> qualities<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.960> has

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
records in lower qualities but this has

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.620 
records in lower qualities but this has
the<00:01:19.200> highest<00:01:19.590> quality<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.130> records<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.790> so

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the highest quality it records it so

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.140 
the highest quality it records it so
what<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.549> camera<00:01:23.759> markets

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
what do you think so this camera markets

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.789 
what do you think so this camera markets
itself<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:25.220> HD<00:01:26.220> camcorder<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.320> really

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
itself as a HD camcorder and it's really

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
itself as a HD camcorder and it's really
tiny<00:01:29.119> unfortunately<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.479> reason

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
tiny unfortunately this is the reason

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.450 
tiny unfortunately this is the reason
why<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> really<00:01:31.380> wanted<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.979> thought<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
why I really wanted it I thought it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.480 
why I really wanted it I thought it
would<00:01:32.579> spin<00:01:33.470> but<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.740> viewfinder<00:01:34.950> does<00:01:35.340> not

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
would spin but the viewfinder does not

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.069 
would spin but the viewfinder does not
turn<00:01:35.670> around<00:01:35.790> because<00:01:36.090> I'm<00:01:36.180> using<00:01:36.360> my<00:01:36.659> DSLR

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
turn around because I'm using my DSLR

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.260 
turn around because I'm using my DSLR
which<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.829> could<00:01:38.369> not<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.670> myself<00:01:38.820> when<00:01:39.180> I'm

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
which I could not see myself when I'm

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.160 
which I could not see myself when I'm
filming<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.930> know

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
filming and I know

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
in frame etc etc unfortunately this does

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.969 
in frame etc etc unfortunately this does
not<00:01:53.159> do<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.780> kitschy<00:01:55.140> is

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
not do that and it's really kitschy is

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.410 
not do that and it's really kitschy is
that<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> right<00:01:56.460> word<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.909> kitschy

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that the right word for it kitschy

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.969 
that the right word for it kitschy
I<00:01:57.450> don't<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.170> listen<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> sound<00:01:58.920> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
I don't know but listen to the sound of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.660 
I don't know but listen to the sound of
make<00:01:59.100> sure<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.310> turn<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.610> on

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.520 

if<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:03.850> doesn't<00:02:04.030> remind<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:04.570> of<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.810> 90s<00:02:05.229> or

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
if that doesn't remind you of the 90s or

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.510 
if that doesn't remind you of the 90s or
early<00:02:05.920> 2000s<00:02:06.850> technology<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:08.190> don't<00:02:09.190> know<00:02:09.250> man

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
early 2000s technology I don't know man

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.280 
early 2000s technology I don't know man
and<00:02:09.759> then<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.209> is<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.420> sag<00:02:10.660> so<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.050> turn<00:02:11.200> it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
and then this is a sag so you turn it

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.370 
and then this is a sag so you turn it
off<00:02:13.680> it's<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.800> good<00:02:14.980> tune<00:02:15.220> but<00:02:15.580> not<00:02:16.270> worth<00:02:16.900> it

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
off it's a good tune but not worth it

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.030 
off it's a good tune but not worth it
I<00:02:17.410> don't<00:02:18.010> think<00:02:18.450> basically<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.810> as<00:02:20.290> cheap<00:02:20.950> as

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
I don't think basically it's as cheap as

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.650 
I don't think basically it's as cheap as
they<00:02:21.100> get<00:02:21.280> as<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:22.000> can<00:02:22.150> see<00:02:22.330> in<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.510> footage

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
they get as you can see in the footage

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.080 
they get as you can see in the footage
that<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.050> shot<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.800> looks<00:02:24.489> like<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.790> filmed

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
that I shot it looks like you filmed

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.140 
that I shot it looks like you filmed
something<00:02:25.270> with<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.510> potato<00:02:25.840> um<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:27.640> only<00:02:27.760> takes

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
something with a potato um it only takes

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.500 
something with a potato um it only takes
a<00:02:28.450> up<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.260> an<00:02:29.440> 8<00:02:30.069> gigabyte<00:02:30.640> memory<00:02:30.910> card<00:02:31.300> so

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
a up to an 8 gigabyte memory card so

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.059 
a up to an 8 gigabyte memory card so
you're<00:02:31.660> screwed<00:02:31.989> if<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.230> want<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.470> film<00:02:32.890> more

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
you're screwed if you want to film more

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.920 
you're screwed if you want to film more
than<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:34.150> takes<00:02:34.360> three<00:02:34.569> Triple<00:02:34.870> A

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
than that it takes three Triple A

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.120 
than that it takes three Triple A
batteries<00:02:34.959> which<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.620> nice<00:02:35.739> you<00:02:35.890> have<00:02:36.010> to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
batteries which is nice you have to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.370 
batteries which is nice you have to
charge<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.610> but<00:02:36.910> otherwise<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:38.050> just<00:02:38.080> think

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
charge it but otherwise I just think

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.199 
charge it but otherwise I just think
it's<00:02:38.500> not<00:02:38.680> worth<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.280> if<00:02:39.550> you're<00:02:39.910> trying<00:02:40.150> to

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
it's not worth it if you're trying to

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.070 
it's not worth it if you're trying to
film<00:02:40.480> high<00:02:40.660> quality<00:02:41.200> um<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:42.489> frame<00:02:42.730> rate<00:02:42.940> is

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
film high quality um the frame rate is

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.580 
film high quality um the frame rate is
really<00:02:44.080> poop<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:47.019> get<00:02:47.170> better<00:02:47.350> quality

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
really poop and you get better quality

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.150 
really poop and you get better quality
with<00:02:48.330> your<00:02:49.330> phone<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:50.019> are<00:02:50.050> just<00:02:50.920> starting
