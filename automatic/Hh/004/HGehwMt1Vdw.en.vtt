00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.830 
inch or 3.5 milimeter input jack version
of<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.279> mic<00:00:29.550> let's<00:00:30.119> go<00:00:30.269> ahead<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.689> look

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
of that mic let's go ahead and just look

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.870 
of that mic let's go ahead and just look
at<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> couple<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> specs<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.610> look<00:00:32.759> at

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
at a couple of the specs if you look at

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.340 
at a couple of the specs if you look at
the<00:00:32.969> frequency<00:00:33.149> response<00:00:33.510> there<00:00:34.020> does<00:00:34.320> seem

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the frequency response there does seem

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.310 
the frequency response there does seem
to<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> relatively<00:00:35.489> flat<00:00:35.850> response<00:00:36.320> except

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
to be a relatively flat response except

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.619 
to be a relatively flat response except
for<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> minor<00:00:37.770> boost<00:00:38.100> around<00:00:38.460> 10<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.910> 20,000

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
for a minor boost around 10 to 20,000

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.780 
for a minor boost around 10 to 20,000
Hertz<00:00:39.660> which<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.649> boosts<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> presence<00:00:41.670> of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
Hertz which just boosts the presence of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.150 
Hertz which just boosts the presence of
the<00:00:42.030> microphone<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.899> does<00:00:43.230> also<00:00:43.559> show<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.829> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the microphone it does also show that it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.639 
the microphone it does also show that it
is<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.340> omnidirectional<00:00:45.180> microphone<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.350> like

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
is a omnidirectional microphone so like

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.560 
is a omnidirectional microphone so like
the<00:00:46.800> other<00:00:46.829> tone<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.460> mic<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.850> should<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.480> able

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the other tone or mic I should be able

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.119 
the other tone or mic I should be able
to<00:00:48.690> spin<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.110> around<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.010> have

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
to spin it around like this and have

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.069 
to spin it around like this and have
very<00:00:50.399> minimal<00:00:50.640> dead<00:00:51.030> space<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.719> it

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
very minimal dead space with it

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.740 
very minimal dead space with it
so<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.500> microphones<00:00:53.070> quality<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.879> sounds

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
so this microphones quality it sounds

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.380 
so this microphones quality it sounds
decent<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.590> 16<00:00:56.070> bucks<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.940> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
decent for 16 bucks but it's not it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.689 
decent for 16 bucks but it's not it
doesn't<00:00:57.780> sound<00:00:58.289> incredibly<00:00:58.949> professional<00:00:59.340> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
doesn't sound incredibly professional it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
doesn't sound incredibly professional it
sounds<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.149> bit<00:01:00.300> tinny<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.780> me<00:01:00.930> but

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
sounds a little bit tinny to me but

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.250 
sounds a little bit tinny to me but
maybe<00:01:01.980> I'm<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.399> being<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.879> bit<00:01:03.120> too<00:01:03.359> picky<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
maybe I'm just being a bit too picky the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
maybe I'm just being a bit too picky the
quality<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> build<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.700> does<00:01:05.939> feel<00:01:06.330> very

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
quality of the build it does feel very

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.899 
quality of the build it does feel very
cheap<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.470> jack<00:01:07.799> feels<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> might<00:01:08.729> just

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
cheap the jack feels like it might just

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.210 
cheap the jack feels like it might just
rip<00:01:09.210> out<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> step<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.500> time<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
rip out if you step on at one time the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100 
rip out if you step on at one time the
stand<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.700> comes<00:01:11.970> along<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
stand that comes along with it not a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.679 
stand that comes along with it not a
very<00:01:13.380> good<00:01:13.560> stand<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.490> cardboard<00:01:15.030> box<00:01:15.270> also

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
very good stand so cardboard box also

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.170 
very good stand so cardboard box also
asked<00:01:15.960> me<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.259> review<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> dragon<00:01:17.280> pad<00:01:17.549> pop

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
asked me to review the dragon pad pop

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.539 
asked me to review the dragon pad pop
filter<00:01:18.630> now<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:19.530> sure<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.130> would<00:01:20.340> work

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
filter now I'm sure that this would work

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.609 
filter now I'm sure that this would work
perfectly<00:01:21.090> fine<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> regular<00:01:22.170> microphone

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
perfectly fine on a regular microphone

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.450 
perfectly fine on a regular microphone
however<00:01:23.600> with<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.140> stand<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.860> comes<00:01:26.159> along

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
however with the stand that comes along

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.490 
however with the stand that comes along
with<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.880> there's<00:01:27.570> no<00:01:27.840> place<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.439> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
with this there's no place for you to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.370 
with this there's no place for you to
clip<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.130> pop<00:01:29.700> filter<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> would

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
clip the pop filter on so I would

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
clip the pop filter on so I would
recommend<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.979> getting<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.369> little<00:01:32.490> bulb<00:01:32.880> pop

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
recommend just getting a little bulb pop

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.060 
recommend just getting a little bulb pop
filter<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.380> place<00:01:34.799> right<00:01:35.040> on

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
filter like this just to place right on

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.850 
filter like this just to place right on
top<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.540> gives<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
top of it so that gives you the the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.679 
top of it so that gives you the the
benefit<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.400> pop<00:01:38.610> filter<00:01:38.790> without<00:01:39.299> having

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
benefit of a pop filter without having

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.440 
benefit of a pop filter without having
to<00:01:39.780> buy<00:01:39.930> an<00:01:40.229> additional<00:01:40.369> microphone<00:01:41.369> stand<00:01:41.700> so

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to buy an additional microphone stand so

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.910 
to buy an additional microphone stand so
I<00:01:42.479> think<00:01:42.630> that'll<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> review<00:01:43.560> of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I think that'll do it for the review of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
I think that'll do it for the review of
this<00:01:44.070> microphone<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.939> are<00:01:45.240> interested<00:01:45.750> in

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
this microphone if you are interested in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.359
