00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.249 
salt and so on to carry that so we're
using<00:01:56.950> soda<00:01:57.460> for<00:01:57.790> that<00:01:57.970> not<00:01:58.509> a<00:01:58.540> work<00:01:58.840> with<00:01:59.079> the

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
using soda for that not a work with the

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.130 
using soda for that not a work with the
soda<00:01:59.530> we're<00:02:00.130> going<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.460> need<00:02:00.729> some<00:02:00.790> sour<00:02:01.659> milk

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
soda we're going to need some sour milk

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.499 
soda we're going to need some sour milk
now<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.740> course<00:02:02.799> if<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.579> milk<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:03.909> cow<00:02:04.149> and

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
now of course if you milk the cow and

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.300 
now of course if you milk the cow and
you<00:02:04.960> had<00:02:05.079> some<00:02:05.290> milk<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:05.740> out<00:02:05.950> without

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
you had some milk that out without

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.249 
you had some milk that out without
refrigeration<00:02:06.820> it<00:02:07.420> would<00:02:07.570> eventually<00:02:07.960> go

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
refrigeration it would eventually go

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.620 
refrigeration it would eventually go
sour<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.489> we<00:02:09.729> would<00:02:09.880> have<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:10.060> use<00:02:10.329> for<00:02:10.360> that

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
sour and so we would have a use for that

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.990 
sour and so we would have a use for that
here<00:02:11.049> if<00:02:11.170> we<00:02:11.320> had<00:02:11.470> some<00:02:11.739> sour<00:02:11.950> milk<00:02:12.310> today<00:02:12.610> this

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
here if we had some sour milk today this

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.470 
here if we had some sour milk today this
sour<00:02:13.329> milk<00:02:13.660> has<00:02:13.870> been<00:02:14.080> especially<00:02:14.620> created
