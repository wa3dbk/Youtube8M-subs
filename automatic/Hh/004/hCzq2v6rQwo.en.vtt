00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.359 
energy for the punch starts in his legs
travels<00:01:05.930> up<00:01:06.079> through<00:01:06.350> his<00:01:06.409> hips<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:06.950> to<00:01:07.250> his

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
travels up through his hips and to his

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.670 
travels up through his hips and to his
shoulder<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.420> therefore<00:01:08.900> he<00:01:09.110> is<00:01:09.200> building<00:01:09.470> up

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
shoulder so therefore he is building up

which will then twist increasing the
force<00:01:51.680> further<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.400> allowing<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.270> shoulder

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
force further and allowing the shoulder

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.539 
force further and allowing the shoulder
of<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.840> punching<00:01:54.259> arm<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:54.890> move<00:01:55.040> forwards

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
of the punching arm to move forwards

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.060 
of the punching arm to move forwards
with<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.909> force<00:01:56.240> then<00:01:57.049> focus<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.619> energy

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
with that force then focus on energy

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.429 
with that force then focus on energy
from<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.369> shoulder<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:58.909> punch<00:01:59.180> itself

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
from the shoulder to the punch itself

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.990 
from the shoulder to the punch itself
this<00:02:00.439> will<00:02:00.649> help<00:02:00.860> develop<00:02:01.009> subsequent<00:02:01.729> elbow

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
this will help develop subsequent elbow

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
prevent you from pulling the arm back

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.509 
prevent you from pulling the arm back
like<00:02:08.899> most<00:02:09.110> do<00:02:09.319> when<00:02:09.649> they<00:02:09.799> demonstrate<00:02:10.369> as

like most do when they demonstrate as

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.610 
like most do when they demonstrate as
they<00:02:10.700> lack<00:02:10.879> the<00:02:11.029> coordination<00:02:11.689> and<00:02:11.870> rely<00:02:12.319> on

that's<00:02:17.069> commonly<00:02:17.549> seen<00:02:17.879> in<00:02:17.909> almost<00:02:18.239> any

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
demonstration of a one inch punch

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.890 
demonstration of a one inch punch
especially<00:02:20.790> when<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.060> comes<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.299> boards<00:02:21.750> even

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
especially when it comes to boards even

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.259 
especially when it comes to boards even
from<00:02:22.260> Bruce<00:02:22.470> Lee<00:02:22.680> himself<00:02:22.769> I'm<00:02:23.370> talking<00:02:24.180> about

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
from Bruce Lee himself I'm talking about

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.479 
from Bruce Lee himself I'm talking about
pulling<00:02:24.659> it<00:02:24.780> back<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:25.349> it's<00:02:25.709> coming<00:02:26.040> basically

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
pulling it back so it's coming basically

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.589 
pulling it back so it's coming basically
from<00:02:26.670> their<00:02:26.819> body<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.180> eight<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.480> they're

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
from their body and eight and they're

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.630 
from their body and eight and they're
still<00:02:27.810> calling<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> one-inch<00:02:28.560> punch<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.580> you

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
still calling it a one-inch punch so you

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.550 
still calling it a one-inch punch so you
want<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:29.970> minimize<00:02:30.090> obviously<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.170> pull<00:02:31.349> back

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
want to minimize obviously the pull back

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.160 
want to minimize obviously the pull back
as<00:02:31.769> much<00:02:31.950> as<00:02:32.190> possible<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.510> person<00:02:34.080> you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
as much as possible on a person you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.110 
as much as possible on a person you
should<00:02:34.410> be<00:02:34.560> able<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.830> get<00:02:35.340> rid<00:02:35.489> of<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:35.940> on

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
should be able to get rid of it but on

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.430 
should be able to get rid of it but on
board<00:02:36.450> sometimes<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:37.049> can<00:02:37.140> be<00:02:37.170> quite

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
board sometimes it can be quite

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.990 
board sometimes it can be quite
subconscious<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.400> might<00:02:38.549> pull<00:02:38.790> back<00:02:38.970> a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
subconscious and you might pull back a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.150 
subconscious and you might pull back a
couple<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.390> centimeters<00:02:39.690> before<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.349> go<00:02:40.530> it's

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
couple of centimeters before you go it's

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.130 
couple of centimeters before you go it's
quite<00:02:41.489> common<00:02:41.730> but<00:02:42.030> try<00:02:42.569> your<00:02:42.690> best<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.019> get

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
quite common but try your best to get

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.960 
quite common but try your best to get
rid<00:02:43.349> of<00:02:43.379> it<00:02:43.560> when<00:02:44.129> you<00:02:44.220> put<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.549> sections

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
rid of it when you put the sections

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.490 
rid of it when you put the sections
together<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.629> coordinate<00:02:45.900> your<00:02:46.319> body

together and coordinate your body
efficiently<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.489> will<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.819> decent<00:02:48.420> 1

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780

many demonstrations movies we even did a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.559 
many demonstrations movies we even did a

than a 30 mile-per-hour car crash with
modern<00:03:15.959> safety<00:03:16.200> features<00:03:16.739> so<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:17.819> does

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
modern safety features so it does

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.759 
modern safety features so it does
generate<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.510> lot<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.840> force<00:03:18.930> when<00:03:19.530> done

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
generate a lot of force when done

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.710 
generate a lot of force when done
correctly<00:03:19.919> so<00:03:20.430> that's<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.510> Bruce<00:03:21.690> Lee

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720
