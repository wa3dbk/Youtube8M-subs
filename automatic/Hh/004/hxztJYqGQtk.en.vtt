00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
glutes so I know that that's kind of the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.430 
glutes so I know that that's kind of the
last<00:00:37.140> area<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.770> go<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.780> maybe<00:00:40.200> want<00:00:40.410> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
last area to go so we just maybe want to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.590

you know those protein scoops that come
with<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.210> protein<00:04:04.660> powder<00:04:04.930> do<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.680> fill<00:04:05.890> them

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
with a protein powder do you fill them

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.630 
with a protein powder do you fill them
up<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:06.580> line<00:04:06.790> or<00:04:07.120> all<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.690> way<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.020> top

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
up to the line or all the way to the top

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.660 
up to the line or all the way to the top
well<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:09.910> that's<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.840> good<00:04:11.050> question<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.830> lot<00:04:12.610> of

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
well and that's a good question a lot of

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.940 
well and that's a good question a lot of
times<00:04:13.000> we'll<00:04:13.210> say<00:04:13.450> one<00:04:13.990> rounded<00:04:14.440> scoop<00:04:14.740> if

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
times we'll say one rounded scoop if

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.770 
times we'll say one rounded scoop if
that's<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.250> case<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.670> you<00:04:15.760> can<00:04:15.970> fill<00:04:16.570> it<00:04:16.690> a

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
that's the case and you can fill it a

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.009 
that's the case and you can fill it a
little<00:04:16.930> bit<00:04:17.109> over<00:04:18.540> otherwise<00:04:19.540> i<00:04:19.750> would<00:04:19.870> just

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
little bit over otherwise i would just

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.860 
little bit over otherwise i would just
say<00:04:20.170> it's<00:04:20.350> an<00:04:20.410> even<00:04:20.709> scoop<00:04:21.330> that<00:04:22.330> being<00:04:22.600> said

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
say it's an even scoop that being said

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.610 
say it's an even scoop that being said
if<00:04:23.290> you<00:04:23.530> overfill<00:04:24.160> it<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.610> you<00:04:24.820> are<00:04:25.440> over<00:04:26.440> by

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
if you overfill it and you are over by

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.690 
if you overfill it and you are over by
five<00:04:27.040> or<00:04:27.220> ten<00:04:27.370> calories<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:28.660> body<00:04:28.900> can<00:04:29.260> handle

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
five or ten calories the body can handle

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.620 
five or ten calories the body can handle
excess<00:04:30.700> and<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:31.060> deficit<00:04:31.600> pretty<00:04:32.500> well<00:04:32.800> so<00:04:33.630> I

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
excess and a deficit pretty well so I

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.900 
excess and a deficit pretty well so I
wouldn't<00:04:35.169> worry<00:04:35.380> about<00:04:35.440> it<00:04:35.590> so<00:04:36.340> you<00:04:36.820> know

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
wouldn't worry about it so you know

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.659 
wouldn't worry about it so you know
maybe<00:04:37.090> one<00:04:37.330> day<00:04:37.450> mix<00:04:37.690> it<00:04:37.840> up<00:04:37.900> go<00:04:38.410> crazy<00:04:38.580> fill<00:04:39.580> it

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
maybe one day mix it up go crazy fill it

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.520 
maybe one day mix it up go crazy fill it
up<00:04:39.700> you<00:04:40.330> know<00:04:40.450> they<00:04:40.600> carotid<00:04:41.020> scooping<00:04:41.410> the
