today this is part 2 of the digitech
time<00:00:14.660> bender<00:00:15.019> it<00:00:15.799> just<00:00:16.040> has<00:00:16.160> so<00:00:16.369> many<00:00:16.520> features

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
time bender it just has so many features

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.480 
time bender it just has so many features
I<00:00:17.090> had<00:00:17.570> to<00:00:17.689> make<00:00:17.810> it<00:00:17.930> a<00:00:17.990> two-parter<00:00:18.460> what<00:00:19.460> I

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
I had to make it a two-parter what I

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.120 
I had to make it a two-parter what I
want<00:00:19.700> to<00:00:19.759> show<00:00:19.910> now<00:00:20.090> is<00:00:20.560> when<00:00:21.560> you<00:00:21.710> connect<00:00:22.039> a

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
want to show now is when you connect a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.310 
want to show now is when you connect a
controller<00:00:22.279> pedal<00:00:23.029> to<00:00:23.180> this<00:00:23.330> thing<00:00:23.570> it<00:00:24.019> lets

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
controller pedal to this thing it lets

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.759 
controller pedal to this thing it lets
you<00:00:24.590> sweep<00:00:25.090> between<00:00:26.090> two<00:00:26.720> different<00:00:27.529> settings

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
you sweep between two different settings

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:29.710 
you sweep between two different settings
of<00:00:28.070> every<00:00:28.580> knob<00:00:28.759> that's<00:00:28.939> on<00:00:29.179> here<00:00:29.390> which<00:00:29.570> is

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
of every knob that's on here which is

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.019 
of every knob that's on here which is
incredibly<00:00:30.289> powerful<00:00:30.529> I<00:00:30.980> mean<00:00:31.369> some<00:00:31.609> pedals

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
incredibly powerful I mean some pedals

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.060 
incredibly powerful I mean some pedals
let<00:00:32.180> you<00:00:32.360> sweep<00:00:32.629> just<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.080> time<00:00:33.320> or<00:00:33.650> maybe<00:00:33.830> the

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
let you sweep just the time or maybe the

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.799 
let you sweep just the time or maybe the
feedback<00:00:34.250> amount<00:00:34.760> or<00:00:34.850> something<00:00:35.120> else<00:00:35.269> but

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
feedback amount or something else but

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.689 
feedback amount or something else but
this<00:00:36.019> thing<00:00:36.260> will<00:00:36.440> let<00:00:36.650> you<00:00:36.830> sweep<00:00:37.129> every

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
this thing will let you sweep every

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.030 
this thing will let you sweep every
parameter<00:00:38.059> to<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.449> different<00:00:38.870> amount<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:39.799> it's

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
parameter to a different amount and it's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.910 
parameter to a different amount and it's
very<00:00:40.339> very<00:00:40.549> powerful<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:41.690> for<00:00:42.110> example<00:00:42.559> if<00:00:42.739> I

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
very very powerful so for example if I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.740 
very very powerful so for example if I
got<00:00:43.339> the<00:00:43.489> keyboard<00:00:43.699> hooked<00:00:44.089> up<00:00:44.210> here<00:00:44.420> now<00:00:44.540> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
got the keyboard hooked up here now and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.969 
got the keyboard hooked up here now and
I<00:00:44.780> just<00:00:44.809> play<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.170> little<00:00:45.260> riff<00:00:50.470> okay<00:00:51.470> so<00:00:51.769> I<00:00:51.830> can

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
I just play a little riff okay so I can

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.299 
I just play a little riff okay so I can
do<00:00:52.070> that<00:00:52.250> but<00:00:52.909> I<00:00:52.970> could<00:00:53.210> also<00:00:54.010> change<00:00:55.010> the

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
do that but I could also change the

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.070 
do that but I could also change the
rhythm<00:00:55.460> number<00:00:56.030> of<00:00:56.089> repeats<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:56.720> here<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.049> goes

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
rhythm number of repeats so here it goes

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.490 
rhythm number of repeats so here it goes
from<00:00:57.559> low<00:00:58.040> mountain<00:00:58.369> repeats<00:01:02.110> and<00:01:03.110> now<00:01:03.260> of<00:01:03.439> a

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
from low mountain repeats and now of a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.310 
from low mountain repeats and now of a
sudden<00:01:03.799> this<00:01:03.949> is<00:01:04.100> gonna<00:01:04.280> keep<00:01:04.460> growing<00:01:05.260> as<00:01:06.260> a

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
sudden this is gonna keep growing as a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.010 
sudden this is gonna keep growing as a
volume<00:01:06.710> levels<00:01:07.010> louder<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:07.430> I'm<00:01:07.549> changing

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
volume levels louder so I'm changing

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:16.209 
volume levels louder so I'm changing
feedback<00:01:09.020> time<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:09.500> other<00:01:09.619> things<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:15.219> you

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
feedback time and other things and you

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.859 
feedback time and other things and you
could<00:01:16.369> just<00:01:16.490> do<00:01:16.640> credibly<00:01:17.210> powerful<00:01:17.689> things

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
could just do credibly powerful things

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.480 
could just do credibly powerful things
your<00:01:18.020> home<00:01:18.320> can<00:01:18.530> be<00:01:18.560> changing<00:01:19.039> a<00:01:19.070> lot<00:01:19.280> of<00:01:19.369> your

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
your home can be changing a lot of your

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.800 
your home can be changing a lot of your
feedbacks<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:20.060> changing<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.509> lot<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.630> your<00:01:20.780> time

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
feedbacks is changing a lot of your time

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.989 
feedbacks is changing a lot of your time
is<00:01:21.259> changing<00:01:21.649> while<00:01:22.070> your<00:01:22.280> modulation<00:01:22.759> is

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:22.999 
is changing while your modulation is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.249 
is changing while your modulation is
changing<00:01:23.359> away<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:23.689> patterns<00:01:24.109> are<00:01:24.229> changing

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
changing away and patterns are changing

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.520 
changing away and patterns are changing
even<00:01:25.219> your<00:01:25.729> voicings<00:01:26.210> can<00:01:26.450> change<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.049> you

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
even your voicings can change so you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.929 
even your voicings can change so you
could<00:01:27.679> be<00:01:27.770> doing<00:01:28.009> different<00:01:28.369> chordal<00:01:28.700> things

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
could be doing different chordal things

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.539 
could be doing different chordal things
as<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:29.210> move<00:01:29.390> through<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.719> pedal<00:01:30.369> so<00:01:31.369> what<00:01:31.490> I

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
as you move through the pedal so what I

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.340 
as you move through the pedal so what I
want<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.759> show<00:01:31.909> you<00:01:31.969> here<00:01:32.390> this<00:01:33.020> is<00:01:33.079> this

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
want to show you here this is this

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.709 
want to show you here this is this
parameter<00:01:34.159> they<00:01:34.310> call<00:01:34.490> envelope<00:01:35.119> which

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
parameter they call envelope which

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.499 
parameter they call envelope which
instead<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.710> giving<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.159> multiple<00:01:37.789> repeats

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
instead of giving you multiple repeats

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.149 
instead of giving you multiple repeats
it's<00:01:38.840> more<00:01:39.229> of<00:01:41.409> almost<00:01:42.409> like<00:01:42.590> chops<00:01:42.920> your

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
it's more of almost like chops your

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.200 
it's more of almost like chops your
sound<00:01:43.460> up<00:01:43.640> into<00:01:43.999> rhythmic<00:01:44.390> patterns<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:46.179> so<00:01:47.179> I

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
sound up into rhythmic patterns and so I

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.940 
sound up into rhythmic patterns and so I
have<00:01:47.450> one<00:01:47.689> set<00:01:47.960> here<00:01:47.990> I'm<00:01:48.319> going<00:01:48.409> to<00:01:48.499> use<00:01:48.560> a

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
have one set here I'm going to use a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.330 
have one set here I'm going to use a
little<00:01:49.310> memory<00:01:49.490> I've<00:01:49.789> set<00:01:49.999> one<00:01:50.149> up<00:01:50.270> in<00:01:50.420> advance

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
little memory I've set one up in advance

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.209 
little memory I've set one up in advance
and<00:01:53.109> so<00:01:54.109> if<00:01:54.170> this<00:01:54.259> works<00:01:54.499> out<00:01:54.679> right<00:01:54.859> I<00:01:55.069> should

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
and so if this works out right I should

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.459 
and so if this works out right I should
be<00:01:55.310> able<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:55.549> just<00:01:55.700> hit<00:01:55.819> this<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:57.200> play

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
be able to just hit this and so play

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.029 
be able to just hit this and so play
just<00:01:58.429> played<00:01:58.670> organ<00:01:59.030> sound<00:01:59.590> but<00:02:00.590> now<00:02:00.740> if<00:02:00.829> I<00:02:00.920> hit

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
just played organ sound but now if I hit

00:02:01.039 --> 00:03:02.710 
just played organ sound but now if I hit
this<00:02:01.159> pedal<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:01.639> get<00:02:01.789> this

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:04:20.729 

now

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:31.600 

hey<00:04:21.739> what<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.370> watch<00:04:22.610> again<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.980> repeats<00:04:31.340> keep

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
hey what to watch again the repeats keep

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.450 
hey what to watch again the repeats keep
going<00:04:31.970> infinite<00:04:32.630> kindness<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:34.100> doesn't

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
going infinite kindness and it doesn't

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.030 
going infinite kindness and it doesn't
get<00:04:34.580> out<00:04:34.610> of<00:04:34.730> control<00:04:35.410> it's<00:04:36.410> definitely<00:04:36.890> very

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
get out of control it's definitely very
