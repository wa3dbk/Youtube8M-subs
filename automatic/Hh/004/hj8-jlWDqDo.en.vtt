and<00:03:14.430> painted<00:03:14.490> head<00:03:15.380> myci<00:03:16.380> painted<00:03:16.770> eye

and painted head myci painted eye

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.340 
and painted head myci painted eye
they're<00:03:17.390> really<00:03:18.390> nice<00:03:18.540> sculpting<00:03:18.960> going<00:03:18.990> all

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
they're really nice sculpting going all

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.600 
they're really nice sculpting going all
the<00:03:19.470> way<00:03:19.530> across<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.010> body<00:03:20.220> we've<00:03:20.400> got<00:03:20.520> these

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
the way across the body we've got these

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.430 
the way across the body we've got these
nice<00:03:20.790> scales<00:03:21.240> going<00:03:21.600> on<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.900> feel<00:03:22.110> little

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
nice scales going on that feel little

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.890 
nice scales going on that feel little
true<00:03:22.740> to<00:03:22.950> what<00:03:23.070> we<00:03:23.100> see<00:03:23.340> on<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:24.210> adult<00:03:24.630> version

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
true to what we see on the adult version

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.240 
true to what we see on the adult version
you<00:03:25.260> can<00:03:25.410> see<00:03:25.530> there's<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.740> nice<00:03:25.890> sculpted

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
you can see there's a nice sculpted

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.030 
you can see there's a nice sculpted
musculature<00:03:26.790> in<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.180> legs<00:03:27.420> they're<00:03:28.010> really<00:03:29.010> a

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
musculature in the legs they're really a

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.920 
musculature in the legs they're really a
nice<00:03:29.190> miniature<00:03:29.670> version<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.210> this

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
nice miniature version of this

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.920 
nice miniature version of this
Spinosaurus<00:03:31.800> so<00:03:32.550> here<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.420> adult

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
Spinosaurus so here is the adult

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.890 
Spinosaurus so here is the adult
Brachiosaurus<00:03:34.740> next<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.460> his<00:03:35.820> miniature<00:03:36.300> Papo

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
Brachiosaurus next to his miniature Papo

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.660 
Brachiosaurus next to his miniature Papo
counterpart<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.160> think<00:03:38.400> these<00:03:38.490> look

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
counterpart and I think these look

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.760 
counterpart and I think these look
really<00:03:39.000> nice<00:03:39.270> next<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.780> each<00:03:39.960> other<00:03:40.140> one<00:03:40.680> of

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
really nice next to each other one of

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.110 
really nice next to each other one of
the<00:03:40.830> things<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:41.100> really<00:03:41.460> stands<00:03:41.760> out<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.090> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
the things that really stands out is the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.690 
the things that really stands out is the
fact<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.600> adult<00:03:43.080> here<00:03:43.320> is<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.740> wrinkly

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
fact that the adult here is so wrinkly

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.400 
fact that the adult here is so wrinkly
compared<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.600> child<00:03:45.900> but<00:03:46.050> that's<00:03:46.140> what

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
compared to the child but that's what

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.740 
compared to the child but that's what
you'd<00:03:46.620> expect<00:03:46.770> you'd<00:03:47.700> expect<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.240> juvenile

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
you'd expect you'd expect the juvenile

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.510 
you'd expect you'd expect the juvenile
Brachiosaurus<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.620> be<00:03:49.740> nice<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.160> smooth

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
Brachiosaurus to be nice and smooth

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.730 
Brachiosaurus to be nice and smooth
almost<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.300> a<00:03:51.330> baby<00:03:51.600> elephant<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.230> then<00:03:52.620> the

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
almost like a baby elephant and then the

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.800 
almost like a baby elephant and then the
adult<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.220> be<00:03:53.340> worn<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.030> wrinkled<00:03:54.540> and

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
adult to be worn and wrinkled and

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.690 
adult to be worn and wrinkled and
they've<00:03:55.110> really<00:03:55.470> done<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:55.680> well<00:03:56.040> here<00:03:56.460> also

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
they've really done that well here also

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.270 
they've really done that well here also
the<00:03:57.030> colour<00:03:57.330> match<00:03:57.660> is<00:03:57.930> very<00:03:57.990> very<00:03:58.770> good<00:03:59.040> for

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
the colour match is very very good for

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.130 
the colour match is very very good for
these<00:03:59.400> two<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.510> only<00:04:00.690> thing<00:04:00.840> I'd<00:04:00.960> say<00:04:01.110> is

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
these two the only thing I'd say is

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.440 
these two the only thing I'd say is
maybe<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.650> toe<00:04:02.430> claws<00:04:02.730> or<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.030> different

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
maybe the toe claws or a different

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.150 
maybe the toe claws or a different
colour<00:04:03.660> but<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.290> might<00:04:04.470> happen<00:04:04.680> over<00:04:05.130> time

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
colour but that might happen over time

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.280 
colour but that might happen over time
the<00:04:05.640> toe<00:04:05.790> claws<00:04:06.060> my<00:04:06.270> age<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.840> weather<00:04:07.050> and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
the toe claws my age and weather and

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.470 
the toe claws my age and weather and
change<00:04:07.560> colour<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.430> can<00:04:08.760> accept<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.240> and<00:04:09.360> I

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
change colour so I can accept that and I

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.690 
change colour so I can accept that and I
think<00:04:09.540> these<00:04:09.810> two<00:04:09.870> look<00:04:10.500> really<00:04:10.950> nice<00:04:11.130> next<00:04:11.370> to

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
think these two look really nice next to

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.220 
think these two look really nice next to
each<00:04:11.790> other<00:04:12.000> in<00:04:12.180> terms<00:04:12.330> of<00:04:12.480> their<00:04:12.600> posing<00:04:13.080> and

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
each other in terms of their posing and

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.090 
each other in terms of their posing and
their<00:04:13.830> scale<00:04:14.130> here's<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.880> adult<00:04:15.390> Papa

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
their scale here's the adult Papa

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.920 
their scale here's the adult Papa
Triceratops<00:04:17.100> with<00:04:17.430> its<00:04:17.760> miniature<00:04:18.359> version

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
Triceratops with its miniature version

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.510 
Triceratops with its miniature version
now<00:04:19.260> we<00:04:19.320> haven't<00:04:19.680> had<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:19.830> hatchling<00:04:20.040> of<00:04:20.370> the

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
now we haven't had a hatchling of the

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.640 
now we haven't had a hatchling of the
Triceratops<00:04:21.270> oh<00:04:21.420> this<00:04:21.570> feels<00:04:21.750> absolutely

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
Triceratops oh this feels absolutely

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.500 
Triceratops oh this feels absolutely
natural<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.400> this<00:04:23.729> feels<00:04:23.940> like<00:04:24.060> us<00:04:24.270> much<00:04:24.479> more

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
natural and this feels like us much more

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.840 
natural and this feels like us much more
stockier<00:04:25.140> version<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:26.130> more<00:04:26.310> baby<00:04:26.550> like

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
stockier version and a more baby like

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.470 
stockier version and a more baby like
version

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
version

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.150 
version
this<00:04:27.690> Triceratops<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:28.890> think<00:04:29.070> this

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
this Triceratops and I think this

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.010 
this Triceratops and I think this
complements<00:04:29.760> this<00:04:29.880> adult<00:04:30.270> version<00:04:30.630> really

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
complements this adult version really

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.780 
complements this adult version really
nicely<00:04:31.590> if<00:04:31.740> I<00:04:31.830> put<00:04:32.010> these<00:04:32.130> two<00:04:32.280> next<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.670> each

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
nicely if I put these two next to each

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.700 
nicely if I put these two next to each
other<00:04:32.910> they<00:04:33.420> just<00:04:33.690> look<00:04:33.840> like<00:04:34.050> an<00:04:34.260> adult<00:04:34.410> and

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
other they just look like an adult and

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.590 
other they just look like an adult and
baby<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.310> that's<00:04:35.430> great<00:04:35.910> that's<00:04:36.150> just<00:04:36.270> what<00:04:36.570> I

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
baby and that's great that's just what I

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.260 
baby and that's great that's just what I
want<00:04:36.870> so<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.830> looks<00:04:38.070> really<00:04:38.160> great<00:04:38.790> on<00:04:38.940> the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
want so that looks really great on the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.570 
want so that looks really great on the
shelf<00:04:39.630> next<00:04:39.900> up<00:04:40.530> here's<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.040> adult

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
shelf next up here's the adult

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.440 
shelf next up here's the adult
stegasaurus<00:04:42.330> next<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.410> its<00:04:43.650> miniature

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
stegasaurus next to its miniature

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
stegasaurus next to its miniature
counterpart<00:04:45.450> and<00:04:45.600> again<00:04:45.840> we<00:04:45.990> haven't<00:04:46.170> had<00:04:46.440> a

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
counterpart and again we haven't had a

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.590 
counterpart and again we haven't had a
Stegosaurus<00:04:47.160> hatchling<00:04:47.610> yet<00:04:47.790> and<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.360> think

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
Stegosaurus hatchling yet and I think

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.360 
Stegosaurus hatchling yet and I think
this<00:04:48.750> really<00:04:49.260> does<00:04:49.500> look<00:04:49.740> like<00:04:49.800> a<00:04:50.040> baby

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
this really does look like a baby

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.180 
this really does look like a baby
version<00:04:50.910> of<00:04:51.030> this<00:04:51.840> Stegosaurus<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.920> colors

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
version of this Stegosaurus the colors

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.040 
version of this Stegosaurus the colors
are<00:04:53.310> a<00:04:53.340> little<00:04:53.430> bit<00:04:53.820> more<00:04:54.240> sort<00:04:54.480> of<00:04:54.510> saturated

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
are a little bit more sort of saturated

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.750 
are a little bit more sort of saturated
on<00:04:55.380> this<00:04:55.590> baby<00:04:55.830> but<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.190> think<00:04:56.430> that<00:04:56.550> works

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
on this baby but I think that works

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.460 
on this baby but I think that works
really<00:04:57.090> well<00:04:57.360> because<00:04:57.600> you'd<00:04:57.900> expect<00:04:58.290> it<00:04:58.440> to

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
really well because you'd expect it to

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.410 
really well because you'd expect it to
be<00:04:58.560> all<00:04:59.040> sort<00:04:59.280> of<00:04:59.310> new<00:04:59.580> fresh<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.270> colorful

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
be all sort of new fresh and colorful

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.300 
be all sort of new fresh and colorful
and<00:05:00.750> then<00:05:00.840> as<00:05:00.960> time<00:05:00.990> goes<00:05:01.380> on<00:05:01.530> as<00:05:01.740> it<00:05:02.130> gets

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
and then as time goes on as it gets

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.190 
and then as time goes on as it gets
older<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.880> kind<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.210> become<00:05:03.480> more<00:05:03.660> worn<00:05:03.990> and

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
older it kind of become more worn and

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.530 
older it kind of become more worn and
weathered<00:05:04.550> so<00:05:05.550> I<00:05:05.580> buy<00:05:05.910> that<00:05:06.150> there<00:05:06.360> would<00:05:06.510> be

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
weathered so I buy that there would be

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.870 
weathered so I buy that there would be
some<00:05:07.200> color<00:05:07.500> variation<00:05:07.590> between<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.490> adult

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
some color variation between the adult

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.910 
some color variation between the adult
and<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.090> juvenile<00:05:10.080> but<00:05:10.200> I<00:05:10.260> just<00:05:10.500> think<00:05:10.650> these

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
and the juvenile but I just think these

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.500 
and the juvenile but I just think these
really<00:05:11.310> complement<00:05:11.790> each<00:05:11.820> other<00:05:12.030> both<00:05:12.210> in<00:05:12.360> the

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
really complement each other both in the

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.230 
really complement each other both in the
pose<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:13.080> also<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:14.130> distinctiveness<00:05:14.820> in<00:05:15.150> the

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
pose and also the distinctiveness in the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.960 
pose and also the distinctiveness in the
coloration<00:05:15.930> of<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.680> eyes<00:05:16.920> for<00:05:17.340> example<00:05:17.430> and

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
coloration of the eyes for example and

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.270 
coloration of the eyes for example and
also<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.570> green<00:05:18.990> going<00:05:19.470> along<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.860> back<00:05:20.070> I

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
also the green going along the back I

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.160 
also the green going along the back I
think<00:05:20.460> that<00:05:20.580> really<00:05:20.820> works<00:05:21.120> well<00:05:21.420> next<00:05:22.020> up

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
think that really works well next up

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.830 
think that really works well next up
here's<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.650> adult<00:05:23.210> Velociraptor<00:05:24.210> with<00:05:24.570> its

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
here's the adult Velociraptor with its

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.450 
here's the adult Velociraptor with its
baby<00:05:25.170> hatchling<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:25.920> this<00:05:26.010> is<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.250> brown

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
baby hatchling and this is the brown

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.940 
baby hatchling and this is the brown
variation<00:05:27.120> of<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.600> Velociraptor<00:05:28.380> which<00:05:28.830> is

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
variation of the Velociraptor which is

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.890 
variation of the Velociraptor which is
actually<00:05:29.250> more<00:05:29.430> scarce<00:05:29.760> to<00:05:29.970> find<00:05:30.240> now<00:05:30.420> but

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
actually more scarce to find now but

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.810 
actually more scarce to find now but
this<00:05:31.080> really<00:05:31.440> complements<00:05:32.220> this<00:05:32.340> miniature

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
this really complements this miniature

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.390 
this really complements this miniature
version<00:05:33.360> of<00:05:33.540> this<00:05:34.050> but<00:05:34.320> also<00:05:34.470> Raptor<00:05:35.040> I<00:05:35.070> think

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
version of this but also Raptor I think

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.610 
version of this but also Raptor I think
the<00:05:35.520> reddish<00:05:35.910> brown<00:05:36.420> stripe<00:05:36.870> along<00:05:37.200> its<00:05:37.380> back

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
the reddish brown stripe along its back

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.220 
the reddish brown stripe along its back
really<00:05:37.980> suits<00:05:38.370> this<00:05:38.610> adult<00:05:39.330> counterpart<00:05:40.110> and

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
really suits this adult counterpart and

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.600 
really suits this adult counterpart and
that<00:05:40.350> really<00:05:40.560> does<00:05:40.800> look<00:05:40.830> like<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.250> genuine

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
that really does look like a genuine

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.820 
that really does look like a genuine
hatchling<00:05:42.240> of<00:05:42.420> this<00:05:42.990> we'll<00:05:43.170> also<00:05:43.320> wrap<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.800> the

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
hatchling of this we'll also wrap to the

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.400 
hatchling of this we'll also wrap to the
head<00:05:44.160> sculpt<00:05:44.610> is<00:05:44.940> very<00:05:45.240> distinct<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:46.200> very

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
head sculpt is very distinct and very

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.650 
head sculpt is very distinct and very
similar<00:05:46.680> to<00:05:46.830> its<00:05:47.160> adult<00:05:47.550> version<00:05:47.940> so<00:05:48.180> I<00:05:48.390> think

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
similar to its adult version so I think

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.750 
similar to its adult version so I think
these<00:05:48.960> two<00:05:49.020> look<00:05:49.560> really<00:05:49.920> good<00:05:50.100> on<00:05:50.280> display

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
these two look really good on display

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.670 
these two look really good on display
next<00:05:51.060> to<00:05:51.150> each<00:05:51.270> other<00:05:51.420> and<00:05:51.750> here<00:05:52.020> is<00:05:52.140> the<00:05:52.260> adult

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
next to each other and here is the adult

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.550 
next to each other and here is the adult
green<00:05:53.070> Papo<00:05:53.700> rex<00:05:54.030> with<00:05:54.660> its<00:05:54.960> miniature

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
green Papo rex with its miniature

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.920 
green Papo rex with its miniature
version<00:05:56.130> now<00:05:56.550> this<00:05:56.880> feels<00:05:57.150> much<00:05:57.420> more<00:05:57.690> like<00:05:57.750> a

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
version now this feels much more like a

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.170 
version now this feels much more like a
miniaturized<00:05:58.350> adult<00:05:59.280> but<00:05:59.730> I<00:05:59.760> feel<00:06:00.000> like

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
miniaturized adult but I feel like

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.610 
miniaturized adult but I feel like
that's<00:06:00.420> the<00:06:00.600> right<00:06:00.810> thing<00:06:01.080> to<00:06:01.260> do<00:06:01.380> because

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
that's the right thing to do because

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.860 
that's the right thing to do because
we've<00:06:01.980> already<00:06:02.190> had<00:06:02.610> a<00:06:02.640> t-rex<00:06:03.120> hatchling<00:06:03.420> as<00:06:03.810> a

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
we've already had a t-rex hatchling as a

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.350 
we've already had a t-rex hatchling as a
figure<00:06:04.440> of<00:06:04.530> its<00:06:04.680> own<00:06:04.980> so<00:06:05.520> it<00:06:05.550> feels<00:06:05.850> only<00:06:06.090> right

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
figure of its own so it feels only right

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.780 
figure of its own so it feels only right
that<00:06:06.540> they<00:06:06.660> do<00:06:06.720> a<00:06:06.870> miniature<00:06:07.410> adult<00:06:08.100> so<00:06:08.640> in

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
that they do a miniature adult so in

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.000 
that they do a miniature adult so in
this<00:06:08.970> case<00:06:09.240> these<00:06:09.720> two<00:06:09.780> are<00:06:10.440> just<00:06:10.770> sort<00:06:10.950> of

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
this case these two are just sort of

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.460 
this case these two are just sort of
varying<00:06:11.490> scales<00:06:11.850> of<00:06:12.120> the<00:06:12.420> same<00:06:12.660> dinosaur<00:06:13.320> and

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
varying scales of the same dinosaur and

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.690 
varying scales of the same dinosaur and
I<00:06:13.500> think<00:06:13.710> actually<00:06:13.860> they've<00:06:14.190> done<00:06:14.370> a<00:06:14.400> fairly

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
I think actually they've done a fairly

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.920 
I think actually they've done a fairly
good<00:06:14.790> job<00:06:14.970> with<00:06:15.630> that

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
good job with that

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.740 
good job with that
next<00:06:16.620> up<00:06:16.800> here's<00:06:17.130> the<00:06:17.280> adult<00:06:17.850> Spinosaurus

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
next up here's the adult Spinosaurus

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.500 
next up here's the adult Spinosaurus
next<00:06:19.110> to<00:06:19.260> it<00:06:19.500> miniature<00:06:20.280> version<00:06:20.820> and<00:06:21.150> I<00:06:21.240> think

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
next to it miniature version and I think

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.360 
next to it miniature version and I think
these<00:06:21.660> two<00:06:21.720> actually<00:06:22.470> really<00:06:22.830> complement

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
these two actually really complement

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.680 
these two actually really complement
each<00:06:23.460> other<00:06:23.670> I<00:06:23.730> was<00:06:23.910> a<00:06:23.970> little<00:06:24.210> bit<00:06:24.300> concerned

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
each other I was a little bit concerned

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.780 
each other I was a little bit concerned
about<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:24.960> purpley<00:06:25.440> blueness<00:06:25.890> of<00:06:26.040> this

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
about the purpley blueness of this

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.240 
about the purpley blueness of this
Spinosaurus<00:06:27.600> miniature<00:06:28.110> but<00:06:28.500> actually<00:06:28.980> it

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
Spinosaurus miniature but actually it

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.920 
Spinosaurus miniature but actually it
really<00:06:29.640> complements<00:06:30.120> the<00:06:30.300> adult<00:06:30.570> in<00:06:30.690> a<00:06:30.780> way

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
really complements the adult in a way

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.570 
really complements the adult in a way
that<00:06:31.140> it<00:06:31.230> looks<00:06:31.260> like<00:06:31.620> it's<00:06:31.890> just<00:06:31.950> freshly

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
that it looks like it's just freshly

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.850 
that it looks like it's just freshly
hatched<00:06:32.940> out<00:06:33.270> of<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.510> egg<00:06:33.660> and<00:06:34.110> I<00:06:34.410> think<00:06:34.680> in

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
hatched out of the egg and I think in

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.950 
hatched out of the egg and I think in
terms<00:06:35.070> of<00:06:35.280> the<00:06:35.370> sculpt<00:06:35.850> these<00:06:36.150> two<00:06:36.360> complement

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
terms of the sculpt these two complement

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.600 
terms of the sculpt these two complement
each<00:06:37.020> other<00:06:37.290> I<00:06:37.470> don't<00:06:37.740> mind<00:06:37.950> the<00:06:38.100> tail<00:06:38.370> being

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
each other I don't mind the tail being

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.770 
each other I don't mind the tail being
down<00:06:39.000> on<00:06:39.030> this<00:06:39.360> baby

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
down on this baby

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.239 
down on this baby
Spinosaurus<00:06:40.470> because

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249 
Spinosaurus because

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.129 
Spinosaurus because
it<00:06:41.489> might<00:06:41.729> behave<00:06:41.999> in<00:06:42.209> a<00:06:42.299> different<00:06:42.689> way<00:06:42.899> when

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
it might behave in a different way when

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.199 
it might behave in a different way when
it's<00:06:43.289> a<00:06:43.409> hatchling<00:06:43.619> but<00:06:44.339> they<00:06:44.459> really<00:06:44.789> do<00:06:44.909> look

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:45.209 
it's a hatchling but they really do look

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:47.509 
it's a hatchling but they really do look
like<00:06:45.419> you<00:06:45.839> know<00:06:45.959> an<00:06:46.139> adult<00:06:46.529> and<00:06:46.679> juvenile

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:47.519 
like you know an adult and juvenile

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:50.419

spinosaurus on display so just how big
are<00:06:50.609> these<00:06:50.849> minifigures<00:06:51.419> if<00:06:51.539> I<00:06:51.629> take<00:06:51.869> these

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:51.989 
are these minifigures if I take these

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:53.929

Stegosaurus which saw an average size of
all<00:06:54.029> the<00:06:54.149> others<00:06:54.419> you<00:06:54.779> can<00:06:54.929> see<00:06:55.049> that<00:06:55.169> he's

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
all the others you can see that he's

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.199 
all the others you can see that he's
about<00:06:55.469> three<00:06:55.859> inches<00:06:56.369> long<00:06:56.699> which<00:06:56.909> is<00:06:56.939> about

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:57.209 
about three inches long which is about

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:59.209 
about three inches long which is about
seven<00:06:57.599> and<00:06:57.659> a<00:06:57.749> half<00:06:57.809> centimeters<00:06:58.289> and<00:06:59.099> in

00:06:59.209 --> 00:06:59.219 
seven and a half centimeters and in

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:00.559 
seven and a half centimeters and in
terms<00:06:59.459> of<00:06:59.579> its<00:06:59.699> height<00:06:59.909> you're<00:07:00.179> looking<00:07:00.449> at

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:00.569 
terms of its height you're looking at

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:02.059 
terms of its height you're looking at
just<00:07:00.779> under<00:07:00.959> two<00:07:01.319> inches<00:07:01.349> which<00:07:01.799> is<00:07:01.829> about

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:02.069 
just under two inches which is about

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:04.009 
just under two inches which is about
four<00:07:02.339> and<00:07:02.429> a<00:07:02.489> half<00:07:02.669> centimeters<00:07:03.059> obviously

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:04.019 
four and a half centimeters obviously

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:06.349 
four and a half centimeters obviously
the<00:07:04.169> size<00:07:04.319> is<00:07:04.529> very<00:07:05.149> Brachiosaurus<00:07:06.149> being

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:06.359 
the size is very Brachiosaurus being

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:08.299 
the size is very Brachiosaurus being
much<00:07:06.539> taller<00:07:06.899> and<00:07:07.199> they've<00:07:07.619> also<00:07:07.799> wrapped<00:07:08.159> to

00:07:08.299 --> 00:07:08.309 
much taller and they've also wrapped to

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:09.919 
much taller and they've also wrapped to
being<00:07:08.489> much<00:07:08.669> more<00:07:08.849> slender<00:07:09.179> but<00:07:09.689> it<00:07:09.809> just

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:09.929 
being much more slender but it just

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.689 
being much more slender but it just
gives<00:07:10.109> you<00:07:10.199> an<00:07:10.319> idea<00:07:10.469> of<00:07:10.739> the<00:07:10.829> average<00:07:11.159> size<00:07:11.399> of

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 
gives you an idea of the average size of

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:13.369 
gives you an idea of the average size of
these<00:07:11.939> figures<00:07:12.299> so<00:07:12.809> there<00:07:12.959> we<00:07:13.049> have<00:07:13.199> it<00:07:13.229> guys

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:13.379 
these figures so there we have it guys

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:15.799 
these figures so there we have it guys
that<00:07:13.739> was<00:07:13.860> today's<00:07:14.219> look<00:07:14.459> at<00:07:14.610> the<00:07:14.729> Papo<00:07:15.239> minis

00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:15.809 
that was today's look at the Papo minis

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:17.359 
that was today's look at the Papo minis
tub<00:07:16.169> I<00:07:16.319> think<00:07:16.499> these<00:07:16.619> are<00:07:16.679> really<00:07:17.159> highly

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:17.369 
tub I think these are really highly

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:20.029 
tub I think these are really highly
detailed<00:07:17.699> figures<00:07:18.389> really<00:07:19.169> complement<00:07:19.860> their

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 
detailed figures really complement their

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.219 
detailed figures really complement their
adult<00:07:20.459> counterparts<00:07:21.019> obviously<00:07:22.019> with<00:07:22.169> the

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:22.229 
adult counterparts obviously with the

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:23.899 
adult counterparts obviously with the
Tyrannosaurus<00:07:22.829> Rex<00:07:23.129> we<00:07:23.279> are<00:07:23.429> getting<00:07:23.729> a

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:23.909 
Tyrannosaurus Rex we are getting a

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:25.789 
Tyrannosaurus Rex we are getting a
miniature<00:07:24.449> adult<00:07:24.839> not<00:07:25.110> a<00:07:25.139> hatchling<00:07:25.379> because

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:25.799 
miniature adult not a hatchling because

00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:27.499 
miniature adult not a hatchling because
we've<00:07:25.919> had<00:07:26.099> a<00:07:26.159> hatchling<00:07:26.399> as<00:07:26.729> a<00:07:26.759> figure

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:27.509 
we've had a hatchling as a figure

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:30.109 
we've had a hatchling as a figure
already<00:07:27.719> but<00:07:28.199> all<00:07:28.349> the<00:07:28.559> rest<00:07:28.919> work<00:07:29.669> really

00:07:30.109 --> 00:07:30.119 
already but all the rest work really

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:32.419 
already but all the rest work really
nicely<00:07:30.509> as<00:07:30.839> baby<00:07:31.229> versions<00:07:31.829> of<00:07:31.979> their<00:07:32.219> adult

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:32.429 
nicely as baby versions of their adult

00:07:32.429 --> 00:07:34.579
