pounds i also bought a case from ebay
it's<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> generic<00:00:44.100> plastic<00:00:44.730> case<00:00:44.910> which

it's just a generic plastic case which
are<00:00:45.510> paid<00:00:45.690> seven<00:00:46.140> pounds<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:46.710> let's<00:00:47.670> take<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
are paid seven pounds for let's take a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.330 
are paid seven pounds for let's take a
look<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.379> which<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.530> quite<00:00:49.680> remarkable<00:00:49.890> when

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
look at which is quite remarkable when

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.799 
look at which is quite remarkable when
you<00:00:50.370> consider<00:00:50.460> you're<00:00:50.910> getting<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.690> they

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you consider you're getting what they

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.209 
you consider you're getting what they
say<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.230> six<00:00:52.410> times<00:00:52.469> improvement<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
say is it six times improvement on the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.330 
say is it six times improvement on the
speed<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:55.020> yet<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.260> pay<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> same<00:00:55.710> price<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
speed and yet you pay the same price and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.470 
speed and yet you pay the same price and
it's<00:00:56.730> about<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> same<00:00:57.210> power<00:00:57.960> usage<00:00:59.480> don't

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
it's about the same power usage don't

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.090 
it's about the same power usage don't
think<00:01:00.660> many<00:01:00.750> Intel<00:01:01.199> computers<00:01:01.680> could<00:01:01.890> boast

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
think many Intel computers could boast

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
think many Intel computers could boast
the<00:01:02.219> same<00:01:02.489> improvement<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> specs<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the same improvement on the specs for a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.260 
the same improvement on the specs for a
generation<00:01:04.530> change

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:18.330 

alright<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:17.259> here<00:01:17.439> it<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.560> in<00:01:17.860> exactly<00:01:18.220> the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
alright so here it is in exactly the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.670 
alright so here it is in exactly the
same<00:01:18.369> size<00:01:18.700> as<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:18.970> was<00:01:19.090> before<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:20.380> let's<00:01:20.530> take

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
same size as it was before so let's take

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.889 
same size as it was before so let's take
a<00:01:20.740> look<00:01:20.860> what<00:01:21.009> you<00:01:21.100> have<00:01:21.130> on<00:01:21.340> here<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.720> I've<00:01:22.780> got

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
a look what you have on here so I've got

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.450 
a look what you have on here so I've got
four<00:01:23.079> USB<00:01:23.320> ports<00:01:23.470> for<00:01:24.159> usb2<00:01:24.670> ports<00:01:25.830> 10<00:01:26.830> 100

mega<00:01:27.670> fernet<00:01:28.240> shame<00:01:29.049> it's<00:01:29.200> not<00:01:29.289> geek<00:01:29.439> bit

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
mega fernet shame it's not geek bit

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.419 
mega fernet shame it's not geek bit
would<00:01:30.070> have<00:01:30.100> liked<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.460> have<00:01:30.520> seen<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:32.429> gpio

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
would have liked to have seen that gpio

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.580 
would have liked to have seen that gpio
bus<00:01:33.759> is<00:01:34.060> significantly<00:01:34.960> larger<00:01:35.110> than<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.470> was

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
bus is significantly larger than it was

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.690 
bus is significantly larger than it was
before<00:01:36.060> here's<00:01:37.060> an<00:01:37.149> old<00:01:37.240> model<00:01:38.049> beep<00:01:38.320> I

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700

first-generation<00:01:39.700> pi<00:01:40.350> see<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.470> size

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
first-generation pi see the size

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.100 
first-generation pi see the size
difference<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:43.659> a<00:01:43.720> little<00:01:43.929> bit<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.929> there

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
difference just a little bit and there

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
difference just a little bit and there
is<00:01:47.289> a<00:01:47.439> I<00:01:47.799> think<00:01:48.189> it's<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.459> touch<00:01:48.939> screen<00:01:49.149> output

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
