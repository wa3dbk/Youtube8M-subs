00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.070
 here 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.270
 sail 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.409
 v 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:11.769
 vincent 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.769
 here 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.550
 Courroye 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.220
 to meet me 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.540
 I'm listening 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.540
 the wall 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 according to the tides 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.480
 last year I've always been 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.600
 refinancing 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.350
 a first since this year 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.350
 in the reserve team 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.870
 the foot hours 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.320
 I do not read them next door we heard minor noises in this 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.950
 room 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.010
 with my brother we came 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.280
 see and we are too many 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.690
 I will love you 17th essence 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.590
 favorite on a coquetry 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 I stayed to do the same 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.080
 it's loving family 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.080
 justified 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.410
 the game itself 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.030
 not everywhere for you 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.130
 all infected 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.450
 very little known 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.440
 necessarily a player 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.019
 his share his pasty voice 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.599
 the former hockey player is daddy you like it's useless 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.539
 to slice 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.069
 when we do not necessarily start Fatah 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.279
 and then 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.149
 we start we must think 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.149
 not too bad weathered 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.739
 this pollution 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.379
 as for others 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.299
 on a professional side 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.849
 will I play somewhere else but surely 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.849
 even though I was on the sidelines not the road 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.749
 at the level of studies I'm lucky to have 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.369
 rather expected 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:19.669
 he absolutely wanted this victory 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.609
 the eye at night the children 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.609
 sometimes finish at 23 hours local denver on the parking 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.529
 chance to do a job 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.529
 that allows me to hurt 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.729
 I am for but I saw 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.649
 why not the weekend 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.689
 so it seems to me to train and play on weekends 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.689
 and if she and have it passed 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.249
 jealousy salah 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.389
 three-four years that I showed myself that the first ten 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.090
 integration this effect a little while 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.090
 by dint of training 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.800
 while all his friends 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.800
 to throw it 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.979
 the atmosphere remains good 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.150
 we laugh a lot more picky about the little details at their time 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.469
 It is exactly 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:14.589
 details that make the difference on a match 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:17.589
 something suspicious 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.569
 here we go 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.969
 there is a very very good 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.969
 the game of his word 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:28.990
 then 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.650
 we see dawn under the nose 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.240
 the pocatiere 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.680
 then the only two players in the game 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.129
 fence 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.569
 and then a permanence 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.569
 that's 40 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:47.659
 to protect us from bullets 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:50.439
 and of course 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:52.830
 hockey stick 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.830
 the field hockey reward 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.210
 we think we know player 

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:31.059
 we will not look to you 

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:39.489
 and some issues
