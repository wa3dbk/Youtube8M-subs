00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.400
 tell you about useful commands 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.930
 only works in 172 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:32.780
 no more version 1 useful command 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.660
 it is now i'm gonna knock slow 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.489
 quality time 360 â€‹â€‹more accurate video quality 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.940
 360 myself 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.640
 someone when we walked the team will 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:52.250
 written to you is given one 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.250
 beneficial use 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:04.159
 you can specify coordinates 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:07.500
 but you can simply not specified only one 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.500
 only one number does not need to enter all 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.560
 no more will go away by itself and then 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.560
 the number and for example we will both see 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:28.920
 we write in the chat that the object is successful 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:30.720
 summoned and zombie attacks a gun it 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.210
 deleted from previous versions 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.850
 minecraft look at it now and how 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.280
 better not to approach the book close yes 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.119
 because with one blow he will kill but he 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.610
 too stupid 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.590
 if you get close to him he is already 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.570
 you are more like caterpillars you 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.570
 the lesson here is this this giant canadian 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.600
 roll it up 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.959
 lift up 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.830
 ok i think it's not so interesting 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.830
 now be the most interesting i'm right 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:32.540
 that still wanted to see it visibly 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.540
 down 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:50.230
 everything 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:58.209
 work there but I can encourage 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:03:03.489
 I explode just write TNT 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:10.290
 so he writes for you just 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:14.290
 write more connectivity 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.299
 okay, it's all the same and I'm also here 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.030
 I did not find a little that I could 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.720
 summon even ender dragon and crystal 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.239
 ender 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:30.299
 it's bad at all first I will call 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:32.379
 crystal but also very dangerous zambon 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.780
 write and press 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:39.970
 you appended stuck you remove 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:45.449
 isolation do it any therefore 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.449
 it is necessary to kill only the servant's Ender 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:31.690
 completion 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:31.690
 Ender the dragon this he meets and I 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.050
 I will help 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:22.060
 and I think on this we will end with you 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:27.360
 chris dragons &amp; dragons we didn't develop 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.360
