00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 how the seveso system works 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 indispensable to prevent the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.859
 industrial accidents in Europe all 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.950
 stages of risk management come 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.259
 taken into account Europe the TV is back 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.219
 on the site of the seveso accident almost 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.219
 40 years later 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.910
 it was a Saturday at the end of production there was a 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.890
 tank that had overheated in the 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 icmesa chemical factory of the la 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.700
 red there is budan 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.430
 overheating led 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.610
 to the de facto explosion of the reactor for 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.470
 even ten days 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.150
 the incident was hidden until 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.100
 no strange things were observed 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.040
 precisely falls of tree leaves 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.850
 for petric their phenol a defoliant 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:56.489
 death of poultry and problems 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.489
 skin, especially children 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.260
 we are in the oak forest born on 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.940
 scenes of the seves damiano incident of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.360
 simine was a child when the reactor 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.650
 of the icmesa pharmaceutical company exploded 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.530
 it was July 10, 1976 in seveso in 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.350
 town at 15 km from milan gets free 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.970
 in the air a huge cloud of dioxin but 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.030
 the company did not immediately declare gravity 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.040
 of substances dispersed in the atmosphere e 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.960
 the local authorities did not inform the 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.910
 population then arrived 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.790
 the area was forced evacuations 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.790
 reclaimed and the surrounding houses 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.790
 destroyed 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.270
 today they took me and his office 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.300
 milan of the environment after 40 years 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.140
 situation has changed a lot because not 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.539
 you can never cancel the system itself 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.210
 would work the problem is to overcome the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.119
 obstacles that arise in many cases 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.399
 from the rebelliousness for example of the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.399
 local authorities to make our situations 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.200
 of danger to the population 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.520
 from the accident in 76 two directives 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.770
 regulate the risk of accidents 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.229
 how the system works 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.240
 first of all today with a 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.000
 census of companies at risk in 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.800
 Europe have been surveyed about it 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.260
 10,000 classified according to level 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.360
 of danger incident we went to 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.900
 visit one of the companies subjected to 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.840
 regime serves only sipcam produces 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.640
 agrochemicals pesticides herbicides fertilizers 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.160
 occupies an area of â€‹â€‹300 thousand meters 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.090
 squares in between the countries in the 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.340
 province of milan 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.349
 here 3 percent of the money is spent 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.380
 risk securely billed 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.410
 fire is very high this machine a 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.770
 all a system of bulkheads that yes 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.080
 stop when operator opens for 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.350
 keep the work situation tones 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.210
 total security 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.520
 the sip cam presented a plan of 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.410
 internal and external emergency in case 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.420
 of an accident with damage outside the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.310
 own territory to controls 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.750
 come they come they have had me 272 from 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.240
 2000 to date this means 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.000
 immediately 25 times a year once 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.850
 15 days to the harp or the asl and then 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.890
 fire brigade or ministry come 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.320
 to check our factory 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.300
 experts say the greatest risks 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.160
 they come more than small businesses 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.410
 they escape the controls from the big ones 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.730
 companies that have the means to invest 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.290
 in prevention 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.830
 but local authorities like i 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.770
 edoardo bai legambiente controls 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.180
 award only one check that is 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.970
 that of the management system of the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.830
 security do it do it in a manner 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.680
 formal ie they sit in the office and 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.290
 they do an audition instead of going one 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.630
 audit the harp the protection agency 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.040
 environment one of the managers of 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.510
 these checks 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.400
 here come the emergency plans 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.470
 sent by companies 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.750
 from here the technicians who theoretically start 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.150
 they go to the various seveso companies 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.140
 monitoring is constant on the hypotheses 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.640
 of accident this is a case of 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.780
 a company that is recognized in 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.490
 simple because of some structure 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.710
 something here that can cause harm 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.210
 and there are three areas of impact that are 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.910
 the area impacts the area safely 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:13.780
 impact different gravity in which they come 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.490
 activated of the provisions of 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.690
 evacuation of the population comes 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.540
 informed and depends on the dynamism of the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.970
 mayor of the degree of 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.830
 availability of personnel of 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.410
 knowledge and financial by degree also 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.540
 of personal sensitivity here is the 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.800
 problem of the seveso system today 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.170
 the population should be informed 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.300
 on what to do before a burst 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.740
 accident but few between municipalities and 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.780
 prefectures do it 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.790
 we finish our journey in Milan 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.530
 firefighters a highly body 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.540
 specialized in chemical accidents 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.030
 ready to intervene in any 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.430
 moment but the exercise is done 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.580
 we played some time was one 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.670
 important exercise with municipality and 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.470
 with a chemical company that is at risk 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.430
 major accident that is auctioning 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.980
 located there a source 36 when there 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.720
 they call we are as possible as it is 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.720
 available because in our interest
