though you can do this new thing called

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.960 
though you can do this new thing called
a<00:03:42.420> video<00:03:42.780> collage<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:43.950> if<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:44.220> open<00:03:44.370> up<00:03:44.640> the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
recorded one so they can see exactly

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
running simultaneously which is quite

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.750 
running simultaneously which is quite
funny<00:03:57.260> not<00:03:57.740> entirely<00:03:58.040> sure<00:03:58.310> how<00:03:58.460> you're<00:03:58.640> going

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.280 
funny not entirely sure how you're going
to<00:03:58.820> share<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:59.210> but<00:03:59.270> it<00:03:59.420> would<00:03:59.570> be<00:03:59.720> pretty<00:03:59.990> fun

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
to share it but it would be pretty fun

as an mp4 etc their camera UI is

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.910 
as an mp4 etc their camera UI is
basically<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.870> same<00:04:06.080> though<00:04:06.320> so<00:04:06.590> ultimately

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
basically the same though so ultimately

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.490 
basically the same though so ultimately
a<00:04:07.340> very<00:04:07.700> very<00:04:07.970> simple<00:04:08.570> but<00:04:08.720> impressive<00:04:09.140> UI

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
a very very simple but impressive UI

a very very simple but impressive UI
what's<00:04:10.100> really<00:04:10.460> impressive<00:04:10.670> is<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.390> power

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
what's really impressive is the power

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.410 
what's really impressive is the power
under<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.200> hood<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.860> external<00:04:13.340> 7<00:04:13.730> pro<00:04:13.940> sir<00:04:14.330> is

quarter<00:04:17.810> two<00:04:18.019> gigs<00:04:18.290> so<00:04:19.190> it'll<00:04:19.400> be<00:04:19.489> relatively

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
quarter two gigs so it'll be relatively

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.510 
quarter two gigs so it'll be relatively
efficient<00:04:20.540> but<00:04:20.780> you've<00:04:20.930> also<00:04:21.170> got<00:04:21.440> three<00:04:22.100> so

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
efficient but you've also got three so

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.940 
efficient but you've also got three so
