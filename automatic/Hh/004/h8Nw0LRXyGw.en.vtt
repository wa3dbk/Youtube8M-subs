00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
use that and sometimes in the fact that

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.830 
use that and sometimes in the fact that
we<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.680> know<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.920> we're<00:00:23.250> quite<00:00:23.519> bright<00:00:23.850> we

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
we do know that we're quite bright we

can tend to skip over some of the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.279 
can tend to skip over some of the
fundamentals<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.599> be<00:00:27.779> really

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
fundamentals so just to just be really

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.890

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
always always a payoff be a positive or

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.940 
always always a payoff be a positive or
negative<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.970> we<00:03:18.810> ultimately<00:03:19.050> if<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.800> can

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
course there is always an aspect of MA

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.420 
course there is always an aspect of MA
in<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.310> game<00:04:05.580> with<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.880> lack<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.090> knowledge

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
in the game with the lack of knowledge

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.509 
in the game with the lack of knowledge
yes<00:04:08.810> yeah<00:04:09.810> there's<00:04:10.470> two<00:04:10.769> aspects<00:04:11.250> there's<00:04:11.430> a

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
yes yeah there's two aspects there's a

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.280 
yes yeah there's two aspects there's a
knowledge<00:04:11.880> component<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.600> there's<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.080> but

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
knowledge component and there's you but

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.020 
knowledge component and there's you but
if<00:04:13.410> you<00:04:13.860> aren't<00:04:14.070> in<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.310> game<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.730> you<00:04:14.760> don't

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
if you aren't in the game and you don't

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.490 
if you aren't in the game and you don't
have<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.390> knowledge<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.840> it's<00:04:16.019> caused<00:04:16.320> a

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
have the knowledge and it's caused a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.820 
have the knowledge and it's caused a
loss<00:04:17.150> guess<00:04:18.150> what<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.959> still<00:04:19.260> created<00:04:19.680> that

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
loss guess what you still created that

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.180 
loss guess what you still created that
loss<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.989> were<00:04:22.109> still<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.470> one<00:04:22.680> actually

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
loss you were still the one actually

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.960 
loss you were still the one actually
going<00:04:23.340> after<00:04:23.760> them

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
going after them

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.580 
going after them
knowledge<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.480> implementing<00:04:25.470> that

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
knowledge and implementing that

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.480 
knowledge and implementing that
knowledge<00:04:25.980> or<00:04:26.700> not<00:04:27.090> implementing<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:28.400> are<00:04:29.400> you

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
knowledge or not implementing it are you

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.670 
knowledge or not implementing it are you
with<00:04:29.640> me
