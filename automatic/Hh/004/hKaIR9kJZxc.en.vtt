00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
got go over here over here there's the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.580 
got go over here over here there's the
giant<00:00:55.469> KX<00:00:55.860> 2500<00:00:56.820> point<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.320> this

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
giant KX 2500 point one here it is this

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.610 
giant KX 2500 point one here it is this
powers<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> subs<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.579> here<00:00:59.930> it's<00:01:00.930> got<00:01:01.230> lots

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
powers the subs right here it's got lots

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.319 
powers the subs right here it's got lots
of<00:01:01.739> zero<00:01:01.920> gauge<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.180> been

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
of zero gauge as you can see it's been

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.719 
of zero gauge as you can see it's been
custom<00:01:03.780> painted<00:01:04.170> red<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.379> black<00:01:04.619> which<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
custom painted red and black which I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.460 
custom painted red and black which I
think<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.240> matches<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.630> car<00:01:06.810> looks<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:07.200> I

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
think it matches the car looks good I

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:21.050 
think it matches the car looks good I
guess<00:01:08.189> we<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:08.729> turn<00:01:09.270> some<00:01:09.420> music<00:01:09.450> on

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.080 

okay<00:01:22.060> so<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:24.009> is<00:01:24.159> my<00:01:24.189> head<00:01:24.399> unit<00:01:24.700> it's<00:01:25.030> a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
okay so this is my head unit it's a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.440 
okay so this is my head unit it's a
pioneer<00:01:26.219> we're<00:01:27.219> gonna<00:01:27.429> go<00:01:27.640> ahead<00:01:27.759> we're<00:01:28.359> gonna
