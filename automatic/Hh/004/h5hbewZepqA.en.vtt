then<00:02:37.970> we'll<00:02:38.030> go<00:02:38.180> ahead<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.480> load<00:02:38.569> some

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
one-inch to swing around here so we can

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.820 
one-inch to swing around here so we can

a<00:03:26.959> stripper<00:03:27.350> down<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.769> can<00:03:27.859> see<00:03:28.010> there's<00:03:28.190> just

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
a stripper down you can see there's just

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.170 
a stripper down you can see there's just
room<00:03:28.579> for<00:03:28.850> one<00:03:29.060> piece<00:03:29.329> to<00:03:29.570> be<00:03:29.690> raised<00:03:29.989> up<00:03:31.180> and

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
conveyor there's some forward guides

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.120 
conveyor there's some forward guides
then<00:03:44.569> Scott<00:03:44.930> will<00:03:45.109> move<00:03:45.290> those<00:03:45.530> forward<00:03:45.889> on<00:03:46.100> a
