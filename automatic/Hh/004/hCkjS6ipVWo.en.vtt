maximum range so what we can conclude is

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
maximum range so what we can conclude is
the<00:01:19.439> fact<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.740> Thresh<00:01:20.070> will<00:01:20.430> follow<00:01:20.700> knockin

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the fact that Thresh will follow knockin

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
the fact that Thresh will follow knockin
