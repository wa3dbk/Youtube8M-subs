00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
at the same time give you an idea what

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.180

we<00:03:17.519> did<00:03:17.700> first<00:03:18.540> shot<00:03:18.720> was<00:03:18.810> point<00:03:19.080> 28<00:03:19.410> 100<00:03:19.980> and

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
we did first shot was point 28 100 and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.750 
we did first shot was point 28 100 and
the<00:03:20.370> last<00:03:20.580> shot<00:03:20.819> was<00:03:20.940> 1.77<00:03:21.930> 100s<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.549> if<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:23.700> do

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.350 
the last shot was 1.77 100s so if I do
the<00:03:23.970> math<00:03:24.090> right<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.420> think<00:03:24.540> that's<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.959> 1.49<00:03:26.360> 107

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
a half so my wrist saved us a lot of fun

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.770 
a half so my wrist saved us a lot of fun
maybe<00:04:02.760> we<00:04:02.819> could<00:04:02.940> do<00:04:03.000> something<00:04:03.239> different<00:04:03.329> as

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
maybe we could do something different as

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.080 
maybe we could do something different as
it<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:04.349> tradition<00:04:04.890> with<00:04:05.069> our<00:04:05.280> shoot<00:04:05.849> fast

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
videos we take these guns right out on

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.839 
videos we take these guns right out on
range<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.400> shoot<00:04:08.519> them

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
range and shoot them

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.610 
range and shoot them
I<00:04:08.880> didn't<00:04:09.510> sign<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.810> in<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.079> just<00:04:10.139> went<00:04:10.530> out

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
I didn't sign it in I just went out

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.530 
I didn't sign it in I just went out
there<00:04:10.829> oiled<00:04:11.310> them<00:04:11.370> up<00:04:11.579> they<00:04:12.150> started

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
there oiled them up they started

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.940 
there oiled them up they started
shooting<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:13.290> experience<00:04:13.739> is<00:04:13.829> quite

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
shooting the experience is quite

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.949 
shooting the experience is quite
different<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.519> do<00:04:14.579> have<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:14.940> say<00:04:15.120> it's<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.810> lot<00:04:15.930> of

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
different I do have to say it's a lot of

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.430 
different I do have to say it's a lot of
horsepower<00:04:16.349> you're<00:04:16.829> shooting<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.310> 45<00:04:18.269> ACP<00:04:18.840> to

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
horsepower you're shooting to 45 ACP to

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.770 
horsepower you're shooting to 45 ACP to
30<00:04:19.709> round<00:04:19.979> ball<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.579> munitions<00:04:21.180> at<00:04:21.329> one<00:04:21.510> time

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
30 round ball and munitions at one time

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.810 
30 round ball and munitions at one time
at<00:04:22.049> one<00:04:22.079> trigger<00:04:22.530> pole<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.070> you're<00:04:23.580> getting

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
at one trigger pole so you're getting

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.210 
at one trigger pole so you're getting
460<00:04:24.539> grains<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.900> lead<00:04:25.020> downrange<00:04:25.289> so<00:04:26.039> the

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
460 grains of lead downrange so the

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.339 
460 grains of lead downrange so the
thumb<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.669> you<00:04:26.849> feel<00:04:27.120> as<00:04:27.360> close<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:27.870> like<00:04:28.320> a

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
thumb that you feel as close to a like a

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.129 
thumb that you feel as close to a like a
500<00:04:28.979> Magnum<00:04:29.639> maybe<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.270> little<00:04:30.419> bit<00:04:30.599> less<00:04:30.810> you

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
500 Magnum maybe a little bit less you

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.020 
500 Magnum maybe a little bit less you
got<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.620> lot<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.830> slide<00:04:32.130> coming<00:04:32.430> back<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.880> got

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
got a lot of slide coming back you got

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.480 
got a lot of slide coming back you got
two<00:04:33.180> barrels<00:04:33.510> reciprocating<00:04:34.200> it's<00:04:34.860> it's

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
two barrels reciprocating it's it's

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.129 
two barrels reciprocating it's it's
quite<00:04:35.729> it's<00:04:35.970> quite<00:04:36.060> a<00:04:36.240> different<00:04:36.690> feeling<00:04:36.900> as

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
quite it's quite a different feeling as

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.860 
quite it's quite a different feeling as
it<00:04:37.200> gets<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.440> real<00:04:37.620> long<00:04:37.860> push<00:04:38.820> more<00:04:39.360> than<00:04:39.539> a<00:04:39.570> jab

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
it gets a real long push more than a jab

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.409 
it gets a real long push more than a jab
so<00:04:40.289> I<00:04:40.680> think<00:04:41.220> if<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.610> spent<00:04:41.849> some<00:04:42.000> time<00:04:42.180> on<00:04:42.210> a

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
so I think if I spent some time on a

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.629 
so I think if I spent some time on a
range<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:42.870> actually<00:04:43.250> played<00:04:44.250> with<00:04:44.460> it<00:04:44.580> a

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
range and actually played with it a

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.250 
range and actually played with it a
little<00:04:44.729> bit<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.210> do<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.330> trigger<00:04:45.660> job<00:04:45.900> lower<00:04:46.139> I

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
little bit and do a trigger job lower I

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.600 
little bit and do a trigger job lower I
could<00:04:46.410> probably<00:04:46.560> get<00:04:46.740> some<00:04:46.919> nice<00:04:47.070> splits<00:04:47.430> with

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
could probably get some nice splits with

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.490 
could probably get some nice splits with
it<00:04:47.789> so<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.389> was<00:04:48.510> kind<00:04:48.690> of<00:04:48.720> an<00:04:48.840> interesting<00:04:49.020> gone

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
it so it was kind of an interesting gone

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.060 
it so it was kind of an interesting gone
all<00:04:49.710> in<00:04:50.039> all<00:04:50.400> but<00:04:51.110> now<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.740> I've<00:04:52.830> got<00:04:52.979> the

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
all in all but now that I've got the

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.409
