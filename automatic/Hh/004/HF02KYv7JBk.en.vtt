00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.119
 besides the penalties that arrive but there are already 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.580
 therefore the athletes at home 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.820
 had imposed on piauí thinking I 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.460
 I dream and I only this and now that I betrayed 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:38.530
 julius of non 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:42.160
 together the coach taught me zé manel 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.780
 not only am I act the coach 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.489
 different systems 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.700
 It's in expectation but you expect it to come. 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.700
 some 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.930
 Now let's talk about that with the son of 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.649
 lady who drinks the most from running 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.390
 proof 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.910
 to is already running great one 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.440
 This is how you compete with other 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:12.160
 companies 4 180 points 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:17.619
 Did you know about the four sessions with 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:23.110
 the one that you really are stronger and 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:25.659
 have a good time is a great rival who 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.180
 really was this we did not have this 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.680
 problem is to have a good time to do 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.960
 two more tests of students when 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.270
 Let's see now, wait and see the sand. 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.830
 with your competition and we'll see 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.280
 a lot of championship ahead 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.200
 want to talk about film cycling in 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.570
 particular but I know it's a fille kick 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.939
 You have a dose down and have merit 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.840
 for the test by tap is doing to 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.470
 talk about the chip 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.470
 antonio coca 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:04.540
 I'm really happy in four to 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:09.540
 companies is not this 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.540
 the value of the test registration 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:25.950
 niki lauda ipa precise stamping ball 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:39.819
 a certain time was the choice of 2 and the 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:45.760
 second in 10 neighborhoods and picked up like me 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:57.219
 I'll call you, I'll have to change the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:59.530
 use of television and oxana when trying 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:12.510
 save a ball nobody will pay 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:12.510
 no smoking was healed 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:29.590
 little by little the 38 in a bet between 89 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:32.819
 and we will start processing who 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.459
 it is approved today 4 to cross sessions vai 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.280
 Yes, I think you know both 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.629
 main where you're going in the first round 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.060
 team for their cowboy in apparently 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.459
 I could not see points and they arrested 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.129
 some points mainly in the range in 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.699
 travanca recover business more points 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.349
 the second adversary therefore could not 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.540
 have run better for the coach 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.759
 very active in the beginning was not champion 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.150
 they arrived but they ended up really 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:07.150
 5 would come with the one that best suits you. 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.250
 hit a bomb but the rest or five 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.539
 stars 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.939
 really was is a municipality very 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.799
 Exciting but it was was a very busy course 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.590
 This is a 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:21.070
 battle is this is how cycling is a 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.080
 Queen's steps has already been 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.220
 now won the Spaniards whom 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.950
 The hardest evidence lies ahead. 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.530
 is any thinking of a bomb for 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.590
 some special or when the accounts 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.840
 those which are prepared to overcome 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.800
 people have a team of fmi a team 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.290
 very full is very much a team 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.740
 good for both the talent test 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.780
 such as background checks and no person 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.030
 privately and I think we have a 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.680
 quite pretty good and pretty 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.810
 reasonable to compete at the highest 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.090
 level with anyone else respect 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.730
 respectively the working capital of the 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.120
 foundation is I being at a disadvantage 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.640
 because so we could have been in the year is 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.590
 last year in the first 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.020
 but very little competition the second year 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.020
 the people of the third year who 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.880
 the fists take advantage of the spain that is 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.770
 the third year is better and I am 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.169
 disadvantage would be with my 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.870
 opponents but let's go now 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.070
 Wait because we'll think of a 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.640
 contest every time 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.950
 the camera is ricardo who does not direct us 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.740
 we are here it's my first time 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.600
 It's partying a big fury with the blush that 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.850
 cold first how is the 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.800
 behave one hundred in 2015 and I was the 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:40.580
 cut for work today the third 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.080
 room was and so I think I go 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.550
 tell to spain 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:54.500
 Look the guy was an okay thing and done 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:58.090
 then ok're angry is required but I 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.090
 when I left your pack 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:14.450
 we have a green castro to follow but 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:17.060
 we hope it will be a contest for 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.430
 we get to know more of what we 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.200
 we can count on spain and if this 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.100
 Contest already was the contest is for that 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.350
 that we will wait and commit in the 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.169
 principle here the campaign has a 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.860
 problem is a problem already complicating 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.030
 which was any timing like the old ones 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.050
 have a little advantage for more 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.729
 some hours 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.550
 now you have to try to buy the wrap 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:47.060
 we'll see until you can but it's manel with 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:51.490
 Someone is sedated to say I do not have 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:54.560
 sorrows in spain and it is not going to be there 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:58.580
 difficulty in choosing the most 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:01.039
 it is also a witness to the 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:05.960
 topic yesterday little old 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:11.060
 see but I think it goes all the way to the 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:16.970
 end of the gaucho for me beyond the stop 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:18.200
 still invited is friendship and unity between 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.050
 the peoples 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.289
 therefore a special message week 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.090
 with Flemish Columbus wishes good luck in 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:29.919
 first day 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.919
 thank you good campaign 2015
