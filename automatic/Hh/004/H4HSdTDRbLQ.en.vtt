Mardi<00:00:26.000> Gras<00:00:26.119> beads<00:00:26.240> you<00:00:26.449> could<00:00:26.570> just<00:00:26.720> string<00:00:26.869> a

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
Mardi Gras beads you could just string a

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.570 
Mardi Gras beads you could just string a
pair<00:00:27.109> of<00:00:27.140> beads<00:00:27.320> but<00:00:27.500> anyways<00:00:27.740> I<00:00:27.949> like<00:00:28.369> to<00:00:28.460> take

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
pair of beads but anyways I like to take

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.330 
pair of beads but anyways I like to take
them<00:00:28.730> right<00:00:28.760> where<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.269> to<00:00:29.619> connect<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.980> ends

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
them right where the to connect the ends

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.100 
them right where the to connect the ends
and<00:00:31.460> then<00:00:31.550> just<00:00:31.820> cut<00:00:32.029> it<00:00:32.150> so<00:00:32.750> that<00:00:32.809> you<00:00:32.930> have<00:00:33.080> a

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
and then just cut it so that you have a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.040 
and then just cut it so that you have a
lone<00:00:33.379> strand<00:00:34.190> of<00:00:34.400> beads<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:35.269> then<00:00:35.750> you<00:00:35.870> want

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
lone strand of beads and then you want

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.049 
lone strand of beads and then you want
to<00:00:36.140> take<00:00:36.350> them<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:36.620> measure<00:00:36.800> them<00:00:37.040> around<00:00:37.670> the

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
to take them and measure them around the

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.899 
to take them and measure them around the
length<00:00:38.269> of<00:00:38.540> your<00:00:39.019> headband<00:00:39.710> as<00:00:40.489> you<00:00:40.610> can<00:00:40.760> see

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
length of your headband as you can see

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.729 
length of your headband as you can see
I'm<00:00:41.150> not<00:00:41.420> like<00:00:41.659> doing<00:00:41.989> it<00:00:42.140> like<00:00:42.379> super

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
I'm not like doing it like super

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.170 
I'm not like doing it like super
accurate<00:00:42.949> I'm<00:00:43.250> just<00:00:43.430> like<00:00:43.549> what<00:00:43.729> just<00:00:43.879> guess

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
accurate I'm just like what just guess

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.729 
accurate I'm just like what just guess
here<00:00:44.540> and<00:00:44.809> then<00:00:45.110> you<00:00:45.199> just<00:00:45.350> want<00:00:45.470> to<00:00:45.500> cut

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
here and then you just want to cut

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.170 
here and then you just want to cut
whatever<00:00:46.280> length<00:00:46.519> that<00:00:46.940> is<00:00:47.769> and<00:00:48.769> yeah<00:00:49.640> it's

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
whatever length that is and yeah it's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.789 
whatever length that is and yeah it's
pretty<00:00:50.360> simple<00:00:50.600> then<00:00:51.080> we're<00:00:51.229> gonna<00:00:51.320> take<00:00:51.589> a

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
pretty simple then we're gonna take a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:53.649 
pretty simple then we're gonna take a
piece<00:00:52.250> of<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.489> embroidery<00:00:52.850> floss<00:00:53.000> or<00:00:53.479> just

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
piece of the embroidery floss or just

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.990 
piece of the embroidery floss or just
one<00:00:53.780> end<00:00:53.930> of<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:54.170> create<00:00:54.710> a<00:00:54.769> loop<00:00:55.000> I'm

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
one end of it and create a loop I'm

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.490 
one end of it and create a loop I'm
gonna<00:00:56.180> make<00:00:56.299> it<00:00:56.390> small<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:56.989> that<00:00:57.019> it's<00:00:57.229> easier

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
gonna make it small so that it's easier

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.140 
gonna make it small so that it's easier
to<00:00:57.619> work<00:00:57.710> with<00:00:57.769> and<00:00:58.129> then<00:00:58.670> you're<00:00:58.790> just<00:00:58.970> going

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
to work with and then you're just going

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.810 
to work with and then you're just going
to<00:00:59.210> slip<00:00:59.799> the<00:01:00.799> bead<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.489> headband

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
to slip the bead and the headband

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.390 
to slip the bead and the headband
through<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.869> you're<00:01:03.650> going<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:03.949> tighten

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
through it and you're going to tighten

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.280 
through it and you're going to tighten
it<00:01:04.810> around<00:01:05.830> your<00:01:06.830> I<00:01:06.860> am<00:01:07.010> tightening<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.610> and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
it around your I am tightening it and

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.050 
it around your I am tightening it and
then<00:01:09.290> just<00:01:09.619> tie<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.040> bunch<00:01:10.369> of<00:01:10.490> knots<00:01:10.670> around

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
then just tie a bunch of knots around

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.530 
then just tie a bunch of knots around
that<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.360> hold<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:11.660> into<00:01:11.780> place<00:01:12.580> because<00:01:13.580> this

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
that to hold it into place because this

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.590 
that to hold it into place because this
is<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.900> know<00:01:15.220> really<00:01:16.220> important<00:01:16.640> step<00:01:16.910> then

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
is you know really important step then

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.520 
is you know really important step then

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
I'm just gonna put a little bit of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.480 
I'm just gonna put a little bit of
superglue<00:01:18.800> just<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.130> keep<00:01:19.250> everything

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
superglue just to keep everything

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.770 
superglue just to keep everything
knotted<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.120> doesn't<00:01:20.300> go<00:01:20.390> anywhere<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.720> it

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
knotted so it doesn't go anywhere and it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.510 
knotted so it doesn't go anywhere and it
made<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:20.930> weird<00:01:21.260> smoke<00:01:21.620> isn't<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:21.980> weird<00:01:22.220> I

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
made that weird smoke isn't that weird I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.340 
made that weird smoke isn't that weird I
don't<00:01:23.030> know<00:01:23.120> why<00:01:23.270> I<00:01:23.300> reacted<00:01:23.630> like<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.170> but

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
don't know why I reacted like that but

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.280 
don't know why I reacted like that but
it<00:01:24.440> did<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:24.890> whatever<00:01:25.340> um<00:01:26.090> anyway<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:26.960> yeah

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
it did but whatever um anyway so yeah

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.220 
it did but whatever um anyway so yeah
then<00:01:27.620> you<00:01:28.130> want<00:01:28.730> to<00:01:29.030> just<00:01:29.600> take<00:01:29.750> your<00:01:29.930> thread

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
then you want to just take your thread

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.290 
then you want to just take your thread
and<00:01:30.290> wrap<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.830> around<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.400> spaces<00:01:32.150> in<00:01:32.270> between

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
and wrap it around the spaces in between

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.120 
and wrap it around the spaces in between
the<00:01:32.690> beads<00:01:32.870> and<00:01:33.230> I'm<00:01:33.560> wrapping<00:01:33.740> it

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
the beads and I'm wrapping it

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.100 
the beads and I'm wrapping it
each<00:01:34.460> bead<00:01:34.820> four<00:01:35.180> times<00:01:35.540> like<00:01:35.840> in<00:01:36.020> between

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
each bead four times like in between

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.800 
each bead four times like in between
each<00:01:36.380> space<00:01:36.620> four<00:01:36.860> times<00:01:37.360> um<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:38.630> then<00:01:38.720> I

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
each space four times um and then I

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.910 
each space four times um and then I
don't<00:01:38.840> actually<00:01:39.080> like<00:01:39.350> gluing<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.740> beads

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
don't actually like gluing the beads

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.740 
don't actually like gluing the beads
down<00:01:40.070> or<00:01:40.190> anything<00:01:40.340> I'm<00:01:40.490> just<00:01:40.600> attaching<00:01:41.600> them

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
down or anything I'm just attaching them

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.899 
down or anything I'm just attaching them
with<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.590> thread<00:01:42.890> which<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.280> why<00:01:43.370> you<00:01:43.430> need<00:01:43.670> to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
reason it's out of focus now but that's

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.340

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
just gonna create a loop and stick your

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.370 
just gonna create a loop and stick your
thread<00:01:54.229> through<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:55.250> end<00:01:55.479> um<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:57.260> know

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
thread through the end um and you know

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.770 
thread through the end um and you know
just<00:01:57.560> tie<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:57.950> on<00:01:58.190> tie<00:01:59.000> knot<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.479> know<00:01:59.600> like

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
just tie it on tie knot you know like

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.110 
just tie it on tie knot you know like
you<00:01:59.930> would<00:02:00.020> tie<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.350> knot<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:00.830> beginning<00:02:01.120> and

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
you would tie a knot the beginning and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.600 
you would tie a knot the beginning and
you<00:02:02.390> just<00:02:02.540> want<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.840> secure<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.799> really<00:02:04.280> tight

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
you just want to secure it really tight

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.039 
you just want to secure it really tight
so<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:04.880> probably<00:02:05.180> did<00:02:05.420> like<00:02:05.570> three<00:02:05.840> or<00:02:06.020> four

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
so I probably did like three or four

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.169 
so I probably did like three or four
knots<00:02:06.470> on<00:02:06.680> there<00:02:06.890> um<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.790> then<00:02:07.880> once<00:02:08.060> again

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
knots on there um and then once again

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.140 
knots on there um and then once again

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
just take your bit of superglue and

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.130 
just take your bit of superglue and
superglue<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.299> this<00:02:11.390> one<00:02:11.599> doesn't<00:02:11.840> make<00:02:11.900> any

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
superglue it this one doesn't make any

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.839 
superglue it this one doesn't make any
smoke<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.739> don't<00:02:12.980> know<00:02:13.190> why<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.430> made<00:02:13.700> that

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
smoke I don't know why it made that

smoke I don't know why it made that
weird<00:02:14.090> smoke<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:15.080> then<00:02:15.200> just<00:02:15.379> cut<00:02:15.560> off<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
weird smoke and then just cut off the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.540 
weird smoke and then just cut off the
extra<00:02:16.430> pieces<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.360> string<00:02:17.569> do<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.500> then<00:02:18.650> see

that<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.620> hanging<00:03:17.040> off<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:18.180> then<00:03:18.300> I'm<00:03:18.360> going

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
that is hanging off and then I'm going

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.240 
that is hanging off and then I'm going
to<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.570> bit<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.810> super<00:03:19.050> glue<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.680> glue<00:03:19.830> those<00:03:20.040> two

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
to a bit of super glue to glue those two

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.440 
to a bit of super glue to glue those two
beads<00:03:20.430> together<00:03:20.610> since<00:03:21.000> they<00:03:21.150> don't<00:03:21.240> have<00:03:21.360> a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
beads together since they don't have a

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.180 
beads together since they don't have a
string<00:03:21.750> attaching<00:03:22.140> them<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.500> then<00:03:23.040> once

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
string attaching them and then once

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.620 
string attaching them and then once
they're<00:03:23.370> glued<00:03:23.580> I'm<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:23.940> wrapping<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.420> to

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
they're glued I'm just wrapping it to

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.530 
they're glued I'm just wrapping it to
make<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.930> match<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.709> rest<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.970> bracelet

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
make it match the rest of the bracelet

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.420 
make it match the rest of the bracelet
and<00:03:27.900> then<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.860> just<00:03:29.160> type<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.940> knot<00:03:30.239> or

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
and then you can just type in a knot or

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.370 
and then you can just type in a knot or
two<00:03:32.430> or<00:03:32.730> five<00:03:32.970> or<00:03:33.300> ten<00:03:33.510> or<00:03:33.540> how<00:03:33.780> many<00:03:34.050> you<00:03:34.200> want

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
two or five or ten or how many you want

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.199 
two or five or ten or how many you want
I<00:03:34.620> probably<00:03:35.010> did<00:03:35.340> like<00:03:35.520> two<00:03:35.670> or<00:03:35.820> three<00:03:35.850> once

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
I probably did like two or three once

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.960 
I probably did like two or three once
again<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.920> once<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.459> have<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.880> your

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
again and once you have it to your

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.930 
again and once you have it to your
desired<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:40.080> know<00:03:40.200> Nottage<00:03:40.709> just<00:03:41.430> add<00:03:41.610> some

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
desired you know Nottage just add some

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.490 
desired you know Nottage just add some
more<00:03:42.060> super<00:03:42.330> glue<00:03:42.510> cut<00:03:42.750> off<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.050> ends<00:03:43.380> and

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
more super glue cut off the ends and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.130 
more super glue cut off the ends and
you're<00:03:44.160> done<00:03:44.459> again<00:03:45.060> see<00:03:45.450> how<00:03:45.720> simple<00:03:46.050> that

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
you're done again see how simple that

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.570 
you're done again see how simple that
was<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.500> was<00:03:46.620> like<00:03:46.770> literally<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.190> can<00:03:47.489> do

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
was I was like literally you can do

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.130 
was I was like literally you can do
these<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.820> like<00:03:47.940> five<00:03:48.330> minutes<00:03:48.360> they're<00:03:48.900> so

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
these in like five minutes they're so

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.810 
these in like five minutes they're so
easy<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.890> they<00:03:50.100> look<00:03:50.250> really<00:03:50.459> cool<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:50.640> I

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
easy and they look really cool and I

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.949 
easy and they look really cool and I
think<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.060> bracelets<00:03:51.450> would<00:03:51.540> look<00:03:51.660> cool<00:03:51.840> if

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
think the bracelets would look cool if

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.930 
think the bracelets would look cool if
you<00:03:52.080> had<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.230> whole<00:03:52.440> bunch<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.770> them<00:03:52.890> on<00:03:53.370> your

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
you had a whole bunch of them on your

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.570 
you had a whole bunch of them on your
wrist<00:03:54.060> at<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.209> same<00:03:54.360> time
