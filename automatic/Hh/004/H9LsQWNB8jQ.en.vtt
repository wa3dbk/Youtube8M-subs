00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
books and I never really gave that a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.060 
books and I never really gave that a
shot<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.500> never<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.800> treating

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
shot because I was never in treating

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.910 
shot because I was never in treating
until<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.320> wasn't<00:00:58.620> until<00:00:58.859> I

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
until now and so it wasn't until I

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.250 
until now and so it wasn't until I
graduated<00:00:59.520> college<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.359> treating<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.020> I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
graduated college to be in treating so I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.020 
graduated college to be in treating so I
guess<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.070> reading<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.579> leisure<00:01:02.789> I
