00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:37.630 
I've come across so let's turn the light
back<00:02:22.850> on<00:02:29.500> go<00:02:30.500> back<00:02:30.740> into<00:02:30.920> shot<00:02:31.280> ah<00:02:36.400> here<00:02:37.400> we<00:02:37.430> go

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
back on go back into shot ah here we go

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.810 
back on go back into shot ah here we go
so<00:02:39.490> this<00:02:40.490> one<00:02:40.820> is<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.840> think<00:02:42.400> yet<00:02:43.400> it's<00:02:43.700> just

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
so this one is I think yet it's just

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.370 
so this one is I think yet it's just
under<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.360> pound<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.470> it's<00:02:45.980> really<00:02:46.400> cheap<00:02:46.640> and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
under a pound so it's really cheap and

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.080 
under a pound so it's really cheap and
yeah<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.410> mean<00:02:48.770> this<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.100> really<00:02:49.640> well-made

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
yeah I mean this is really well-made

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.780 
yeah I mean this is really well-made
it's<00:02:50.360> just<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.660> can't<00:02:51.050> stress<00:02:51.620> enough<00:02:51.830> how<00:02:52.040> good

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
it's just I can't stress enough how good

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.240 
it's just I can't stress enough how good
this<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.209> we<00:02:54.200> actually<00:02:54.410> put<00:02:54.680> down<00:02:54.709> my<00:02:54.920> reason

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
this is we actually put down my reason

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.430 
this is we actually put down my reason
so<00:02:55.459> yeah<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.910> would<00:02:56.060> look<00:02:56.450> actually<00:02:56.690> once<00:02:57.230> it's

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
so yeah I would look actually once it's

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:17.350 
so yeah I would look actually once it's
on<00:02:57.590> your<00:02:57.709> wrist<00:03:03.040> great<00:03:04.040> epic<00:03:04.850> fail<00:03:15.820> so<00:03:16.820> yeah<00:03:17.000> it

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
just looks great it's probably one of

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.030
