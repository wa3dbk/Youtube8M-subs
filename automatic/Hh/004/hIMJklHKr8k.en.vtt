this little video show you how I set up
my<00:00:05.180> flight<00:00:06.180> Ron<00:00:06.420> infrared<00:00:06.960> shutter<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.740> work

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
my flight Ron infrared shutter to work

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.720 
my flight Ron infrared shutter to work
with<00:00:08.250> my<00:00:08.400> photography<00:00:09.269> 14sg<00:00:10.309> and<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.429> idea

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
with my photography 14sg and the idea

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.440 
with my photography 14sg and the idea
here<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:13.019> this<00:00:13.230> little<00:00:13.980> chap<00:00:14.340> will<00:00:14.759> start

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
here is that this little chap will start

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.710 
here is that this little chap will start
and<00:00:15.599> stop<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.960> video<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.190> sony<00:00:17.720> alpha

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
and stop the video on the sony alpha

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.230 
and stop the video on the sony alpha
nex-5n<00:00:19.650> 5<00:00:20.430> r<00:00:20.699> &amp;<00:00:21.150> 7<00:00:21.800> and<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.980> will<00:00:23.070> also<00:00:23.189> run<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
nex-5n 5 r &amp; 7 and it will also run the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.390 
nex-5n 5 r &amp; 7 and it will also run the
shutter<00:00:24.480> as<00:00:24.720> well<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.890> will<00:00:26.039> look<00:00:26.130> at<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
shutter as well so this will look at the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:35.840 
shutter as well so this will look at the
transmitter<00:00:27.119> first<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:29.390> do<00:00:32.450> basically<00:00:34.850> what

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
transmitter first up do basically what

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.430 
transmitter first up do basically what
are<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> set<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.989> want<00:00:37.290> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
are the way I set out because I want to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.330 
are the way I set out because I want to
have<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.520> shutter<00:00:39.350> camera<00:00:40.350> shutter<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:41.010> here

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
have the shutter camera shutter and here

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.529 
have the shutter camera shutter and here
I'm<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.930> stun<00:00:43.320> stop<00:00:43.649> video

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
I'm going to have the stun stop video

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.819 
I'm going to have the stun stop video
yeah<00:00:45.980> so<00:00:47.570> if<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.629> go<00:00:48.870> into<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.230> linkage<00:00:49.559> menu

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
yeah so if we go into the linkage menu

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.479 
yeah so if we go into the linkage menu
and<00:00:51.559> we<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.430> function<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.980> I've<00:00:56.129> got<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and we go to function and I've got the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.790 
and we go to function and I've got the
this<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.570> channel<00:00:57.840> 8<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.469> we're<00:00:58.559> gonna<00:00:58.680> have

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
this one channel 8 so we're gonna have

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.119 
this one channel 8 so we're gonna have
to<00:00:58.859> channel<00:00:59.219> 8<00:00:59.340> you'll<00:00:59.730> see<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.629> set

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
to channel 8 you'll see that if you set

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.060 
to channel 8 you'll see that if you set
this<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.879> s<00:01:03.180> H<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:04.320> means<00:01:04.350> you're

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
this one here to s H that means you're

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.250 
this one here to s H that means you're
controlling<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.420> switch<00:01:06.659> up<00:01:06.990> here

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
controlling it with the switch up here

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.310 
controlling it with the switch up here
and<00:01:08.330> then<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> trim<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.470> set<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.540> SS<00:01:12.540> which<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
and then the trim is set to SS which is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.899 
and then the trim is set to SS which is
a<00:01:13.530> switch<00:01:13.830> over<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.580> when<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.850> to

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
a switch over here and when you go to

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.800 
a switch over here and when you go to
the<00:01:15.090> trim<00:01:15.390> menu<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:17.790> SF<00:01:18.210> as<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.570> see

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the trim menu and the SF as you can see

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.039 
the trim menu and the SF as you can see
the<00:01:19.380> rate<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.130> -<00:01:20.580> 100<00:01:21.000> %<00:01:21.299> than<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.600> mode<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the rate is - 100 % than the mode is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.330 
the rate is - 100 % than the mode is
normal<00:01:23.869> ok<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.799> when<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.130> back<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
normal ok and then when I go back to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.760 
normal ok and then when I go back to
linkage<00:01:26.729> menu<00:01:27.110> which<00:01:28.110> I'll<00:01:28.290> go<00:01:28.439> through<00:01:28.619> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
linkage menu which I'll go through to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.520 
linkage menu which I'll go through to
reverse<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:30.930> I've<00:01:31.140> reversed

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
reverse and you see I've reversed

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.880 
reverse and you see I've reversed
channel<00:01:32.159> 8<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> look<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.770> all

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
channel 8 so when we have a look of all

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.789 
channel 8 so when we have a look of all
that<00:01:35.040> she<00:01:35.310> does<00:01:36.590> come<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> servo<00:01:38.280> menu

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
that she does come to the servo menu

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.620 
that she does come to the servo menu
well<00:01:40.799> actually<00:01:41.130> does<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.060> push<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
well actually does is if I push the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.060 
well actually does is if I push the
switch<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.579> top<00:01:44.759> right<00:01:45.020> then<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.619> goes<00:01:46.829> from

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
switch up on top right then it goes from

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.630 
switch up on top right then it goes from
0<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.570> minus<00:01:48.570> 100<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.560> changed<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.920> end<00:01:50.100> point<00:01:50.369> 4

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
0 to minus 100 I changed the end point 4

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.260 
0 to minus 100 I changed the end point 4
-<00:01:51.140> 135<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.380> month<00:01:52.530> 100<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.009> well<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:55.590> also

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
- 135 to month 100 as well and it also

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.420 
- 135 to month 100 as well and it also
if<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.509> flick<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.469> switch<00:01:58.710> over<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> top

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
if I flick the switch over on the top

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.530 
if I flick the switch over on the top
left<00:01:59.729> then<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:01.259> goes<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.890> plus<00:02:02.280> 100<00:02:03.240> even

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
left then it goes to plus 100 even

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.510 
left then it goes to plus 100 even
though<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.810> bar<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.200> down<00:02:04.439> that's<00:02:04.680> plus<00:02:05.009> 100

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
though this bar is down that's plus 100

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.240 
though this bar is down that's plus 100
so<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:06.600> how<00:02:06.840> I've<00:02:06.990> got<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.439> transmitter

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
so that's how I've got the transmitter

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.010 
so that's how I've got the transmitter
set<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.390> put<00:02:09.539> over<00:02:09.660> there<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> minute

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020

shutter I'll just hold it here for a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.920 
shutter I'll just hold it here for a
second<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.460> what<00:02:33.060> will<00:02:33.180> happen<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.540> when<00:02:33.870> I

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
second and what will happen is when I

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.070 
second and what will happen is when I
push<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.860> switch<00:02:35.820> this<00:02:36.180> does<00:02:36.570> prove<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.960> to

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
push this switch this does prove it to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.240 
push this switch this does prove it to
the<00:02:37.170> back<00:02:37.320> here<00:02:38.420> where<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.510> get<00:02:40.250> still

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the back here where you get still

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.080 
the back here where you get still
photograph<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.840> hold<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:44.960> there<00:02:45.960> okay<00:02:46.170> and

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
photograph you hold it there okay and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.820 
photograph you hold it there okay and
when<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.120> use<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.050> switch<00:02:49.350> on<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.710> other

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
when you use the switch on the other

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.220 
when you use the switch on the other
side<00:02:50.130> if<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.090> pull<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.420> forward<00:02:51.780> back<00:02:51.930> once

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
side if you pull it forward back once

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.990 
side if you pull it forward back once
you<00:02:53.190> start<00:02:53.550> recording<00:02:55.670> it's<00:02:56.670> still<00:02:56.880> recording

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
you start recording it's still recording

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.280 
you start recording it's still recording
and<00:02:57.750> then<00:02:57.930> if<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.170> push<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.470> again<00:03:00.050> they<00:03:01.050> will

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
and then if you push it again they will

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.530 
and then if you push it again they will
record<00:03:02.220> for<00:03:02.520> you<00:03:02.580> then<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.210> go<00:03:03.330> back<00:03:03.510> to

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
record for you then you can go back to

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.180 
record for you then you can go back to

stills do that in the air.you like what
I<00:03:08.220> do<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:09.500> stick<00:03:10.500> me<00:03:12.560> on<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.740> infrared

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
I do is I stick me on the infrared

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.120 
I do is I stick me on the infrared

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
LED on these new boards is just that

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.860 
LED on these new boards is just that

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
tiny little micro LED on the front there

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.210 
tiny little micro LED on the front there

rally<00:03:28.830> day<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.460> great<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:30.000> is

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
rally day but this is great it is

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.070 
rally day but this is great it is
literally<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.720> size<00:03:30.960> of<00:03:31.070> my<00:03:32.070> fingernail<00:03:32.520> and

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
literally the size of my fingernail and

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.560 
literally the size of my fingernail and
if<00:03:34.080> you<00:03:34.290> put<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.740> with<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.670> sticky<00:03:36.060> pad<00:03:36.270> or

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
if you put that with a sticky pad or

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.570 
if you put that with a sticky pad or
something<00:03:36.750> on<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.350> front<00:03:38.690> like<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:40.580> we

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
something on the front like that we

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.080 
something on the front like that we
sometimes<00:03:41.820> find<00:03:42.180> as<00:03:42.570> well<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:44.070> you<00:03:44.910> get

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
sometimes find as well that and you get

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.610 
sometimes find as well that and you get
better<00:03:45.270> interference<00:03:45.750> from<00:03:45.840> sunlight<00:03:46.140> on

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
better interference from sunlight on

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.890 
better interference from sunlight on
these<00:03:46.830> infrared<00:03:47.100> transmitters<00:03:47.610> so<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.390> tend<00:03:48.780> to

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
these infrared transmitters so I tend to

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.960 
these infrared transmitters so I tend to
also<00:03:49.200> this<00:03:49.860> is<00:03:50.010> very<00:03:50.040> tight<00:03:50.400> at<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.640> moment

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
also this is very tight at the moment

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.190 
also this is very tight at the moment
but<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.120> tend<00:03:51.330> towards<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.600> just<00:03:51.780> put<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.960> bit<00:03:52.110> of

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
but I tend towards I just put a bit of

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.710 
but I tend towards I just put a bit of
black<00:03:52.710> insulating<00:03:53.250> tape<00:03:53.280> around<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.970> which

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
black insulating tape around it which

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.960 
black insulating tape around it which
then<00:03:54.870> keeps<00:03:55.080> out<00:03:55.290> any<00:03:55.740> other<00:03:55.920> signals<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:56.850> that

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
then keeps out any other signals so that

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.350 
then keeps out any other signals so that
can<00:03:57.090> they<00:03:57.180> be<00:03:57.270> an<00:03:57.330> absolute<00:03:57.810> people<00:03:58.220> and<00:03:59.360> we

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
can they be an absolute people and we

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:08.010 
can they be an absolute people and we
will<00:04:00.480> see<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.990> again<00:04:02.240> this<00:04:03.240> is<00:04:03.390> rich<00:04:03.540> it

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.730 

nothing<00:04:09.120> pronounced<00:04:10.120> our<00:04:10.330> line<00:04:10.630> it's<00:04:11.530> very

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
nothing pronounced our line it's very

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.680 
nothing pronounced our line it's very
important<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.100> get<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.370> exactly<00:04:12.550> in<00:04:13.000> line<00:04:15.690> so

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
important you get it exactly in line so

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:27.960 
important you get it exactly in line so
just<00:04:23.880> okay<00:04:24.880> so<00:04:25.470> good<00:04:26.470> if<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:26.650> got<00:04:26.740> led<00:04:27.220> exactly

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
just okay so good if you got led exactly

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.020 
just okay so good if you got led exactly
in<00:04:28.030> line<00:04:28.180> you've<00:04:28.990> got<00:04:29.020> your<00:04:29.610> still<00:04:30.610> photos

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
in line you've got your still photos

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.680 
in line you've got your still photos
there<00:04:31.590> how<00:04:32.590> do<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:32.740> have<00:04:32.920> got<00:04:33.160> your<00:04:33.690> video

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
there how do you have got your video

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:42.090 
there how do you have got your video
stops<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:39.340> video<00:04:39.640> stop<00:04:40.230> okay<00:04:41.230> so<00:04:41.800> hopefully

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
stops and video stop okay so hopefully

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.860 
stops and video stop okay so hopefully
that<00:04:42.370> helps<00:04:42.610> out<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:42.790> little<00:04:42.970> bit<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.570> needed
