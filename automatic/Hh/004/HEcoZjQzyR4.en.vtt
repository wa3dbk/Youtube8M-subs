00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030

the<00:01:12.570> mostly<00:01:13.200> chuckle<00:01:13.770> worthy<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.430> think

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the mostly chuckle worthy I do think

the mostly chuckle worthy I do think
that<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> decent<00:01:15.930> comedy<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.150> it

log horizon and I mean this is going to

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.490 
log horizon and I mean this is going to
be<00:04:04.310> a<00:04:04.340> trend<00:04:04.669> and<00:04:05.030> I<00:04:05.419> hope<00:04:05.689> it's<00:04:05.959> you<00:04:06.319> know<00:04:06.470> it's

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
be a trend and I hope it's you know it's

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.770 
be a trend and I hope it's you know it's
a<00:04:06.739> trend<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.129> lasts<00:04:07.879> and<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:08.510> know<00:04:08.629> they're

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
a trend that lasts and you know they're

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.629 
a trend that lasts and you know they're
able<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:09.079> come<00:04:09.259> up<00:04:09.290> with<00:04:09.409> new<00:04:09.530> stories<00:04:10.069> so<00:04:10.609> I

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
able to come up with new stories so I

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.789 
able to come up with new stories so I
think<00:04:11.030> this<00:04:11.359> is<00:04:11.419> just<00:04:11.689> another<00:04:12.019> bridge<00:04:12.500> on

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
think this is just another bridge on

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.060 
think this is just another bridge on
that<00:04:12.909> trend<00:04:13.909> overall<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:15.530> isn't<00:04:15.859> something

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
that trend overall this isn't something

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.550 
that trend overall this isn't something
I<00:04:16.340> would<00:04:16.549> watch<00:04:16.729> my<00:04:16.759> girlfriend<00:04:17.560> because

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
I would watch my girlfriend because

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.370 
I would watch my girlfriend because
there's<00:04:18.769> way<00:04:18.949> too<00:04:18.979> many<00:04:19.310> baths<00:04:19.609> scenes<00:04:20.200> it<00:04:21.200> is

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
there's way too many baths scenes it is

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.530 
there's way too many baths scenes it is
something<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.190> I<00:04:22.550> will<00:04:22.909> laugh

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
something that I will laugh

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.780 
something that I will laugh
that<00:04:23.660> and<00:04:23.900> it's<00:04:24.680> probably<00:04:24.980> nothing<00:04:25.640> that<00:04:25.760> I

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
that and it's probably nothing that I

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.720 
that and it's probably nothing that I
would<00:04:26.090> like<00:04:26.330> buy<00:04:26.600> the<00:04:26.660> DVD<00:04:27.260> set<00:04:27.620> on<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.190> I

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
would like buy the DVD set on and I

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.570 
would like buy the DVD set on and I
don't<00:04:29.000> see<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.330> having<00:04:29.720> a<00:04:30.170> third<00:04:30.620> season<00:04:31.040> and

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
don't see it having a third season and

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.360 
don't see it having a third season and
that's<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:32.600> because<00:04:32.810> it<00:04:33.740> doesn't<00:04:34.130> seem<00:04:34.310> to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
that's just because it doesn't seem to

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.250 
that's just because it doesn't seem to
have<00:04:34.550> enough<00:04:34.700> action<00:04:35.300> although<00:04:35.600> it's<00:04:35.900> good

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
have enough action although it's good

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.560 
have enough action although it's good
writing<00:04:36.620> it's<00:04:37.070> not<00:04:37.280> fantastic<00:04:37.790> it's<00:04:38.210> smart

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
writing it's not fantastic it's smart

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.260 
writing it's not fantastic it's smart
riding<00:04:38.990> but<00:04:39.470> it's<00:04:39.620> not<00:04:40.060> something<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.090> i

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
riding but it's not something that i

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.720 
riding but it's not something that i
think<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.870> people<00:04:41.990> are<00:04:42.260> really<00:04:42.830> really<00:04:43.460> in

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
think that people are really really in

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.640 
think that people are really really in
love<00:04:43.760> with<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.390> want<00:04:44.420> to<00:04:44.720> keep<00:04:44.900> seeing<00:04:44.960> more

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
love with and want to keep seeing more

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.240 
love with and want to keep seeing more
of<00:04:45.910> but<00:04:46.910> overall<00:04:47.300> it's<00:04:48.140> a<00:04:48.260> good<00:04:48.410> anime<00:04:48.770> series

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
of but overall it's a good anime series

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.720 
of but overall it's a good anime series
and<00:04:49.520> i<00:04:50.240> give<00:04:50.480> it<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.900> eight<00:04:51.470> out<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:51.770> 10<00:04:52.100> i<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.400> mean

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
and i give it a eight out of 10 i I mean

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.070 
and i give it a eight out of 10 i I mean
I<00:04:52.760> think<00:04:52.910> it's<00:04:53.150> good<00:04:53.420> i<00:04:53.450> don't<00:04:53.690> think<00:04:53.960> it's

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
I think it's good i don't think it's

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.960 
I think it's good i don't think it's
great<00:04:54.260> but<00:04:54.470> i<00:04:55.070> think<00:04:55.310> it's<00:04:55.430> good<00:04:55.610> and<00:04:55.730> i<00:04:55.790> think

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
great but i think it's good and i think

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.370 
great but i think it's good and i think
it's<00:04:56.060> a<00:04:56.120> little<00:04:56.390> better<00:04:56.510> than<00:04:56.810> seven<00:04:57.200> it's

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
it's a little better than seven it's

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.860 
it's a little better than seven it's
above<00:04:57.650> average<00:04:57.920> but<00:04:58.580> it's<00:04:58.700> not<00:04:58.880> fantastic<00:04:59.450> and

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
above average but it's not fantastic and

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.810 
above average but it's not fantastic and
i<00:04:59.960> think<00:05:00.290> that<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:00.860> need<00:05:01.250> I<00:05:01.430> think<00:05:01.670> I<00:05:01.760> need
