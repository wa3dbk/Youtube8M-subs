00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
first off it's not a very efficient

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.760 
first off it's not a very efficient
quick-release<00:01:15.479> plate<00:01:15.659> because<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.409> doesn't

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
quick-release plate because it doesn't

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.649 
quick-release plate because it doesn't

they<00:01:30.689> twist<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.079> all<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> way<00:01:31.380> back<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.829> then

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
they twist it all the way back and then

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.859 
they twist it all the way back and then
you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.640> get<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.909> out<00:01:33.060> now<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.689> nice<00:01:33.840> thing

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you can get it out now the nice thing

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.460 
you can get it out now the nice thing
about<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.520> does<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:36.180> flush<00:01:36.509> with

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
about it is that it does go flush with

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.319 
about it is that it does go flush with
the<00:01:37.650> fly<00:01:37.799> cam<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.549> I've<00:01:38.700> done<00:01:38.880> though<00:01:39.090> is

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the fly cam what I've done though is

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.460 
the fly cam what I've done though is
I've<00:01:40.170> taken<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.860> Manfrotto<00:01:41.460> RC<00:01:42.030> 2<00:01:42.240> adapter<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
I've taken a Manfrotto RC 2 adapter the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440 
I've taken a Manfrotto RC 2 adapter the
entire<00:01:43.860> quick<00:01:44.220> release<00:01:44.520> mount<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.060> I've

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
entire quick release mount and I've

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.389 
entire quick release mount and I've
mounted<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.439> fly<00:01:46.649> cam<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
mounted it to the fly cam that was a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.980 
mounted it to the fly cam that was a
little<00:01:47.520> bit<00:01:47.670> tricky<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.030> put<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.420> because<00:01:48.780> on

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
little bit tricky to put on because on

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 
little bit tricky to put on because on
the<00:01:49.079> Manfrotto<00:01:49.590> RC<00:01:49.920> 2<00:01:50.100> quick-release<00:01:50.579> plate

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the Manfrotto RC 2 quick-release plate

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.639 
the Manfrotto RC 2 quick-release plate
you<00:01:51.299> got<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> little<00:01:51.720> notch<00:01:52.079> that's<00:01:52.530> your

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
you got this little notch that's your

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.800 
you got this little notch that's your
locking<00:01:53.070> mechanism<00:01:53.610> down<00:01:54.149> here<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.689> if

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
locking mechanism down here and if

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.240 
locking mechanism down here and if
you're<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.990> mount<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.590> track<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you're a mount on the track in the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.130 
you're a mount on the track in the
direction<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> track<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.570> this

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
direction that the track is going this

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.039 
direction that the track is going this
would<00:01:58.680> keep<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.100> from<00:01:59.340> going<00:01:59.549> flush<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.329> so

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
would keep it from going flush and so

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.260 
would keep it from going flush and so
I've<00:02:01.469> put<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> white<00:02:02.549> washers<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
I've put one of the white washers that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.300 
I've put one of the white washers that
the<00:02:03.509> fly<00:02:03.689> cam<00:02:03.930> Nano<00:02:04.140> comes<00:02:04.439> with<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.890> between

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the fly cam Nano comes with in between

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.399 
the fly cam Nano comes with in between
the<00:02:05.460> balancing<00:02:05.969> plate<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.719> RC<00:02:07.079> 2

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
the balancing plate and the RC 2

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.619 
the balancing plate and the RC 2
after<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.489> way<00:02:08.729> I've<00:02:09.149> been<00:02:09.300> able<00:02:09.479> to

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
after and in that way I've been able to

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.229 
after and in that way I've been able to
offset<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.530> rc2<00:02:10.920> adapter<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.000> fits

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
offset the rc2 adapter so that it fits

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.390 
offset the rc2 adapter so that it fits
right<00:02:12.720> on<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.349> balancing<00:02:13.830> head<00:02:14.040> now<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
right on to the balancing head now the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.559 
right on to the balancing head now the
really<00:02:14.550> cool<00:02:14.640> thing<00:02:14.910> about<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.180> Manfrotto

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
really cool thing about the Manfrotto

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.180 
really cool thing about the Manfrotto
rc2<00:02:15.989> adapter<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.739> has<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> locking

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
rc2 adapter is that it has a locking

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.400 
rc2 adapter is that it has a locking
mechanism<00:02:17.720> which<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.870> quick-release<00:02:19.110> plate

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
mechanism which is a quick-release plate

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.890 
mechanism which is a quick-release plate
that<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> fly<00:02:20.190> cam<00:02:20.430> nano<00:02:20.580> comes<00:02:20.910> with<00:02:21.180> doesn't

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
that the fly cam nano comes with doesn't

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.330 
that the fly cam nano comes with doesn't
have<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.129> essence<00:02:23.549> I<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:24.360> lock<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.840> and

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
have so in essence I can lock it and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.369 
have so in essence I can lock it and
unlock<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:26.879> when<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.030> lock<00:02:27.299> it<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.900> will<00:02:28.170> not

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
unlock it so when I lock it it will not

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.250 
unlock it so when I lock it it will not
come<00:02:28.860> off<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:29.459> if<00:02:29.610> i<00:02:29.760> unlock<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.629> can<00:02:31.110> move

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
come off but if i unlock it I can move

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.460 
come off but if i unlock it I can move
this<00:02:31.440> latch<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.099> release<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.000> plate<00:02:33.470> which

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
you have the fly cam push all the way up

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.210 
you have the fly cam push all the way up
this<00:03:09.359> knob<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.900> constantly<00:03:10.620> getting<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.099> the

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
this knob is constantly getting in the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.740 
this knob is constantly getting in the
way<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.400> it's<00:03:11.730> hard<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.000> twist<00:03:12.269> because<00:03:12.450> of

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
way and it's hard to twist because of

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.050 
way and it's hard to twist because of
these<00:03:13.470> two<00:03:13.739> weight<00:03:13.980> holders<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.880> weight

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
these two weight holders and the weight

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.210 
these two weight holders and the weight
holders<00:03:15.540> are<00:03:15.750> another<00:03:16.290> issue<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.859> keep<00:03:17.099> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
holders are another issue I keep the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.680 
holders are another issue I keep the
weight<00:03:17.370> holders<00:03:17.639> on<00:03:17.790> here<00:03:18.030> because<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.299> have<00:03:18.569> it

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
weight holders on here because I have it

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.180 
weight holders on here because I have it
balanced<00:03:19.079> for<00:03:19.290> my<00:03:19.380> wide-angle<00:03:19.859> lens<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
balanced for my wide-angle lens and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.710 
balanced for my wide-angle lens and
that's<00:03:20.310> all<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.519> use<00:03:20.609> on<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.150> but<00:03:21.359> if<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.510> were<00:03:21.630> to

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
that's all I use on it but if I were to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.030 
that's all I use on it but if I were to
mount<00:03:21.900> an<00:03:21.989> external<00:03:22.410> microphone<00:03:22.590> or

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
mount an external microphone or

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.620 
mount an external microphone or
something<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.400> my<00:03:23.519> camera<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.060> would<00:03:24.329> be<00:03:24.419> more

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
something to my camera I would be more

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.120 
something to my camera I would be more
weights<00:03:24.810> at<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.049> bottom<00:03:25.319> which<00:03:25.769> means<00:03:25.919> that<00:03:26.069> I

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
weights at the bottom which means that I

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.120 
weights at the bottom which means that I
have<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.459> unscrew<00:03:27.299> both<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.440> these<00:03:28.530> plates<00:03:28.829> and

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
have to unscrew both of these plates and

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.400 
have to unscrew both of these plates and
add<00:03:29.669> more<00:03:29.970> weights<00:03:30.299> down<00:03:30.450> here<00:03:30.870> does<00:03:31.169> come

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
add more weights down here does come

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.750 
add more weights down here does come
with<00:03:31.560> plenty<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.859> weights<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.430> even<00:03:32.609> comes

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
with plenty of weights and it even comes

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.819 
with plenty of weights and it even comes
with<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.030> second<00:03:33.450> stackable<00:03:33.959> level<00:03:34.349> where<00:03:34.769> you

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
with a second stackable level where you

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.559 
with a second stackable level where you
can<00:03:34.950> put<00:03:35.069> more<00:03:35.250> weights<00:03:35.549> on<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.120> quickest

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
can put more weights on it the quickest

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.849 
can put more weights on it the quickest
thing<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.109> do<00:03:37.260> though<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.680> just

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
thing that you can do though is just

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.069 
thing that you can do though is just
take<00:03:38.250> these<00:03:38.430> plastic<00:03:39.090> weight<00:03:39.389> holders<00:03:39.840> off

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
take these plastic weight holders off

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.990 
take these plastic weight holders off
and<00:03:40.470> then<00:03:40.650> put<00:03:40.829> bolts<00:03:41.010> down<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.669> tighten<00:03:41.970> your

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
and then put bolts down to tighten your

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.970 
and then put bolts down to tighten your
weights<00:03:42.329> down<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:43.109> you<00:03:43.290> can<00:03:43.410> quickly<00:03:43.680> take

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
weights down so you can quickly take

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.099 
weights down so you can quickly take
them<00:03:44.190> off<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.730> on<00:03:44.910> that's<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.660> quickest<00:03:45.989> way

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
them off and on that's the quickest way

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.300 
them off and on that's the quickest way
to<00:03:46.139> do<00:03:46.349> it<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.650> other<00:03:46.799> thing<00:03:46.919> about<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.160> fly

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
to do it the other thing about the fly

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.449 
to do it the other thing about the fly
cam<00:03:47.579> is<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.389> comes<00:03:48.599> loose<00:03:49.280> fairly<00:03:50.280> easily

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
cam is that it comes loose fairly easily

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.800 
cam is that it comes loose fairly easily
you<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.120> make<00:03:51.359> sure<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.630> it's<00:03:51.780> tight

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
you have to make sure that it's tight

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.080 
you have to make sure that it's tight
every<00:03:52.500> time<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.889> use<00:03:53.099> it<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.400> that's<00:03:53.790> tight

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
every time you use it and that's tight

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.180 
every time you use it and that's tight
here<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.599> tight<00:03:55.260> up<00:03:55.410> here<00:03:55.440> where<00:03:55.859> you<00:03:55.950> have<00:03:55.980> an

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
the head the very first time that I

the head the very first time that I
tried<00:03:59.790> to<00:04:00.120> use<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:00.359> these<00:04:01.169> were<00:04:01.620> not

tried to use it these were not
tightening<00:04:02.340> tight<00:04:02.609> for<00:04:02.849> some<00:04:03.030> reason<00:04:03.389> and<00:04:03.590> the

tightening tight for some reason and the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.250 
tightening tight for some reason and the
whole<00:04:04.769> head<00:04:05.040> was<00:04:05.069> kind<00:04:05.430> of<00:04:05.579> bouncing

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
whole head was kind of bouncing

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.320 
whole head was kind of bouncing
every<00:04:06.620> few<00:04:06.800> steps<00:04:07.099> and<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:07.849> was<00:04:07.879> making<00:04:08.239> the

have to be very very careful because the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
back and forth just slightly which will

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.120 
back and forth just slightly which will
ruin<00:04:17.090> some<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:17.449> the<00:04:17.510> glass<00:04:17.810> smooth<00:04:18.350> movement

and<00:05:26.539> style<00:05:27.139> with<00:05:27.889> the<00:05:28.039> fly<00:05:28.220> cam<00:05:28.460> Nano<00:05:28.729> that<00:05:29.060> you

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
and style with the fly cam Nano that you

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.210 
and style with the fly cam Nano that you
can<00:05:29.419> with<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:29.930> glide<00:05:30.110> cam<00:05:30.380> however<00:05:30.919> you're

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
can with the glide cam however you're

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.040 
can with the glide cam however you're
not<00:05:31.370> getting<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:31.669> structural<00:05:32.240> quality<00:05:32.870> of

not getting the structural quality of
the<00:05:33.470> glide<00:05:33.680> cam<00:05:33.950> and<00:05:34.250> that's<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.700> biggest

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
the glide cam and that's the biggest

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.120 
the glide cam and that's the biggest
difference<00:05:35.300> so<00:05:35.990> if<00:05:36.440> you<00:05:36.620> decide<00:05:36.860> to<00:05:36.979> buy<00:05:37.070> the

three<00:06:19.990> seconds<00:06:20.380> for<00:06:20.560> it<00:06:20.650> to<00:06:20.770> go<00:06:20.919> all<00:06:21.310> the<00:06:21.639> way

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
three seconds for it to go all the way

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.670 
three seconds for it to go all the way
down<00:06:21.970> and<00:06:22.300> it<00:06:22.630> shouldn't<00:06:22.960> go<00:06:23.050> back<00:06:23.199> and<00:06:23.470> forth

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
down and it shouldn't go back and forth

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.089 
tighten up all four bolts again in this
way<00:07:12.669> you<00:07:12.729> can<00:07:12.970> very<00:07:13.360> quickly<00:07:13.949> balance<00:07:14.949> your

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:15.099 
way you can very quickly balance your

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:17.010 
way you can very quickly balance your
camera<00:07:15.430> using<00:07:15.729> this<00:07:15.970> technique<00:07:16.389> I'm<00:07:16.630> able<00:07:16.990> to

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.020 
camera using this technique I'm able to

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.080 
camera using this technique I'm able to
balance<00:07:17.229> it<00:07:17.560> sometimes<00:07:17.949> between<00:07:18.250> one<00:07:18.729> minute

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090 
balance it sometimes between one minute

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.909 
balance it sometimes between one minute
and<00:07:19.210> five<00:07:19.659> minutes<00:07:19.900> which<00:07:20.440> saves<00:07:20.650> a<00:07:20.740> lot<00:07:20.860> of

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 
and five minutes which saves a lot of

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:23.310 
and five minutes which saves a lot of
time<00:07:21.039> when<00:07:21.639> a<00:07:21.909> job<00:07:22.180> filming<00:07:22.539> something<00:07:22.990> I<00:07:23.110> hope

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:23.320 
time when a job filming something I hope
