00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.740 

okay<00:00:01.110> we<00:00:01.500> pasted<00:00:02.010> our<00:00:02.550> shoulder<00:00:03.179> on<00:00:03.689> a

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
okay we pasted our shoulder on a

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.749 
okay we pasted our shoulder on a
separate<00:00:04.230> layer<00:00:04.410> here<00:00:04.710> as<00:00:04.920> you<00:00:05.040> can<00:00:05.069> see<00:00:05.250> and

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
separate layer here as you can see and

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.940 
separate layer here as you can see and
now<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:06.420> need<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.690> flip<00:00:07.020> it<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.350> was<00:00:07.799> having

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
now we need to flip it I was having

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.600 
now we need to flip it I was having
problems<00:00:08.460> before<00:00:08.610> because<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.719> was<00:00:09.870> going<00:00:10.170> to

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
problems before because I was going to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.330 
problems before because I was going to
image<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.969> then<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.139> was<00:00:13.380> trying<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.710> transform

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
image and then I was trying to transform

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.029 
image and then I was trying to transform
and<00:00:14.639> flip<00:00:14.820> but<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.630> will<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:16.170> all<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.800> layers

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
and flip but that will do all the layers

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.429 
and flip but that will do all the layers
together<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.390> if<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.600> try<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.170> there

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
together so if you try to do that there

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.810 
together so if you try to do that there
it'll<00:00:19.619> do<00:00:19.770> all<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.070> layers<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.640> didn't

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
it'll do all the layers so we didn't

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.429 
it'll do all the layers so we didn't
want<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.420> what<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> go

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
want that so what you have to do is go

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.170 
want that so what you have to do is go
to<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.680> specific<00:00:23.220> layer<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> click<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
to the specific layer so I click on the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.099 
to the specific layer so I click on the
layer<00:00:24.359> go<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.410> specific<00:00:25.980> layer<00:00:26.250> menu<00:00:26.580> and

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
layer go to the specific layer menu and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.640 
layer go to the specific layer menu and
then<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.410> go<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.789> transform<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.260> then<00:00:31.260> flip

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
then we go to transform and then flip

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.100 
then we go to transform and then flip
horizontally<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.570> flips<00:00:33.840> this

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
horizontally and that just flips this

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.620 
horizontally and that just flips this
shoulder<00:00:34.620> then<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.730> get<00:00:35.850> my<00:00:35.910> move<00:00:36.300> tool

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
shoulder then I can get my move tool

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.200 
shoulder then I can get my move tool
from<00:00:36.870> over<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.760> move<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
from over here and I can move it to the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
from over here and I can move it to the
other<00:00:39.239> side<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.469> turn<00:00:40.829> my<00:00:41.040> background

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
other side I can turn my background

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.360 
other side I can turn my background
eyeball<00:00:42.000> back<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.860> move<00:00:44.160> this

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
eyeball back on here I can move this

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
eyeball back on here I can move this
into<00:00:44.550> position<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.379> want<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> rotate<00:00:47.070> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
into position and I want to rotate it

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.610 
into position and I want to rotate it
slightly<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:48.239> once<00:00:48.420> again<00:00:48.690> also<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.140> need<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> go

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
slightly so once again also I need to go

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.020 
slightly so once again also I need to go
to<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> layer<00:00:50.129> menu<00:00:50.989> transform<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
to the layer menu transform and

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.810 
to the layer menu transform and
arbitrary<00:00:54.030> rotation<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.140> want<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.820> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
arbitrary rotation is what I want and to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.369 
arbitrary rotation is what I want and to
do<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.180> I'll<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.660> move<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.050> out<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
do that I'll just move this out of the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:58.790 
do that I'll just move this out of the
way

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
way

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.119 
way
and<00:00:59.359> I<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:01.289> right<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.649> here

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
and I can go right in here

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.600 
and I can go right in here
and<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.180> rotate<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.930> slightly<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.460> what

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and I can rotate this slightly and what

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.910 
and I can rotate this slightly and what
I<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.060> I've<00:01:06.180> done<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.659> go<00:01:07.470> back<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
I like what I've done I go back to the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310 
I like what I've done I go back to the
window<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.549> click<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> rotate<00:01:09.930> button

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
window and click on the rotate button

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.929 
window and click on the rotate button
and<00:01:11.189> now<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.520> done

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and now it's done

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.140 
and now it's done
I<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.780> my<00:01:12.900> move<00:01:13.110> tool<00:01:13.380> once<00:01:13.650> again<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.970> can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
I get my move tool once again and I can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.940 
I get my move tool once again and I can
move<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.570> shoulder<00:01:15.990> into<00:01:16.979> place<00:01:17.299> I<00:01:18.920> need<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
move the shoulder into place I need a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.700 
move the shoulder into place I need a
little<00:01:20.159> erasing<00:01:20.909> here<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.840> smoothen<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.409> some

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
little erasing here to smoothen out some

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.820 
little erasing here to smoothen out some
of<00:01:22.799> these<00:01:22.890> areas<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:24.150> once<00:01:25.020> again<00:01:25.170> I'm<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.619> I

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
of these areas so once again I'm on I

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.130 
of these areas so once again I'm on I
make<00:01:26.130> sure<00:01:26.280> I'm<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.549> right<00:01:26.759> layer<00:01:27.030> grab<00:01:27.960> my

around<00:01:33.479> some<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:34.560> areas<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.430> give<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.729> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
around some of these areas to give it a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.710 
around some of these areas to give it a
cleaner<00:01:36.119> edge<00:01:38.119> especially<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.420> shadow

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
cleaner edge especially on this shadow

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.310 
cleaner edge especially on this shadow
here<00:01:40.189> right<00:01:41.189> by<00:01:41.369> her<00:01:41.549> hair<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.020> erase

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
here right by her hair if I can erase

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.319 
here right by her hair if I can erase
just<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.430> that'll<00:01:45.299> be

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
just a little bit of that that'll be

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.520 
just a little bit of that that'll be
more<00:01:45.600> realistic

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.490 

we'll<00:01:50.190> race<00:01:50.369> here<00:01:50.760> loose<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.840> don't<00:01:52.229> want

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
we'll race here loose there I don't want

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.380 
we'll race here loose there I don't want
to<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.650> too<00:01:52.710> far<00:01:53.190> because<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.760> go<00:01:53.909> too<00:01:53.970> far

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
to go too far because if I go too far

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.450 
to go too far because if I go too far
the<00:01:55.049> white<00:01:55.260> will<00:01:55.470> start<00:01:55.770> showing<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.159> again

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the white will start showing up again

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
the white will start showing up again
when<00:01:57.210> I'm<00:01:57.330> happy<00:01:57.720> with<00:01:57.840> it

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
when I'm happy with it

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.420 
when I'm happy with it
I<00:01:58.290> call<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.400> good<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.950> time<00:02:02.190> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
I call it all good and and it's time to
