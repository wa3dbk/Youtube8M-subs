rough teenager and then he got into the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.240 
rough teenager and then he got into the
ranks<00:02:38.420> of<00:02:38.540> Yakuza<00:02:38.870> but<00:02:39.170> nope<00:02:39.710> there's<00:02:39.980> none<00:02:40.130> of

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
ranks of Yakuza but nope there's none of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.470 
ranks of Yakuza but nope there's none of
that<00:02:40.280> it's<00:02:40.610> more<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.970> family<00:02:41.210> that's

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
that it's more of a family that's

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.720 
that it's more of a family that's
ingrained<00:02:41.930> already<00:02:42.320> established<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.460> they

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
ingrained already established and they

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.990 
ingrained already established and they
are<00:02:44.000> here<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:45.080> sit<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.800> not<00:02:46.400> be<00:02:46.580> messed<00:02:46.880> with

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
are here to sit and not be messed with

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.480 
are here to sit and not be messed with
so<00:02:47.540> that's<00:02:47.780> pretty<00:02:48.260> much<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.560> vibe<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
so that's pretty much the vibe of the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.580 
so that's pretty much the vibe of the
entire<00:02:49.790> film<00:02:50.060> there's<00:02:50.300> no<00:02:50.420> buildup<00:02:50.990> there's

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
entire film there's no buildup there's

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.970 
entire film there's no buildup there's
the<00:02:51.740> more<00:02:51.950> family<00:02:52.990> orientation<00:02:53.990> rather<00:02:54.800> than

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
the more family orientation rather than

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.090 
the more family orientation rather than
a<00:02:55.210> individual<00:02:56.210> on<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:57.050> bossman<00:02:57.320> sort<00:02:58.010> of

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
a individual on the bossman sort of

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.130 
a individual on the bossman sort of
thing<00:02:58.280> one<00:02:58.670> could<00:02:58.880> say<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.150> all<00:02:59.510> that

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
thing one could say that all that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.350 
thing one could say that all that
laughter<00:03:00.740> characterization<00:03:01.550> but<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.760> think<00:03:02.060> it

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
laughter characterization but I think it

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.820 
laughter characterization but I think it
was<00:03:02.510> done<00:03:02.720> well<00:03:02.990> because<00:03:03.230> there<00:03:03.380> are<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:03.500> many

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
was done well because there are so many

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.550 
was done well because there are so many
people<00:03:04.390> within<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.720> family<00:03:05.960> that<00:03:06.320> you

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560
