00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.640 
I'll explain later but there's a little
mussel<00:00:34.940> back<00:00:35.120> here<00:00:35.449> and<00:00:35.840> you<00:00:36.079> need<00:00:36.230> to<00:00:36.410> pull

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
different then the actual it will be

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.100

really<00:00:59.469> slimy<00:01:01.420> then<00:01:02.420> you<00:01:02.570> need<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.899> Pat<00:01:03.170> them<00:01:03.379> a

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
really slimy then you need to Pat them a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.690 
really slimy then you need to Pat them a
little<00:01:04.100> bit<00:01:04.250> but<00:01:04.489> these<00:01:04.699> are<00:01:04.879> perfect<00:01:06.700> okay

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700

now<00:01:08.420> we're<00:01:08.659> gonna<00:01:08.719> do<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.020> rub<00:01:09.319> and<00:01:11.259> I<00:01:12.259> just<00:01:12.560> like

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
now we're gonna do a rub and I just like

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.230 
now we're gonna do a rub and I just like
this<00:01:12.950> I<00:01:13.069> think<00:01:13.280> it<00:01:13.399> you<00:01:13.579> know<00:01:13.670> it<00:01:13.759> takes<00:01:13.999> five

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
this I think it you know it takes five

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.739 
this I think it you know it takes five
seconds<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:15.109> throw<00:01:15.319> it<00:01:15.469> together<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:17.060> has

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
seconds to throw it together and it has

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:20.109 
seconds to throw it together and it has
the<00:01:18.530> best<00:01:18.740> flavor<00:01:19.069> instead<00:01:19.399> of<00:01:19.609> using<00:01:19.939> one<00:01:20.090> of

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
the best flavor instead of using one of

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.260 
the best flavor instead of using one of
those<00:01:20.709> store-bought<00:01:21.709> ones<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.060> we're<00:01:23.179> gonna

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
those store-bought ones so we're gonna
