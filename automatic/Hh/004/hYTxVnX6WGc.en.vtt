00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:03.940
 Harmon get to why Leo Wolf 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.200
 So many an explanation 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.079
 Baumer I now not only Bio Rolf van Gerner Ho and 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.939
 not come to these 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.309
 already seen some lines Chernitz yes special explanation already 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.739
 in there and I thought Oh my something in between 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.909
 we give away Christ figure I try 4 place to take 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.880
 So that was pretty much a Paul pretty soon explained the reward 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.050
 and set because Aldi and Videoton for somehow already on YouTube 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.100
 was occupied 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.100
 I've just got what I'm looking for 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.220
 usually Heisig 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.180
 that Heitmann ECG only Bio Wulff 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.180
 because I can agree with these peace ahead are good life 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.020
 and 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.020
 to here well 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.260
 showing me was relative thanks to me 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
 many scare off Pratteln 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.080
 at different treasures and has in different thick emissions 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.650
 everything that belongs to 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.860
 and the old Nicknames Union stayed new for too long I pondered and 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.740
 something special 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 I thought somehow in the combination 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.910
 So Leo Tag the Storen 2008 durable 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.030
 the layman so well shortcut Solino of 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.580
 lead up a bit 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.190
 and I thought so percent Leo the pro such a combination is this Leo 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.750
 actually 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
 so it should not lose sight direct meaning 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.040
 So Menzel I'm not 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.330
 Lion Wulff 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
 and worst of all, I'm a wolf, especially no lies 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 because he wrote for Google, not with 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.610
 so no wolf 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.510
 from a Wulff 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.810
 what Oliver high no laws still do not explain 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.810
 that just fell to me so a report advantage no wolf 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.849
 I have you 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.849
 so this short explanation so a bit 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.589
 big comes from and because it falls 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.129
 and I hope you 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.009
 Stop what I do 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.009
 and I got here open on my other spot 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:31.529
 stop Leo Wolf where I do my dvd videos and 3 the other things 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.529
 on it 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:39.399
 with these times it was just like Aigner idea report he was that in the 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.399
 new video did that 8 years but since 8 years 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:46.369
 I think so after this Digimon variant as a kind of development 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.819
 That's what I do before putting as Digimon extension 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:55.349
 I hope he finds the one so halfway jerk funny and 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.169
 Kuck but for the second shell with so 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.389
 Magma Leo Wulff 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.439
 without 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.309
 the led lights also necessarily set 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.309
 Here you can enjoy the fireplace pulling CAS 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.949
 and many a Schloss Hoffmann second channel is a lot of fun 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:16.539
 SchÃ¼es yesterday
