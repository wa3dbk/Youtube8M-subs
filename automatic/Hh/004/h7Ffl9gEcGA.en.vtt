00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.930 
this a completely depleted resource
today<00:00:57.559> there's<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.620> convergence<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.280> risk<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
today there's a convergence of risk and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.090 
today there's a convergence of risk and
there's<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.390> convergence<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.930> opportunity<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
there's a convergence of opportunity and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
there's a convergence of opportunity and
while<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.699> talk<00:01:02.879> about<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.329> global<00:01:03.510> water

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
while we talk about the global water

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.170 
while we talk about the global water
crisis<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.250> impacts<00:01:05.610> are<00:01:05.790> really<00:01:05.970> felt

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
crisis the impacts are really felt

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420 
crisis the impacts are really felt
locally<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.810> regionally

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
locally and regionally

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.870 
locally and regionally
so<00:01:09.000> there's<00:01:09.180> investable<00:01:09.870> opportunities

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
so there's investable opportunities

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:19.539 
so there's investable opportunities
everywhere<00:01:11.930> for<00:01:12.930> innovation<00:01:13.440> and<00:01:14.070> ingenuity

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.789 

the<00:01:20.149> way<00:01:20.299> we<00:01:20.479> look<00:01:20.630> at<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.990> market<00:01:21.200> is<00:01:21.590> that

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
the way we look at the market is that

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:22.779 
the way we look at the market is that
there's<00:01:21.979> three<00:01:22.280> different<00:01:22.460> categories

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
there's three different categories

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.270 
there's three different categories
there's<00:01:23.420> water<00:01:23.630> utilities<00:01:24.229> there's<00:01:24.890> water

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
there's water utilities there's water

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.410 
there's water utilities there's water
