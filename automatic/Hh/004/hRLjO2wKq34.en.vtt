about<00:00:09.210> six<00:00:09.599> years<00:00:09.929> now<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:11.179> started<00:00:12.200> six<00:00:13.200> years

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
about six years now I started six years

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.210 
about six years now I started six years
ago<00:00:13.500> today<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:15.379> yeah<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.619> would<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:16.920> six

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
ago today so yeah that would be six

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.099 
ago today so yeah that would be six
years<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:20.220> when<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.640> first<00:00:21.029> started<00:00:21.420> them<00:00:21.930> i

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
years and when I first started them i

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.359 
years and when I first started them i
was<00:00:22.350> using<00:00:22.650> annie's<00:00:23.609> onyx<00:00:24.060> webcam<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.960> i

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
was using annie's onyx webcam and i

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.849 
was using annie's onyx webcam and i
recorded<00:00:26.369> them<00:00:26.580> at<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.849> resolution<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.779> 160<00:00:28.680> x

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
recorded them at a resolution of 160 x

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.999 
recorded them at a resolution of 160 x
120<00:00:29.900> because<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.230> all<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.560> webcam

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
120 because that was all the webcam

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.860 
120 because that was all the webcam
could<00:00:32.250> handle<00:00:32.640> without<00:00:32.790> making<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.540> frame

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
could handle without making the frame

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.600 
could handle without making the frame
right<00:00:34.370> go<00:00:35.370> all<00:00:35.750> slow<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.290> after<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.550> I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
right go all slow so after that I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.510 
right go all slow so after that I
eventually<00:00:42.090> moved<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.050> better<00:00:43.530> webcam<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
eventually moved on to better webcam and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.130 
eventually moved on to better webcam and
recorded<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> 320<00:00:46.140> x<00:00:46.379> 240<00:00:47.450> but<00:00:48.450> after<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.960> all

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
recorded it 320 x 240 but after of all

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.060 
recorded it 320 x 240 but after of all
that<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:50.329> kind<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.510> was<00:00:52.350> too<00:00:52.710> small<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
that a kind of was too small a

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.459 
that a kind of was too small a
resolution<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.210> i<00:00:55.520> eventually<00:00:56.520> bought<00:00:57.469> this

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
resolution so i eventually bought this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.579 
resolution so i eventually bought this
webcam<00:00:59.480> which<00:01:00.480> records<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.260> 640<00:01:01.980> x<00:01:02.160> 480<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.149> I

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
webcam which records at 640 x 480 but I

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.570 
webcam which records at 640 x 480 but I
lower<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.189> 480<00:01:05.880> x<00:01:06.210> 360<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:08.400> you're

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
lower that to 480 x 360 and if you're

there and well I turned a couple of old
stories<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.030> wrote<00:02:29.070> probably<00:02:30.810> over<00:02:31.810> 10

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
stories that I wrote probably over 10

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.990 
stories that I wrote probably over 10
years<00:02:32.350> ago<00:02:32.910> maybe<00:02:33.910> more<00:02:34.800> into<00:02:35.800> ebooks<00:02:36.670> and

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
years ago maybe more into ebooks and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.400 
years ago maybe more into ebooks and
published<00:02:37.690> them<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:38.050> there<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:39.450> had<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.690> add

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
published them on there I had to add

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
published them on there I had to add
more<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.670> one<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.360> ebooks<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.400> rename<00:02:45.400> it

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
more to one of the ebooks and rename it

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
more to one of the ebooks and rename it
because<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.870> wasn't<00:02:47.320> really<00:02:47.940> not<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.090> long

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
because it wasn't really not that long

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.870 
because it wasn't really not that long
and<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.050> wanted<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.650> add<00:02:51.130> more<00:02:51.519> to<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.760> story

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
and I wanted to add more to the story

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.270 
and I wanted to add more to the story
but<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:54.340> first<00:02:54.610> one<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:54.970> just<00:02:55.390> basically

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
but the first one I just basically

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.430 
but the first one I just basically
didn't<00:02:57.280> edit<00:02:57.549> or<00:02:57.880> didn't<00:02:58.150> add<00:02:58.360> any<00:02:58.720> more<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:59.290> it

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
four now I've been messing around with

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.090 
four now I've been messing around with
it<00:04:03.450> it's<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.660> good<00:04:04.870> game<00:04:05.200> but<00:04:05.260> one<00:04:05.830> of<00:04:05.980> the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
it it's a good game but one of the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.890 
it it's a good game but one of the
things<00:04:06.130> that<00:04:06.520> I<00:04:06.760> don't<00:04:06.820> really<00:04:07.180> like<00:04:07.300> about<00:04:07.750> it

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
things that I don't really like about it

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.890 
things that I don't really like about it
is<00:04:08.320> that<00:04:08.520> when<00:04:09.520> you're<00:04:09.670> driving<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.300> camera

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
is that when you're driving the camera

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.240 
is that when you're driving the camera
angle<00:04:11.290> doesn't<00:04:11.530> stay<00:04:11.950> locked<00:04:12.370> behind<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.420> car

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
angle doesn't stay locked behind the car

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.130 
angle doesn't stay locked behind the car
you<00:04:15.250> have<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.520> kind<00:04:15.700> of<00:04:15.880> manually<00:04:16.660> turn<00:04:16.989> the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
you have to kind of manually turn the

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.280 
you have to kind of manually turn the
camera<00:04:17.560> with<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.980> mouse<00:04:18.190> or<00:04:19.060> you're<00:04:19.690> driving

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
camera with the mouse or you're driving

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.500 
camera with the mouse or you're driving
in<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.920> previous<00:04:21.310> versions<00:04:21.910> of<00:04:22.090> Grand<00:04:22.420> Theft

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
in the previous versions of Grand Theft

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.440 
in the previous versions of Grand Theft
Auto<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.890> camera<00:04:24.340> would<00:04:24.460> stay<00:04:24.730> locked<00:04:25.030> behind

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
Auto the camera would stay locked behind

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.020 
Auto the camera would stay locked behind
the<00:04:25.870> car<00:04:26.110> so<00:04:27.010> that<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:27.370> can<00:04:27.520> see<00:04:27.760> where<00:04:28.000> you're

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
the car so that you can see where you're

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.680 
the car so that you can see where you're
going<00:04:28.240> at<00:04:28.870> all<00:04:29.080> times<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:30.820> doesn't<00:04:31.210> do<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.480> in

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
going at all times it doesn't do that in

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.490 
going at all times it doesn't do that in
this<00:04:31.870> version<00:04:32.169> though<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:33.780> guess<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.990> gameplay

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
this version though I guess the gameplay

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.990 
this version though I guess the gameplay
kind<00:04:36.220> of<00:04:36.310> requires<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:38.130> shoot<00:04:39.130> out<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:39.610> the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
kind of requires you to shoot out of the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.820 
kind of requires you to shoot out of the
window<00:04:40.390> and<00:04:42.810> requires<00:04:43.810> you<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.230> use<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.650> mouse

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
window and requires you to use the mouse

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.159 
window and requires you to use the mouse
to<00:04:44.890> turn<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.669> camera<00:04:46.000> angles<00:04:46.360> inch<00:04:46.630> inseam

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
to turn the camera angles inch inseam

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.940 
to turn the camera angles inch inseam
what<00:04:48.010> you're<00:04:48.310> shooting<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:49.590> not<00:04:50.590> when<00:04:50.800> you're

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
what you're shooting it not when you're

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.320 
what you're shooting it not when you're
just<00:04:51.220> driving<00:04:51.580> it's<00:04:52.030> kind<00:04:52.600> of<00:04:52.720> annoying<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.940> I

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
just driving it's kind of annoying and I

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.900 
just driving it's kind of annoying and I
guess<00:04:55.510> that's<00:04:55.750> going<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.140> do<00:04:56.290> it<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.790> think<00:04:57.790> I'm

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
guess that's going to do it I think I'm

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.210 
guess that's going to do it I think I'm
only<00:04:58.060> going<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.419> be<00:04:58.660> making<00:04:58.870> video<00:04:59.410> blogs<00:04:59.680> once
