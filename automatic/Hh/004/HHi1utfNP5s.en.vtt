the<00:03:54.170> repainting<00:03:55.170> he<00:03:55.530> does<00:03:55.769> now<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.610> seems<00:03:56.880> like

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
the repainting he does now it seems like

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.780 
the repainting he does now it seems like
he<00:03:57.300> took<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.600> Dinoco<00:03:58.080> hauler<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.709> then<00:03:59.340> spray

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
he took a Dinoco hauler and then spray

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.360 
he took a Dinoco hauler and then spray
painted<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.600> match<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.140> color<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.709> motor<00:04:02.160> key

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
painted to match the color of motor key

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.479 
painted to match the color of motor key
Pistons<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.030> then<00:04:03.630> repaying<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.890> silver<00:04:05.370> on

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
Pistons and then repaying the silver on

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.810 
Pistons and then repaying the silver on
it<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:05.910> it's<00:04:06.090> not<00:04:06.180> really<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:07.230> best<00:04:07.670> paint<00:04:08.670> I

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
it so it's not really the best paint I

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.790 
it so it's not really the best paint I
I'm<00:04:09.030> just<00:04:09.180> gonna<00:04:09.570> say<00:04:09.750> he's<00:04:09.870> not<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.050> best

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
I'm just gonna say he's not the best

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.100 
I'm just gonna say he's not the best
painter<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.459> world<00:04:11.700> but<00:04:11.940> as<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:12.810> can<00:04:12.989> see

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
painter in the world but as you can see

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.570 
painter in the world but as you can see
it's<00:04:13.260> just<00:04:13.320> kind<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.650> not<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.980> most

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
it's just kind of not the most

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.199 
it's just kind of not the most
consistent<00:04:15.300> paint<00:04:15.540> going<00:04:15.810> on

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209
