00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 i 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.950
 hello how good today we are going to present 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.740
 a very useful support for use or pro if 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.790
 those lovers of cycling or of any 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.610
 another sport in which bars are used 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:23.210
 for example skiing is the support for 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:27.369
 handlebar saddle and so on 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.369
 as you see it contains enough pieces 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:34.300
 and well its price is 25 euros 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.330
 although some go pro catalogs 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.390
 put for 20 other 25 but hey go and 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.790
 oscillating before 20-25 euros 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.840
 well we go as you see we have the 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.030
 open bag 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.740
 loosen the camera a little so you can see 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.740
 well everything that brings us 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.730
 we take everything 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.810
 we leave the bag around here this is in 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.810
 general where it goes what subject 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:13.909
 is adapted for bars between 19 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 centimeters and 3 with 5 I think remember 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.479
 centimeters in diameter is pretty 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.479
 well then there is another one 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.760
 that goes from 3.5 to 65 that 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.670
 would be thing 35 euros well this is very 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.900
 easy to use as you see that what 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 we have to unscrew unscrew 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.100
 pretty and good as you see here I had a 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.869
 small notch 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.210
 and so they expose this 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.980
 screw and set here if we want 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.740
 is placed here and so 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.170
 well and now you will ask yourself why 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.350
 are the rubber parts 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.409
 this for example good because we have taken 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.100
 the side of the screw as you have seen 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:04.119
 you see that this then if you will see it well 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.119
 he has the holes in there 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.210
 between the holes all the holes 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.830
 we have to put this piece 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.770
 but if it costs a bit and they give 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.770
 and this what he does is adapt it to some 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.080
 had a smaller tad before 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.569
 place the other where a little more then 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.439
 the hook always 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.439
 I colocase 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.830
 and good 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.780
 as you go squeezing the basket 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.230
 this kind of cee is closing 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.410
 As you can see, it closes until it adjusts 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.959
 to the Navarrese diameter then we have 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.080
 also this brings two screws one 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:56.490
 long and another short 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.800
 do not confuse camera content worth 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.120
 you have this here so you can place 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.739
 this if you want to expand it 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.140
 but size only that you have to 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.980
 Squeeze it a bit like that inside 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.690
 because it does not come so it looks good 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.560
 tight and do not move even if you have the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.560
 nut a little loose 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.660
 go that's pretty hard 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.170
 Well forgive me for taking so long 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.750
 for good here you can use 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.950
 any of the two miles can 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.950
 use the small one if you want 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.630
 I'm going to use the little one this is 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.120
 nut can be removed if you want too 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.830
 but I recommend you 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.830
 we arrived here is that you leave it here 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.740
 it's worth it and then the other one is placed here 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:59.120
 Up this one better 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.740
 and so this would be the longest you put it 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.069
 here in a bar the bar goes here for 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.469
 Navarre example goes here 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.050
 and here goes the camera let's put now 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:11.630
 an example in a truth bar 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.420
 well let's try the support in a 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.070
 truth bar so you can see their 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.380
 functionality 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.540
 we have placed in this bar this 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.060
 support 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.110
 and we have placed the piece of rubber 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.510
 the fine that it brought to adapt it to the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.730
 perfection that support and also what 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.710
 allows is to remove vibrations even though that 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.300
 support as it will move us does not 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.160
 I need you to remove too many but 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.110
 example on a bicycle if needed 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.720
 that here I saw you versions 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.840
 because if you do not get a screenshot of 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.900
 stable image good and now once 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.670
 let's move a bit so it's like that 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.030
 only the final step is missing 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.460
 our camera go pro are something first 3 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.860
 white since we have made a small 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.560
 boxing explaining the criticisms they bring 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.080
 the episodes etcetera and well you can 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.670
 see if you want me because the link is already 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.620
 has left 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.139
 let's put the camera here 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.360
 As you can see we have placed the two pieces 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.340
 that they brought to the extensions for 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.430
 get a little arm 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.919
 what is very good to focus towards 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.919
 places that are a little further away 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.290
 OK 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.290
 and well, it would be 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.389
 this clear we have to tighten the best 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.780
 it's tight this is no problem anymore 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:41.600
 vibrations or anything 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.720
 Well , you have already seen the usefulness of 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.540
 this little support that does not cost 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.270
 even 30 euros for your camera go 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.990
 pro is super good 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.810
 for the price that it brings is very good 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.240
 necessary parts and good I hope that you 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.450
 have liked the video so up 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.450
 soon
