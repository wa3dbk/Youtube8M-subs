00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.600 

actually<00:00:45.410> have<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.770> throw<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.129> which<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
did half way today and then I had to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.680 
did half way today and then I had to
stop<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.190> something<00:00:50.520> finish<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.590 

so<00:00:54.690> anyway<00:00:54.989> these<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> two<00:00:55.590> motors<00:00:56.600> this

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
so anyway these are the two motors this

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.849 
so anyway these are the two motors this
is<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.899> one<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.140> came<00:00:58.320> out<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.559> my<00:00:58.829> pickup

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.830 
is the one that came out of my pickup
this<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.160> one<00:01:02.370> I'm<00:01:03.239> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> put<00:01:03.600> in

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
this is the one I'm going to put in

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.469

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
obviously the backing plates are

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.700 
obviously the backing plates are
different<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.049> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> switch<00:01:07.409> those

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
different so I'm going to switch those

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.640 
different so I'm going to switch those
two<00:01:07.740> out<00:01:08.270> this<00:01:09.270> one<00:01:09.510> came<00:01:10.080> out<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.180> 1994

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200 
Mercury Topaz same part number so I mean
everything's<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.310> same<00:01:20.340> why<00:01:20.909> wouldn't<00:01:21.180> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
everything's the same why wouldn't it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:02:43.920
