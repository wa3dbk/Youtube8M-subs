hi there welcome to the third of three
videos<00:00:03.090> on<00:00:03.570> excel<00:00:04.380> for<00:00:04.620> teachers<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.250> using

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
videos on excel for teachers and using

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.089 
videos on excel for teachers and using
Excel<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.180> an<00:00:06.299> educational<00:00:06.870> context<00:00:07.410> let's

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
Excel in an educational context let's

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.919 
Excel in an educational context let's
have<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.280> look<00:00:08.429> at<00:00:08.550> what<00:00:08.700> we've<00:00:08.880> done<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.900> far

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
have a look at what we've done so far

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.950 
have a look at what we've done so far
we've<00:00:10.559> created<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.820> table<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.690> we've<00:00:12.780> inputted

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
we've created a table and we've inputted

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.379 
we've created a table and we've inputted
information<00:00:13.830> there<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.099> table<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.610> giving<00:00:15.299> us

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
information there the table is giving us

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.689 
information there the table is giving us
some<00:00:15.630> quick<00:00:16.230> but<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.650> think<00:00:16.920> really<00:00:17.130> nice<00:00:17.430> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
some quick but I think really nice and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.240 
some quick but I think really nice and
informative<00:00:18.119> analysis<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:19.250> performance

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
informative analysis about performance

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.460 
informative analysis about performance
across<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.789> cohorts<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> last<00:00:22.289> video

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
across the cohorts and in the last video

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.650 
across the cohorts and in the last video
we<00:00:22.830> had<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.010> look<00:00:23.250> at<00:00:23.550> generating<00:00:24.510> these

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
we had a look at generating these

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.019 
we had a look at generating these
summary<00:00:25.320> measures<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.340> these<00:00:26.550> are<00:00:26.730> measures

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
summary measures so these are measures

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.029 
summary measures so these are measures
that<00:00:27.180> give<00:00:27.359> us<00:00:27.480> an<00:00:27.779> impression<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.500> what's

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that give us an impression of what's

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.049 
that give us an impression of what's
happening<00:00:29.519> across<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> whole<00:00:30.750> cohort<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
happening across the whole cohort and

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.700 
happening across the whole cohort and
really<00:00:33.059> good<00:00:33.329> simple<00:00:34.200> things<00:00:34.410> for<00:00:34.500> us<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
really good simple things for us to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.180 
really good simple things for us to
understand<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.250> tell<00:00:35.579> us<00:00:35.730> what's<00:00:36.030> going<00:00:36.270> on

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
understand that tell us what's going on

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.310 
understand that tell us what's going on
so<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.149> video<00:00:39.420> we're<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.930> continue

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
so in this video we're going to continue

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.549 
so in this video we're going to continue
on<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.950> theme<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.370> summary<00:00:42.030> information<00:00:42.559> and

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
on the theme of summary information and

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.440 
on the theme of summary information and
we're<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.430> about<00:00:44.640> generating

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
we're going to think about generating

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.350 
we're going to think about generating
things<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:46.440> charts<00:00:47.280> things<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.850> visually

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
things like charts things that visually

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.220 
things like charts things that visually
represent<00:00:49.100> our<00:00:50.100> analysis<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.539> situation

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
represent our analysis and the situation

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.040 
represent our analysis and the situation
what's<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.449> we've<00:00:54.449> got<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> really<00:00:54.840> nice

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
what's going on we've got a really nice

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.770 
what's going on we've got a really nice
chart<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:57.000> aim<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.390> video<00:00:57.570> is

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
chart here and the aim of this video is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.330 
chart here and the aim of this video is
to<00:00:58.260> allow<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.680> understand<00:00:59.129> how<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to allow you to understand how to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.189 
to allow you to understand how to
generate<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.059> kind<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.420> thing<00:01:00.629> yourself

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
generate this kind of thing yourself

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.740 
generate this kind of thing yourself
so<00:01:01.800> again<00:01:02.370> make<00:01:02.789> sure<00:01:02.969> you've<00:01:03.120> downloaded<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
so again make sure you've downloaded the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.539 
so again make sure you've downloaded the
practice<00:01:04.140> file<00:01:04.350> from<00:01:04.559> our<00:01:04.710> website<00:01:04.920> we'll<00:01:05.339> put

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
practice file from our website we'll put

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.850 
practice file from our website we'll put
the<00:01:05.670> link<00:01:05.960> underneath<00:01:06.960> underneath<00:01:07.470> this

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the link underneath underneath this

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.800 
the link underneath underneath this
video<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.220> make<00:01:08.520> sure<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.700> practice<00:01:09.270> how<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
video and make sure you practice how to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.230 
video and make sure you practice how to
do<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.200> yourself<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.490> let's<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.850> look<00:01:12.030> at

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
do this yourself so let's have a look at

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.929 
do this yourself so let's have a look at
the<00:01:12.390> practice<00:01:12.840> file<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.520> example

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the practice file this is the example

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.999 
the practice file this is the example
sheets<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> chart<00:01:16.830> is

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
sheets and you can see that the chart is

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.999 
sheets and you can see that the chart is
here<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.850> how<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.450> go<00:01:19.080> about<00:01:19.110> generating

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
here so how would we go about generating

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.429 
here so how would we go about generating
this<00:01:20.310> table<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.030> generating<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.080> chart

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
this table and generating this chart

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.859 
this table and generating this chart
which<00:01:22.710> gives<00:01:22.950> us<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.610> good<00:01:23.820> snapshot<00:01:24.450> of

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
which gives us a really good snapshot of

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.980 
which gives us a really good snapshot of
what's<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:26.270> let's<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.750> practice

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
what's going on let's go to the practice

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.590 
what's going on let's go to the practice
summary<00:01:28.920> info<00:01:29.549> sheet<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.299> see<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
summary info sheet and you can see that

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.690 
summary info sheet and you can see that
I've<00:01:30.780> already<00:01:31.110> set<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.860> table<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.520> you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
I've already set up this table for you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.340 
I've already set up this table for you
so<00:01:32.909> I've<00:01:33.030> used<00:01:33.210> some<00:01:33.360> fairly<00:01:33.840> simple

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
so I've used some fairly simple

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
so I've used some fairly simple
formatting<00:01:34.920> techniques<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.759> you'll<00:01:36.479> notice

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
formatting techniques that you'll notice

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.230 
formatting techniques that you'll notice
that<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.950> green<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.430> red<00:01:38.579> colors<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:39.180> I've

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that the green and red colors that I've

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.660 
that the green and red colors that I've
used<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.920> grades<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.430> fails

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
used for a to see grades and fails

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
used for a to see grades and fails
they're<00:01:41.970> consistent<00:01:42.689> throughout<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.470> whole

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
they're consistent throughout the whole

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.039 
they're consistent throughout the whole
file<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.579> that's<00:01:44.759> an<00:01:44.939> example<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.420> color<00:01:45.720> are

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
file so that's an example of color are

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.170 
file so that's an example of color are
supporting<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> meaning<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.460> what's<00:01:47.970> going

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
supporting the meaning of what's going

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.630 
supporting the meaning of what's going
on<00:01:48.329> green<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.840> good<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.140> red<00:01:49.649> for<00:01:49.829> bad<00:01:50.009> all

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
on green for good and red for bad all

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.139 
on green for good and red for bad all
we're<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.540> try<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
we're going to do is try to get the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.219 
we're going to do is try to get the
summary<00:01:54.149> information<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
summary information we have on the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.920 
summary information we have on the
student<00:01:55.649> table<00:01:56.100> into<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> other<00:01:57.360> sheet<00:01:57.659> into

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
student table into the other sheet into

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.730 
student table into the other sheet into
the<00:01:58.290> summary<00:01:58.740> into<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> summary<00:02:00.000> info<00:02:00.360> sheet

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
the summary into the summary info sheet

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.560 
the summary into the summary info sheet
into<00:02:01.740> these<00:02:01.890> cells<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.420> that

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
into these cells here we can do that

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.620 
into these cells here we can do that
fairly<00:02:04.170> easily<00:02:04.200> by<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:04.860> hitting<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.909> equals

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
fairly easily by just hitting the equals

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.660 
fairly easily by just hitting the equals
keep<00:02:07.489> going<00:02:08.489> back<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.970> student<00:02:09.420> table<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
keep going back to the student table and

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
keep going back to the student table and
then<00:02:11.670> clicking<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.270> cell<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:13.050> contains

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
then clicking on the cell that contains

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.440 
then clicking on the cell that contains
information<00:02:14.159> that<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:14.370> want<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.640> appear<00:02:15.060> in

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
information that we want to appear in

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.869 
information that we want to appear in
the<00:02:15.750> table<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.319> I've<00:02:16.409> clicked<00:02:16.680> on<00:02:16.830> cell<00:02:17.069> f6<00:02:17.549> and

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
the table so I've clicked on cell f6 and

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.970 
the table so I've clicked on cell f6 and
we<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.180> see<00:02:18.390> at<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.049> top<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> formula

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
we can see at the top in the formula

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.530 
we can see at the top in the formula
editor<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.819> it's<00:02:20.970> ready<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.239> go

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
editor that it's ready to go

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.979 
editor that it's ready to go
so<00:02:21.930> I'm<00:02:22.049> going<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.230> hit<00:02:22.440> enter<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:24.450> we<00:02:24.629> can<00:02:24.810> see

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
so I'm going to hit enter and we can see

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.240 
so I'm going to hit enter and we can see
that<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.349> that<00:02:25.709> information<00:02:26.010> minus<00:02:26.819> 16<00:02:28.250> that

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
that that that information minus 16 that

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.509 
that that that information minus 16 that
minus<00:02:29.670> 16<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.299> in<00:02:30.510> 7f<00:02:30.870> six<00:02:31.170> has<00:02:31.680> appeared<00:02:32.129> in

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
minus 16 there in 7f six has appeared in

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.490 
minus 16 there in 7f six has appeared in
this<00:02:32.940> cell<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.180> that's<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.599> good<00:02:33.750> example<00:02:33.870> of

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
this cell so that's a good example of

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.580 
this cell so that's a good example of
how<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.799> can<00:02:35.190> combine<00:02:35.879> sheets<00:02:36.569> together<00:02:36.989> to

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
how you can combine sheets together to

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.910 
how you can combine sheets together to
create<00:02:38.099> nice<00:02:39.000> data<00:02:39.329> summaries<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.019> we<00:02:40.739> can

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
create nice data summaries so we can

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.160 
create nice data summaries so we can
simply<00:02:41.510> pull<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:43.489> formula<00:02:44.489> down<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:46.019> now

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
simply pull this formula down and we now

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.309 
simply pull this formula down and we now
have<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.410> foreigner<00:02:46.950> 0<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.989> has<00:02:49.140> taken

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
have a foreigner 0 and that has taken

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.869 
have a foreigner 0 and that has taken
the<00:02:49.590> information<00:02:50.190> below<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.540> minus<00:02:51.900> 16<00:02:52.379> and

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
the information below the minus 16 and

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.569 
the information below the minus 16 and
it's<00:02:53.879> just<00:02:54.060> taking<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.540> through<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.459> we<00:02:56.459> have

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
it's just taking it through that we have

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.849 
it's just taking it through that we have
to<00:02:56.700> do<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.940> same<00:02:57.180> for<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.840> other<00:02:58.140> cells<00:02:58.470> so

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
to do the same for the other cells so

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.610 
to do the same for the other cells so
quickly<00:02:59.489> I'm<00:03:00.150> going<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.450> go<00:03:00.599> for<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.019> 6<00:03:01.409> there

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
quickly I'm going to go for I 6 there

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:13.190 
quickly I'm going to go for I 6 there
once<00:03:04.620> again<00:03:05.069> for<00:03:05.579> L<00:03:05.970> 6<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.310> finally<00:03:11.569> 406<00:03:12.569> okay

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
once again for L 6 and finally 406 okay

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.990 
once again for L 6 and finally 406 okay
maybe<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.650> excel<00:03:14.010> purists<00:03:14.519> out<00:03:14.609> there<00:03:14.849> will

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
maybe the excel purists out there will

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.369 
maybe the excel purists out there will
be<00:03:15.030> telling<00:03:15.420> me<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.540> could<00:03:15.840> do<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.109> much

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
be telling me I could do that much

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.550 
be telling me I could do that much
faster<00:03:16.650> using<00:03:17.220> an<00:03:17.310> offset<00:03:17.430> formula<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.560> if

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
faster using an offset formula and if

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.659 
faster using an offset formula and if
you're<00:03:19.709> interested<00:03:20.160> in<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> offset

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
you're interested in the offset

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.039 
you're interested in the offset
4-wheeler<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.090> do<00:03:21.419> take<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.660> look<00:03:21.810> at<00:03:21.959> our

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
4-wheeler and do take a look at our

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.199 
4-wheeler and do take a look at our
video<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.919> offset<00:03:23.250> formula<00:03:23.639> but<00:03:24.000> back<00:03:24.180> to

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
video on the offset formula but back to

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.509 
video on the offset formula but back to
this<00:03:24.480> again<00:03:25.290> I'm<00:03:25.709> going<00:03:25.919> to<00:03:25.980> click<00:03:26.220> and

this again I'm going to click and
highlight<00:03:27.150> these<00:03:27.419> cells<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.989> then<00:03:28.260> just

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
highlight these cells and then just

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.470 
highlight these cells and then just
double<00:03:29.370> click<00:03:29.700> in<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:29.910> bottom<00:03:30.180> right<00:03:30.299> hand

another sheet created a really nice
summary<00:03:41.669> table<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.209> think<00:03:42.629> it's<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.109> important

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
summary table I think it's so important

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.220 
summary table I think it's so important
in<00:03:44.069> Excel<00:03:44.699> to<00:03:44.940> create<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:45.480> kind<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:45.900> summary

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
in Excel to create this kind of summary

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.020 
in Excel to create this kind of summary
because<00:03:46.530> everybody<00:03:46.949> sees<00:03:47.190> lots<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.609> numbers

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
because everybody sees lots of numbers

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.390 
because everybody sees lots of numbers
lots<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.720> data<00:03:48.989> it's<00:03:49.349> really<00:03:49.859> important<00:03:50.370> that

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
lots of data it's really important that

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.970 
lots of data it's really important that
we<00:03:50.639> pull<00:03:50.970> out<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.870> important<00:03:52.379> information

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
we pull out the important information

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.210 
we pull out the important information
get<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:54.260> displayed<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.680> really<00:03:55.980> simple

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
get it displayed and a really simple

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.369 
get it displayed and a really simple
easy<00:03:56.639> to<00:03:57.120> understand<00:03:57.660> way<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:57.840> think<00:03:57.989> that's<00:03:58.260> a

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
easy to understand way I think that's a

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.740 
easy to understand way I think that's a
fairly<00:03:58.620> good<00:03:58.949> way<00:03:59.489> for<00:03:59.730> us<00:03:59.819> to<00:03:59.970> do<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.510> we

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
fairly good way for us to do it and we

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.020 
fairly good way for us to do it and we
also<00:04:00.900> think<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.440> idea<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.739> a<00:04:02.040> table<00:04:02.549> and<00:04:02.760> a

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
also think the idea of a table and a

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.879 
also think the idea of a table and a
chart<00:04:03.359> next<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.930> each<00:04:04.019> other<00:04:04.199> communicating

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
chart next to each other communicating

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.939 
chart next to each other communicating
something<00:04:05.250> numerically<00:04:06.090> unvisited<00:04:07.079> by<00:04:07.650> side

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
something numerically unvisited by side

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.009 
something numerically unvisited by side
is<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.459> really<00:04:08.819> effective<00:04:09.030> way<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.660> approaching

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
is a really effective way of approaching

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.009 
is a really effective way of approaching
analysis<00:04:10.609> so<00:04:11.609> we've<00:04:11.879> got<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.060> nice<00:04:13.069> chart<00:04:14.069> here

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
analysis so we've got a nice chart here

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.020 
analysis so we've got a nice chart here
group<00:04:16.019> performance<00:04:16.470> over<00:04:16.709> time<00:04:17.010> we<00:04:17.789> talked

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
group performance over time we talked

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.150 
group performance over time we talked
about<00:04:18.120> our<00:04:18.269> for<00:04:18.720> assessment<00:04:19.440> milestones<00:04:19.949> and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
about our for assessment milestones and

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.469 
about our for assessment milestones and
then<00:04:20.549> we<00:04:20.669> can<00:04:20.820> see<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.030> key<00:04:21.419> at<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.019> bottom<00:04:22.349> that

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
then we can see a key at the bottom that

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.550 
then we can see a key at the bottom that
allows<00:04:24.479> people<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.840> understand<00:04:25.320> what's<00:04:25.500> going

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
allows people to understand what's going

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.640 
allows people to understand what's going
on<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:25.890> how

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
on so how

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.070 
on so how
we<00:04:26.800> generate<00:04:27.759> that<00:04:27.940> chart<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.419> simplest<00:04:28.900> way

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
we generate that chart the simplest way

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.200 
we generate that chart the simplest way
if<00:04:29.350> your<00:04:29.860> data<00:04:30.130> is<00:04:30.310> reasonably<00:04:31.030> well

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
if your data is reasonably well

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.850 
if your data is reasonably well
organized<00:04:31.630> into<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.960> table<00:04:32.380> as<00:04:32.500> we've<00:04:32.680> done

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
organized into a table as we've done

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.969 
organized into a table as we've done
here<00:04:32.919> we<00:04:33.580> can<00:04:33.790> select<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.360> whole<00:04:34.389> table<00:04:34.979> then

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
here we can select the whole table then

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.770 
here we can select the whole table then
go<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.490> insert<00:04:37.120> button<00:04:38.020> at<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.770> top<00:04:39.100> and

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
go to the insert button at the top and

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.189 
go to the insert button at the top and
go<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:41.009> charts<00:04:42.210> fancy<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.300> bar<00:04:43.509> charts<00:04:44.020> a

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
go to charts fancy of bar charts a

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.800 
go to charts fancy of bar charts a
column<00:04:44.979> chart<00:04:45.009> rather<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.729> then<00:04:46.300> just<00:04:46.539> click

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
column chart rather and then just click

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.100 
column chart rather and then just click
on<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.110> simple<00:04:47.530> column<00:04:47.860> charts<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.840> Excel<00:04:49.840> will

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
on a simple column charts and Excel will

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.890 
on a simple column charts and Excel will
generate<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:50.770> chart<00:04:50.800> for<00:04:51.310> us<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:52.419> already

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
generate the chart for us so already

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.540 
generate the chart for us so already
it's<00:04:53.169> done<00:04:53.289> a<00:04:53.320> lot<00:04:53.530> of<00:04:53.650> work<00:04:53.830> for<00:04:54.039> us<00:04:54.160> we<00:04:54.340> still

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
it's done a lot of work for us we still

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.180 
it's done a lot of work for us we still
need<00:04:54.729> to<00:04:54.850> do<00:04:55.000> things<00:04:55.240> like<00:04:55.360> put<00:04:55.810> in<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.190> the

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
need to do things like put in the the

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.610 
need to do things like put in the the
title<00:04:57.460> of<00:04:57.729> the<00:04:57.820> charts<00:04:58.210> in<00:04:58.360> so<00:04:59.229> I'm<00:04:59.350> going<00:04:59.530> to

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
title of the charts in so I'm going to

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.680 
title of the charts in so I'm going to
put<00:04:59.830> group<00:05:00.190> performance<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:02.789> also<00:05:03.789> adjusting

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
put group performance and also adjusting

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.900 
put group performance and also adjusting
the<00:05:04.810> colors<00:05:05.260> so<00:05:05.590> that<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:05.949> colors<00:05:06.370> reflect

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
the colors so that the colors reflect

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.689 
the colors so that the colors reflect
the<00:05:07.360> meaning<00:05:07.810> of<00:05:07.919> what<00:05:08.919> that<00:05:09.070> piece<00:05:09.250> of<00:05:09.460> data

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
the meaning of what that piece of data

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.640 
the meaning of what that piece of data
is<00:05:10.030> now<00:05:10.270> this<00:05:10.419> piece<00:05:10.630> of<00:05:10.810> data<00:05:10.990> is<00:05:11.199> number<00:05:11.470> of<00:05:11.500> A

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
is now this piece of data is number of A

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.740 
is now this piece of data is number of A
to<00:05:11.710> C<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:12.220> don't<00:05:12.669> really<00:05:12.820> think<00:05:12.910> a<00:05:13.150> red<00:05:13.330> color<00:05:13.600> is

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
to C I don't really think a red color is

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.120 
to C I don't really think a red color is
suitable<00:05:14.169> because<00:05:14.260> it's<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.560> positive<00:05:14.800> thing

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
suitable because it's a positive thing

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.310 
suitable because it's a positive thing
so<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:16.060> green<00:05:16.419> color<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.750> think<00:05:16.780> is<00:05:17.110> more

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
so a green color I think is more

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.960 
so a green color I think is more
suitable<00:05:17.710> like<00:05:17.919> I've<00:05:18.160> just<00:05:18.190> clicked<00:05:18.639> on<00:05:18.820> those

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
suitable like I've just clicked on those

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.620 
suitable like I've just clicked on those
bars

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
bars

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.159 
bars
I<00:05:19.660> can<00:05:20.169> go<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.380> design<00:05:20.919> or<00:05:21.479> formats<00:05:22.479> at<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:22.900> top

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
I can go to design or formats at the top

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.650 
I can go to design or formats at the top
and<00:05:23.440> choose<00:05:24.220> whichever<00:05:24.759> color<00:05:24.880> I<00:05:25.120> wants<00:05:25.509> I

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
and choose whichever color I wants I

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.409 
and choose whichever color I wants I
think<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.199> green<00:05:26.410> color<00:05:26.710> is<00:05:26.949> more<00:05:27.610> appropriate

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
think a green color is more appropriate

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.900 
think a green color is more appropriate
here<00:05:28.860> okay<00:05:29.860> so<00:05:29.919> that's<00:05:30.250> how<00:05:30.340> you<00:05:30.460> go<00:05:30.699> about

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
here okay so that's how you go about

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.540 
here okay so that's how you go about
generating<00:05:31.180> a<00:05:31.599> chart<00:05:31.930> Excel<00:05:32.919> does<00:05:33.130> a<00:05:33.160> lot<00:05:33.490> of

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
generating a chart Excel does a lot of

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.250 
generating a chart Excel does a lot of
the<00:05:33.789> work<00:05:33.970> for<00:05:34.270> you<00:05:34.419> these<00:05:34.599> deaths<00:05:34.930> they've

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
the work for you these deaths they've

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.990 
the work for you these deaths they've
done<00:05:35.470> a<00:05:35.500> really<00:05:35.590> good<00:05:36.039> job<00:05:36.250> of<00:05:36.460> making<00:05:36.490> X

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
done a really good job of making X

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.180 
done a really good job of making X
making<00:05:37.599> charts<00:05:37.870> really<00:05:38.260> easy<00:05:38.410> to<00:05:38.620> generate<00:05:39.039> so

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
making charts really easy to generate so

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.550 
making charts really easy to generate so
I<00:05:39.250> don't<00:05:39.430> encourage<00:05:39.669> you<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:41.110> get<00:05:41.289> to<00:05:41.440> know

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
I don't encourage you to get to know

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.550 
I don't encourage you to get to know
them<00:05:42.570> great<00:05:43.570> so<00:05:43.720> we've<00:05:43.870> got<00:05:43.960> a<00:05:43.990> table<00:05:44.229> and<00:05:44.530> a

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
them great so we've got a table and a

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.500 
them great so we've got a table and a
chart<00:05:44.830> that's<00:05:45.039> our<00:05:45.190> data<00:05:45.370> summary<00:05:45.789> let's<00:05:46.300> just

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
chart that's our data summary let's just

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.330 
chart that's our data summary let's just
rewind<00:05:47.020> and<00:05:47.380> let's<00:05:47.590> go<00:05:47.710> back<00:05:47.740> through<00:05:48.220> the

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
rewind and let's go back through the

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.180 
rewind and let's go back through the
whole<00:05:48.580> process<00:05:48.909> we've<00:05:49.900> had<00:05:50.110> three<00:05:50.560> steps<00:05:50.919> this

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
whole process we've had three steps this

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.029 
whole process we've had three steps this
the<00:05:51.370> three<00:05:51.639> part<00:05:51.909> series<00:05:52.150> on<00:05:52.539> using<00:05:53.229> Excel<00:05:53.770> for

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
the three part series on using Excel for

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.710 
the three part series on using Excel for
teachers<00:05:54.430> and<00:05:54.580> we've<00:05:54.669> generated<00:05:55.180> we've

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
teachers and we've generated we've

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.850 
teachers and we've generated we've
created<00:05:56.669> a<00:05:57.669> progress<00:05:58.570> tracking<00:05:59.229> spreadsheet

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
created a progress tracking spreadsheet

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.899 
created a progress tracking spreadsheet
if<00:06:00.370> you<00:06:00.849> like<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:02.340> originally<00:06:03.340> we<00:06:03.610> talked

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
if you like and originally we talked

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:07.589 
if you like and originally we talked
about<00:06:04.030> how<00:06:04.479> to<00:06:04.539> convert<00:06:05.729> grade<00:06:06.729> so<00:06:07.090> letters

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
about how to convert grade so letters

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:10.320 
about how to convert grade so letters
into<00:06:08.409> values<00:06:08.800> into<00:06:09.280> numbers<00:06:09.639> once<00:06:10.090> we've

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
into values into numbers once we've

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.120 
into values into numbers once we've
converted<00:06:10.840> them<00:06:11.110> into<00:06:11.169> values<00:06:11.680> we<00:06:11.889> can<00:06:11.919> begin

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
converted them into values we can begin

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.680 
converted them into values we can begin
to<00:06:12.250> measure<00:06:12.580> them<00:06:12.820> against<00:06:13.180> each<00:06:13.240> other<00:06:13.419> and

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
to measure them against each other and

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.170 
to measure them against each other and
measure<00:06:13.930> progress<00:06:14.080> things<00:06:14.889> like<00:06:15.099> that<00:06:15.310> so<00:06:16.030> we

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
measure progress things like that so we

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.870 
measure progress things like that so we
used<00:06:16.419> a<00:06:16.539> vlookup<00:06:17.169> formula<00:06:17.409> and<00:06:17.889> a<00:06:18.580> grades

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
used a vlookup formula and a grades

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.180 
used a vlookup formula and a grades
table<00:06:19.419> that<00:06:19.780> we<00:06:19.870> populated<00:06:20.380> ourselves<00:06:21.010> in

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
table that we populated ourselves in

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.820 
table that we populated ourselves in
order<00:06:21.789> to<00:06:21.970> convert<00:06:22.539> these<00:06:22.750> grades<00:06:23.199> into

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
order to convert these grades into

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.909 
order to convert these grades into
values<00:06:24.990> next<00:06:25.990> we<00:06:26.110> talked<00:06:26.320> about<00:06:26.409> drop-down

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
values next we talked about drop-down

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.240 
values next we talked about drop-down
menus<00:06:27.340> and<00:06:28.260> we<00:06:29.260> intimate<00:06:29.620> implemented<00:06:30.190> a

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
menus and we intimate implemented a

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.939 
menus and we intimate implemented a
simple<00:06:30.490> drop-down<00:06:31.240> menu<00:06:31.659> here<00:06:32.169> we<00:06:32.560> can<00:06:32.770> see

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
simple drop-down menu here we can see

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:36.180 
simple drop-down menu here we can see
that<00:06:33.330> that's<00:06:34.330> fairly<00:06:34.570> easy<00:06:34.690> to<00:06:34.960> do<00:06:35.380> using<00:06:35.950> the

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
that that's fairly easy to do using the

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.670 
that that's fairly easy to do using the
data<00:06:36.430> and<00:06:36.880> data<00:06:37.090> validation<00:06:37.320> and<00:06:38.320> then<00:06:38.560> we

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
data and data validation and then we

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.970 
data and data validation and then we
talked<00:06:38.889> about<00:06:39.039> summary

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
talked about summary

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.440 
talked about summary
information<00:06:40.460> so<00:06:40.640> we<00:06:40.760> can<00:06:40.910> see<00:06:41.060> at<00:06:41.150> the<00:06:41.210> top

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
information so we can see at the top

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.560 
information so we can see at the top
here<00:06:41.780> we<00:06:42.440> generated<00:06:43.400> some<00:06:43.430> formula<00:06:44.120> to<00:06:44.300> really

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
here we generated some formula to really

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.170 
here we generated some formula to really
capture<00:06:44.930> summarize<00:06:45.740> what's<00:06:46.490> going<00:06:46.820> on<00:06:46.970> to

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
capture summarize what's going on to

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.090 
capture summarize what's going on to
make<00:06:47.300> it<00:06:47.450> nice<00:06:47.630> and<00:06:47.660> easy<00:06:48.020> to<00:06:48.170> understand

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
make it nice and easy to understand

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.370 
make it nice and easy to understand
with<00:06:50.030> that<00:06:50.180> summary<00:06:50.570> information<00:06:51.170> we<00:06:51.350> just

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
with that summary information we just

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.250 
with that summary information we just
linked<00:06:52.190> it<00:06:52.370> to<00:06:52.400> a<00:06:52.700> summary<00:06:53.180> page<00:06:53.510> using<00:06:54.050> some

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 
linked it to a summary page using some

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.790 
linked it to a summary page using some
very<00:06:54.700> simple<00:06:55.700> formula<00:06:56.570> that<00:06:57.170> we<00:06:57.320> can<00:06:57.500> see<00:06:57.680> in

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
very simple formula that we can see in

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.530 
very simple formula that we can see in
these<00:06:57.980> cells<00:06:58.310> and<00:06:58.580> that<00:06:58.970> allowed<00:06:59.300> us<00:06:59.330> to

00:06:59.530 --> 00:06:59.540 
these cells and that allowed us to

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.220 
these cells and that allowed us to
quickly<00:07:00.170> generate<00:07:01.160> a<00:07:01.190> chart<00:07:01.810> so<00:07:02.810> I<00:07:02.840> think<00:07:02.960> this

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.230 
quickly generate a chart so I think this

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.290 
quickly generate a chart so I think this
is<00:07:03.320> a<00:07:03.380> really<00:07:03.590> good<00:07:03.800> example<00:07:03.920> of<00:07:04.460> how<00:07:04.790> we<00:07:04.970> can

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
is a really good example of how we can

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.450 
is a really good example of how we can
use<00:07:05.480> Excel<00:07:05.930> to<00:07:05.960> help<00:07:06.290> us<00:07:06.440> make<00:07:06.710> sense<00:07:06.740> of

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
use Excel to help us make sense of

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.430 
use Excel to help us make sense of
what's<00:07:07.970> going<00:07:08.060> on<00:07:08.330> in<00:07:08.510> education<00:07:09.080> to<00:07:09.260> make

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 
what's going on in education to make

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.800 
what's going on in education to make
sense<00:07:09.740> of<00:07:09.920> student<00:07:10.340> performance<00:07:10.510> to<00:07:11.510> measure

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
sense of student performance to measure

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.380 
sense of student performance to measure
it<00:07:12.080> but<00:07:12.710> also<00:07:12.920> to<00:07:13.160> generate<00:07:13.430> that<00:07:13.940> summary

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.390 
it but also to generate that summary

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.940 
it but also to generate that summary
information<00:07:15.020> and<00:07:15.170> we<00:07:15.260> talked<00:07:15.470> about<00:07:15.590> what

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950 
information and we talked about what

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.130 
information and we talked about what
senior<00:07:16.400> managers<00:07:16.820> want<00:07:17.420> to<00:07:17.600> see<00:07:17.750> I<00:07:17.780> think<00:07:18.020> it's

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
senior managers want to see I think it's

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.620 
senior managers want to see I think it's
a<00:07:18.200> really<00:07:18.500> good<00:07:18.590> opportunity<00:07:18.860> to<00:07:19.640> impress

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:20.630 
a really good opportunity to impress

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.170 
a really good opportunity to impress
people<00:07:20.660> a<00:07:21.320> senior<00:07:21.770> in<00:07:22.100> your<00:07:22.180> education

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
people a senior in your education

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.350 
people a senior in your education
institution<00:07:24.070> with<00:07:25.070> what's<00:07:25.370> going<00:07:25.580> on<00:07:25.820> in<00:07:26.090> your

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 
institution with what's going on in your

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.850 
institution with what's going on in your
cohort<00:07:26.570> so<00:07:26.930> think<00:07:27.140> about<00:07:27.260> that<00:07:27.500> summary

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:27.860 
cohort so think about that summary

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.040 
cohort so think about that summary
information<00:07:28.450> generating<00:07:29.450> those<00:07:29.540> tables

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050 
information generating those tables

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.680 
information generating those tables
generating<00:07:30.890> those<00:07:31.040> charts<00:07:31.460> I've<00:07:32.240> really<00:07:32.570> like

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 
generating those charts I've really like

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.150 
generating those charts I've really like
to<00:07:32.810> hear<00:07:32.960> what<00:07:33.140> you<00:07:33.230> think<00:07:33.380> about<00:07:33.530> this<00:07:33.800> series
