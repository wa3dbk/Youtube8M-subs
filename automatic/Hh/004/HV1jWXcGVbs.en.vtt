00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello and welcome to this news 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.280
 video tennis attitude I propose you 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.500
 to approach this time the notions of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.349
 placement and support and how 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.109
 improve all that by removing three 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.150
 mistakes the three mistakes that commit 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.660
 a lot of players in their 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.510
 progression 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.449
 so the first is that we errors 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.650
 that we often see is that of 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.130
 let stand the back foot during the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
 hit 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.760
 when using online support so 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.860
 it's a mistake to keep your foot on 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.430
 flat the the back support at the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.980
 strikes since it's completely blocked 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.860
 the passage of the right leg 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.230
 the lip rotation of the shoulders and so 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.649
 instead instead of that and makes you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.940
 an example 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.250
 so that's it we're ready we would be 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.379
 rather in the error so down there 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.480
 very often the player is looking for a 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.670
 turned the stars and and we convince ourselves 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.320
 a little bit we managed one because 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.140
 we ended up in that position 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.990
 but in reality simply 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.439
 pivoting the back foot so we 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.210
 put the tip of the shoe on 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.490
 the tip and so in this case take 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.070
 also as a benchmark the sole of the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.439
 shoe towards the back of the court in 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.799
 doing that at the moment of the typing is 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.200
 just before it's triggered the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.840
 shoulders the hips allow you to 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.270
 really passed in the ball and we'll have 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.619
 a also a transfer of the weight of the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.060
 body that is going to be much better then the 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.130
 second the second mistake we 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.189
 meet often it's a very small 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.270
 little harder to fix it's you 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.970
 have probably heard of 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.299
 it's this notion of foot to a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.619
 dam then the foot in dams that's 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.140
 always we will take the example of a 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.840
 right shot made we could online 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.760
 so the foot in dams this time 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.980
 it will concern 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.560
 the left support would be to become 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.230
 place the left foot in this 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.399
 position that is a position that is going 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.740
 to be too parallel spun to the line of 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.900
 background will run to the service line to 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.180
 new this position and fire from 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.690
 way this is it's purely a bio 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.740
 bio mechanical that will create a dam a 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.530
 blockage at the passage of the body and the weight 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.560
 of the body forward and also the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.550
 passage of the shoulders and chest to 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.110
 forward while typing 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.020
 so it's really very important to the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.020
 place of his to try systematically 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.270
 to have a foot break that is going to 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.280
 do a little more forward 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.540
 you can take as a point of 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.960
 landmark when you're at about 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.480
 middle of having the tip of the foot which is 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.340
 pointed at the picket of simple on 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.920
 your right for a forehand for the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.480
 right-handed obviously helping and in this 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.160
 case there you go using really 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.670
 this this position there you go 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.040
 really facilitate the passage of weight 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.750
 of the body on on that leg before and in 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.170
 really using there the left thigh 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.670
 and we will really be able to have a 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.500
 keystroke and a trigger that is 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.959
 much more fluid while ga in 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.970
 maintaining stability of the supports 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.690
 here I show you an example on a 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.550
 could freeze c1 could very well be a 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.209
 back foot passage it depends where 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.380
 we are the player and his intention to 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.200
 two strikes depending on the situation 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.000
 to play then another 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.940
 the third mistake actually that one 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.320
 meeting very often and who has one who 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.750
 makes it a bit inefficient 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.860
 displacement and supports would be the one 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.390
 to carry out the distancing by 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.489
 report to the ball coming through 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.989
 report to the rebound realize the setting 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.290
 the essence on the bad leg 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.340
 so in fact the right solution is to 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.200
 carry out the distance and art and 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.390
 art is in your traveling on 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.209
 your back support say that well 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.590
 often we can observe her so if I have 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.909
 a ball has to play a little bit 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.489
 laterally there on my right one 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.340
 often observes wise I move I 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.829
 just put the rain before then the support 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.409
 back and there we are on a web 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:19.370
 who is really not going to facilitate the 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:21.229
 fluidity of the hit and especially the 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.430
 synchronization between the foot break 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.960
 and the keystroke 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.300
 reverse me really I you 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.520
 proposed was clearly trying that this 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.680
 will always realize your bet 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.199
 distance and stop after your 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.180
 moving on your jeans marc yesterday 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.590
 can be after a race there here so 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.740
 this would be first under way right foot 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.330
 then left foot before the dough 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.630
 it can be on balls that are not 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.490
 very very far after a displacement 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.770
 in the pasha it's here with a 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.139
 orientation here right foot first foot 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.570
 left then after the strike 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.130
 So that's something that happened 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.720
 really that I wanted to address there is 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.250
 small fixes I you in 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.770
 will speak a little bit later but 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.440
 the idea was already 2 to take 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.440
 awareness of these small blockages there 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.030
 that they can really embarrass you to the 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.470
 hits and then often we see the 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.020
 players who take their heads on the 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.139
 on the hall is taken the achievement is 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.449
 sometimes really the cause comes from just 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.949
 bottom and it will unlock 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.720
 not even a lot of things with water 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.120
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.910
