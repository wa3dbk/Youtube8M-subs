00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.949 

okay<00:02:47.860> this<00:02:48.459> panel<00:02:48.849> has<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.120> be<00:02:49.239> very<00:02:49.480> carefully

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
okay this panel has to be very carefully

okay this panel has to be very carefully
lifted<00:02:50.260> out<00:02:50.379> otherwise<00:02:50.680> you'll<00:02:50.920> break<00:02:51.129> the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
lifted out otherwise you'll break the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:06.899 
lifted out otherwise you'll break the
clips<00:02:51.579> on<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.819> back<00:02:51.939> of<00:02:52.120> it<00:03:05.579> that's<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.730> need

clips on the back of it that's the need

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.649 
clips on the back of it that's the need
much<00:03:07.120> pressure<00:03:08.879> this<00:03:09.879> panel<00:03:10.209> already<00:03:10.480> has<00:03:10.629> a

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
much pressure this panel already has a

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:16.830 
much pressure this panel already has a
few<00:03:10.900> broken<00:03:11.140> clips<00:03:11.500> on<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.450> clips<00:03:16.720> you

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
few broken clips on it and the clips you

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.649

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
can see the clips are held on by then

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.410 
can see the clips are held on by then
hold<00:03:19.870> on<00:03:19.989> by<00:03:20.109> basically<00:03:20.620> nothing<00:03:21.150> they<00:03:22.150> break

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
hold on by basically nothing they break

00:03:31.780 --> 00:04:11.099 
on either side two screws on either side
of<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.019> radio<00:03:32.319> you<00:03:33.280> undo<00:03:33.639> those<00:03:33.849> two<00:04:10.049> now<00:04:11.049> the

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
of the radio you undo those two now the

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:31.590 
of the radio you undo those two now the
radio<00:04:11.470> should<00:04:11.769> be<00:04:11.889> free<00:04:12.129> to<00:04:12.160> slide<00:04:12.579> forward

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.080 

and<00:04:32.600> once<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:33.020> radio<00:04:33.290> is<00:04:33.440> free<00:04:33.940> under<00:04:34.940> the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
and once the radio is free under the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.610 
and once the radio is free under the
quad<00:04:35.330> lock<00:04:35.510> connector<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:36.260> antenna

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
quad lock connector and the antenna

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:45.040 
quad lock connector and the antenna
connector<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:44.000> that's<00:04:44.240> how<00:04:44.419> you<00:04:44.479> remove<00:04:44.720> an

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
connector and that's how you remove an

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.470 
connector and that's how you remove an
ICD<00:04:45.500> 510<00:04:46.449> from<00:04:47.449> a<00:04:47.570> Mach<00:04:47.900> 5<00:04:48.139> golf
