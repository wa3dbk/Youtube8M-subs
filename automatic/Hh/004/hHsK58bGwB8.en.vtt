00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
come with indominus rex it is guaranteed

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.310 
come with indominus rex it is guaranteed
to<00:00:20.310> at<00:00:20.580> least<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.180> an<00:00:21.390> indominus<00:00:21.840> rex<00:00:21.930> in

to at least have an indominus rex in

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.109 
to at least have an indominus rex in
here<00:00:22.529> who<00:00:22.740> knows<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> other<00:00:23.550> dinosaurs

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
here who knows what the other dinosaurs

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.420 
here who knows what the other dinosaurs
will<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.960> or<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:25.289> colors<00:00:25.859> they're<00:00:26.130> gonna<00:00:26.220> be

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
will be or what colors they're gonna be

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.000 
will be or what colors they're gonna be
they're<00:00:26.640> all<00:00:26.760> supposed<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.420> random<00:00:27.980> well<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
they're all supposed to be random well I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.890 
they're all supposed to be random well I
was<00:00:29.279> hoping<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.699> could<00:00:29.730> tear<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.480> guess

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
was hoping I could tear that but guess

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.359 
was hoping I could tear that but guess
not<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.289> feels<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.710> has<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> zipper<00:00:32.279> in

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
not it feels like it has a zipper in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.150 
not it feels like it has a zipper in
there<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.000> might<00:00:33.120> be<00:00:33.270> resealable<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:34.920> that

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
there so it might be resealable so that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.740 
there so it might be resealable so that
that<00:00:35.730> would<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.030> nice<00:00:37.040> let's<00:00:38.040> see<00:00:38.600> maybe<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that would be nice let's see maybe I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.720 
that would be nice let's see maybe I
didn't<00:00:40.079> cut<00:00:40.260> down<00:00:40.410> far<00:00:40.710> enough<00:00:40.739> okay

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
didn't cut down far enough okay

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:59.619 
didn't cut down far enough okay
eventually<00:00:41.940> I'm<00:00:42.570> gonna<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:42.870> into<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.200> bag

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.720 

let's<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:00.870> dump<00:01:01.079> all<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> these<00:01:01.730> dinosaurs

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
let's just dump all of these dinosaurs

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.510 
let's just dump all of these dinosaurs

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
logo on there I have a green one there

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.090 
logo on there I have a green one there
probably<00:01:21.840> gonna<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.200> another<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:23.040> two

probably gonna have another one or two

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.810 
probably gonna have another one or two
in<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.090> somewhere<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:24.930> sure<00:01:25.280> if<00:01:26.280> he<00:01:26.549> wants

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
in here somewhere I'm sure if he wants

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.499 
in here somewhere I'm sure if he wants
to<00:01:26.970> stand<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.710> ankylosaurus

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
to stand then we have the ankylosaurus

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.810 
to stand then we have the ankylosaurus
which<00:01:30.509> i<00:01:30.750> think<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.470> really<00:01:31.829> cool<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.369> kind

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
which i think is a really cool one kind

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.359 
which i think is a really cool one kind
of<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> tank<00:01:33.420> dinosaur<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
of like the tank dinosaur I like that

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.510 
of like the tank dinosaur I like that
one<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:37.850> get<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.030> out<00:01:39.890> looks<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.310> have

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
one and get this out looks like we have

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.030 
one and get this out looks like we have
I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:42.200> we<00:01:43.200> talked<00:01:43.439> about<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.799> one<00:01:43.979> before

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
I think we talked about this one before

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.670 
I think we talked about this one before
I<00:01:44.369> open<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.030> different<00:01:45.780> mystery<00:01:46.079> bag<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.619> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
I open it a different mystery bag and I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.539 
I open it a different mystery bag and I
think<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.850> an<00:01:48.000> Allosaurus<00:01:48.680> not<00:01:49.680> 100%<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.520> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
think it's an Allosaurus not 100% but I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.810 
think it's an Allosaurus not 100% but I
think<00:01:50.939> that's<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.829> and<00:01:52.829> let's<00:01:53.579> see

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
think that's what it is and let's see

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.490 
think that's what it is and let's see
what<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.720> back<00:01:54.990> here<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.320> we

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
what all we have back here because we

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.200 
what all we have back here because we
have<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.890> many<00:01:56.040> dinosaur<00:01:56.549> skills<00:01:56.939> through

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
have so many dinosaur skills through

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.090 
have so many dinosaur skills through
this<00:01:58.020> time<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.180> Spinosaurus<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:01.100> think

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
this time we have a Spinosaurus I think

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.310 
this time we have a Spinosaurus I think
I<00:02:02.189> even<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.520> one<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.060> color<00:02:03.360> already<00:02:03.780> but

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
I even have one this color already but

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.149 
I even have one this color already but
that's<00:02:04.590> okay

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
that's okay

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.219 
that's okay
all<00:02:05.399> these<00:02:05.909> little<00:02:06.119> dinos<00:02:06.570> are<00:02:06.869> really

of<00:02:21.989> sera<00:02:22.230> tops<00:02:22.819> that<00:02:23.819> would<00:02:24.030> be<00:02:24.120> cool<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.659> don't

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
of sera tops that would be cool I don't

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.330 
of sera tops that would be cool I don't
know<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.290> that's<00:02:25.439> gonna<00:02:25.590> happen<00:02:25.769> or<00:02:25.950> not<00:02:26.069> but

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
know if that's gonna happen or not but

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.759 
know if that's gonna happen or not but
anyway<00:02:26.819> then<00:02:27.209> we<00:02:27.329> have<00:02:27.480> another<00:02:27.769> Triceratops

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
anyway then we have another Triceratops

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.069 
anyway then we have another Triceratops
this<00:02:28.980> time<00:02:29.189> we<00:02:29.340> have<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.519> green<00:02:29.849> one<00:02:29.879> and<00:02:30.720> sent

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
this time we have a green one and sent

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.559 
this time we have a green one and sent
him<00:02:31.260> back<00:02:31.290> here<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.370> we<00:02:33.329> have<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.810> Pteranodon

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
him back here and we have a Pteranodon

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.339 
him back here and we have a Pteranodon
also<00:02:36.569> has<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.959> JW<00:02:37.590> logo<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.220> they<00:02:38.579> all<00:02:38.730> do<00:02:38.970> a

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
also has the JW logo like they all do a

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.020 
also has the JW logo like they all do a
lot<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.470> detail<00:02:40.890> for<00:02:41.129> such<00:02:41.340> small<00:02:41.579> little

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
lot of detail for such small little

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.830 
lot of detail for such small little
dinosaurs<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.650> flying<00:02:44.519> reptiles<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.599> course

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
dinosaurs and flying reptiles of course

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.920 
dinosaurs and flying reptiles of course
there<00:02:46.019> are<00:02:46.140> no<00:02:46.290> dinosaurs<00:02:46.579> technically<00:02:47.579> I

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
there are no dinosaurs technically I

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.089 
there are no dinosaurs technically I
prefer<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.049> think<00:02:49.079> of<00:02:49.319> them<00:02:49.500> all<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:49.680> dinosaurs

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
prefer to think of them all as dinosaurs

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.330 
prefer to think of them all as dinosaurs
but<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.579> know<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.970> technically<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:52.079> is

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
but I know that technically that is

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.949 
but I know that technically that is
incorrect<00:02:53.340> scientifically<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.359> so<00:02:54.750> well

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
incorrect scientifically but so well

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.970 
incorrect scientifically but so well
anyway<00:02:55.620> we<00:02:56.549> have<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:57.150> t-rex<00:02:57.870> which<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.620> really

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
anyway we have a t-rex which is really

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.740 
anyway we have a t-rex which is really
the<00:02:59.099> color<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.549> I<00:02:59.579> think<00:02:59.909> of<00:03:00.150> when<00:03:00.659> I<00:03:00.690> think

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
the color that I think of when I think

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.660 
the color that I think of when I think
of<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.139> t-rex<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.769> kind<00:03:02.099> of<00:03:02.129> like<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> brownish

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
of a t-rex is kind of like a brownish

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.720 
of a t-rex is kind of like a brownish
color<00:03:02.879> but<00:03:03.810> anyway<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.650> think<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.099> awesome<00:03:05.340> we

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
color but anyway I think it's awesome we

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.379 
color but anyway I think it's awesome we
have<00:03:05.909> the<00:03:06.120> Tyrannosaurus<00:03:06.989> Rex<00:03:07.349> now<00:03:07.650> and

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
have the Tyrannosaurus Rex now and

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.729 
have the Tyrannosaurus Rex now and
somewhere<00:03:09.389> in<00:03:09.540> here<00:03:09.569> we<00:03:09.930> have<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:10.440> indominus

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
somewhere in here we have the indominus

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.690 
somewhere in here we have the indominus
I<00:03:11.220> haven't<00:03:11.430> gotten<00:03:11.609> to<00:03:11.989> her<00:03:12.989> yet<00:03:13.400> okay<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.519> key

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
I haven't gotten to her yet okay the key

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.119 
I haven't gotten to her yet okay the key
Rex<00:03:14.879> doesn't<00:03:15.090> want<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.329> stand<00:03:15.540> alone<00:03:16.049> then<00:03:17.040> we

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
Rex doesn't want to stand alone then we

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.360 
Rex doesn't want to stand alone then we
have<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.660> Stegosaurus<00:03:18.660> right<00:03:18.930> here<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.500> think<00:03:20.310> I

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
have a Stegosaurus right here I think I

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.099 
have a Stegosaurus right here I think I
have<00:03:20.519> one<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:20.910> color<00:03:21.150> already<00:03:21.389> too<00:03:21.780> but

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
have one this color already too but

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.580 
have one this color already too but
that's<00:03:22.379> okay<00:03:23.340> because<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.419> like<00:03:25.109> all<00:03:25.379> these

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
that's okay because I like all these

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.580 
that's okay because I like all these
little<00:03:25.739> dinosaurs<00:03:26.419> may<00:03:27.419> have<00:03:27.599> the<00:03:27.840> Mosasaurus

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
little dinosaurs may have the Mosasaurus

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.339 
little dinosaurs may have the Mosasaurus
right<00:03:28.919> here<00:03:29.190> it's<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.120> very<00:03:30.299> colorful<00:03:30.930> version

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
right here it's a very colorful version

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.860 
right here it's a very colorful version
of<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:31.919> kind<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:33.000> like<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> blue<00:03:33.449> version

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
of it I kind of like the blue version

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.140 
of it I kind of like the blue version
better<00:03:34.049> but<00:03:34.410> that's<00:03:34.799> okay<00:03:35.129> actually<00:03:35.669> we<00:03:36.000> have

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
better but that's okay actually we have

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.780 
better but that's okay actually we have
two<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:37.019> are<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.199> same<00:03:37.470> color<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:38.459> we<00:03:38.609> have

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
two that are the same color so we have

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.339 
two that are the same color so we have
like<00:03:39.449> little<00:03:39.720> twins

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
like little twins

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.979 
like little twins
you<00:03:40.769> have<00:03:40.889> to<00:03:41.069> Moses<00:03:41.430> sources<00:03:41.879> of<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.750> color

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
you have to Moses sources of that color

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.280 
you have to Moses sources of that color
and<00:03:43.319> then<00:03:44.040> we<00:03:44.190> have<00:03:44.220> another<00:03:45.150> ankylosaurus

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
and then we have another ankylosaurus

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.110 
and then we have another ankylosaurus
which<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.709> also<00:03:46.919> the<00:03:47.069> same<00:03:47.190> colors<00:03:47.730> too<00:03:47.910> one
