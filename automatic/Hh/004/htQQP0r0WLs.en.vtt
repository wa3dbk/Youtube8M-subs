00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.260
 never 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.110
 It hurts 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.110
 online 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.030
 a turn in this dust 40 cross 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.030
 country please come with us 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.940
 and 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.970
 we started although you know well that 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.160
 whenever we try a car with 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.660
 country characteristics we try that 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.630
 see it a little bit in action and this 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.250
 returns ub40 cross-country with traction 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.000
 integral to the four wheels or to the wheel 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.890
 drive 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.600
 as they then nominate you in volvo then the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.430
 truth is that it has no problem 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.540
 in getting into any sarao the truth 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.360
 is that we were quite surprised by the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.830
 traction especially because it carries a 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.660
 19-inch tire that the truth is not 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.480
 is your own to walk the field of 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.460
 series comes with a 17 but the truth is 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.250
 that we liked how I know how 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.750
 holds as traction how can you with 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.610
 Well, with the difficulties 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.170
 orographic and in that sense the truth 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.890
 is that we put a pretty note 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.360
 pretty good and especially the best of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.490
 all day even is that you do not have to 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.000
 give no vote is not traction 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.680
 Total of this connected series does not 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.090
 you have to give no button quoted or a 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.570
 Roulette you just mess by the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.590
 liquids 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.590
 obviously the computer 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.140
 detects that the ground so you go 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.989
 is the most suitable for an attraction 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.519
 simply front wheels and then the 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.810
 letters also traction there needs 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.489
 get out of any trouble without any 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.140
 problem and especially how can 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.470
 listen with absolute softness the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.500
 truth is that the car does not sound at all 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.500
 we are going we are going to leave to the asphalt and 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.290
 good as a normal contact 4 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.080
 meters and 37 centimeters of a car was going 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.670
 very well that we will not cheat you 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.370
 It is also true that of the five 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.500
 carrying engines that you can ride this 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.930
 ub40 cross-country three diesel and two 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.350
 gasoline we're right with him with the one of 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.180
 five that is 250 grossomodo horses 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.700
 that consume a lot also you what 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.040
 I have to say but of course, the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.720
 product is very very refined and is 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.220
 very well an automatic change of six 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.300
 speeds that goes very well and especially 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.790
 when we connect the sport mode 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.320
 say it still works better the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.630
 accelerations are very fast they are very 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.820
 good the truth is that we do not have 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.290
 no problem in that sense there are 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.840
 automatic songs that go a little bit 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.580
 regulated this concrete goes phenomenal and 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.170
 and then back again know the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.240
 truth is that as you see a quality 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.300
 premium and answer miren we love 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.330
 Perhaps the most this material of the 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.650
 that the dashboard is made with its 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.270
 inscription that you cons and metallic 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.500
 so we know what model is few 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.210
 things to know what differences the 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.480
 cross country of the ub40 normal by 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.370
 example on this button that is the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.680
 dependents that we have to say that in 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.310
 this unit does not work we do not know the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.660
 speak a technical problem or is it 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.770
 we do not know why but then he has 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.750
 I tried to connect by downloading some 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.520
 steep slope and has not entered the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.900
 moment and what are our wants have 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.290
 have activated it but the truth is that 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.850
 has not entered and I can tell you that the 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.500
 volvo of 40 cross-country now there are some 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.110
 fantastic offers and you can have it 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.120
 plan ping gone for 21 thousand 400 euros the 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.180
 normal price of the entry version 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.160
 are 27 thousand this in particular the t 5 with 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.109
 something I did live we are talking about 41 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.539
 thousand and with panoramic roof 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.919
 with the sports automatic transmission with 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.520
 Etcetera etcetera with this leather 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.020
 memory seats that we're going to 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.210
 47,000 long the truth is that it is not 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.710
 turkey mucus in exchange for we have a 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.360
 product prize a product that goes very 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.400
 well and above all well then well 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.319
 I would like you to notice this 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.120
 scorecard that as you see now 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.710
 same has a very sober line that 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.020
 modern flame with little touches in brown 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.400
 but we are going to see how it 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.550
 turns green and the truth is that 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.409
 we like it a lot and especially if 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.689
 we want to squeeze the 250 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.639
 horses let's say performance is going 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.949
 everything to beige red he tells the 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.449
 speedometer transforms the tachometer and 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.770
 with the mode is sport for the truth is 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.990
 that is when you can take out all the 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.029
 party to this car that the truth already 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.439
 I say that we liked enough squares 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:10.199
 back very justitas I'm not going to 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:12.360
 cheat meter 80 well right on the roof 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.960
 panoramic because you can start to rub 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.840
 with the luggage compartment roof 335 liters point 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.210
 very weak of this volvo of 40 or polbo 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.590
 ub40 transcont and what you want the 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.110
 trunk is well below average 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.030
 and make 37 of the tree of truth is 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.890
 that should offer some more liter 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.810
 in addition this model in particular the cross 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.750
 country that has the culete a little 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.880
 raised for that to look for more 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.250
 capacity a road just because it has less 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.280
 trunk the back view and the pretty 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.450
 worse etcetera etcetera problems without me 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.950
 they say they give us what I want 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.110
 delighted because he is a car but 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.090
 pay 47 thousand euros for this unit to me 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.710
 I think it's a little bit elevated 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.300
 although it is very good that it has 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.580
 many horses and consumption well 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.530
 on the highway you can do to limits 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.450
 legal around 8 liters 8 and little 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.550
 we have done a bit of everything and we are already 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:03.510
 touching the 10 liters 9.9 as you can 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.100
 see there then everyone who thinks what 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.150
 who wants to like us but 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.980
 maybe the price seems a little 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.210
 elevated that is a bit the summary that 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.620
 we do as always in video portal 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.080
 coches.net reference website 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.090
 giving the engine and you know that if 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.430
 you want to know everything about this ub40 dust 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.680
 kraus country and on the website there 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.910
 We make the extensive analysis in writing 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.650
 so you do not miss a single 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.650
 detail of everything there 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.780
 has been provoked
