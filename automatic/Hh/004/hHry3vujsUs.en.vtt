00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.940
 good afternoon with kim I have a question 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.430
 I will not provide me and my driver's license 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.800
 multiple jobs can of course also 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.699
 are we under your mouth as soon as we get them 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.480
 to deliver 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.610
 you want a question near the hague 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.399
 yes yes I happen to live here in the neighborhood 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.559
 ok well if you want fun then too 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:45.730
 think then I would say come over 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:47.890
 good all went good afternoon 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.230
 if all goes well , you can go clockwise 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.570
 it then a line hi hi mom on me 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.100
 sit like you are there but how 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.500
 did you end up at about 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.420
 well i came here to the right via 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 girlfriends of mine who have you too 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.350
 driven 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.929
 and all those very positive stories 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.799
 about this and yes they are also in one go 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:08.049
 successful 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.189
 what we say we do what we 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.789
 are reliable 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.509
 that is very important being flexible and 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.219
 nowadays we get everyone quickly 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.599
 driver's license and you probably yes too 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.969
 I thought so 

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.079
 we can arrange very quickly there is none 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.299
 only problem 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.889
 the quality is quite high at info about 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.029
 so the chance of success in first time is 

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:27.009
 also very high 

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:28.420
 The theory allows pay would I want 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.429
 because the theory is natural 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.319
 very important in the part 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.119
 yes the advice i give is to get one 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.039
 take a course at the moment you take one 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.469
 choice you have a bit more value and 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.689
 then the chance to go is 98% 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.979
 yes i would also like my me theories 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.359

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.029
 also go old discs you already 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:48.459
 in that you then walk parallel 

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:51.069
