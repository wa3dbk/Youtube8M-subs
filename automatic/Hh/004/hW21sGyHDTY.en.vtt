00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
is gonna be one of those baits that want

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.629 
is gonna be one of those baits that want
to<00:01:51.810> probably<00:01:51.959> be<00:01:52.170> throwing<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:53.219> I<00:01:53.340> was<00:01:53.520> in

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
to probably be throwing if I was in

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.219 
to probably be throwing if I was in
South<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.060> pop<00:01:54.270> their<00:01:54.450> office<00:01:54.749> in<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.929> southern

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
South I pop their office in the southern

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.569 
South I pop their office in the southern
states<00:01:55.439> I'd<00:01:55.560> probably<00:01:55.709> throw<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.219> jerk<00:01:56.399> bait

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
states I'd probably throw in a jerk bait

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.429 
states I'd probably throw in a jerk bait
on<00:01:56.729> some<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:56.969> those<00:01:57.030> bigger<00:01:57.270> waters<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.229> right

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
on some of those bigger waters but right

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.099 
on some of those bigger waters but right
now<00:01:59.090> this<00:02:00.090> probably<00:02:00.479> won't<00:02:00.600> get<00:02:00.719> use<00:02:00.899> till

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
now this probably won't get use till

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.060 
now this probably won't get use till
