00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.130
 and everyone is welcome on the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.320
 dr fitness string so today I 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.330
 wanted to address the five principles of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.460
 base of the muscular construction 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.960
 the five basic principles that go 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.359
 really stimulated hypertrophy 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.630
 muscle to help you take 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.560
 the mass simply so the five 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.599
 principles that I wanted to address 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.310
 today are the volume 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.140
 drive 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.110
 the training intensity the time of 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.719
 rest between the series the pan pot is 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.730
 to say the live time and the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.989
 drive frequency then the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 first principle so that's the volume 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.760
 so the bulk volume that consists of 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.899
 number of rules you make is at 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.059
 number of series you do 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.489
 there is an inverse relationship between 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.840
 two roughly in general when the number 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.460
 series increases the number of 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.960
 repetitions decreases and when the number 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.969
 repetition increases the number of 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.190
 jiminy series for hypertrophy 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.230
 muscle in general at the level of 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.769
 repetitions we try to be between 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.210
 8 and 12 repetition this is this 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.670
 fork there that will give you roughly 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.130
 the best father hypertrophic answer 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.850
 traffic go there the mayor of pons of hyper 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.689
 Muscular camping in general below 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.790
 repetitions 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.119
 you will be more in the work of the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.950
 force and beyond 12 aisle beyond 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.290
 15 repetition you are no longer in 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.380
 endurance is the problem is that it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.119
 there is not enough work to stimulate 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.159
 muscle hypertrophy and so 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.450
 take it right after at the series level 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.750
 in general we try to be between 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.220
 3 and 4 sets per exercise so the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.259
 second point is intensity and 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.550
 intensity roughly how much of 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.960
 weight because I have to use so 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.520
 in the search for the best 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.670
 simulation of possible hypertrophy 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.730
 I would say 70 % of your 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.440
 a max rave except that we are not all 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.540
 professionals we do not know 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.130
 inch our a rep max so what I 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.160
 advises you to do is work 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.030
 with a weight try if you make it 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.500
 less than eight 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.210
 So it's too heavy 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.650
 you make more than 12 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.360
 So it's too light so 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.100
 try to really find the weight that 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.560
 allows you to work between 8 and 12 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.630
 repetition what you need to know is 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.430
 that between volume is intensity there is the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.320
 same relation against series and 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.720
 repetitions ie that in general 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.400
 no more the volume increases more 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.550
 decreased intensity and more intensity 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.440
 increases the volume decreases the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.530
 third point addressed is the time of 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.760
 rest time I call 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.800
 really that's the rest time that is 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.820
 no time to text playtime 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.890
 disputed that my mates and that's 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.220
 really rest time the time of 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.530
 optimum rest in general these 60 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.410
 seconds after savary that's why 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.790
 I prefer to say between 45 and 90 seconds 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.020
 according to what you do on the big 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.190
 exercise like the bench press 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.470
 squats etc 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.600
 better to take 90 seconds of a 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.880
 minute thirty and for drc isolation 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.920
 like and will take 45 seconds 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.500
 good knowing who is still 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.270
 average of 60 seconds 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.110
 the fourth point his slats taxes and 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.660
 the delay 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:15.709
 it's basically the live time 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:17.270
 that is, if you do that you 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.220
 do not control the charge you stimulate 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.230
 not the same hypertrophy if you do 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.270
 box jump or if you do the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.880
 butterfly pulls as crossfit 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.739
 you do not stimulate hypertrophy for 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.360
 stimulate hypertrophy I do not want you 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.489
 give exact numbers I 'm just going 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.310
 tell you control controlled load 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.770
 on the controlled descent on the rent 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.560
 and you can exploded on the lift to 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.500
 the limit but really control your 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.980
 descent sound go down during 4 5 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.480
 seconds 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.100
 it's totally different 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.660
 other training technique but for 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.700
 stimulate hypertrophy control the 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.560
 charge to the maximum and reassemble 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.600
 quietly the fifth point addressed 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.460
 this is the frequency roughly the frequency 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.150
 know how many times a week because 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.730
 I have to work 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.380
 intel muscles and studies have shown 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.460
 than 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.200
 as a 100% natural athlete 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.570
 natural the best for us was to 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.340
 work the muscle twice 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.670
 week ago there is one more point that 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.080
 I wanted to talk about it really 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.100
 love what you do have fun at 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.590
 the room 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.650
 to take everything seriously that's what makes 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.140
 what you do is somewhere 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.120
 someone who loves what he does with the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.280
 program the draw of the world will progress 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.570
 more than someone who is not strong 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.150
 in his training and who live not 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.230
 at all with the best yellow program 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.270
 thank you for the time you granted me 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.970
 I hope this video will be useful 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.590
 if you enjoyed it do not hesitate to

 next videos here is there I know 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.060
 not what to say in fact
