00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.130
 hello there is a garage killer you remember 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.650
 can be about our want our hand 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.050
 small budget draccary project 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.050
 the business has not ended 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.870
 first thing we drove the car into the garage 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.440
 raised on the lift looked it 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.440
 girls under the skirt 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.310
 everything was fine there was no rust 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.150
 in general rule 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.489
 some kind of defecting and realized that we 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.739
 there are parts and what we have to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.430
 buy turned out to buy what we need more 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.430
 a lot of things 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.920
 something we found but most and 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.970
 a piece of the result japan they go for a long time 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.770
 so the matter dragged on 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.460
 start building a car we 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.460
 decided to motor 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.250
 we took the motor from the strong 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.930
 sr20 atmospheric 165 horsepower there 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.659
 several options for installing this 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.340
 engine leave all suspension from 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.399
 toyota 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:42.320
 engine mounts sold 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.950
 we immediately threw out this option we decided 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.100
 to put 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.259
 engine to beam from the goals but the engine 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.509
 turned out to be heavily biased back in these 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.799
 options did not seem to us very 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.380
 comfortable not very correct we took 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.860
 American props took native props from 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.289
 sylvia 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.289
 and connected them almost like families 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.870
 to 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.320
 we have a place to hook the oven hoses 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.430
 we have room for the box 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:18.280
 shifter turned out to be in current in place then pasha 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.890
 so much together but a little but his 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.430
 a little sawed but it's not scary in 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.440
 general motor has become a regular phenomenon between 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.060
 second and third cylinder oven 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.650
 there must be a good well suspension of worms 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.170
 worth on the quote gave them easy everything 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.070
 just need to buy the right parts 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:43.240
 we bought the correct trapezoid and has to 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:47.080
 ordinary Kiev details cling to me 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.880
 this is an active traction awning fine in our 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.709
 case they put the standard because 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.000
 until we wheel others anywhere 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.430
 going to beam hotels that is from the place 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.240
 had to lengthen the steering shaft 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.760
 because rake is worth a little further 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.500
 than on E85 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.500
 our Siberian rake will take the brain 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.200
 while instructed motor in passing, we 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.660
 ordered parts in Krasnoyarsk from 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.510
 we found the local necrophiles 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.430
 trunk and gas tank on this car is 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.840
 but we do not finally have a car bottom 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.090
 rock even in the winter we decided to collect miss all 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.030
 court my friend Pavlik we gathered 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.660
 lower turned out to be a classic not solo 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.150
 care no bluff just ride main 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.100
 gas does not let go absolutely the same budget 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.400
 except that the car is turbo 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.530
 in 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.240
 and was collected in two weeks we all 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.180
 quickly screwed everything in the regular places 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:51.910
 almost no alterations well, so 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:54.490
 it turned out to pour shorter car collected 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.110
 we are such senoes he rides on a not did not 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.840
 know it turned out that no builder 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.020
 life they are not riders 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.160
 well i 'm good at it freaked out and let's just 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:11.950
 change black you want to build those 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:15.910
 hello everyone 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.480
 Here I became the new owner of the hachirock 2 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.810
 cap 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.389
 okay let her stay 2 master in 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.250
 Generally what plans for the car first 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.650
 first you need to transfer the car new 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.600
 the garage got it already installed 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.970
 motor, respectively, you wait 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.280
 here i think i say one problem 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.530
 I decided to set the suspension 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.300
 of course disk bridge from ae86 lock 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:56.620
 I would like them to brew we will see 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:59.919
 it will turn out to buy will not work in the cabin 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:05.050
 we will only panel . 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:06.370
 steering wheel and 2 buckets as we now have 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.260
 all parts that are already possible 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.540
 spin to the car 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.540
 - let's start the assembly soon and the next part 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:20.380
 I hope you will see there as we collect 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:22.600
 from and well shorter while pasha turns the nuts in 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.620
