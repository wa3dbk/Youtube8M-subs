00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.170
 rhine-main is moving that is rather 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.410
 approaching a thing with great enthusiasm the goal more 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.900
 Have motivation 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.720
 because everything that happens about acting that is just victory in the 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.030
 Enlargement Interest You can also understand things better 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.609
 On the other hand, one has to say that the figures 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.729
 supports the oxygen uptake of the brain 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.360
 can then just concentrate even better and that is he learning the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.130
 also very important so movement bothers me the concentration but 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.350
 allows you 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.540
 downright and it would have 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.489
 That is not that could be understood as a principle of learning 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.280
 So you can have that many lesson content just about exercise 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.200
 Let's take the time to teach German 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.510
 when the topic of prepositions is pending 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.200
 above behind 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.570
 how does that work wonderfully in a movement game? 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.490
 Vienna 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.329
 And so, for example, you can give Bernd a supposedly calory shot 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.120
 Principle or incorporated 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.590
 ensemble 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.850
 and there have been so far 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 imprisoned in her memory 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.820
 Literature acquisition has once a year way what to do with that one Laue 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.420
 used carrots and can differentiate 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.780
 so logically 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.650
 she apart 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.240
 can hold which Enke car for example with words 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.890
 you need it done 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.680
 a well-functioning auditory perception 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.079
 and everything about movement also has something to do with perception 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.140
 "But I understand perception as well 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.630
 Audi drive and visual perception the second is that one 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.200
 Written language acquisition 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.200
 also the free culture is given given 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.690
 if you're lucky you do not get good writings 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.370
 So you have to do Marco Reus exercises and training 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.110
 you can use the whole body while typing 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.890
 So writing only on paper is the children's very bitter hand of it 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.190
 Of course, with the whole body a looseness one must be controlled 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.190
 has also delighted 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.369
 their experiences made 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.369
 the sick children with migration background 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:48.300
 Over movement the judges had also play can they look different 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.569
 even if she maybe 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.319
 Germans not as mother tongue may have some problems with that 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.969
 but also in 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:57.069
 the Germans in the German language competence close 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.709
 when they cross the Carpathians 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.739
 to be more addressed in the classroom 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.980
 They also feel much more demanded in their resources 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.709
 what has one 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:09.849
 spoke 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.149
 Supports language support 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:15.469
 about movements about the physicality of the child 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.449
 the great benefit that the children are actively involved in that they enjoy and 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.350
 enthusiasm 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.570
 There are many things there, for example, or vocabulary 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.840
 can be about moving activities 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.620
 wonderful also supported and promoted 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.030
 so you can give occasions for a reason of movement 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.540
 you can let that be 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.750
 very systematic approach with the children and playful yet that is 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.450
 the beautiful 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.630
 that has a system will be unfoldable if one spoke on the one hand 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.730
 moves us a meal spread 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.199
 but at the same time the best for the child 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.319
 challenging game end as welcome 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.100
 Employment «invisible» to blue Nile and have good mood with 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.100
 is connected 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:10.609
 the sik kids with ad hs are often asked you can not finally 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:11.550
 to sit down 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.190
 she must put all her energy into the body's Steag regime 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.820
 meanwhile, is the helping hands 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.660
 would give a bit of confidence in the movement 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.200
 and then again their willingness to have them with time 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.670
 could concentrate on the other hand 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.379
 it is also such that the movement becomes, for example, and at one 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.690
 Percent after sitting the apple certain 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.690
 Form of attention shows the children 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.350
 after rain their balance system 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.350
 this is something of a legitimate child giving up cases 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.740
 since you're on a ball into the net my laptop has a single up and down motion 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.569
 This stimulates attention on the other hand, it can be 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.730
 rather, focus on the subject matter and you will be allowed to do it yourself 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.100
 increased if not permanently driven 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.400
 they can not see something 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.680
 regular c become disciplined so there are also these kids 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.339
 the willingness to participate 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.360
 can learn a good German z circle Soest at all 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.439
 8 all the potential of the child back 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:31.189
 on his cognitive has his emotional but also Skoff his 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.639
 physically notorious potential 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:34.660
 in German 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.729
 classes 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.610
 It is also possible to stage poems that involve the body 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.330
 and to represent something 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.919
 you can just learn the language 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.060
 Moving events as a language supportive 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.800
 take action 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.860
 the child's action must be promoted to increase his motivation 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.290
 that is in my view that that 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.960
 a good learning concept no matter what subject 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.029
 that can be just as good in math 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.960
 out 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.960
 records 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:15.210
 and there are the geneticists who are good at using Bohle like that 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.080
 The main role that kids will take care of them 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.710
 it also becomes an activity 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.710
 and then there's as soon as I know the whole series 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.479
 Possibility to encourage children with material Homann 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.410
 where can meet and where you can be in action as a first trial 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.809
 is characterized by an experienced yourself 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:38.449
 but by the great activity percent suggestions
