00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Good time dear lovers 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.890
 chess with you chess school d4d 5 and 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.500
 today we will talk about gold 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.200
 chess rules then spent which 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.340
 necessary for every chess player in assessing 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.140
 positions in front of us in the position chart 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.740
 taken from the party of Alexander Fomin 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.070
 who played white and his opponent 17 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.789
 input c6 cheese attacking the horse well 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.070
 let's try to evaluate the position of any 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.850
 of us in this position most likely 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.399
 or 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.760
 exchanged it not for an elephant with a move like 6 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.610
 taking advantage of two elephants 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.210
 or just walked a horse let's say on 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.750
 e3 but alexander does for now 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.100
 country hot blonde 6 meaning he donates 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.730
 knight for two pawns the question arises 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.680
 Why did Alexander do this ? 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.750
 Now let's take a closer look at this position. 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.510
 playing 8 August swing elephant to 6 Alexander 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.290
 calculated this option 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.299
 forced option after the exchange and 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.400
 even in the park there was a cheese course owning 8 and 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.500
 after c5 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.930
 black quickly lost i think face 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.900
 counted the main thing continues and colder 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.650
 and one rook one well let's now 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.750
 let's estimate this position and resort to 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.450
 the golden rule of the so -called chess 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.689
 the rule of fighting figures that sounds 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.540
 so when assessing the position namely 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.650
 the material balance of power is necessary 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.070
 take into account the figures 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.390
 which affects the result of the party 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:48.600
 let's look at the position of whites 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.350
 it means they have an elephant elephant 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.619
 Black's rook if we calculate then we 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.780
 you will see that black is not a horse 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.189
 sold killed them legal is a pawn but everything 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.090
 there is an arithmetic calculation 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.170
 blacks play with material 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.690
 the advantage is so but we are with you 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.050
 just said that when counting 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.000
 our material garden 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.460
 nissin we only consider those 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.090
 figures that influence the result 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.750
 party 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.960
 White has two bishops and a rook 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.210
 affects the outcome of the game and what about 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.920
 I will only show black ones in the game 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.850
 elephant and horse 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.630
 ourselves that rook on a8 and c8 bishop 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.790
 nor does it affect the result of the game 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.090
 so if we are now using something 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.980
 chess rules we honor a300 figures there and 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.130
 yourself that is white to play actually with 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.690
 extra rook and two extra pawns then 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.180
 there is knowing this rule after 17 move 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.810
 c6 we will not be difficult 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.510
 sacrifice a piece for two pawns since 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.420
 we now come to the conclusion that we 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.750
 we are actually staying with an extra rook 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.990
 and rook 8 and sun 8 do not affect 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.000
 the result of the game this game was 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.530
 alexander pastures beautiful style 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.060
 before us is the next position which 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.600
 originated in the park were looking for anderson off course 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.180
 White White did not want to move 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.430
 why the party was waiting for the white party 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.150
 again if we read materially 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.300
 the ratio of forces there we will see that on the board 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.220
 material equality but remembering 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.590
 the golden rule of chess is what we 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.000
 count only those figures that affects 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.120
 on the result of the party 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.580
 we ourselves see that whites 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.940
 no figure affect people from 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.800
 parties as fret motionless and a how 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.220
 they can not make a move due to loss 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.390
 rooks therefore all four pieces are white 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.000
 located on 1 horizontal 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.000
 they do not affect the outcome of the game so what 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.340
 black, then they have a rook in the game which 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.820
 paralyzed all these four black white 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.750
 figures 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:13.209
 plus the game now tupit elephant that is 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.910
 black hornbeam is actually with excess water and 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.780
 extra elephant after following about deserve 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.710
 7 whites may suffer big 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:27.320
 material losses are therefore reasonable 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.730
 the fact that whites surrendered the party 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.200
 finish this video water video lesson 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:37.070
 golden chess right i would like 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.800
 the classic party eive keris which 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.160
 was played in forty-eighth year again 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.200
 same let's resort to the material 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.250
 correlation of forces arithmetic 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.770
 white black are equal but remembering the golden 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.650
 the rule we ourselves see that scientists are all 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.220
 the pieces in the game are like white rook and 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.920
 elephant 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.410
 they are not participating yet does not affect 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.050
 the result of the game is again the recipient 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.620
 black plays with excess water and excess 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.970
 an elephant 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.290
 in such cases it is necessary to quickly 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.530
 organize either an attack on the king or 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.300
 seek a material gain after a couple more 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.270
 moves and what 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.810
 and the white will develop with the elephant and bring 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.930
 rook 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:26.690
 therefore, in this position, and it plays 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:31.910
 sorry queries plays actively and he 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.280
 playing an elephant takes on f4 that is he 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.620
 sacrifices an elephant 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.770
 for destroying the pedestrian cover of the king and 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.110
 for opening the vertical f 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:45.100
 elephant donated but even after 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.260
 white elephant settle if we are with you again 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.020
 we respect materially the balance of power 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.500
 affecting the ice and then we will see 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.530
 that still blacks still play 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.380
 with the extra rook nothing terrible in this 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.570
 nicely there is no victim on board opened white 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:08.930
 King and now will be much easier cotton 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:13.580
 forge gave still followed horse f3 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:16.720
 well in the future accurate blows Kerry 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.720
 calmly won 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:26.440
 and after the servant's turn 4th in 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:30.010
 surrendered again look at the final 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:34.140
 position ourselves that the rook is on a1 so 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:37.870
 did not make a single move in the party see 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:40.690
 what do we repeat with you the scary rule 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.640
 figures means it sounds so when 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.800
 assessment of the position namely material 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.840
 power relationships need to be considered 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.840
 a figure that affects the result 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.550
 parties so now their own desk lights 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.220
 bot to sacrifice if you see that 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.800
 rival has not developed from you are still a figure and 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.080
 even if it hung on the board looking at 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.420
 equality do not forget to consider something 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.120
 which figures that affect the result 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.510
 party, well thank you all for your attention to 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.510
 new meetings
