00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.439
 this realize deck this must be how 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.000
 sustainable you are no less than go 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.230
 ahead eagles but they go through now lie 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.269
 you out 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.969
 yes it is indeed sour sure that 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.240
 this way should just go unfortunate 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.310
 what you yourself say no less 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.750
 If you must be lucky the odds 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.580
 go in especially you got two too 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.990
 chances hell is shocked at second 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.430
 half are just without 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.230
 seamlessly brush everyone onboard the 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.789
 law and pressure very different than you come one 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.289
 oh before and then yes then we have to again 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.730
 come 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.980
 yes and unfortunately of that ball not in and 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.670
 remain 0 then it becomes exciting until it 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.079
 end of the century had to then go 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.339
 heads a little on 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.510
 also conclude that you actually have that 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.800
 match maybe Wednesday 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.120
 have wasted when it is true 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.620
 theory became but you maybe more 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.809
 should have won 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.979
 actually, but you can still see it 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.229
 everything happen it's all yours 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.059
 because you have a thousand or three three playable 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:56.199
 we came here with feeling 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.399
 that can just end well and until the 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.710
 five is not actually just fine 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.959
 done and then without you having one 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.249
 article all it all come back and then one 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:04.180
 Help eventful year 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.789
 also click for you maybe it 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.950
 most turbulent year career you certainly do 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.560
 Just start well the season which 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.180
 take that at the top and then you just drop 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.049
 much much rather end up crying or 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.149
 the place of 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.979
 And then you 're glad you still have that team 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.149
 can play and it's just a shame 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.369
 you go out in the first round 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.590
 while you just good football but also 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.369
 a lot has happened on planet 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.509
 yes absolutely sure that's why it was alone 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.700
 but fun still coming to poetic 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.210
 I have even had the seasons 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.679
 say yes arches with ups and downs and yes 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.549
 it's just one without it 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.170
 were ending 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.880
 how do you personally look back on this 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.469
 seasonal floris cord 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.929
 significant share in for it 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.549
 After successfully doing for sure but I think 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.020
 the first hell of some team 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.009
 achievement and then you go along yourself 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.380
 to play 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.930
 we combine 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.780
 attacking you will be in position and again 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.009
 the tracks no racist and second as 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.780
 second season will be a little less 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.829
 but finally good afterwards 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.299
 on 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.640
 And then we have the name that so you 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.720
 just again the resist it is 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.619
 too bad you see the first miracles again 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.240
 Exit 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.320
 there is still something nice on season 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.899
 for you still go on a fun 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.360
 training camps yes certainly yes one 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.849
 nice ending so no always everything they 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.470
 quite a reasonable seasons is the 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.130
 objective was to have that after kingsale 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.720
 and just nice endings 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.160
 to Curacao but you have to go now 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.019
 I don't think about it 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.970
 well it's just sour it's a shame 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.280
 everyone I think everyone still 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.959
 round will continue after the chance 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.980
 just in and therefore is just send 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.980
 that you wear it that way
