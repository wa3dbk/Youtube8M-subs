 And these hang on a hook what in the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.090
 Principle looks like a trifle 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.309
 is actually very complicated and it 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.829
 there is a lot to it all right 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.510
 Let's make a pylone on the ground 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.510
 drives gets five criminal seconds 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.989
 here the drivers have the task one

 to start the course with pylons 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.219
 staked out is the biggest difficulty 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.129
 In doing so, you will need a Euro range 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.460
 take up the filled with 48 beer crates 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.680
 is 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.269
 who goes too fast in the curve of the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.339
 runs the danger that the boxes of the 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.590
 palette tilt and that takes time 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.840
 the driver does not have it in two minutes 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.229
 and 20 seconds, the task must be solved 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.630
 his 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.289

 to get the ball into the goal 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:28.610
 if the ball falls beside it means 20 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:31.280
 seconds deduction a little bit 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.380
 complicated the situation is Ballauf
