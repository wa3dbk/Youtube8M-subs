where the joint is and it's still quite
bumpy<00:01:58.729> because<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.270> just<00:01:59.630> haven't<00:01:59.990> perfected

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
bumpy because I just haven't perfected

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.300 
bumpy because I just haven't perfected
getting<00:02:01.100> them<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.969> smooth<00:02:02.799> yet<00:02:03.799> but<00:02:04.130> they're

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
getting them that smooth yet but they're

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.789 
getting them that smooth yet but they're
not<00:02:04.460> too<00:02:04.969> noticeable<00:02:05.270> they're<00:02:05.960> not<00:02:06.079> too<00:02:06.439> bumpy

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
not too noticeable they're not too bumpy

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.570 
not too noticeable they're not too bumpy
really<00:02:07.520> per<00:02:07.939> tilt<00:02:08.890> they<00:02:09.890> don't<00:02:10.100> really<00:02:10.280> look

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
really per tilt they don't really look

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.840 
really per tilt they don't really look
that<00:02:10.970> bump<00:02:11.300> is<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:11.930> know<00:02:12.520> it's<00:02:13.520> not<00:02:13.670> that

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
that bump is it you know it's not that

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.750 
that bump is it you know it's not that
silly<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.330> can't<00:02:14.600> wear<00:02:14.810> them<00:02:14.990> really

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
silly that you can't wear them really

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.580 
silly that you can't wear them really
but<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:17.000> edgy

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
but so edgy

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.710 
but so edgy
see<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:17.920> can<00:02:18.129> see<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.700> there<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.209> probably

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
see you can see that there and probably

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.509 
see you can see that there and probably
the<00:02:19.989> white<00:02:20.230> tips<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.800> wood<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.129> would<00:02:21.250> have<00:02:21.400> not

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
the white tips of wood it would have not

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.220 
the white tips of wood it would have not
so<00:02:21.700> bad<00:02:21.879> but<00:02:22.090> because<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.660> sorted<00:02:23.019> color

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
so bad but because of the sorted color

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.920 
so bad but because of the sorted color
it<00:02:23.560> makes<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.370> more<00:02:24.580> noticeable<00:02:24.819> that<00:02:25.720> you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
it makes it more noticeable that you

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.309 
it makes it more noticeable that you
have<00:02:26.110> stuck<00:02:26.860> tips<00:02:27.190> on<00:02:27.450> yourself<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.080> it

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
have stuck tips on yourself and so it

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.440 
have stuck tips on yourself and so it
wasn't<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.709> very<00:02:29.739> good<00:02:30.129> result<00:02:30.519> so<00:02:30.849> just<00:02:31.269> to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
wasn't a very good result so just to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.119 
wasn't a very good result so just to
hide<00:02:31.629> that<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.959> bit<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.260> did<00:02:32.530> put<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:32.860> French

definitely new catalogs out so whether

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.130

it<00:03:06.730> will<00:03:07.000> still<00:03:07.239> be<00:03:07.390> now<00:03:07.540> what<00:03:07.720> are<00:03:07.840> those<00:03:07.930> it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
it will still be now what are those it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.330 
it will still be now what are those it
still<00:03:08.349> would<00:03:08.560> but<00:03:08.739> whether<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.040> still<00:03:09.190> be

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
still would but whether it still be

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.170 
still would but whether it still be
twenty<00:03:09.700> twenty<00:03:10.120> four<00:03:10.360> hundred<00:03:12.120> percent<00:03:13.120> sure

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
twenty twenty four hundred percent sure

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.759 
twenty twenty four hundred percent sure
buff<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:13.989> have<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.170> check<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.440> out

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
buff so you just have to check that out

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.789 
buff so you just have to check that out
if<00:03:15.040> you're<00:03:16.030> interested<00:03:16.090> but<00:03:17.019> let's<00:03:17.500> say<00:03:17.650> for

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
if you're interested but let's say for

if you're interested but let's say for
the<00:03:17.860> money<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.129> do<00:03:18.280> get<00:03:18.459> enough<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.879> do<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.480> mean

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
the money you do get enough to do I mean

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.800 
the money you do get enough to do I mean
one<00:03:20.260> set<00:03:20.560> hard<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:21.069> be<00:03:21.280> hardly<00:03:22.209> used<00:03:22.389> anything

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
one set hard to be hardly used anything

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.090 
one set hard to be hardly used anything
really<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.290> have<00:03:23.530> got<00:03:23.739> enough<00:03:23.950> in<00:03:24.069> there

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
really so you have got enough in there

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.809 
really so you have got enough in there
so<00:03:24.400> I'd<00:03:24.790> say<00:03:25.000> at<00:03:25.180> least<00:03:27.180> four<00:03:28.180> sets<00:03:28.540> I<00:03:29.670> mean<00:03:30.670> you

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
so I'd say at least four sets I mean you

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.550 
so I'd say at least four sets I mean you
get<00:03:30.940> 40<00:03:32.220> nail<00:03:33.220> tips<00:03:34.049> now<00:03:35.049> obviously<00:03:35.349> they're

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
get 40 nail tips now obviously they're

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.430 
get 40 nail tips now obviously they're
in<00:03:35.590> different<00:03:36.099> sizes<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.090> will<00:03:37.690> end<00:03:38.170> up

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
in different sizes so you will end up

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.780 
in different sizes so you will end up
having<00:03:38.620> some<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:39.069> won't<00:03:39.220> be<00:03:39.340> suitable<00:03:39.549> for

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
having some that won't be suitable for

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.089 
having some that won't be suitable for
you<00:03:40.000> but<00:03:40.239> you<00:03:40.359> probably<00:03:40.720> if<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.500> were<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.709> mind

you but you probably if you were a mind

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.860 
you but you probably if you were a mind
to<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.459> probably<00:03:42.760> could<00:03:43.000> court<00:03:43.569> and<00:03:43.720> file

this<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.790> quick<00:04:04.450> dip<00:04:04.810> powder<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:06.609> put<00:04:06.870> the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
this is a quick dip powder you put the

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.589 
this is a quick dip powder you put the
resin<00:04:08.290> on<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.880> then<00:04:10.000> once<00:04:10.209> that's<00:04:10.419> done

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
resin on and then once that's done

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.479 
resin on and then once that's done
you've<00:04:10.959> done<00:04:11.109> the<00:04:11.260> steps<00:04:11.500> with<00:04:11.769> that<00:04:12.010> then<00:04:12.340> you

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
you've done the steps with that then you

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.699 
you've done the steps with that then you
dip<00:04:12.700> your<00:04:12.730> finger<00:04:13.150> into<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.510> powder<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:14.200> then

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
dip your finger into the powder and then

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.289 
dip your finger into the powder and then
obviously<00:04:14.919> that<00:04:15.160> becomes<00:04:15.579> hard<00:04:15.849> and<00:04:16.060> then<00:04:16.209> you

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
obviously that becomes hard and then you

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.800 
obviously that becomes hard and then you
get<00:04:16.419> this<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.880> if<00:04:19.090> you<00:04:19.180> can<00:04:19.209> hear<00:04:19.419> that<00:04:19.570> hard

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
get this and if you can hear that hard

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.449

the liquid type of a credit where you
use<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.360> monomer<00:04:34.780> then<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:35.139> pick<00:04:35.289> up<00:04:35.320> the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
use the monomer then you pick up the

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.860 
use the monomer then you pick up the
ball<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.280> powder<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.850> then<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.419> have<00:04:37.630> to

ball of the powder and then you have to

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.290 
ball of the powder and then you have to
smooth<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:39.009> make<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.310> shape<00:04:39.490> an<00:04:39.669> analysis<00:04:39.910> is

just<00:04:40.509> dip<00:04:41.080> in<00:04:41.289> and<00:04:41.560> then<00:04:41.740> all<00:04:41.889> CS<00:04:42.220> sticks<00:04:42.490> on

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
just dip in and then all CS sticks on

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.390 
just dip in and then all CS sticks on
your<00:04:43.960> natural<00:04:44.410> nail<00:04:44.800> itself<00:04:46.560> so<00:04:47.560> I'm<00:04:47.979> saying
