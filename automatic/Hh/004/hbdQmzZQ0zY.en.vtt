00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.770
 Zdarova gangsters with you panda this brie fight 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.320
 stacks against raw raise actually 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.600
 both heroes are tough enough 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.949
 In this mode, of course bristle running is not 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.269
 the leader who would argue 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.399
 ruin is quite a mider many leave but 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.550
 it's a damn place in the middle of the map 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.050
 because the first skill 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.239
 drives away opponents second well 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.329

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.649
 pushes with aganim well and without aganim 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.090

 how would it be softer to say lyuley people 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.969
 not afraid to say so not to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.820

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.970
 confidently becoming one of the leaders 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.939
 of our project and not the first fight he 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.320
 wins without problems ruin make 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.930
 nothing can because enough 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.540
 thin it slows down slows down 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.490
 punch it manages to suck damage 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.930
 manages to brie a wimp man's hand damage 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.509
 at the end of the day it doesn't need him 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.119
 have spines spines allow you to break 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.579
 faces many many thorns many many oh 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.799
 e and the worst chip in what's the joke 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.890
 when a column in the Foreign Ministry whether because 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.270
 A glass of thorns nastakat possible to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.750
 more block it practically 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.210
 we won't do anything really 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.159
 forget about the fact that the attacks of course yes 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.040
 just hard to punch in the back and 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.920
 turn around and run away nothing complicated 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.240

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.409
 no well, in general, the throne of God in general 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.990
 is one of the most powerful heroes 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.479
 midone did he prove the same not in one battle 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.010
 but itâ€™s still too early to sum up 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.770
