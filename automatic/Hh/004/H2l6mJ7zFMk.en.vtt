the big end
that's<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.790> indented<00:02:49.240> end<00:02:50.100> indented<00:02:51.100> end<00:02:51.250> in

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
that's the indented end indented end in

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.860 
that's the indented end indented end in
goes<00:02:51.820> first<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.570> you<00:02:53.470> know<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.590> got<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:53.860> right

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
goes first and you know you got it right

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.500 
goes first and you know you got it right
because<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.200> jet<00:02:56.410> will<00:02:56.590> actually<00:02:57.300> sink<00:02:58.300> down

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
because the jet will actually sink down

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.970 
because the jet will actually sink down
like<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.110> orifice<00:02:59.380> tube<00:03:00.990> next<00:03:01.990> piece

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.020 

it's<00:03:06.459> too<00:03:06.580> slow<00:03:06.819> jet

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.550 

that<00:03:10.660> gets<00:03:10.840> pushed<00:03:11.080> in

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.380 

just<00:03:14.250> like<00:03:14.430> that

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
just like that

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.410 
just like that
and<00:03:16.900> then<00:03:16.990> the<00:03:17.080> last<00:03:17.290> piece<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.890> main<00:03:18.070> jet

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.300 

the<00:03:23.840> spring<00:03:24.170> retainer<00:03:24.530> goes<00:03:24.770> on<00:03:24.950> top<00:03:25.160> with

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
the spring retainer goes on top with

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.690 
the spring retainer goes on top with
this<00:03:25.430> low<00:03:25.640> jet<00:03:26.920> you<00:03:27.920> just<00:03:28.130> give<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.280> little<00:03:28.340> push

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
this low jet you just give a little push

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.690 
this low jet you just give a little push
in<00:03:28.880> like<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.210> and<00:03:30.460> then<00:03:31.460> when<00:03:31.610> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
in like that and then when the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.580 
in like that and then when the
carburetor<00:03:32.210> gets<00:03:32.360> clipped<00:03:32.600> on<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:33.080> holds<00:03:33.470> the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
carburetor gets clipped on it holds the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:44.790 
carburetor gets clipped on it holds the
other<00:03:33.680> pieces<00:03:33.950> in

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.920 

and<00:03:45.190> that's<00:03:46.090> pretty<00:03:46.330> much<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.690> we're<00:03:46.810> gonna

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
and that's pretty much it we're gonna

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.520 
and that's pretty much it we're gonna
clip<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.800> carburetor<00:03:48.220> ball<00:03:48.430> back<00:03:48.640> on<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.530> put

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
clip the carburetor ball back on and put

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.700 
clip the carburetor ball back on and put
the<00:03:50.590> car<00:03:50.770> back<00:03:50.800> on<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.430> we'll<00:03:51.520> try
