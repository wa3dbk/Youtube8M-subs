00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
little break every now and then that'll

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.770 
little break every now and then that'll
give<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.680> time<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.950> dry<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.820> can<00:03:21.660> also

varnish on them and they'll become

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.710 
varnish on them and they'll become
sticky<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:26.970> way<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.209> dinosaur<00:03:27.570> will<00:03:27.660> be

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
sticky and that way the dinosaur will be

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.830 
sticky and that way the dinosaur will be
drying<00:03:27.930> your<00:03:28.049> fingers<00:03:28.380> won't<00:03:28.620> stick<00:03:29.660> now<00:03:30.660> by
