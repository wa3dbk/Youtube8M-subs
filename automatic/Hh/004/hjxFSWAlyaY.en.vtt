00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
I recommend backing it up on your

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.480 
I recommend backing it up on your
computer<00:02:47.960> like<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.410> did<00:02:48.620> right<00:02:48.740> now<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:48.920> have<00:02:49.460> a

whole<00:02:49.670> bunch<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.910> other<00:02:50.000> stuff<00:02:50.270> like<00:02:50.900> the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
whole bunch of other stuff like the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.200 
whole bunch of other stuff like the
standard<00:02:51.380> project<00:02:51.830> them<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.340> some<00:02:52.670> emulators

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
standard project them and some emulators

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.600 
standard project them and some emulators
and<00:02:53.390> stuff<00:02:53.570> like<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.960> but<00:02:54.920> if<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.310> ever<00:02:55.400> want

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
and stuff like that but if I ever want

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.890 
and stuff like that but if I ever want
to<00:02:55.640> get<00:02:55.760> back<00:02:55.820> into<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.270> I<00:02:56.330> just<00:02:56.630> get<00:02:56.750> rid<00:02:56.840> of

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
to get back into that I just get rid of

to get back into that I just get rid of
all<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.230> this<00:02:57.350> because<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:57.650> have<00:02:57.800> it<00:02:57.920> all<00:02:58.040> backed

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
all of this because I have it all backed

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.690 
all of this because I have it all backed
up<00:02:58.550> right<00:02:59.270> over<00:02:59.540> here<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:00.220> then<00:03:01.220> just<00:03:01.280> take

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
up right over here and then just take

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.890 
up right over here and then just take
all<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:01.910> off<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.209> put<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.330> back<00:03:02.390> on<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.660> SD

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.380 
card so there we go or just buy another
SD<00:03:05.690> card<00:03:05.959> but<00:03:06.380> I'm<00:03:06.470> too<00:03:06.650> broken<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:07.010> do<00:03:07.100> that

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
SD card but I'm too broken to do that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.780 
SD card but I'm too broken to do that
alright<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:08.630> once<00:03:09.140> all<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.709> is<00:03:10.040> copied<00:03:10.670> on

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
alright so once all of that is copied on

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.280 
alright so once all of that is copied on
also<00:03:11.240> I<00:03:11.390> should<00:03:11.510> probably<00:03:11.630> show<00:03:12.020> you<00:03:12.050> how<00:03:12.230> to

also I should probably show you how to

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.490 
also I should probably show you how to
extract<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:13.610> stuff<00:03:13.940> let's<00:03:14.630> go<00:03:14.750> downloads<00:03:15.260> and
