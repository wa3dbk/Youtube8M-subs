hi<00:00:05.110> this<00:00:05.290> is<00:00:05.320> Alicia<00:00:05.680> know<00:00:05.890> and<00:00:06.130> because<00:00:06.399> I'm

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
hi this is Alicia know and because I'm

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.289 
hi this is Alicia know and because I'm
rebuilding<00:00:07.330> this<00:00:07.750> x4<00:00:08.500> quad<00:00:09.030> with<00:00:10.030> the<00:00:10.059> new

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:10.299 
rebuilding this x4 quad with the new

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.690 
rebuilding this x4 quad with the new
arms<00:00:10.750> you<00:00:10.900> can<00:00:10.930> see<00:00:11.350> that<00:00:11.980> new<00:00:12.190> arms<00:00:12.550> are

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
arms you can see that new arms are

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.260 
arms you can see that new arms are
different<00:00:13.150> so<00:00:13.900> there<00:00:14.170> is<00:00:14.349> no<00:00:15.029> landing<00:00:16.029> gear

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
different so there is no landing gear

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.660 
different so there is no landing gear
here<00:00:16.630> anymore<00:00:17.050> all<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:17.680> arms<00:00:18.009> are<00:00:18.130> here<00:00:18.490> and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
here anymore all the arms are here and

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.630 
here anymore all the arms are here and
quad<00:00:19.570> is<00:00:19.720> sitting<00:00:20.020> nice<00:00:20.230> and<00:00:20.259> good<00:00:20.650> it's

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
quad is sitting nice and good it's

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.729 
quad is sitting nice and good it's
actually<00:00:21.849> looking<00:00:22.360> much<00:00:22.540> more<00:00:23.079> beautiful<00:00:23.290> as

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:23.739 
actually looking much more beautiful as

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.490 
actually looking much more beautiful as
well<00:00:24.070> more<00:00:24.399> futuristic<00:00:24.880> as<00:00:25.210> well<00:00:25.390> I<00:00:25.599> was<00:00:26.200> doing

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
well more futuristic as well I was doing

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.620 
well more futuristic as well I was doing
this<00:00:26.669> rebuilding<00:00:27.669> so<00:00:27.880> I<00:00:27.910> thought<00:00:28.180> it's<00:00:28.329> a<00:00:28.419> good

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
this rebuilding so I thought it's a good

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.780 
this rebuilding so I thought it's a good
idea<00:00:28.779> that<00:00:29.619> I<00:00:29.649> posted<00:00:30.099> this<00:00:30.189> missing<00:00:30.610> video

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
idea that I posted this missing video

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.760 
idea that I posted this missing video
that<00:00:31.300> how<00:00:31.509> to<00:00:31.570> actually<00:00:32.020> connect<00:00:32.439> everything

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
that how to actually connect everything

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.370 
that how to actually connect everything
so<00:00:33.100> when<00:00:33.250> doing<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.640> wirings<00:00:34.059> or<00:00:34.390> connecting

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
so when doing the wirings or connecting

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.779 
so when doing the wirings or connecting
the<00:00:35.440> electronics<00:00:35.949> it's<00:00:36.100> really<00:00:36.250> very<00:00:36.670> very

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
the electronics it's really very very

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.880 
the electronics it's really very very
simple<00:00:37.329> first<00:00:38.019> thing<00:00:38.199> that<00:00:38.230> you<00:00:38.469> need<00:00:38.500> to<00:00:38.739> do

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
simple first thing that you need to do

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.849 
simple first thing that you need to do
is<00:00:39.059> connect<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.179> ESC<00:00:40.690> s<00:00:40.750> okay<00:00:41.079> so<00:00:41.649> there<00:00:41.800> are

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
is connect the ESC s okay so there are

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.369 
is connect the ESC s okay so there are
three<00:00:42.070> cables<00:00:42.489> one<00:00:42.699> cable<00:00:42.969> is<00:00:43.149> down<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:43.989> two

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
three cables one cable is down and two

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.829 
three cables one cable is down and two
cables<00:00:44.739> are<00:00:44.890> on<00:00:45.070> top<00:00:45.460> okay<00:00:46.000> so<00:00:46.480> you<00:00:46.539> can<00:00:46.629> easily

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
cables are on top okay so you can easily

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.810 
cables are on top okay so you can easily
find<00:00:47.170> them<00:00:47.320> I<00:00:47.440> always<00:00:47.739> connect<00:00:48.219> the<00:00:48.339> lower<00:00:48.550> one

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
find them I always connect the lower one

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.779 
find them I always connect the lower one
to<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.149> blue<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:49.660> upper<00:00:50.410> one<00:00:50.589> to<00:00:51.039> either<00:00:51.280> red

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
to the blue and upper one to either red

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.569 
to the blue and upper one to either red
or<00:00:51.820> black<00:00:52.329> later<00:00:52.929> we<00:00:53.199> will<00:00:53.320> probably<00:00:54.249> have<00:00:54.429> to

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
or black later we will probably have to

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.000 
or black later we will probably have to
swap<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.269> red<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.659> black<00:00:55.899> if<00:00:56.109> we<00:00:56.620> find<00:00:56.859> the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
swap the red and black if we find the

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.439 
swap the red and black if we find the
propellers<00:00:57.579> are<00:00:57.699> spitting<00:00:58.089> in<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.269> wrong

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
propellers are spitting in the wrong

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.069 
propellers are spitting in the wrong
direction<00:00:59.070> this<00:01:00.070> is<00:01:00.249> your<00:01:00.460> forward<00:01:00.909> so<00:01:01.510> esc

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
direction this is your forward so esc

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.230 
direction this is your forward so esc
one<00:01:02.309> counterclockwise<00:01:03.809> esc<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:05.010> clockwise

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
one counterclockwise esc to clockwise

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.700 
one counterclockwise esc to clockwise
esc<00:01:07.240> three<00:01:07.479> counterclockwise<00:01:08.880> esc<00:01:09.880> for

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
esc three counterclockwise esc for

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.190 
esc three counterclockwise esc for
clockwise<00:01:11.710> okay<00:01:12.159> so<00:01:12.670> counter<00:01:13.149> clock<00:01:13.570> counter

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
clockwise okay so counter clock counter

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.240 
clockwise okay so counter clock counter
clocking<00:01:15.420> 1234<00:01:16.420> alright<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:17.470> once<00:01:17.979> you<00:01:18.130> have

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
clocking 1234 alright so once you have

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.480 
clocking 1234 alright so once you have
connected<00:01:18.520> all<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.850> ESS<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.890> motors<00:01:21.219> then

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
connected all the ESS to the motors then

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.090 
connected all the ESS to the motors then
you'll<00:01:21.640> connect<00:01:21.969> the<00:01:22.329> ESS<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:22.990> these<00:01:23.140> four<00:01:23.530> jst

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
you'll connect the ESS to these four jst

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.010 
you'll connect the ESS to these four jst
connectors<00:01:24.549> which<00:01:25.149> actually<00:01:25.329> goes<00:01:25.689> to<00:01:25.930> the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
connectors which actually goes to the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.459 
connectors which actually goes to the
battery<00:01:26.380> okay<00:01:27.240> once<00:01:28.240> done<00:01:28.509> then<00:01:28.899> it's<00:01:29.200> very

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
battery okay once done then it's very

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.359 
battery okay once done then it's very
very<00:01:29.680> easy<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:30.159> connect<00:01:30.490> on<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:31.360> FY<00:01:31.780> 91<00:01:32.320> q<00:01:32.619> now

data<00:02:15.600> cable<00:02:15.930> from<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.920> GPS<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:17.640> campus<00:02:18.180> goes

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
data cable from the GPS on campus goes

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.420 
data cable from the GPS on campus goes
to<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.830> upper<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.460> here<00:02:21.360> okay<00:02:22.200> all<00:02:23.070> right<00:02:23.250> and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
to the upper one here okay all right and

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.640 
to the upper one here okay all right and
you<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.390> see<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.470> data<00:02:25.800> one<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.670> top

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
you can see it's the data one on top

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.080 
you can see it's the data one on top
uart<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:28.860> will<00:02:28.980> simply<00:02:29.310> leave<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.580> alone<00:02:29.670> then

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
uart we will simply leave it alone then

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.460 
uart we will simply leave it alone then
there<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.450> another<00:02:30.690> cable<00:02:30.960> which<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.440> a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
there is another cable which is a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.880 
there is another cable which is a

you install the caps on the motors to

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.410 
you install the caps on the motors to
tighten<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.620> propellers<00:03:32.100> okay<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.910> then<00:03:33.210> we

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
tighten the propellers okay and then we

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.920 
tighten the propellers okay and then we
will<00:03:33.600> test<00:03:33.900> by<00:03:34.620> powering<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:36.030> throttle<00:03:36.750> up
