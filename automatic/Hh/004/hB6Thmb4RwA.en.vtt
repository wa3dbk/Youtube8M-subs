with the decision of her push out to
begin<00:02:03.340> with<00:02:03.729> but<00:02:04.719> obviously<00:02:05.289> anything<00:02:05.740> would

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
begin with but obviously anything would

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
to go to rail position high left come

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.480 
to go to rail position high left come
across<00:03:37.920> for<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.370> six<00:03:38.820> which<00:03:43.100> we<00:03:44.100> have<00:03:44.220> seen

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
across for the six which we have seen

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.030 
across for the six which we have seen
all<00:03:44.790> parts<00:03:45.270> of<00:03:45.390> shoutings<00:03:45.960> game<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.320> powerful

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
all parts of shoutings game a powerful

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.560 
all parts of shoutings game a powerful
break<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.820> delicacy<00:03:48.300> of<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:51.090> recent

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
break and the delicacy of that recent

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.770 
break and the delicacy of that recent
shot<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:55.670> think<00:03:56.670> as<00:03:57.000> she<00:03:57.030> gets<00:03:57.420> more

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
shot I think as she gets more

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.900 
shot I think as she gets more
comfortable<00:03:58.440> over<00:03:58.710> here<00:03:58.890> even<00:03:59.280> in<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.670> last

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
comfortable over here even in the last

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.310 
comfortable over here even in the last
couple<00:04:00.270> of<00:04:00.390> years<00:04:00.630> we<00:04:00.810> have<00:04:00.840> seen<00:04:00.960> her

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
couple of years we have seen her

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.630 
couple of years we have seen her
certainly<00:04:01.740> become<00:04:02.070> that<00:04:02.280> with<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.180> language

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
certainly become that with the language

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.610 
certainly become that with the language
with<00:04:05.640> every<00:04:06.120> part<00:04:06.420> of<00:04:06.630> life<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:07.110> tour<00:04:07.380> not
