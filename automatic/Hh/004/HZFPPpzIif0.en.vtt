drop<00:01:37.369> to<00:01:38.369> oldest

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.200 

bubbles<00:01:43.820> is<00:01:44.000> like<00:01:44.360> it

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:57.260 

the<00:01:47.270> site

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.170 

try<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.900> get

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.460 

all

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.220 

now<00:02:08.890> what's<00:02:09.190> interesting<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.910> looking<00:02:10.540> at

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
now what's interesting that looking at

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.660 
now what's interesting that looking at
came<00:02:12.500> out<00:02:12.800> with<00:02:12.980> us

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.010 

so<00:02:15.790> there's<00:02:16.210> all<00:02:16.360> types

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:31.090 

hardness

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.960 

should<00:02:31.460> be<00:02:31.610> overweight

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.170 

by<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.600> nets

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:55.260 

I'll<00:02:46.990> say<00:02:47.170> this<00:02:47.349> for<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.740> GRE

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.030 

now<00:02:55.630> they<00:02:55.780> get<00:02:55.930> read<00:02:56.140> once<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.530> week<00:02:56.710> so<00:02:56.920> would

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
now they get read once a week so would

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.560 
now they get read once a week so would
you<00:02:57.160> moderate<00:02:57.580> their<00:02:57.760> food<00:02:57.940> if<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.240> fines

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
you moderate their food if you fines

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.550 
you moderate their food if you fines
they're<00:02:58.870> going<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.410> little<00:02:59.890> bit<00:03:00.040> yeah

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.190 

now

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.050 

10<00:03:08.770> pounds<00:03:09.099> 20<00:03:09.370> pounds<00:03:09.400> or<00:03:09.700> if<00:03:09.819> we<00:03:09.880> see<00:03:10.030> a

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
10 pounds 20 pounds or if we see a

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.230 
10 pounds 20 pounds or if we see a
trends<00:03:10.569> that

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
trends that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.470 
trends that
and<00:03:12.840> we<00:03:13.020> would<00:03:13.140> be<00:03:13.290> concerned<00:03:13.710> but<00:03:14.010> every

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
and we would be concerned but every

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.210 
and we would be concerned but every
weight<00:03:15.480> adjustment<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:16.080> we<00:03:16.200> made<00:03:16.380> have<00:03:17.070> to

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
weight adjustment that we made have to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.930 
weight adjustment that we made have to
go<00:03:17.340> through

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.440 

and

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.660 

so<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:29.990> thought<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.410> suctions

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
so I thought the suctions

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.740 
so I thought the suctions
well<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.760> know<00:03:32.849> if<00:03:33.000> they<00:03:33.209> actually<00:03:33.330> tries<00:03:33.750> to

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.180 

your<00:03:37.170> cameras<00:03:37.500> are<00:03:37.650> all<00:03:37.740> around<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.010> park

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
your cameras are all around the park

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.160 
your cameras are all around the park
right<00:03:38.400> now<00:03:38.550> is<00:03:39.390> also<00:03:39.540> why<00:03:39.870> they're<00:03:40.020> not

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
right now is also why they're not

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.790 
right now is also why they're not
working

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
working

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.930 
working
Fred<00:03:42.230> said<00:03:43.230> um<00:03:43.470> gathered<00:03:44.220> they're<00:03:44.580> trying<00:03:44.790> on

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
Fred said um gathered they're trying on

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.650

blue as those photos are very mushy

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.960 
blue as those photos are very mushy
which<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.770> kind<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.070> what<00:03:50.400> we<00:03:50.520> found<00:03:50.730> even

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
which is kind of what we found even

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.290 
which is kind of what we found even
moving<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.540> back<00:03:51.890> let's<00:03:52.890> take<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.070> step<00:03:53.250> back

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.879 

a<00:04:20.970> lot<00:04:21.420> of<00:04:21.450> people<00:04:21.690> ask<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:22.230> see

actually<00:05:15.790> I<00:05:16.120> don't<00:05:16.270> think<00:05:16.420> this<00:05:16.630> hasn't

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
actually I don't think this hasn't

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.600 
actually I don't think this hasn't
really<00:05:17.050> been<00:05:17.320> done<00:05:17.500> with<00:05:17.770> accelerates<00:05:18.250> but

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
really been done with accelerates but

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.040 
really been done with accelerates but
they<00:05:18.700> are<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.210> largest<00:05:19.540> number<00:05:19.780> that<00:05:19.930> also

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
they are the largest number that also

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.510 
they are the largest number that also

the<00:05:21.970> Dolphins<00:05:22.360> they<00:05:22.900> believe<00:05:23.259> that<00:05:23.530> in<00:05:24.490> their

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
the Dolphins they believe that in their

the Dolphins they believe that in their
brain<00:05:24.940> there's<00:05:25.210> to<00:05:25.449> them<00:05:25.569> especially<00:05:25.690> ours

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
brain there's to them especially ours

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.839 
brain there's to them especially ours
they'll<00:05:27.220> actually<00:05:27.430> rest

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
they'll actually rest

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.869 
they'll actually rest
while<00:05:29.449> the<00:05:29.569> other<00:05:30.159> remains<00:05:31.159> somewhat<00:05:31.580> alert

while the other remains somewhat alert

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.530 
while the other remains somewhat alert
so<00:05:32.599> it's

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540
