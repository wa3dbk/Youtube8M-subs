be<00:00:40.129> following<00:00:40.489> people<00:00:41.149> of<00:00:41.390> a<00:00:41.690> certain<00:00:41.989> quality

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
be following people of a certain quality

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.989

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999 
and of course there's going to be a

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:46.149 
and of course there's going to be a
mixture<00:00:44.359> in<00:00:44.510> there<00:00:44.899> of<00:00:45.199> their<00:00:45.530> own<00:00:45.649> personal

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
mixture in there of their own personal

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.669 
mixture in there of their own personal
interests<00:00:46.879> their<00:00:47.390> own<00:00:47.539> personal<00:00:48.050> friends<00:00:48.559> and

interests their own personal friends and

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:50.889 
interests their own personal friends and
probably<00:00:49.670> things<00:00:49.909> on<00:00:50.059> a<00:00:50.089> business<00:00:50.480> level<00:00:50.510> as

probably things on a business level as
well<00:00:51.109> but<00:00:51.679> I<00:00:51.710> always<00:00:52.100> see<00:00:52.339> that<00:00:52.370> as<00:00:52.819> sort<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.569> a

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659
