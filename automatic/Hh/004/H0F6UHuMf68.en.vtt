when<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> read<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.490> thread<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.119> reddit<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.540> was

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
when I read that thread on reddit I was

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.149 
when I read that thread on reddit I was
like<00:01:39.780> that's<00:01:39.990> retarded<00:01:40.470> who<00:01:40.799> would<00:01:40.920> fall<00:01:41.100> for

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
like that's retarded who would fall for

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.819 
like that's retarded who would fall for
that<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.700> then<00:01:41.939> people<00:01:42.899> were<00:01:43.110> confirming<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that and then people were confirming it

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.910 
that and then people were confirming it
so<00:01:44.189> i<00:01:44.490> figured<00:01:44.759> i'd<00:01:44.880> make<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> video<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.920> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
so i figured i'd make a video of it you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.609 
so i figured i'd make a video of it you
