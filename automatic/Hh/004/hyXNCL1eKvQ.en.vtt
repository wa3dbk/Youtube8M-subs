going<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.690> prepare<00:00:09.990> peas<00:00:10.530> for<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.519> spring<00:00:11.849> I

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
going to prepare peas for the spring I

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.780 
going to prepare peas for the spring I
have<00:00:12.690> put<00:00:12.990> them<00:00:13.139> inside<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:14.099> plastic<00:00:14.759> tube

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
have put them inside this plastic tube

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.330 
have put them inside this plastic tube
so<00:00:15.360> they<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.839> grow<00:00:16.049> well<00:00:16.260> during<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.859> winter

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
so they can grow well during the winter

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.080 
so they can grow well during the winter
they<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.500> they<00:00:19.500> are<00:00:19.740> already<00:00:20.070> outgrowing<00:00:20.789> it

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
they have they are already outgrowing it

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.830 
they have they are already outgrowing it
so<00:00:21.359> we're<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.560> prepare<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.039> peas<00:00:23.840> so

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
so we're going to prepare the peas so

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.470 
so we're going to prepare the peas so
they<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.289> grow<00:00:25.830> well<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.640> they<00:00:27.029> start<00:00:27.330> to

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
they can grow well and they start to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.040 
they can grow well and they start to
entangle<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.529> mesh<00:00:29.060> also<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.660> hallway

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
entangle on the mesh also in the hallway

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.100 
entangle on the mesh also in the hallway
near<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> middle<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.679> have<00:00:32.009> planted<00:00:33.110> scarlet

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
near the middle I have planted scarlet

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.220 
near the middle I have planted scarlet

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.350 
prepare the peas these are the scarlet
club<00:00:48.180> radish<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.930> picked<00:00:49.850> as<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.180> see

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
club radish I have picked as you can see

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.310 
club radish I have picked as you can see
these<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:52.079> pretty<00:00:52.440> big<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.750> am<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.110> use

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
these are pretty big I am going to use

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.380 
these are pretty big I am going to use
these<00:00:55.500> iron<00:00:55.920> bars<00:00:57.109> to<00:00:58.399> place<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.640> net<00:00:59.910> around

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
these iron bars to place a net around

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.280 
these iron bars to place a net around
them<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:01.500> are<00:01:01.620> some<00:01:01.879> nets<00:01:02.879> sold<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.140> stores

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
them there are some nets sold in stores

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.460 
them there are some nets sold in stores
that<00:01:04.860> are<00:01:05.339> green<00:01:06.030> they<00:01:06.600> are<00:01:06.720> very<00:01:06.930> interesting

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that are green they are very interesting

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.420 
that are green they are very interesting
but<00:01:07.970> actually<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.299> very<00:01:09.450> difficult<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.430> put

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
but actually it's very difficult to put

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.030 
but actually it's very difficult to put
them<00:01:11.580> right<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.060> I'd<00:01:12.180> rather<00:01:12.360> use<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.810> mesh<00:01:13.040> so

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
them right so I'd rather use a mesh so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.370 
them right so I'd rather use a mesh so
four<00:01:14.549> bars<00:01:14.930> on<00:01:15.930> each<00:01:16.049> side<00:01:17.750> for<00:01:18.750> support<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
four bars on each side for support and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.859 
four bars on each side for support and
for<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> peas<00:01:20.460> I'm<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> use<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.299> mesh

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
for the peas I'm going to use this mesh

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.490 
for the peas I'm going to use this mesh
it's<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.680> construction<00:01:23.070> mess<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.240> about<00:01:24.570> 1

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it's a construction mess it's about 1

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.730 
it's a construction mess it's about 1
meter<00:01:25.979> high<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.900> I'm<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.170> place<00:01:28.470> it

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
meter high and I'm going to place it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.160 
meter high and I'm going to place it
around<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.159> bars

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
around the bars

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.530 
around the bars
so<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.890> peas<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.579> grow<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:35.130> very<00:01:36.119> simply

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
so the peas can grow so very simply

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.460 
so the peas can grow so very simply
we're<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.290> alternate<00:01:38.630> one<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
we're going to alternate one with the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:55.400 
we're going to alternate one with the
other

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.090 

once<00:01:56.410> we<00:01:56.980> have<00:01:57.160> all<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.750> row<00:01:58.930> in<00:01:59.170> place<00:01:59.440> we

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
once we have all the row in place we

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.140 
once we have all the row in place we
bring<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.670> down<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:02.370> it's<00:02:03.370> going<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.610> be<00:02:03.790> about

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
bring it down and it's going to be about

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.560 
bring it down and it's going to be about
10<00:02:04.570> centimeters<00:02:05.410> or<00:02:05.590> 4<00:02:05.800> inches<00:02:06.460> from<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.300> soil

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
10 centimeters or 4 inches from the soil

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.919 
10 centimeters or 4 inches from the soil
doesn't<00:02:08.050> need<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.350> touch<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.590> soil<00:02:09.720> then<00:02:10.720> to

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
doesn't need to touch the soil then to

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.770 
doesn't need to touch the soil then to
keep<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.470> place<00:02:11.770> so<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.520> doesn't<00:02:12.550> move<00:02:13.000> we

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
keep it in place so it doesn't move we

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.850 
keep it in place so it doesn't move we
can<00:02:13.930> use<00:02:14.080> maybe<00:02:14.350> some<00:02:14.830> cord<00:02:15.820> but<00:02:16.540> we<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.680> use

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
can use maybe some cord but we can use

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.920 
can use maybe some cord but we can use
plastic<00:02:18.340> clamps<00:02:18.700> also<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.060> would<00:02:19.480> rather<00:02:19.630> use

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
plastic clamps also I would rather use

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.410 
plastic clamps also I would rather use
adjustable<00:02:20.590> plastic<00:02:21.430> clamps<00:02:21.790> because<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.330> is

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
adjustable plastic clamps because it is

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.290 
adjustable plastic clamps because it is
also<00:02:22.570> a<00:02:22.720> way<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.930> tighten<00:02:23.380> more<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.790> mesh<00:02:25.030> you

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
also a way to tighten more the mesh you

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.960 
also a way to tighten more the mesh you
can<00:02:25.690> decide<00:02:26.560> for<00:02:26.590> yourself<00:02:26.830> let's<00:02:27.760> put<00:02:27.880> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
can decide for yourself let's put the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.810 
can decide for yourself let's put the
clamp<00:02:28.209> in<00:02:28.510> here<00:02:28.840> let's<00:02:29.740> pull<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> bit<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:33.520> now

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
clamp in here let's pull a bit and now

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.610 
clamp in here let's pull a bit and now
it<00:02:34.240> will<00:02:34.450> move<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.709> I'm<00:02:37.020> putting<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.110> clamps

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
it will move so I'm putting the clamps

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.580 
it will move so I'm putting the clamps
on<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.970> mesh<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.270> around<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.230> VARs

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
on the mesh and around the VARs

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:52.949 
on the mesh and around the VARs
I<00:02:43.020> want<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.350> tight<00:02:50.520> that's<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.700> now<00:02:52.570> it's

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
I want it to be tight that's it now it's

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.070 
I want it to be tight that's it now it's
tight<00:02:53.320> it's<00:02:53.620> perfect<00:02:54.100> on<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:55.480> other<00:02:55.600> side<00:02:55.840> we

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
tight it's perfect on the other side we
