00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
often as you can see the HUD is

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.010 
often as you can see the HUD is
transparent<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.340> hard<00:02:11.640> side<00:02:11.910> boom<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.600> prefer

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
transparent a hard side boom I prefer

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.720 
transparent a hard side boom I prefer
that<00:02:13.200> way<00:02:13.440> much<00:02:13.680> easier<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:14.040> see<00:02:14.280> them<00:02:14.430> red

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
that way much easier to see them red

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.150 
that way much easier to see them red
somehow<00:02:15.360> for<00:02:15.600> me<00:02:15.720> I'm<00:02:15.959> not<00:02:15.989> exactly<00:02:16.440> sure<00:02:16.650> as
