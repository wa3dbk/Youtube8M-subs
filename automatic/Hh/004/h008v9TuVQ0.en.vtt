00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
cold air intake into the system I've got

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.120 
cold air intake into the system I've got
the<00:01:25.860> air<00:01:26.430> flow<00:01:26.700> meter<00:01:26.880> or<00:01:27.150> whatever<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.630> is

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
the air flow meter or whatever this is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
the air flow meter or whatever this is
plugged<00:01:29.130> into<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.670> I've<00:01:30.030> got<00:01:30.270> your<00:01:30.509> PCV<00:01:31.020> valve

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
plugged into it I've got your PCV valve

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.800 
plugged into it I've got your PCV valve
air<00:01:31.619> PCV<00:01:32.630> plugged<00:01:33.630> into<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.560> well<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:36.329> cold

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
air PCV plugged into it as well the cold

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.770 
air PCV plugged into it as well the cold
air<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> sealed<00:01:38.220> cold<00:01:38.610> air<00:01:38.790> which<00:01:39.390> I've

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
air is not a sealed cold air which I've

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.350 
air is not a sealed cold air which I've
heard<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> good<00:01:40.500> thing<00:01:40.770> because<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:42.180> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
heard is a good thing because when you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.649 
heard is a good thing because when you
seal<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.259> off<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.770> make<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.180> take<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.450> bunch

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
seal it off and make it take in a bunch

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.679 
seal it off and make it take in a bunch
of<00:01:45.780> air<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.829> actually<00:01:47.040> will<00:01:47.430> consume<00:01:47.820> more

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
of air it actually will consume more

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.160 
of air it actually will consume more
fuel<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
fuel because it's like going on the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.660 
fuel because it's like going on the
freeway<00:01:52.380> 75<00:01:53.009> miles<00:01:53.220> an<00:01:53.369> hour

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
freeway 75 miles an hour

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.370 
freeway 75 miles an hour
sticking<00:01:54.630> your<00:01:54.659> head<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.110> window<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
sticking your head out the window and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.100 
sticking your head out the window and
trying<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> breathe<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:57.509> kind<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
trying to breathe you kind of have it

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.139 
trying to breathe you kind of have it
okay<00:01:58.799> then<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.130> can't<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.670> breathe<00:01:59.909> too

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
okay then you can't really breathe too

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.920 
okay then you can't really breathe too
well<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:01.170> kind<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> same<00:02:01.799> concept

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
well and that's kind of the same concept

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.740 
well and that's kind of the same concept
when<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.960> put<00:02:04.530> those<00:02:04.680> big<00:02:05.040> ones<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.460> there

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
when you put those big ones in there

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.190 
when you put those big ones in there
that<00:02:06.750> seal<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.200> off<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.950> kind<00:02:08.520> of

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
that seal it off it kind of

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.119 
that seal it off it kind of
doesn't<00:02:09.979> work<00:02:10.069> too<00:02:10.310> well<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:11.860> I've<00:02:12.860> never<00:02:13.040> had

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
doesn't work too well so I've never had

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.890 
doesn't work too well so I've never had
