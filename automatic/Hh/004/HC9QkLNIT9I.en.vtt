00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:08.220
 the ancient classic of cooking 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.350
 contemporary and adding food 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.500
 peculiar flavor and aromas 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.600
 the fruit of the olive tree and the olive tree 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.060
 feeding man by providing greater 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.339
 longevity may become 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.929
 in the southern half of the state a new source 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.199
 income family of farmers 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:27.179
 settled by the trust 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.769
 this qualification that they are 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.419
 receiving here today, right? 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.970
 together with some families here 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.740
 present when these technicians are 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.660
 farmers to return to their home 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.460
 for their production unit and listed 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.020
 replicating this knowledge is that the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.960
 people can see here today then the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.850
 main objective is to strengthen nor 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.800
 already existing organizations so that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.780
 can also work with this 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.290
 this alternative is the cultivation of 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.140
 olive regions of cold regions 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.150
 she adapts much better with 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.700
 this intention is that in the last week 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.310
 embrapa temperate received the day of 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.240
 field olive harvest and extraction of 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.249
 olive oil 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.679
 the activity brought together farmers and 

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:10.740
 technicians from three operational 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:12.479
 emater and cooptec to know what there is 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.909
 novelty about this culture that 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.909
 begins to gain market in the country 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.490
 to sérgio alves head of p &amp; d activity 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.229
 reinforces the work it started in 2005 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.780
 pilots of pilots 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.700
 it is extremely important the right 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.069
 embrapa's work opens its doors 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.850
 so that farmers can come 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.649
 your experience bring your doubts 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.600
 to promote articulation and dialogue 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.639
 between the researcher and the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.359
 you can use the results 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:41.359
 of this research 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.630
 I will neither scherer farmer sitting on the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.180
 Southern crossroads of county and 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.220
 milestones were some of the 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.780
 of the participants interested in 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.060
 find out what this little fruit 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.070
 peculiarity can bring benefit to 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.700
 families seated on the Grand River of 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.430
 south 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.229
 it would be another alternative for us to 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.350
 diversification of the 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.690
 culture we have some information 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.569
 which are a culture that fits well 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.760
 region and that could be an alternative 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.380
 of income for families 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.230
 so that's why we're here 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.170
 looking to use demonstrative to see which 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.470
 the result what is the economic potential 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.870
 what is the difficulty of producing this 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.739
 culture that we know they 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.840
 adapt in the region in the climate we have 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.970
 to encourage these alternatives and more 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.310
 an income on the property né 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.680
 oliver producers who have an interest are 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.730
 one always encouraging new 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.950
 technologies 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.730
 knowing that other regions of the world are 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.680
 much less amenable to the production and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.850
 climate here has with us condition 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.860
 in Brazil to play olive serve the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.630
 trusts in partnership with the teams and even 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.160
 not to implement five units 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.709
 five settlements 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.579
 distinct from the southern half of the 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.310
 the cultivars chosen were arboreal 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.290
 harbor santana and connect plants with 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.930
 better adaptation in the region 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.570
 Brazil is the seventh largest importer 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.560
 of olive oil and the second of 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.450
 olives 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.700
 this shows that the country does not plant 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.380
 olive trees for the embrapa researcher 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.810
 temperate climate and nilton and philippe 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.940
 Coutinho three cultivars that will be 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.579
 established in the settlements have 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.650
 easy adaptation to the climate and 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.840
 Brazilian consumer taste 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.450
 the variety has shown a good 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.650
 adaptability in different regions of the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.519
 rio grande do sul paraná and santa 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.280
 Catherine 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.200
 this way we will test the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.940
 settlements and this production validation 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.430
 oil has to be fine beaded this 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.230
 what are the main requirements 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.720
 consumer has today regarding olive oil 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.670
 olive oil and is not initially intended to be 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.290
 an extra virgin olive oil that the new 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.030
 given name for olive oil 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.440
 according to the new standards 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.110
 the technique of production and commercialization 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.860
 of olive oil in brazil is this depends a lot 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.569
 of the producer to already because it produces 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.400
 your olive oil the quality it produces 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.069
 and with regard to the consumer 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.140
 our Brazilian consumer, he has to 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.290
 a more balanced olive oil not so 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.400
 bitter and not so much 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.169
 spicy then it has to be an agent 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.970
 balanced and that these three varieties 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.709
 produce this type of olive oil 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.600
 In the afternoon the group went to the station 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.880
 experimental cascade 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.340
 there they knew the techniques of the process of 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.250
 olive oil extraction your 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.470
 storage and manufacturing 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.390
 federal university of pelotas and that 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.910
 is part of the olive tree project 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.520
 explains from the beginning of the process 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.440
 today at embrapa we have two 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.690
 machines imported from italy with 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.700
 capacity for extraction of 130 kilos 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.800
 of fruit per hour 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.100
 are two equipments where the first 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.560
 performs the function of spreading and washing 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.970
 fruits and direct them to the process of 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.790
 extraction in the second equipment we 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.310
 we have the extraction itself 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.680
 begins with the grinding process of the 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.110
 fruit through a knife mill and 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.240
 hammers by turning these products into 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.180
 a homogeneous pulp that should be 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.000
 beat for 45 minutes at a time then 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.580
 this complete mass referred to a 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.640
 separator which separates two phases 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.390
 olive oil and the solid part then 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.520
 to the final product of olive oil. 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.770
 the intention of the trust that until the middle of the 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.020
 year the second stage of the 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.390
 activity where technical 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.100
 of pruning management and subjects 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.410
 complementary information on the 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.840
 olive groves all the settlements of 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.280
 agrarian reform is allowed to have in a 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.020
 Olive farming, right? 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.030
 and it may become part of the 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.120
 redesign of these agroecosystems 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.690
 dialogue with environmental issues is 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.729
 bringing more income, especially one with 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.780
 manpower is there within the 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.780
 agrarian reform settlements 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.500
 ah
