00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.670
 hi guys once again here jaciel 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.959
 I call your therapist and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.270
 iscte online 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.350
 today I'm going to teach you how to send 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.970
 a new manual 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.850
 Some people asked me to do this. 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.890
 In this maneuver I was thinking more 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.020
 because they teach in the manual its already taught 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.970
 the manual that class 12 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.449
 if you did not see that you can click 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.969
 here in this video and check them out 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.489
 techniques you use in the manual 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.379
 you can use the manual mode on the new 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.329
 will fall forward is not like the fall 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.769
 Way you're going to fall forward, you're going 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.769
 having to have strength in the arm 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.260
 the first exercise for you to command 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.720
 the new manual you work this 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.560
 balance and look for a bar 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.880
 support for you to start weighing your 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.700
 feel the balance 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.880
 place the full front foot or the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.080
 the last screws near the new ne 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.570
 then you will do just go 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.570
 forrÃ³ starts with both hands 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.560
 One hour from there. 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.700
 this activity will help you a little 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:48.160
 working fine motor skills right 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.870
 the only mistake you have in the new manual 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.840
 really 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.800
 It's the new one hit the ground and you fall out of it. 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.720
 face 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.730
 some people can run away 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.070
 walking they have a certain balance 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.440
 hit us on the ground it went wrong I play 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.720
 on the floor at the pole with his hands 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.520
 if I make a roll and then I'll go 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.160
 lead is your trunk will be generated 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.320
 for here the arm a little forward can 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.910
 semi-open even mentioning or so 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.800
 It might be the way you find it. 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.660
 calm and that in the body behind a 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.840
 put your hands like this to do the 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.100
 balance and let us that I was not 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.100
 I know how this works. 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:28.120
