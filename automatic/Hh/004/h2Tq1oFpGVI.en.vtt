00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.079
 all right 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.370
 welcome to online drawing today we're going 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.190
 to draw this perspective is about 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.950
 a top view or plan view in 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.520
 Drawing also called bird's eye view 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.110
 You can watch the scene from above 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.810
 this perspective is not a very sight 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.970
 used when amateur it is but 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.440
 although we do not realize it is used with 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.480
 often in the cinema to give a 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.000
 print different from the one shown on 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.980
 camera commonly this view us 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.440
 provides a global understanding of 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.360
 what happens on the scene although many 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.910
 Sometimes it is also used for its effect 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.160
 dramatic as in these examples of the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.770
 cartoon or just like a 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.660
 interesting variant in narrative but 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.829
 whatever the use, it is a 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.989
 essential exercise for us 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.640
 to understand some important points 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.489
 about this drawing we will explain in 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.769
 simple we draw a rectangle and join 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.870
 with diagonals its four corners and 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.269
 then on these diagonals we draw a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.799
 smaller rectangle we lined the cross 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.770
 that is in the smallest rectangle and 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.720
 ready to indicate this space we can 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.030
 make some figures seen from 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.520
 up and to make it even more obvious 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.310
 we make a shadow and a mosaic in the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.020
 floor it is important to mention that no 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.149
 you have to draw the vanishing point in 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.460
 the center of the rectangle 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.590
 for example in this rectangle we locate 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.049
 the vanishing point very down and in this 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.940
 another very high and left always 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.920
 you will notice that the far wall the point of 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.159
 leak will look wider and the nearest 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.869
 At the vanishing point , the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.399
 classic error that you should avoid is 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.700
 draw the inner rectangle very 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.720
 small because that would mean a space 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.350
 very small 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.840
 or extremely high walls like 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.190
 that rare room has to draw 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.430
 a room you have to consider 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.370
 some walls more or less like these very 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.140
 small ones you will also notice that 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.330
 objects far away from the vanishing point 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.120
 they seem to be taller and the objects more 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.300
 near the vanishing point more short 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.710
 so to speak 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.300
 1 let's start with our drawing 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.730
 we draw a rectangle and then we mark 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.680
 the vanishing point even though it can 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.050
 seem like something difficult to do for 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.070
 achieve this view we use a single point 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.870
 of flight 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.760
 This will be called false fire point 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.850
 because the horizon is not at some point 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.420
 in particular we do not place it at the center 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.570
 then we draw rays from it 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.160
 towards all the ends of the rectangle 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.000
 then we join the corners with the point 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.860
 of flight 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.200
 here in black and we draw a rectangle 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.390
 small inside the big one and after 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.500
 delete the inner lines we already have 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.530
 the basic space 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.770
 2 we start by drawing the objects 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.390
 basic in every room without 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.850
 perspective this will be the bed 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.709
 to the right and to the left we draw a 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.410
 couple of small buildings 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.440
 this will be a desk and this will be a 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.290
 musical keyboard we can start to give 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.819
 volume to the objects that we carry 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.319
 starting from the corners of each object 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.390
 and using the blue lines as 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.970
 reference we give height to the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.860
 furniture and the desk on the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.110
 desk we draw a computer and 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.840
 then we do a high part to 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.910
 desk on this side of the room 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.300
 we draw a large piece of furniture to store 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.480
 clothing blankets and so behave 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.450
 sliding this from here will be a bookseller 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.400
 and this a door in this corner 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.650
 we make a couple of shelves with two 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.970
 simple rectangles and here we draw a 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.610
 window 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.840
 these little squares and circles 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.840
 they will indicate chairs and a small dumpster and 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.410
 these rectangles will indicate posters and 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.780
 pictures on the wall in the furniture we make 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.240
 doors and here we will add a hallway that 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.880
 it did not exist in our original plan 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.890
 but here we do this volume can 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.620
 serve to indicate a piece of furniture in the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.160
 wall here next to the bed we can 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.410
 indicate with these lines a closet here 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.090
 in the corner we make a small table and 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.670
 in this way we end with the general 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.209
 if you look at it carefully you already understand 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.400
 the room still without detailing 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.959
 we started to draw figures inside the 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.840
 room with the method that we have 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.220
 already explained many times the one that is 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.340
 on the bed does not present major 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.259
 difficulty because you have no course but 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.539
 these other three figures will be more 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.340
 complicated to do us the 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.250
 we solve here with simple volumes 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.110
 superimposed but will require 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.630
 tutorials apart for your understanding 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.220
 Once the figures are finished 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.190
 we started to draw more volumes 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.470
 small is to say details about what 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.800
 general that we already draw try to 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.780
 follow this order and so we indicate books 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.789
 curtains and objects of all kinds 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.060
 We give depth to the chairs of the 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:02.000
 bed and we now draw a stave in the 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.610
 floor line by line as the lines 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.500
 of a school notebook and only remains 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.320
 erase the lines that can have us 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.169
 some confusion likewise we begin to 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.690
 draw very small lines like edges 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.889
 of furniture the keys of the piano and 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:21.069
 small objects here and there 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.469
 3 at this moment we already have the idea 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:26.439
 general drawing only remains to trace 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:29.919
 to detail in this case we do it to 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:32.710
 hand with all patience tracing with a 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.200
 rule we get this stroke after a 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.320
 little while 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.360
 We hope this class is useful for you 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.270
 practice your own perspectives and look 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.310

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.170
 in the description to see the others 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.480
 five cases of perspective that we have 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.180
