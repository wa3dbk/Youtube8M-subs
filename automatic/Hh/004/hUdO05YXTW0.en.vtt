00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
okay this is the 93 Volvo 240 classic of

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.700 
okay this is the 93 Volvo 240 classic of
my<00:00:10.440> brothers<00:00:10.940> he<00:00:11.940> brought<00:00:12.180> it<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.360> me<00:00:12.710> because

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
my brothers he brought it to me because

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.360 
my brothers he brought it to me because
it's

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
it's

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.269 
it's
few<00:00:14.490> problems<00:00:14.970> that<00:00:15.619> we<00:00:16.619> need<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.860> take<00:00:17.039> care

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
few problems that we need to take care

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.980 
few problems that we need to take care
of<00:00:17.340> he's<00:00:18.180> got<00:00:18.360> a<00:00:18.390> leaky<00:00:18.689> exhaust<00:00:19.970> and<00:00:20.990> that

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
of he's got a leaky exhaust and that

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.200 
of he's got a leaky exhaust and that
seems<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.380> be<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> crack<00:00:22.740> pipe<00:00:23.040> at<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.340> entrance

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
seems to be a crack pipe at the entrance

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.320 
seems to be a crack pipe at the entrance
of<00:00:24.450> the<00:00:24.840> resonator<00:00:25.849> and<00:00:26.849> he's<00:00:26.939> got<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> check

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
of the resonator and he's got a check

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.240 
of the resonator and he's got a check
engine<00:00:27.480> light<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.290> intermittent<00:00:28.860> stalling

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
engine light and a intermittent stalling

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.639 
engine light and a intermittent stalling
problem<00:00:29.430> which<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.450> believe<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.349> due<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:31.649 
problem which I believe is due to the

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.180 
problem which I believe is due to the
injector<00:00:32.040> codes<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.970> pulls<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:34.190> he

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
injector codes that it it pulls and he

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.389 
injector codes that it it pulls and he
also<00:00:35.430> has<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.420> very<00:00:36.720> loud<00:00:37.110> rapping<00:00:37.680> noise<00:00:37.860> when

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
also has a very loud rapping noise when

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.979 
also has a very loud rapping noise when
the<00:00:38.489> accelerates<00:00:39.000> hard<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.510> originally<00:00:39.870> we

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the accelerates hard and originally we

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.510 
the accelerates hard and originally we
thought<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.410> was<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> center<00:00:41.040> bearing<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
thought it was the center bearing of the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.910 
thought it was the center bearing of the
drive<00:00:41.820> shaft<00:00:41.850> hitting<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> floor<00:00:42.890> when<00:00:43.890> I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
drive shaft hitting the floor when I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.509 
drive shaft hitting the floor when I
looked<00:00:44.130> under<00:00:44.370> there<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.989> looks<00:00:45.989> nice<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
looked under there that looks nice and

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.689 
looked under there that looks nice and
fine<00:00:47.519> it's<00:00:47.789> cool<00:00:47.879> good<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.449> tight<00:00:49.370> but<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.429> did

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
fine it's cool good and tight but I did

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.299 
fine it's cool good and tight but I did
notice<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.269> u-joint<00:00:51.839> at<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.710> rear<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
notice the u-joint at the rear of the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.819 
notice the u-joint at the rear of the
transmission<00:00:54.120> sit<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> floor<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.589> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
transmission sit in the floor and the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.669 
transmission sit in the floor and the
motor<00:00:56.010> seems<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.399> be<00:00:56.489> cocked<00:00:56.730> over<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> did<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
motor seems to be cocked over so I did a

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.729 
motor seems to be cocked over so I did a
little<00:00:58.800> looking<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.460> seems<00:00:59.789> like<00:01:00.739> motor

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
little looking and it seems like motor

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.530 
little looking and it seems like motor
mounts<00:01:02.039> busted<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:04.940> let's<00:01:05.940> take<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> camera

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
mounts busted so let's take the camera

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:18.590 
mounts busted so let's take the camera
down<00:01:06.690> in<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> fender<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:18.210> yes

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
down in this and the fender here and yes

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:27.530 
down in this and the fender here and yes
the<00:01:18.870> motor<00:01:19.020> mount<00:01:19.260> is<00:01:19.380> broken

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.020 

here's<00:01:28.540> where<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.870> driveshaft<00:01:29.110> is<00:01:29.710> uh<00:01:30.030> is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
here's where the driveshaft is uh is

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.550 
here's where the driveshaft is uh is
hitting<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.450> floor<00:01:31.600> here's<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.140> yoke<00:01:32.409> on

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
hitting the floor here's the yoke on

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.090 
hitting the floor here's the yoke on
their<00:01:32.770> rear<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.940> transmission<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.979> when<00:01:35.979> the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
their rear the transmission and when the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.740 
their rear the transmission and when the
accelerate<00:01:36.610> hard<00:01:36.790> I<00:01:36.940> guess<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.240> motor<00:01:37.450> gets

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
accelerate hard I guess the motor gets

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.649 
accelerate hard I guess the motor gets
kind<00:01:37.990> of<00:01:38.050> jacked<00:01:38.320> over<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:39.300> it<00:01:40.300> really<00:01:40.450> sounds

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
kind of jacked over and it really sounds

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.670 
kind of jacked over and it really sounds
terrible<00:01:42.300> so<00:01:43.300> once<00:01:43.810> we<00:01:43.960> get<00:01:44.080> that<00:01:44.140> motor<00:01:44.470> mouth

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
terrible so once we get that motor mouth

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.670 
terrible so once we get that motor mouth
fixed<00:01:45.040> up<00:01:45.190> I<00:01:45.310> think<00:01:45.369> we'll<00:01:45.640> be<00:01:45.759> okay

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
fixed up I think we'll be okay

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.550 
fixed up I think we'll be okay
we're<00:01:47.680> trans<00:01:48.040> mount<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:51.430> seems<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.880> have

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
we're trans mount really seems to have

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.380 
we're trans mount really seems to have
no<00:01:53.560> issues<00:01:54.009> I<00:01:54.420> pried<00:01:55.420> out<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.810> looks<00:01:56.200> fine<00:01:57.390> you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
no issues I pried out it looks fine you

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.340 
no issues I pried out it looks fine you
can<00:01:58.539> actually<00:01:58.750> see<00:02:00.690> you<00:02:01.690> can't<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:02.080> don't<00:02:02.229> know

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
can actually see you can't I don't know

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.170 
can actually see you can't I don't know
but<00:02:02.649> from<00:02:03.039> what<00:02:03.160> I'm<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.550> way<00:02:03.640> I'm<00:02:03.759> looking<00:02:03.940> at

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
but from what I'm the way I'm looking at

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.270 
but from what I'm the way I'm looking at
it<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.840> driveshaft<00:02:05.140> is<00:02:05.560> definitely<00:02:05.950> over<00:02:06.130> to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
it the driveshaft is definitely over to

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.370 
it the driveshaft is definitely over to
the<00:02:06.369> right<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.759> car<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.300> I<00:02:07.539> think<00:02:08.140> once

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
the right of the car so I think once

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.320 
the right of the car so I think once
that<00:02:08.470> motor<00:02:08.739> about<00:02:08.950> straightened<00:02:09.429> up<00:02:09.519> I<00:02:09.789> think

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
that motor about straightened up I think

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.800 
that motor about straightened up I think
the<00:02:10.600> whole<00:02:10.780> drivetrain<00:02:11.680> will<00:02:12.130> be

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the whole drivetrain will be

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:38.350 
the whole drivetrain will be
straightened<00:02:13.810> normal<00:02:14.140> again<00:02:18.239> crank<00:02:19.239> her<00:02:19.330> up

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.060 

there's<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.750> dry<00:02:38.960> Thursday<00:02:39.170> exhaust<00:02:39.800> leak

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
there's a dry Thursday exhaust leak

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.650 
there's a dry Thursday exhaust leak
right<00:02:40.280> there

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.240 

here's<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.840> used<00:02:47.019> fuel<00:02:47.349> rail<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.560> got<00:02:47.830> from<00:02:48.099> the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
here's the used fuel rail I got from the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.530 
here's the used fuel rail I got from the
PA<00:02:48.489> Auto<00:02:48.790> recyclers<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.980> eBay<00:02:51.400> got<00:02:52.269> a<00:02:52.300> pretty

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
PA Auto recyclers on eBay got a pretty

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.330 
PA Auto recyclers on eBay got a pretty
good<00:02:52.720> deal<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.050> I<00:02:53.200> think<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.500> paid<00:02:53.650> about<00:02:53.709> 60

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
good deal and I think I paid about 60

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.300 
good deal and I think I paid about 60
bucks<00:02:54.550> for<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:56.470> got<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:56.980> over<00:02:57.220> in

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
bucks for that and I got this over in

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.970 
bucks for that and I got this over in
Kitty<00:02:57.580> over<00:02:58.120> here<00:02:58.330> for<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.890> four<00:03:00.129> injectors

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
Kitty over here for the four injectors

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.550 
Kitty over here for the four injectors
so<00:03:02.980> I'll<00:03:03.790> do<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.239> all<00:03:04.420> REO<00:03:04.840> ring<00:03:05.140> these<00:03:05.290> and

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
so I'll do is all REO ring these and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.559 
so I'll do is all REO ring these and
I'll<00:03:05.680> just<00:03:06.340> install<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:06.879> whole<00:03:07.120> rail<00:03:07.360> and

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
I'll just install this whole rail and

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.170 
I'll just install this whole rail and
regulator<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.760> hopefully<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:09.879> will<00:03:10.000> take

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
regulator and hopefully that will take

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.320 
regulator and hopefully that will take
care<00:03:10.390> of<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.840> fuel<00:03:11.440> injector<00:03:11.799> fault

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
care of the fuel injector fault

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.150 
care of the fuel injector fault
I<00:03:13.360> owned<00:03:13.840> all<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.140> ones<00:03:14.290> out<00:03:14.440> on<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.769> engine

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
I owned all the ones out on the engine

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.990 
I owned all the ones out on the engine
and<00:03:15.579> they<00:03:16.150> all<00:03:17.040> seem<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.069> check<00:03:18.370> out<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.700> same

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
and they all seem to check out the same

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.770 
and they all seem to check out the same
but<00:03:19.329> I<00:03:19.480> think<00:03:19.780> one<00:03:19.930> of<00:03:19.959> them<00:03:20.140> gets<00:03:20.380> hot<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.780> and

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
but I think one of them gets hot and and

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.300 
but I think one of them gets hot and and
then<00:03:23.200> sets<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.590> code<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:25.180> instead<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.690> just

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
then sets the code so instead of just

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.289 
then sets the code so instead of just
playing<00:03:27.310> with<00:03:27.489> one<00:03:27.640> fuel<00:03:27.879> injector<00:03:28.239> and

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
playing with one fuel injector and

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.699 
playing with one fuel injector and
moving<00:03:28.569> her<00:03:28.660> around<00:03:28.690> they<00:03:29.110> just<00:03:29.319> figure<00:03:29.620> it

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
moving her around they just figure it

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.819 
moving her around they just figure it
would<00:03:29.860> be<00:03:29.920> easier<00:03:30.280> just<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.549> get<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.790> nice<00:03:31.000> rail

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
would be easier just to get a nice rail

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:38.069 
would be easier just to get a nice rail
the<00:03:32.829> injectors<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:34.890> install<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:37.079> take

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
the injectors and install that so take

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.780 
the injectors and install that so take
one<00:03:38.230> last<00:03:38.440> peek<00:03:38.680> under<00:03:38.980> this<00:03:39.129> car<00:03:39.370> before<00:03:39.579> I

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
one last peek under this car before I

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.309 
one last peek under this car before I
put<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.120> down<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.480> went<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.750> order<00:03:40.959> some<00:03:41.140> parts

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
put it down and went to order some parts

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.400 
put it down and went to order some parts
and<00:03:42.390> that's<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.599> motor<00:03:43.780> mount<00:03:44.019> on<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.230> other

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
and that's the motor mount on the other

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.830 
and that's the motor mount on the other
side<00:03:44.940> looks<00:03:45.940> pretty<00:03:46.180> broken<00:03:46.450> too<00:03:47.130> so<00:03:48.840> we'll

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
side looks pretty broken too so we'll

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.150 
side looks pretty broken too so we'll
get<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.079> a<00:03:50.109> set<00:03:50.350> of<00:03:50.470> motor<00:03:50.590> mounts<00:03:50.889> for<00:03:51.010> this

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
get you a set of motor mounts for this

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.680 
get you a set of motor mounts for this
car<00:03:51.400> or<00:03:51.519> us<00:03:51.700> oh<00:03:53.609> all<00:03:54.609> right<00:03:54.700> well<00:03:55.000> I'll<00:03:55.540> get

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
car or us oh all right well I'll get

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.300 
car or us oh all right well I'll get
some<00:03:55.870> parts<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:57.060> once<00:03:58.060> we<00:03:58.180> get<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.420> parts

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
some parts and once we get the parts

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.080 
some parts and once we get the parts
well<00:04:00.310> uh<00:04:00.609> make<00:04:01.510> another<00:04:01.750> video
