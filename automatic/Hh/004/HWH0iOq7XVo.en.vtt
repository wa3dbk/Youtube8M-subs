okay so start stop it bottom string open

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.590 
okay so start stop it bottom string open
twice<00:01:51.460> then<00:01:52.460> we<00:01:52.580> use<00:01:52.760> your<00:01:52.940> second<00:01:53.299> finger<00:01:53.420> on

the fifth fret bottom string and then

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.380 
the fifth fret bottom string and then
you<00:01:55.220> hammer<00:01:55.369> onto<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.759> seventh<00:01:56.060> fret<00:01:56.240> using

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
you hammer onto the seventh fret using

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.660 
you hammer onto the seventh fret using
your<00:01:56.600> pinky<00:01:58.509> third<00:01:59.509> fret<00:01:59.780> on<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.900> 5th<00:02:00.140> string

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.830 

before<00:02:46.129> spark<00:02:46.519> which<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:47.090> starts<00:02:47.420> off<00:02:47.569> a<00:02:47.659> bit

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
before spark which it starts off a bit

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.800 
before spark which it starts off a bit
like<00:02:48.019> staring<00:02:48.439> at<00:02:48.680> me

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.110 

so<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.730> basically<00:02:58.310> know<00:02:59.310> there's<00:02:59.550> people<00:02:59.790> from

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
so I basically know there's people from

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.570 
so I basically know there's people from
the<00:03:00.330> force<00:03:00.570> drinking<00:03:00.960> sake<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.400> bar

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
the force drinking sake of the the bar

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.120 
the force drinking sake of the the bar
here<00:03:02.850> on<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.450> fifth<00:03:04.260> fret<00:03:04.410> on<00:03:04.530> strings<00:03:04.950> one

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
here on the fifth fret on strings one

here on the fifth fret on strings one
two<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.430> three<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.970> then<00:03:06.030> seven<00:03:06.870> thrown<00:03:07.080> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
two and three and then seven thrown the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:19.400 
two and three and then seven thrown the
Fortran<00:03:07.770> picked<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.730> four<00:03:08.970> straight<00:03:18.410> down

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
Fortran picked the four straight down

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:34.290 
Fortran picked the four straight down
the<00:03:20.660> first<00:03:21.660> finger<00:03:21.900> on<00:03:26.300> the

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.230 

you've<00:03:35.140> gotta<00:03:35.320> be<00:03:35.440> heating<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:36.010> on/off<00:03:36.220> in<00:03:37.000> it

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
you've gotta be heating it on/off in it

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.040 
you've gotta be heating it on/off in it
almost<00:03:37.510> in<00:03:37.900> this<00:03:38.020> truck<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:43.540> then<00:03:43.660> we<00:03:43.720> just<00:03:43.840> do

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
almost in this truck and then we just do

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.650 
almost in this truck and then we just do
5th<00:03:44.650> fret<00:03:44.860> on<00:03:44.890> all<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.370> strings<00:03:45.670> well<00:03:45.940> 1<00:03:46.180> 2<00:03:46.360> 3<00:03:46.510> &amp;

saintil<00:03:49.210> picking<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:50.230> then<00:03:50.320> we<00:03:50.380> do<00:03:50.500> 4th<00:03:50.890> fret

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
saintil picking and then we do 4th fret

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.250 
saintil picking and then we do 4th fret
on<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.490> 4th<00:03:52.090> string<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:52.720> then<00:03:52.930> use<00:03:53.080> your

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
on the 4th string and then use your

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.179 
on the 4th string and then use your
second<00:03:53.590> finger<00:03:53.710> to<00:03:53.950> do<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.250> fifth<00:03:54.490> fret<00:03:54.760> bar

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.640 

and<00:04:00.189> do<00:04:00.340> a<00:04:00.370> c5<00:04:00.909> power<00:04:01.329> cord<00:04:01.599> and<00:04:01.930> it's<00:04:02.170> like<00:04:02.439> a

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
and do a c5 power cord and it's like a

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.800 
and do a c5 power cord and it's like a
slider<00:04:03.010> up<00:04:03.189> 55

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
slider up 55

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.070 
slider up 55
twice<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.069> then<00:04:07.400> we<00:04:07.430> can<00:04:07.610> form<00:04:08.240> a<00:04:08.390> deesis<00:04:08.870> to

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
twice and then we can form a deesis to

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.770 
twice and then we can form a deesis to
cord<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:10.040> first<00:04:10.340> finger<00:04:10.819> barring<00:04:11.450> five

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
cord the first finger barring five

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.380 
cord the first finger barring five
strings<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.500> then<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.190> leaves<00:04:13.430> your<00:04:13.819> third

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
strings and then you leaves your third

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.390 
strings and then you leaves your third
and<00:04:14.420> fourth<00:04:14.840> finger<00:04:15.200> on<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.350> power<00:04:15.709> me<00:04:15.860> we

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
and fourth finger on the power me we

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.890 
and fourth finger on the power me we
should<00:04:16.639> get<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.880> fifth<00:04:17.150> fret<00:04:17.359> on<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.510> second

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
should get the fifth fret on the second

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:31.730 
should get the fifth fret on the second
string<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.169> ring

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:42.280 

okay<00:04:32.940> that's<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.150> base<00:04:34.419> from<00:04:34.690> the

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.860 

and<00:04:42.770> asleep<00:04:43.040> on<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.190> c5

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.950 

and<00:04:48.320> then

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:08.390 

you<00:04:53.050> seem<00:04:53.289> up<00:04:53.500> again

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:52.640 

you<00:05:09.710> must<00:05:10.710> be<00:05:10.860> that<00:05:11.009> course<00:05:11.310> buggin

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.650 

then<00:05:53.650> obviously<00:05:53.860> he<00:05:54.070> doesn't<00:05:54.669> mentor<00:05:55.180> solo<00:05:55.540> in

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
then obviously he doesn't mentor solo in

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.720 
then obviously he doesn't mentor solo in
there<00:05:55.840> but<00:05:56.110> he<00:05:56.350> seems<00:05:56.919> to<00:05:56.980> improvise<00:05:57.370> it<00:05:57.550> every

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
there but he seems to improvise it every

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.879 
there but he seems to improvise it every
time<00:05:57.910> that<00:05:58.060> he<00:05:58.150> does<00:05:58.300> it<00:05:58.450> so<00:05:58.620> get<00:05:59.620> yourself<00:05:59.830> a

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
time that he does it so get yourself a

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.830 
time that he does it so get yourself a
deep<00:06:00.100> pentatonic<00:06:00.700> minor<00:06:00.730> scale<00:06:01.360> and<00:06:01.660> then

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
deep pentatonic minor scale and then

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:17.940 
deep pentatonic minor scale and then
where<00:06:02.139> you<00:06:02.260> going

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.310 

you<00:06:18.360> just<00:06:19.360> improvise<00:06:19.570> something<00:06:20.080> over<00:06:20.230> the

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
you just improvise something over the

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.630 
you just improvise something over the
top<00:06:20.350> of<00:06:20.500> that<00:06:20.590> anything<00:06:20.920> that<00:06:21.100> you<00:06:21.280> do<00:06:21.460> will

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
top of that anything that you do will

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.250 
top of that anything that you do will
