00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.440
 whether it's local multiplayer or 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.450
 online multiplayer I like a lot and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.740
 playing with friends and playing today is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.240
 enough about this I brought the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.000
 invited to talk to him about this 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.920
 game and today that the rbs plane tim liberty 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.990
 present place you come I am the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.619
 coffee universe langella with games is 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.910
 place of origin here has used it is 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.039
 that crazy group that people 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.349
 participate in facebook and I'm here to 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.329
 talking about this game was that you boyfriend 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.700
 presented I fell in love 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.890
 elkin gold cats and kim ghattas in one 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.559
 Multiplayer focused game loading 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.420
 the elements of several other places 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.850
 he drinks from several other sources he 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.920
 say a little of it so i crouch 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.829
 defined that it gagged with a mixture 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.100
 bizarre fun to face this 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.190
 strong terrarium is basically a game of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.320
 of teams is a multiplayer game 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.449
 cooperative in which you have a blue team 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.250
 red team and they have to build 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.189
 the works almost to defend the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.430
 structures evolve is the structure of this 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.439
 and fight against the enemy and the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.000
 instead of that iphan country structure 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.920
 where you find using units each 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.930
 player controls the unit have to do 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.340
 its your job to kind of convince 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.560
 then the constructor and has for sure 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.810
 your studies on making the deaths let's 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.580
 power to pick up the most powerful weapons 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.560
 the warriors without counting the archers 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.180
 stand on the stand and everyone has to 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.130
 work here for the same thing 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.890
 and this is one of the few games 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.659
 that the builders are type 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.250
 so that your team can reach the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.840
 victory I played a little and I release 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.159
 now afternoon and I think we 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.570
 lost because I'm a builder of 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.509
 shit because the other team of consultants 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.000
 very good and really have like you 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.740
 make traps cheat on enemies and 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.990
 if you make a wrong construction you 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.509
 can harm your entire team or 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.130
 can help a lot and the attacks that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.420
 come from opponents teams can destroy 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.520
 their constructions 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.219
 if the guy does not care to have 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.810
 put a structure is made of stone and 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.189
 sometimes it's easy to half way 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.049
 something like this you can see how 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.490
 it was an arrow of fire and it was already 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.469
 minister of the face but you make a 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.910
 structure that ensures only 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.830
 a column 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.190
 someone threw an entire cross bomb 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.470
 on top of all the players until 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.240
 she's very crazy and for me 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.210
 question of constructions one of things 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.000
 coolest is the game's own control 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.100
 Can you get out, for example, pick up with 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.230
 your warrior use the shield on top of the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.060
 head his shield planacon or put the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.160
 study of the character he uses 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.620
 as if it were a board and you 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.480
 allows a lot of things flown you 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.640
 being able to do with the controls can 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.780
 and fly with her until you can 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.400
 play teaching stuff has a website 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.440
 infinite number of things 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.690
 the controls not only with the builders 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.520
 but also with the keiko with a warrior who 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.170
 He left very interesting game as 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.420
 cool, I played this game 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.610
 by fulfilling a very old flock there is 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.730
 several months ago and I played 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.700
 recently is also and face the difference 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.830
 of what people are building are 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.540
 usually benefit from them 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.750
 resources know people 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.240
 began to discover new forms of 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.000
 build what are traps we go 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.520
 build safer and more expensive structures 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.160
 It's very cool, it's very weak. Long time. 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.870
 I played like this, so what's what? 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.220
 spend the goals that we could not 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.660
 to score a match and there were many 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.150
 different varieties on a very 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.310
 great play we investigate a lot 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.170
 the structures in protecting the flags 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.370
 have catholic by the flag had people 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.690
 who was shitting to defend the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.760
 ways simply went to the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.680
 attack and experience the match in less than 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.200
 10 seconds has so many ways 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.840
 different you can play sometimes 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.090
 It's a different team that we came in. 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.739
 know is very crazy guy starting 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.930
 really different team than the other one speak 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.220
 that he is from the same company that made the sun 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.880
 from the internet also from there 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.940
 presented in this channel and even in the mechanics 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.310
 very similar and discusses with the child 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.220
 We have to check out the trailers. 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.489
 Sometimes they have a very good language. 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.040
 the youtube channel is the first mall 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.360
 is that they find the first and the chicken fly and 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.830
 thousand of hacking martins simulator is this 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.900
 Then I 'll call the game trailer too. 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.060
 There's no way you can not buy this game. 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.830
 it's after star and it takes a while 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.490
 to engage their gameplay but it 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.620
 very worthwhile 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.720
 air combat simulator from 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.240
 measures 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.980
 exactly and that's it, you have to 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.980
 play king arthur road
