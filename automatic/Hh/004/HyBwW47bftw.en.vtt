00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.589 

today's<00:00:07.859> engines<00:00:08.400> do<00:00:08.639> have<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.940> tendency<00:00:09.240> to

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
today's engines do have a tendency to

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.320 
today's engines do have a tendency to
get<00:00:09.840> congested<00:00:10.080> with<00:00:10.650> deposits<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
get congested with deposits and the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.780 
get congested with deposits and the
source<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.809> those<00:00:12.960> deposits<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:14.040> actually<00:00:14.639> in

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
source of those deposits is actually in

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.420 
source of those deposits is actually in
the<00:00:14.910> fuel<00:00:15.179> not<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.660> engine<00:00:16.430> environmental

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the fuel not the engine environmental

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.730 
the fuel not the engine environmental
regulations<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.300> created<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.080> demand<00:00:19.289> for

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
regulations have created a demand for

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.400 
regulations have created a demand for
cleaner<00:00:20.430> burning<00:00:20.760> fuels<00:00:21.359> which<00:00:21.689> sounds<00:00:22.170> great

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
cleaner burning fuels which sounds great

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.310 
cleaner burning fuels which sounds great
and<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:23.100> for<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> environment<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:24.990> not

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and is for the environment but it's not

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.800 
and is for the environment but it's not
so<00:00:25.680> great<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.220> your<00:00:26.400> engine<00:00:26.880> because<00:00:27.570> these

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
so great for your engine because these

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.349 
so great for your engine because these
new<00:00:28.080> fuel<00:00:28.439> formulations<00:00:29.250> tend<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.730> waxy

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
new fuel formulations tend to be waxy

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.659 
new fuel formulations tend to be waxy
and<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.170> leave<00:00:31.349> deposits<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.340> couple

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and like to leave deposits in a couple

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.000 
and like to leave deposits in a couple
