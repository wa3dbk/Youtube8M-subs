00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.330 

there<00:00:01.079> are<00:00:01.230> several<00:00:01.530> different<00:00:01.949> ways<00:00:01.979> that

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
there are several different ways that

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.700 
there are several different ways that
you<00:00:02.520> can<00:00:02.639> do<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:02.850> GE<00:00:03.179> run<00:00:03.480> I'm<00:00:04.200> going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.529> show

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
you can do a GE run I'm going to show

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.769 
you can do a GE run I'm going to show
you<00:00:04.770> two<00:00:05.100> ways<00:00:05.130> that<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:05.670> can<00:00:05.910> do<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.299> but<00:00:06.629> be

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
you two ways that you can do this but be

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.419 
you two ways that you can do this but be
aware<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.109> there<00:00:07.470> are<00:00:07.500> more<00:00:07.890> than<00:00:08.010> two<00:00:08.220> ways

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
aware that there are more than two ways

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.850 
aware that there are more than two ways
to<00:00:08.700> do<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.630> first<00:00:09.780> one<00:00:10.019> sounds<00:00:10.440> like<00:00:10.469> this

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
to do it the first one sounds like this

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.480 
to do it the first one sounds like this
if<00:00:11.130> I'm<00:00:11.610> starting<00:00:12.000> with<00:00:12.090> my<00:00:12.300> D<00:00:12.360> chord

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.370 

the<00:00:19.970> second<00:00:20.360> one<00:00:20.450> sounds<00:00:20.660> like<00:00:20.840> this<00:00:21.170> and

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
the second one sounds like this and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:30.960 
the second one sounds like this and
again<00:00:21.530> I'm<00:00:21.650> going<00:00:21.770> to<00:00:21.860> start<00:00:22.070> with<00:00:22.160> my<00:00:22.310> D<00:00:22.370> chord

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.910 

the<00:00:31.970> first<00:00:32.210> one<00:00:32.419> that<00:00:32.540> I<00:00:32.599> showed<00:00:32.689> you<00:00:33.230> the

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
the first one that I showed you the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.530 
the first one that I showed you the
reason<00:00:34.219> that<00:00:34.250> I'm<00:00:34.430> starting<00:00:34.699> with<00:00:34.910> my<00:00:35.090> D<00:00:35.149> chord

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
reason that I'm starting with my D chord

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.240 
reason that I'm starting with my D chord
is<00:00:35.660> because<00:00:36.020> most<00:00:36.320> of<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.590> time<00:00:36.800> that's<00:00:37.010> where

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
is because most of the time that's where

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.860 
is because most of the time that's where
you're<00:00:37.370> going<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.550> be<00:00:37.610> coming<00:00:37.940> from<00:00:37.969> when<00:00:38.780> you

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
you're going to be coming from when you

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.900 
you're going to be coming from when you
get<00:00:39.019> ready<00:00:39.199> to<00:00:39.350> put<00:00:39.530> that<00:00:39.559> g<00:00:39.980> lick<00:00:40.190> in<00:00:40.489> or<00:00:40.760> that

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
get ready to put that g lick in or that

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.310 
get ready to put that g lick in or that
g<00:00:41.120> run<00:00:41.379> so

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.280 

you<00:00:45.800> start<00:00:46.190> by<00:00:46.400> doing<00:00:46.430> your<00:00:46.850> G<00:00:47.150> run<00:00:47.480> which

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
you start by doing your G run which

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.830 
you start by doing your G run which
starts<00:00:48.680> on<00:00:48.890> your<00:00:48.920> sixth<00:00:49.490> string<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.450> lowest

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
starts on your sixth string the lowest

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.029 
starts on your sixth string the lowest
one<00:00:51.050> open

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
one open

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.930 
one open
second<00:00:53.879> fret<00:00:54.120> third<00:00:55.070> fret

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
second fret third fret

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.910 
second fret third fret
and<00:00:58.030> then<00:00:58.810> you're<00:00:58.930> going<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.230> do<00:00:59.350> a<00:00:59.380> hammer-on

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
and then you're going to do a hammer-on

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.190 
and then you're going to do a hammer-on
on<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.850> fifth<00:01:01.090> string<00:01:01.270> that's<00:01:01.810> this<00:01:02.020> one

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
on the fifth string that's this one

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.010 
on the fifth string that's this one
right<00:01:02.260> here<00:01:02.620> from<00:01:02.770> open<00:01:03.220> to<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.820> second<00:01:04.210> fret

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
right here from open to the second fret

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.319 
right here from open to the second fret
and<00:01:06.350> when<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.650> do<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.799> hammer-on<00:01:07.340> case<00:01:08.180> you

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
and when you do a hammer-on case you

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:09.999 
and when you do a hammer-on case you
don't<00:01:08.570> know<00:01:08.689> what<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:08.899> is<00:01:09.110> what<00:01:09.530> I'm<00:01:09.680> doing

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
don't know what that is what I'm doing

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.710 
don't know what that is what I'm doing
is<00:01:10.130> I'm<00:01:10.280> hitting<00:01:10.579> the<00:01:10.700> string<00:01:10.970> one<00:01:11.240> time<00:01:11.509> with

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
is I'm hitting the string one time with

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.940 
is I'm hitting the string one time with
my<00:01:11.899> pick<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:13.520> then<00:01:13.700> I'm<00:01:13.850> hammering<00:01:14.270> on<00:01:14.479> here

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
my pick and then I'm hammering on here

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.639 
my pick and then I'm hammering on here
to<00:01:15.950> get<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.189> second<00:01:16.549> sound<00:01:16.790> and<00:01:17.409> you<00:01:18.409> have<00:01:18.530> to

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
to get the second sound and you have to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.440 
to get the second sound and you have to
do<00:01:18.799> that<00:01:18.979> really<00:01:19.189> quickly<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:19.850> hard<00:01:20.119> like

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
do that really quickly and hard like

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.999 
do that really quickly and hard like
your<00:01:20.600> fingers<00:01:20.930> like<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.140> hammer<00:01:21.470> when<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:21.860> do

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
your fingers like a hammer when you do

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.130 
your fingers like a hammer when you do
that<00:01:22.250> then<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.119> do<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.360> same<00:01:23.390> thing<00:01:23.630> on<00:01:24.020> the

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
that then I do the same thing on the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.330 
that then I do the same thing on the
fourth<00:01:24.409> string<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:26.799> then<00:01:27.799> I<00:01:27.860> hit<00:01:28.039> the<00:01:28.070> third

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
fourth string and then I hit the third

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.140 
fourth string and then I hit the third
string<00:01:28.670> open<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.679> strum

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:43.990 

so<00:01:34.150> again<00:01:34.450> what<00:01:34.659> I<00:01:34.689> have<00:01:34.780> is

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.510 

if<00:01:44.120> you<00:01:44.750> make<00:01:45.050> your<00:01:45.230> G<00:01:45.530> chord<00:01:45.560> instead<00:01:46.370> of

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
if you make your G chord instead of

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.910 
if you make your G chord instead of
using<00:01:47.510> these<00:01:47.720> three<00:01:48.080> fingers<00:01:48.530> if<00:01:48.740> you're

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
using these three fingers if you're

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.400 
using these three fingers if you're
making<00:01:49.040> it<00:01:49.280> like<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:49.850> then<00:01:50.750> when<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.080> do<00:01:51.260> the

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
making it like this then when you do the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.290 
making it like this then when you do the
G<00:01:51.620> run<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.280> other<00:01:52.430> fingers<00:01:52.850> that<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.060> would

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
G run the other fingers that you would

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.840 
G run the other fingers that you would
use<00:01:53.510> would<00:01:53.780> be<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.950> then<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:58.490> would<00:01:58.610> do<00:01:58.700> your

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
use would be and then you would do your

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.649 
use would be and then you would do your
chord<00:01:59.090> like<00:01:59.270> this

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.599 

the<00:02:02.659> second<00:02:03.140> of<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.409> two<00:02:03.619> G<00:02:03.950> runs<00:02:04.249> that<00:02:04.490> I

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
the second of the two G runs that I

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.639 
the second of the two G runs that I
showed<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:04.939> it's<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.659> little<00:02:05.960> bit<00:02:06.079> harder<00:02:06.499> but

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
showed you it's a little bit harder but

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:07.630 
showed you it's a little bit harder but
not<00:02:06.829> too<00:02:07.069> bad

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
not too bad

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.770 
not too bad
so<00:02:08.090> again<00:02:08.360> if<00:02:08.450> I'm<00:02:08.599> starting<00:02:08.899> from<00:02:09.200> D

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.770 

I do<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.170> same<00:02:13.500> G<00:02:14.100> run<00:02:14.400> again

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
I do the same G run again

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.420 
I do the same G run again
and<00:02:17.780> then<00:02:18.079> I'm<00:02:18.170> going<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.379> hit<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:19.129> fifth

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
and then I'm going to hit the fifth

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.319 
and then I'm going to hit the fifth
string<00:02:19.760> open<00:02:20.299> and<00:02:21.760> then<00:02:22.760> I'm<00:02:22.879> going<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.120> go<00:02:23.269> to

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
string open and then I'm going to go to

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.380 
string open and then I'm going to go to
the<00:02:23.569> first<00:02:23.780> fret<00:02:24.200> with<00:02:24.409> my<00:02:24.590> first<00:02:24.859> finger

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
the first fret with my first finger

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.380 
the first fret with my first finger

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
and some people will leave instead of
