00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.569
 like the good one this time we're going to 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.660
 do a review 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:12.750
 1635 canon series l 2.8 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.650
 and good to start telling you that it's worth 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.250
 around 1500 euros new and about 800 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.320
 900 euros second-hand 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.010
 but well let's see 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.740
 to begin the qualities are very very 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.259
 good in my free time I dedicate myself to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 repair objectives the two amounts the 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.879
 arrange them clean the fungi and say 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.290
 that this internally is very good 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.650
 they take care even the smallest 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.650
 detail 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.739
 from the button it is much easier to 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.240
 move that any other objective the 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:53.590
 Threads are very soft 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.580
 but we are talking about what it is worth 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.170
 about one thousand euros is going to be spent 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.590
 anyone who buys not this if 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.430
 what you want quality 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.130
 then I 'm going to put a few 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.440
 examples of how we are going to assemble it and 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.950
 let's record a little video to see 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.950
 how fast it has and nothing 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.399
 well we have it assembled and we are going to do 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.049
 Focus tests I'm going to put a 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:24.939
 manual was completely focused and 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.229
 let's put it automatic and see 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.229
 how long it takes and the noise it makes 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.960
 and now we focus for another side 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.590
 good as you see is a very objective 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.130
 fast and it works very well in terms of 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.230
 sound and the sharpness of the photograph and 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.910
 the video evidently nothing since then 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.510
 they take a few pictures so you can see 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.030
 the sharpness with rast and others say no 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.240
 I'm going to retouch in no time 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.909
 I'm going to photograph it with 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.710
 in neutral and without any filter or anything 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.700
 so you can see the quality that the 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.700
 objective 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.879
 final conclusion is a goal if 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.469
 It was my hand and could buy me 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.139
 what you would not buy is not a goal 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:10.360
 very good for portraits since it has a 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:12.790
 2 with 8 of focal and 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.180
 and has a 16 35 ideal to do 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.000
 portraits as iguana sharpness 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.189
 a little more to say good if I'm going to 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.609
 teach how much it weighs that I already know 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.609
 I forgot 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.790
 despite more than more than half a kilo but 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.319
 It is a goal that takes takes 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.909
 because it is comfortable to take to the camera 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.389
 it's not like for example a sant joan ' of 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.790
 14 millimeters that weighs and makes them weigh 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.920
 the camera and it's uncomfortable between quotation marks 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.620
 but it is a goal that is done 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.510
 carry very well and nothing more to say 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.280
 I hope you liked the review and 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.280
 you write to my channel a greeting
