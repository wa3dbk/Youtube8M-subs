00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.320
 good morning Good afternoon Good night 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.720
 Look what just came for me 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.370
 this item with the highest degree of 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.520
 wonderful age 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.800
 This box is huge is bigger than 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.230
 imagined 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.530
 this is good here what is editing 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.480
 limited mario kart 8 it european 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.339
 by age rating, we see that 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.510
 European because European 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.179
 simply because the American version 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.809
 was exclusive of nintendo world 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:43.999
 store 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.460
 there in New York only those who were there 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:49.550
 I could personally buy it and if I did not 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.559
 was limited to 350 units 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.589
 then what happened immediately in the 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.350
 first day he already went straight to ebay 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.329
 for a price of 300 and 400 dollars or 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.359
 simply ridiculous for you to receive 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.840
 that in Brazil it would be a thousand reais thing 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.890
 serious then so totally out of 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.399
 question 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.740
 and to vary the European box is superior 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.630
 the american box the european box is 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.729
 much easier to achieve much more 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.920
 I have however of the European game 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.200
 but I already have the mario kart invention 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.350
 american martial arts kart with 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.439
 the national capital of gm in brazil that 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.619
 it's just that the American game starts 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.420
 lippi case that I both coast then to 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.170
 It does not matter, I have the game I have. 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.240
 the collector's edition 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.189
 again as well as pandora's 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.109
 tower is one more of the boxes of 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.999
 collector who does not come sealed he comes 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.340
 with sealing wax underneath 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.469
 that famous round transparent lac 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.240
 but on top there is nothing the box is 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.670
 fully open 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.570
 It is common for some European items to be like this 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.170
 same 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:02.090
 so let's open let's see the content 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.460
 first of all our game and it's very 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.069
 heavier than the American game but 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.200
 much heavier and should have a 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.990
 mega manual here with several languages 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.650
 In fact, let me see something that has 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.930
 various 3ds games 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.849
 Good luck! 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.579
 mario kart 8 is in English from 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.230
 portugal also has even Russian because 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.360
 they do not take that Portuguese from 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.489
 portugal and adapt to portuguese 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.230
 Brazilian version or in the American version 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.970
 Leave portugal for those who do not 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.129
 knows English although mario kart does not 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.810
 requires a lot but it would be interesting only 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.950
 to show that you care a little bit about 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.049
 Brazil is not 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.450
 one thing I do not like about issues 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.849
 European is this is the classification 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.739
 age of germany this is the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.359
 england is tiny is the same as 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.790
 united states in size so I do not 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.220
 I'll call you now, I avoid getting the edition. 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.260
 German because of this as this is the 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.670
 box-to-box they do for all 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.170
 nationalities put all the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.569
 age ratings that should be 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.549
 French I'm not sure so stay 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:09.480
 Here, this hideous business messes up 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:11.430
 cover art comparison only you lose 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.379
 totally this corner here is not big 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.810
 But I think it's ugly 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.169
 I liked the side that instead of 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.720
 simply the text has a new normal 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.220
 I find it very different now I like this one. 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.810
 red cover here 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.629
 American has people who do not like 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.799
 people who really hate but I 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.250
 really like 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.379
 Now let's get to what is the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.819
 the second canister that is 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.280
 inside the box 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.120
 take it from here carefully not to 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.190
 spoil see that it's all beyond the box and 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.940
 the more firm it is all protected in with 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.760
 cardboard 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.949
 unlike the eggshell boxes of the 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.720
 American issues the demarcation I did not see 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:55.909
 But from what I saw, it looks like the 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.090
 paper is much thinner than usual 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:02.519
 does not have the box is a box with code 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.989
 bar and everything with the name of the item and such 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:10.549
 we see right here has a left open 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.549
 very thin adhesive tape here 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.400
 ok let's get the box there's a 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.740
 manual here teaching to ride 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.110
 here is very simple only a leaflet even 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.000
 teaching to ride put this on 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.150
 this and that on top of it or well 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.260
 basic and let me take it with 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:39.290
 Beware that you have lousy loose 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.290
 opa opa 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.260
 it seems that just leaning has nothing to 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.980
 to fit even has this little bit here 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.980
 that the base 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:54.750
 so it fit well it looks like the car 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:00.240
 goes over the position I preferred 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.370
 This is it, I do not think so 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.050
 This is a lot more children, is that it? 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.360
 Guys thank you very much for watching. 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.510

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.260
