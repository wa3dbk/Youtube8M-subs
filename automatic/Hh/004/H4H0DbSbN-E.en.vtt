00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the bike across the lane because I

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.109 
the bike across the lane because I
wasn't<00:00:25.619> sure<00:00:25.740> if<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.980> had<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:26.310> not<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:27.060> I

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
wasn't sure if I had it or not and I

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.160 
wasn't sure if I had it or not and I
heard<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.330> roar<00:00:27.539> from<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.750> crowd<00:00:27.810> and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
heard this roar from the crowd and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.400 
heard this roar from the crowd and
realized<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.769> one<00:00:30.050> it's<00:00:31.050> not<00:00:31.140> yeah<00:00:31.289> it's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
realized that one it's not yeah it's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.380 
realized that one it's not yeah it's
hard<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.619> express<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.070> how<00:00:32.189> excited<00:00:33.149> how

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
hard to express just how excited how

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.020 
hard to express just how excited how
amazing<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.320> experience<00:00:34.860> was<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.280> yeah<00:00:36.000> I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
amazing that experience was but yeah I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.100 
amazing that experience was but yeah I
think<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.300> sure<00:00:36.390> when<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> got<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.809> podium

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
think it's sure when I got in the podium

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.319 
think it's sure when I got in the podium
and<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.440> wasn't<00:00:38.070> really<00:00:38.309> able<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.910> hold<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> all

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and I wasn't really able to hold it all

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:51.740 
and I wasn't really able to hold it all
in<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:39.719> what<00:00:40.410> an<00:00:40.500> experience<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.520> was<00:00:49.070> I<00:00:50.750> was

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
in but what an experience that was I was

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
in but what an experience that was I was
a<00:00:51.780> lot<00:00:52.199> better<00:00:52.410> after<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> crowds<00:00:53.129> of

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
a lot better after the crowds of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
a lot better after the crowds of
probably<00:00:53.579> 5<00:00:53.789> 10<00:00:54.090> times<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> row

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
probably 5 10 times in a row

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.990 
probably 5 10 times in a row
none<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.949> us<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.190> ever<00:00:56.309> raced<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.760> crowds

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
none of us have ever raced to crowds

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.400 
none of us have ever raced to crowds
anything<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:58.050> probably<00:00:58.199> never

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
anything like that we probably never

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.779 
anything like that we probably never
will<00:00:58.620> dive<00:00:58.800> ever<00:00:58.920> again<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.340> honest<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.699> was

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
will dive ever again to be honest it was

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.970 
will dive ever again to be honest it was
it<00:00:59.910> an<00:01:00.420> experience<00:01:00.960> Ella<00:01:01.109> would<00:01:01.289> remember<00:01:01.469> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
all the people I've neglected so

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.980 
all the people I've neglected so
horribly<00:01:17.040> over<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> last<00:01:17.700> 10<00:01:18.360> years<00:01:18.659> I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
horribly over the last 10 years I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.570 
horribly over the last 10 years I
thought<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.680> was<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.130> better<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.460> that

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
thought I was going to do better in that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.160 
thought I was going to do better in that
IP<00:01:20.759> than<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.210> did<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> will<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
IP than I did and then I will see the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.570 
IP than I did and then I will see the
scratch<00:01:22.439> race<00:01:22.560> thing<00:01:22.740> going<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.040> way<00:01:23.189> either

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
scratch race thing going my way either

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.429 
scratch race thing going my way either
so<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.150> bit<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.360> over<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> place<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:25.140> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
so I was a bit all over the place like I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.140 
so I was a bit all over the place like I
didn't<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.280> think<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.000> many

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
didn't know what to think and so many

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.039 
didn't know what to think and so many
things<00:01:27.330> were<00:01:27.450> running<00:01:27.600> through<00:01:27.720> my<00:01:27.840> head<00:01:27.869> like

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
things were running through my head like

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.480 
things were running through my head like
how<00:01:28.350> am<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.500> actually<00:01:28.530> gonna<00:01:28.860> gain<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> points

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
how am I actually gonna gain the points

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
how am I actually gonna gain the points
back<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:30.990> more<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
back and then it was just more of a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.960 
back and then it was just more of a
forget<00:01:31.770> them<00:01:31.950> results<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.670> caught<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
forget them results and it caught the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.490 
forget them results and it caught the
chat<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.240> 500<00:01:33.720> meter<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> they<00:01:34.140> don't<00:01:34.290> see

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
chat on the 500 meter and they don't see

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.539 
chat on the 500 meter and they don't see
it<00:01:34.590> paid<00:01:34.799> off

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it paid off

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.069 
it paid off
it's<00:01:36.030> they're<00:01:36.450> all<00:01:36.540> different<00:01:36.750> they're<00:01:36.900> all

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it's they're all different they're all

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
I learnt the career with that raid and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.940 
I learnt the career with that raid and
on<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:41.810> back<00:01:41.960> of<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.230> promises<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.800> whole

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950
