00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.170
 my people and welcome to one 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.370
 Show new video on my channel today 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.519
 I give you the new fireworks future 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.240
 the version 1.4 point 6 like the whole 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.250
 looks 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.250
 yes that is it is first 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.820
 so we come to the whole how one 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.460
 The whole build one can firstly 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.629
 build a normal firecracker 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.759
 from black powder and paper then take place 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.830
 normal firecracker, however 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.869
 not exploded and no effects 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.899
 So that's pretty pointless 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:18.869
 You can now black powder top left 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:21.990
 placing keep right next paper 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.929
 there is an effect to the right of it 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.550
 namely, effect items one can 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:33.600
 make monastery behind or here 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:36.149
 diamond pieces or a head hit 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.759
 head does not matter to the head of fireball 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:43.229
 gold nugget or a feather all 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.729
 different effects and underneath 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.810
 This effect can also be one 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:54.539
 dye I conjure probably now time 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:58.580
 very short a dye if I still 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.580
 would know where the dyes are 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:13.890
 okay I have it but I'll take it 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:17.220
 blue round so black powder stop 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.490
 black powder effect next to it underneath 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.780
 a color and already I have one 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:27.240
 fireworks star with the characteristics 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.940
 small ball because of the blue dye 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.000
 and twinkle that 's the effect of 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.790
 monastery dust the listing of all 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.870
 effects and colors i can give you in 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.120
 to pack the description 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.760
 everything would be read for that too 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.490
 let's all have everything crafted so now 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.740
 you are staring at this fireworks 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.070
 you can then star this fireworks 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.530
 just pull out of the crafting box 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:56.460
 and you keep that first 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.490
 need her here again black powder 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:03.300
 down over it paper and over it again 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.050
 your crafted fireworks star with 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.060
 the characteristics and that was the case 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.709
 back then that this would get out of here 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.200
 a firecracker with the 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:18.080
 bottles a small ball smart and angle 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.190
 so if you want to have that 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.459
 Bottles gets bigger so that the 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.739
 rocket altitude flies prepares that 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.920
 black powder here a bit out of that 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.840
 means here it is not just one 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.200
 but occupied in three fields and 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.030
 Maybe it's Italy 3 here 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.260
 I already do a few rockets 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.840
 I'm here from here and hope that 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:49.980
 now do not die because of the bug so moved 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:51.930
 I have a dispens and redstone and 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.560
 another button and another blog 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.560
 and done away with the button 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:08.390
 so now you just place the 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:12.540
 Dispenser somewhere or donor 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.700
 made departmental turn on and in 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.799
 the donor Here comes your 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.200
 firecracker things tinkered out 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.739
 the fireworks star and black full of 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.650
 paper 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.750
 he just comes in and already pushes 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:30.390
 Just click the button and you see 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.919
 The whole thing comes naturally exploding 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:39.600
 spectacular over when you do it 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:41.520
 Of course you can do that as well 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.780
 so make millions of dispens 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.000
 one after the other then one switches 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.580
 next series and so on in the usa 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.590
 in the first users with the effect with 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.270
 the second in different color and in 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:57.210
 other effect and so on they could 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:58.340
 invent or invent really good fireworks 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.880
 build wood 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.530
 and you can do it all nicely again 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.070
 fire quickly 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.590
 with a matt stone block again like 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.930
 already known 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:22.640
 Here is a circular redstone 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:22.640
 last torch and 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:30.160
 ok so you see that's one 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.360
 that's why it was a bit too fast 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.780
 slowing down a bit now but you 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.350
 See it works and yes that was mine 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.750
 tutorial the link to the more precise ones 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.380
 Instructions how to use different effects 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.270
 builds and so on you will find on the 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.490
 on the link in the description and yes 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.810
