00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.099
 hello very good to all how about how 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.929
 you are and welcome to the monthly top of 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.869
 cydia where in this video we are going to 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.910
 review the top five tweets so 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.029
 less in my opinion that they have left this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.680
 five months of cydia are five 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.539
 tweets I think that fantastic the truth 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.670
 is that so many have not come out this month 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.990
 tweets as good as last month 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.160
 you can check the video last month 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.960
 surely you will find it here 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.430
 down but good the truth that they are five 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.780
 tweets of the best thing that has come out and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.070
 they are quite interesting we are going to do 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.070
 a top 5 mega we started 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.780
 we start with position number 5 and in 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.030
 this position we have a very simple click 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.400
 but very useful and completely free 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.810
 the tweet is called shuai banner and it's 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.090
 available as you see in the repository 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.040
 of mont maya dotcom and does what 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.989
 next when we get a 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.309
 notice of agreement to fix as we 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.050
 It appears a notification which is 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.430
 many times and we receive many 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.230
 notifications may be a little bit 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.640
 annoying not then to remove them 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.950
 you just have to do when 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.229
 come the agreement you make such a gesture that 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.520
 this one and you can toss it aside 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.660
 you will be able to remove without any problem 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.240
 for me I get many notifications 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.700
 the truth is that it is a click of the most 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.560
 essential we do not do so and what 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.550
 we remove so that it does not bother us this is 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.930
 tweet what the truth is that it is 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.740
 pretty simple we went to the position 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.740
 Number 4 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.310
 in this position we are also 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.410
 with a pretty simple but super tweet 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.700
 super useful at least for me not 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.800
 also to see what you think of you 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.060
 it's a completely free tweet 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.920
 also that is available in the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.500
 mod my repository and there is dotcom and it 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.760
 call time for alarm and you will see what 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 what does it simply do we have to 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.900
 put in the clock app and we 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.000
 appears the time that is missing so that 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.590
 bee the alarm I think this is 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.150
 quite useful because many times over 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.860
 all the ancient nuclei we 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.120
 we remembered when we put the branch that 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.160
 I told you you have so many hours left for two 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.870
 my mother militias how little I have left 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.460
 no or how much I have left what happiness 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.480
 you slept a little bit more comfortable not because 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.830
 nothing is simply this so that 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.270
 you have an orientation I think it is 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.730
 something that would have to come natively 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.680
 Default I find very useful declare it 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.250
 I recommend and we move to the position 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.250
 number 3 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.210
 well, the thing is evolving 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.100
 here we find one of the tweets 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.870
 more essential than also being 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.730
 free I think you should have all 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.370
 you because it's an authentic past 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.870
 it's called activity jet and it's available 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.970
 in a repository that does not come by 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.510
 defect over like the previous ones the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.480
 repository of this tweet is rp 3c h 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.490
 repo bar you see here below you are 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.290
 seeing in agreement to put it you already know 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.940
 you are going to manage you are going to edit 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.410
 add and here you have to put it 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.030
 good agreement let's see a little bit what 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.530
 is what makes this fantastic tweet 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.060
 Well, we're going to the center of 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.530
 notifications because it's a beat get that 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.360
 integrates directly into the center 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.860
 notifications and how are you going to see it is 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.900
 this here I'm pointing with the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.460
 red dot do not notice that I have put 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.750
 is configurable can put what 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.060
 you who have proposed to call 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.830
 grab and I have simulated the start button 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.140
 the home button that is this button here 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.730
 agree then simulate the sleep button 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.530
 what is this button here for 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.360
 Turn off the device to put it on 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.400
 I do not rest and then notice that we have 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.750
 here the multitasking that when we press 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.790
 here in multitasking we access 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.280
 directly multitasking for me is 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.080
 comfortable to do so and for example enter 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.860
 I rest in agreement when we click here and 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.900
 note that the device has entered 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.190
 right now at rest this is not what 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.660
 does the truth is that it is very simple 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.870
 also but it's configurable let's 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.670
 go for example to the activator tweet 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.440
 of agreement and from here we configure it 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.090
 in the menu option appears to us this 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.040
 new option and here we will be able to put 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.900
 the buttons that we want 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.070
 we will be able to move and from here we are going to 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.070
 to be able to put any of the options 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.810
 that we have in activator is very cool the 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.560
 I really like it a lot and we went to 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.560
 top number 2 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.220
 Well, we are reaching the end of 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.230
 this top and here we are going to present you a 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.700
 customization tweet that does what 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.340
 next from the lock screen 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.290
 when we unblock so that we can fix 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.670
 the cool animation that puts us is 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.610
 a click of personalization that is called 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.400
 live with pro is a tweet that has a 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.810
 price of 0.99 american dollars and you go 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.430
 to see what it does because it is configurable 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.840
 let's get into the settings we 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.280
 let's go to the option of live wire pro 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.780
 from here obviously we can activate 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.280
 deactivate and the coolest thing from here 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.840
 we will be able to change between 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.860
 different transitions we're going to put 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.230
 This is the one that comes by default 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.700
 live with and I already talked to you in the past 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.280
 a free version and the version 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.380
 free is this according to this mode of 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.330
 unlock but we also have this one 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.000
 here, notice that we also have to 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.010
 this here to note that you also have to 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.229
 changing none note that too 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.669
 we have this here we have this one 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.320
 here that goes around 360 is 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.600
 quite curious and we have to 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.979
 finish this here, these are all 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.479
 the transitions that we have to me the 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.250
 truth is that it is that of folk 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.600
 it seems to me the hardest of all and a 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.880
 pretty cool thing from here we go to 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.380
 can set the speed of agreement 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.840
 we raise the bar fixed that will do more 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.680
 super super super slow you can 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.270
 adjust a little 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.370
 So good taste to highlight a 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.199
 little bit more the animation no this is what 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.340
 that makes the super super super cool tweet 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.470
 of customization I like 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.520
 I highly recommend it and we went to 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.520
 top number one 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.500
 good guys and girls we come to the end 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.030
 of this tour and we call the top 1 in this 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.620
 position we have a tweet that is 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.240
 Pretty cool is integrated with the camera 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.350
 of photos I think it's an application 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.330
 also what would have to come 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.460
 natively in our system but not 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.260
 it comes but thanks to the holy jailbreak 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.180
 jailbreak we will be able to install all 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.500
 these fantastic things that they manage to do 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.930
 life a little easier and more pleasant 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.480
 not the tweet in question I do not roll more 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.070
 it's called native ry how are you going to see us 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.200
 let's go in the photo camera according and 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.670
 from here we could activate it now 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.560
 we have this new option agree that 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.000
 it's called enable qr that when 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.990
 we activate then simply when we 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.060
 we approach a led to a qr code of 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.700
 fijaros agreement which will do us 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.480
 we approach a core code and read it 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.460
 automatically agree this is a 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.170
 link to wikipedia to the section of 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.330
 steve jobs in agreement to fix that the 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.730
 qr code and opens it without any kind of 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.290
 problem I do not want to change the search engine 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.970
 that I prefer to use good google 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.560
 Notice that you open it perfectly 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.020
 because with this option simply what 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.460
 you will be able to do is read any qr 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.310
 and will link you to the website 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.990
 corresponding to the contact whatever 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.569
 the truth is that you already know how it works 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.669
 the qr no this is an example of it 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:11.979
 links without any problem is 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.599
 super a super simple way not good 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.860
 Well this is the tour we have for 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.149
 this month has also been nothing 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.169
 exceptional the truth but I think that 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:19.839
 have been at least tried 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.459
 collect most free tweets and 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.659
 especially tweets that add things and that 

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:24.459
 they make our lives a little bit easier 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.499
 even if they are simple things I think that 

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:27.849
 they are things that do not come by default anymore 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:29.199
 me at least all these things I 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:30.729
 They serve a lot and I hope someone 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:32.559
 that has the same tastes of 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.330
 productivity at least that I then 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:36.339
 also serve them you will not look 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.929
 majo steve jobs was the best good 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:39.279
 here we made the tour thank you very much
