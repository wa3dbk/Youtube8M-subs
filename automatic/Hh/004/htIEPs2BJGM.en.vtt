people around her and her best friend

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.120 
people around her and her best friend
instead<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:15.020> just<00:01:15.229> thinking<00:01:15.590> about<00:01:15.710> herself

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
instead of just thinking about herself

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.359 
instead of just thinking about herself
and<00:01:16.610> what<00:01:16.790> she<00:01:16.820> wanted<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:17.860> so<00:01:18.860> she<00:01:18.920> kind<00:01:19.310> of

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
to love it something I had a problem

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.840 
to love it something I had a problem
with<00:01:36.200> last<00:01:36.500> year<00:01:36.770> was<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.189> whole<00:01:37.340> idea<00:01:37.369> of

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
with last year was the whole idea of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.890 
with last year was the whole idea of
Moroi<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.229> Strigoi<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.430> dhampir<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:41.330> just

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
Moroi and Strigoi and dhampir I just

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.960 
Moroi and Strigoi and dhampir I just
thought<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.229> sounded<00:01:42.439> very<00:01:42.890> fanfiction<00:01:43.850> II<00:01:43.939> I

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
thought it sounded very fanfiction II I

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.719 
thought it sounded very fanfiction II I
thought<00:01:44.329> it<00:01:44.450> sounded<00:01:44.689> kind<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.259> silly<00:01:45.729> but

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
thought it sounded kind of silly but

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.359 
thought it sounded kind of silly but
reading<00:01:47.479> on<00:01:47.659> about<00:01:48.049> it<00:01:48.079> I<00:01:48.530> actually<00:01:48.860> thought

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
reading on about it I actually thought

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.940 
reading on about it I actually thought
