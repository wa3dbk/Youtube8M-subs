00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.789
 one 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.670
 maybe I'm downloaded 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.790
 tuto if on this occasion we are going to learn 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.989
 to play a simple blues all that 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.850
 I did at the beginning the video was a 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.920
 small improvisation among a few 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.390
 chords this time I'm not going to 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.040
 to be able to explain what I did at the beginning 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.199
 of the video because as you already 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.460
 mentioned improvise but of course 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.870
 I'll explain what all the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.790
 chords and many forms of power 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.470
 touch them and fit them together 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.630
 well for this lesson you do not have to 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.600
 basically learn four chords the 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.940
 which are my biggest and which is the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.489
 medium and the ring in the second fret 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.380
 of the fourth and the fifth string and the 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.480
 index on the first fret of the third 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.990
 string is played from the sixth 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.450
 ropes 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.240
 The following are the major recalled that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.619
 play from the sixth string too 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.750
 in many places you will find that 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.729
 touch from the fifth which is not 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.500
 incorrect however due to the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.530
 properties of the chord play it from 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.539
 of the sixth string is not wrong this 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.030
 chord is about accommodating these three 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.710
 fingers or these three fingers in the second 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.400
 fret of the second third and fourth 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.560
 rope 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.360
 the next agreed are the seventh the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.650
 which requires a bit of technique due 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.110
 that is basically a small nut 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.630
 we are going to place you index of the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.540
 first to the fourth string in the manner of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.210
 followed and we are going to add the annular or the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.630
 which we like more in the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.980
 third fret of the first string and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.860
 we are going to play it 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.320
 preference from the fifth string 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.060
 although touching it from the sixth no 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.210
 there is no problem is not heard 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.210
 wrong 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.580
 and the last chord that we are going to review 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.310
 it is exactly this figure only that 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.750
 traveled to the seventh fret 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.970
 this figure can be touched from 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.500
 the sixth string however if 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.210
 interferes a little with the sound that 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.830
 we want to achieve so preferably 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.830
 touch from the fifth 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.109
 that's why in the video what I do is 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.959
 place this position with the ring finger 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:34.689
 and my middle finger as is enough 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.019
 long I do not use it so that this rope does not 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.019
 sound 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.050
 this is a matter of practice not you 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.270
 worry if you can not do it to the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.310
 first 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.140
 and basically these are the four 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.640
 colors that use the following that 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.830
 you have to review obviously is the rhythm 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.020
 If you are going to think about it, I recommend that you 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.570
 just make detours to carry if 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.660
 beads with a spike it is advisable that 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.310
 for this rhythm, use it because 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.560
 in the blues, 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.390
 barb due to the amount of sounds that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.000
 can achieve with it specifically 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.170
 for this genre but if you do it with 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.460
 the fingers like me there is no 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.470
 inconvenient nor any 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.410
 limiting maybe they are a little less 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.720
 strong for example with your fingers 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.610
 with a pick 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.770
 or maybe not strong but a little more 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.360
 neat however the difference is almost 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.190
 null well as I mentioned if you go 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.660
 starting with radios down is more 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.300
 enough and what you are going to do is 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.510
 make a fast chords a quick on 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.840
 my greatest 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.689
 silversmith in the greatest ease with the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.709
 air ropes and to top off several 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:37.709
 traits in my major 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.790
 Y 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.990
 and basically there we have a blues 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.990
 which can be the basis for improvising 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.099
 if you want to achieve a stronger sound and 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.200
 a little more light-oriented you can 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.530
 only play the strings of more 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.530
 above 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.930
 be the first four strings and 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.630
 only three or only two that 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.580
 it's up to you the sound obviously is 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.739
 quite different between just touching 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.400
 the first to play all for example 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.400
 I'm going to play all 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.480
 now I'm just going to play those of 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.480
 material 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.480
 you will be able to realize it is quite 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.110
 different and how you see 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.900
 these three chords I say there are three 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.009
 because this chord plays the strings at 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.629
 air is also considered a chord and 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.629
 I may only cycle 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.640
 which does not sound so good or that in the end 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.640
 of the cycle are followed in my greatest 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.730
 and when you want to add the others 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.730
 chords 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.320
 that is also already up to you without 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.940
 However, I recommend that you do it at 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.940
 end is to say when the cycle finishes 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.300
 only radios below if you go 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.860
 starting if you already have a little more 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.860
 experience or if you want to glimpse 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.770
 and you can even do what it says in the 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.510
 video that is to add the little finger in the 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.510
 fifth fret of the first string 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.220
 and then at times 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:45.229
 and you can go back from the fret topic to 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:45.229
 him my biggest can even be this 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.710
 memorizing the figure well you can do 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.600
 this is to make a cameron is to say 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.789
 play the strings in the air and then 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.360
 press and that can be done with 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.360
 all the actors 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.560
 ah 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.259
 i 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.740
 there are a myriad of ways in which 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.830
 you can improvise clear that that already 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.750
 it depends on your abilities and also if 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.790
 you require more lessons not the 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.530
 you can ask with pleasure I can 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.000
 explain various techniques can be done 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.100
 with these four chords and obviously 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.450
 with more and also with chords that 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.350
 they require a bit more technique like 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.350
 chords with grids 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.560
 that you liked it and really if 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.509
 you want more lessons of blues do not doubt 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.310
 in asking me the leads I have some 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.289
 very basic knowledge but they are 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.509
 pretty useful to start and 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:46.729
 also be able to achieve a little more 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:48.860
 level in this particular genre 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:50.870
