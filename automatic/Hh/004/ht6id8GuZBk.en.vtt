purpose today when you're lifting the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.639 
purpose today when you're lifting the
cab<00:00:45.489> into<00:00:45.820> place<00:00:46.030> there's<00:00:46.360> a<00:00:46.420> about<00:00:47.230> four

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
cab into place there's a about four

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.220 
cab into place there's a about four
steel<00:00:48.550> workers<00:00:48.969> that<00:00:49.149> will<00:00:49.269> be<00:00:49.390> up<00:00:49.510> on<00:00:49.719> the

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
steel workers that will be up on the

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.889 
steel workers that will be up on the
tower<00:00:50.409> itself<00:00:50.829> fastened<00:00:51.699> to<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.210> tower<00:00:52.539> with

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
tower itself fastened to the tower with

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.329 
tower itself fastened to the tower with
safety<00:00:53.170> belts<00:00:53.589> so<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:53.890> there's<00:00:54.129> no

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
safety belts so that there's no

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:55.829 
safety belts so that there's no
possibility<00:00:55.120> that<00:00:55.360> they're<00:00:55.479> going<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.659> fall

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
possibility that they're going to fall

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.410 
possibility that they're going to fall
off<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:57.010> tower<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.579> cab<00:00:57.820> will<00:00:58.030> be<00:00:58.149> raised

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
off and the tower the cab will be raised

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.049 
off and the tower the cab will be raised
into<00:00:58.780> place<00:00:59.019> and<00:00:59.320> probably<00:00:59.949> hooked<00:01:00.579> up<00:01:00.790> one

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
into place and probably hooked up one

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.209 
into place and probably hooked up one
leg<00:01:01.329> at<00:01:01.510> a<00:01:01.600> time<00:01:01.629> if<00:01:02.049> you<00:01:02.170> will<00:01:02.320> so<00:01:02.799> that<00:01:02.949> we<00:01:03.070> can

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
leg at a time if you will so that we can

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.730 
leg at a time if you will so that we can
more<00:01:03.399> properly<00:01:03.820> align<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:04.360> bolts<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:05.320> hold<00:01:05.350> it

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
more properly align the bolts to hold it

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.770 
more properly align the bolts to hold it
into<00:01:05.890> place<00:01:06.009> and<00:01:06.399> as<00:01:06.820> soon<00:01:07.000> as<00:01:07.119> it's<00:01:07.270> down<00:01:07.539> and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
into place and as soon as it's down and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.600 
into place and as soon as it's down and
locked<00:01:07.990> bolted<00:01:08.470> in<00:01:08.619> then<00:01:08.890> it<00:01:08.920> will<00:01:09.130> be<00:01:09.220> welded

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
locked bolted in then it will be welded

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.060 
locked bolted in then it will be welded
in<00:01:09.729> place<00:01:09.759> so<00:01:10.450> this<00:01:10.659> is<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.840> big<00:01:11.229> milestone<00:01:11.560> for

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
in place so this is a big milestone for

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.520 
in place so this is a big milestone for
us<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.399> then<00:01:12.490> will<00:01:12.670> now<00:01:12.820> be<00:01:13.000> able<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.530> complete

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
us and then will now be able to complete

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.740 
us and then will now be able to complete
us<00:01:15.070> more<00:01:15.399> of<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.580> interior<00:01:16.090> as<00:01:16.270> we're<00:01:16.420> able<00:01:16.600> to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
us more of the interior as we're able to

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.480 
us more of the interior as we're able to
pour<00:01:16.960> floors<00:01:17.289> and<00:01:17.530> seal<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:17.979> building<00:01:18.100> so<00:01:18.399> we

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
pour floors and seal the building so we

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.370 
pour floors and seal the building so we
can<00:01:18.610> do<00:01:18.729> all<00:01:19.569> the<00:01:19.690> other<00:01:19.780> things<00:01:19.929> that<00:01:20.170> need<00:01:20.259> to
