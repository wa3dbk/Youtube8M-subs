locker going out after testing and

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.170 
locker going out after testing and
determining<00:01:02.410> it<00:01:02.590> was<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:02.950> lot<00:01:03.250> of<00:01:03.280> Locker<00:01:03.850> or

failure have taken the truck to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.880 
failure have taken the truck to
to<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> local<00:01:08.729> GMC<00:01:08.939> dealer<00:01:09.649> weird<00:01:10.649> it<00:01:10.770> was

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
to the local GMC dealer weird it was

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.300 
to the local GMC dealer weird it was
fixed<00:01:11.729> under<00:01:11.969> warranty<00:01:12.600> no<00:01:13.350> questions<00:01:13.860> asked

so<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:16.590> video<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.840> showing<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.289> test

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so this video is showing that the test

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.310 
so this video is showing that the test
procedure<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.310> how<00:01:20.539> to<00:01:21.539> determine<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
procedure on how to determine the
