prime<00:00:41.780> it

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:01:00.860 

where

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.630 

and<00:01:01.289> there<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.770> our<00:01:01.949> highway<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
and there you can see our highway in the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:13.960 
and there you can see our highway in the
sky

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.180 

and<00:01:14.480> there<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.750> can<00:01:14.780> see<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.290> acting<00:01:15.650> in<00:01:15.800> idle

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
and there you can see and acting in idle

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:24.420 
and there you can see and acting in idle
you<00:01:16.280> can<00:01:16.430> still<00:01:16.670> see<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:16.880> display

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.130 

let<00:01:24.910> me<00:01:25.000> go<00:01:25.090> ahead<00:01:25.150> and<00:01:25.270> change<00:01:25.480> the<00:01:25.660> tape<00:01:25.870> the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
let me go ahead and change the tape the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.410 
let me go ahead and change the tape the
GPS<00:01:26.710> Waypoint<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:27.940> should<00:01:28.120> see<00:01:28.300> the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
GPS Waypoint and you should see the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.140 
GPS Waypoint and you should see the
highway<00:01:28.690> in<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.780> sky<00:01:29.020> change<00:01:29.320> now

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.090 

so<00:01:32.390> I'm<00:01:32.450> just<00:01:32.660> sending<00:01:32.810> direct<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.980> I'm

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
so I'm just sending direct to and I'm

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.040 
so I'm just sending direct to and I'm
thinking<00:01:34.310> an<00:01:34.490> airport<00:01:34.850> in<00:01:35.180> this<00:01:35.630> case<00:01:35.870> i'll

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
thinking an airport in this case i'll

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.540 
thinking an airport in this case i'll
pick<00:01:36.230> one<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.530> recently<00:01:36.860> used<00:01:36.950> once<00:01:37.370> there

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
pick one of the recently used once there

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.730 
pick one of the recently used once there
we<00:01:37.670> go

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
we go

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.620 
we go
and<00:01:38.829> now<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.189> can<00:01:39.490> see<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:39.909> harm<00:01:40.150> in<00:01:40.270> this<00:01:40.450> guy

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
and now you can see the harm in this guy

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.870 
and now you can see the harm in this guy
has<00:01:40.810> changed<00:01:41.229> its<00:01:41.409> direction

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.990 

you<00:01:44.119> can<00:01:44.299> also<00:01:44.450> see<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.990> war<00:01:45.170> zone

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
you can also see the war zone

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.980 
you can also see the war zone
for<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
for the the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.190 
for the the
verizon<00:01:49.799> there

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
verizon there

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.639 
verizon there
with<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:51.920> system<00:01:52.130> it's<00:01:52.670> kind<00:01:52.880> of<00:01:53.030> crude<00:01:53.299> but

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
with this system it's kind of crude but

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:10.330 
with this system it's kind of crude but
it's<00:01:54.649> an<00:01:54.799> idea<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.159> what<00:01:55.340> we<00:01:55.460> should<00:01:55.700> be<00:01:55.939> seeing

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.590 

so<00:02:11.340> hopefully<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.850> gives<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.180> good<00:02:12.330> idea

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
so hopefully that gives you a good idea

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600 
so hopefully that gives you a good idea
of<00:02:12.990> what<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.380> highway<00:02:13.770> in<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.920> sky<00:02:14.220> system

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
of what the highway in the sky system

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.310 
of what the highway in the sky system
looks<00:02:14.820> like<00:02:15.000> you'll<00:02:15.480> notice<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.810> when<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
looks like you'll notice that when the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.280 
looks like you'll notice that when the
engine<00:02:16.590> started<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.040> slow<00:02:17.250> down<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.640> highway

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
engine started to slow down the highway

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.690 
engine started to slow down the highway
in<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.470> guy<00:02:19.620> as<00:02:19.830> well<00:02:20.040> as<00:02:20.160> their<00:02:20.280> horizon

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
in this guy as well as their horizon

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.280 
in this guy as well as their horizon
disappeared<00:02:21.240> because<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.720> prop<00:02:21.930> started

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
disappeared because the prop started

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.790 
disappeared because the prop started
spinning<00:02:22.500> too<00:02:22.770> slowly<00:02:24.440> with<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.770> can

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
spinning too slowly with this I can

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.190 
spinning too slowly with this I can
pretty<00:02:26.100> much<00:02:26.220> display<00:02:26.730> any<00:02:26.970> kind<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.420> display

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
pretty much display any kind of display

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.480 
pretty much display any kind of display
that<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.500> want<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.860> at<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.100> point<00:02:29.220> it's

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
that we want to at this point it's

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.880 
that we want to at this point it's
vector<00:02:29.850> only<00:02:30.180> once<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.840> moved<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.140> my<00:02:31.320> new<00:02:31.350> unit

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
vector only once I moved to my new unit

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.010 
vector only once I moved to my new unit
that<00:02:32.040> has<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:33.630> high-resolution

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
that has the the high-resolution

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.320 
that has the the high-resolution
projection<00:02:34.890> system<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.460> we<00:02:36.030> should<00:02:36.210> be

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
projection system in it we should be

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.060 
projection system in it we should be
able<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.600> display<00:02:36.900> pretty<00:02:37.200> much<00:02:37.380> anything<00:02:37.710> and

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
able to display pretty much anything and

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.730 
able to display pretty much anything and
you<00:02:38.130> can<00:02:38.310> see<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:39.300> area<00:02:39.870> that's<00:02:40.080> defined<00:02:40.560> by

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
you can see the area that's defined by

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.220 
you can see the area that's defined by
the<00:02:40.800> propeller<00:02:41.340> arc<00:02:41.610> out<00:02:41.790> there<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.750> actually

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the propeller arc out there is actually

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.640 
the propeller arc out there is actually
our<00:02:43.320> entire<00:02:43.650> display<00:02:43.980> surface<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:45.650> this

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
our entire display surface so this

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.460 
our entire display surface so this
concludes<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:47.190> demo
