3 in this video we're going to be
looking<00:00:15.839> at<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> sawmill<00:00:16.640> so<00:00:17.640> grab<00:00:17.880> these

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
looking at the sawmill so grab these

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.000 
looking at the sawmill so grab these
things<00:00:18.390> here<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.230> sawmill<00:00:19.619> runs<00:00:19.830> off<00:00:19.980> of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
things here the sawmill runs off of

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.590 
things here the sawmill runs off of
redstone<00:00:20.430> flux<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.150> we're<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.510> be

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
redstone flux and we're going to be

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.269

used in some crafting recipes take those

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.110 
used in some crafting recipes take those
out<00:02:05.230> of<00:02:05.290> there<00:02:05.500> but<00:02:06.190> one<00:02:06.370> of<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.550> main<00:02:06.700> reasons

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
out of there but one of the main reasons

why people use sawmills is for

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.010 
why people use sawmills is for
reclaiming<00:02:09.220> materials<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.210> through<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.570> pop<00:02:10.750> a

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
reclaiming materials so through to pop a

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.310 
reclaiming materials so through to pop a
bed<00:02:11.470> in<00:02:11.620> there<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:13.420> turn<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.840> output<00:02:14.200> off

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
bed in there and turn the output off

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.480 
bed in there and turn the output off
actually<00:02:16.260> there<00:02:17.260> we<00:02:17.350> go<00:02:17.530> they<00:02:17.950> broke<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.340> bed

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
actually there we go they broke the bed

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.860 
actually there we go they broke the bed
back<00:02:18.700> down<00:02:18.880> into<00:02:19.090> its<00:02:19.209> constituent<00:02:19.360> parts

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
back down into its constituent parts

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.270 
back down into its constituent parts
which<00:02:20.260> would<00:02:20.380> be<00:02:20.470> three<00:02:20.709> planets<00:02:21.130> in<00:02:21.220> the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
which would be three planets in the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.250 
which would be three planets in the
three<00:02:21.550> wolf<00:02:21.730> admittedly<00:02:22.630> it's<00:02:22.870> not<00:02:22.930> really

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
three wolf admittedly it's not really

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.660 
three wolf admittedly it's not really
all<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.380> useful<00:02:23.740> but<00:02:24.040> if<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.250> do<00:02:24.400> end<00:02:24.580> up

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
all that useful but if you do end up

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.910 
all that useful but if you do end up
with<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:24.850> few<00:02:25.270> spare<00:02:25.570> jukeboxes<00:02:26.170> it's<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.770> good

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
with a few spare jukeboxes it's a good

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.920 
with a few spare jukeboxes it's a good
way<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.100> recoup<00:02:27.640> some<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.910> your<00:02:28.090> diamonds

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
there we go now you can use the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.580 
there we go now you can use the
multimeter<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.450> right<00:02:34.750> click<00:02:34.900> on<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.260> see

multimeter to right click on it and see

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.070 
multimeter to right click on it and see
how<00:02:35.620> much<00:02:35.860> energy<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.430> stored<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.870> just

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
how much energy is stored and that just

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.600 
how much energy is stored and that just
