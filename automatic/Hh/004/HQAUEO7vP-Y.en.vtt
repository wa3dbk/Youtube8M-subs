00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:08.620

 when he knows what to do with the funds he can 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.390
 come the urge 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.740
 suddenly to make the telline cut 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.710
 best in the world 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.990
 yes you can manage to beat this 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.150
 record because often when 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.070
 you have someone to do with mushrooms 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.560
 you can think of making box cutters o 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.529
 the noodles they are always a bit in 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.960
 he laughs a little dry and then doesn't wear

 patience begin in making a 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.870
 sautÃ©ed carrot celery and onion e 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.530
 when it comes to copper-colored copper-gold not 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.730
 bronze c thrown broken mushrooms 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.860
 mainly stems chapels e 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.170
 put on the side is used two or three 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.750
 in this case but mainly changes and 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.790
 together a chip look at four 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.460
 change is a little chip and you do it 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.530
 then so a soup with some 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.210
 of water the fairies do not cook time 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.970
 that the potato becomes soft then 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.430
 pass everything together with garlic and 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.430
 of the analysis of the come a kind of 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.620
 passes its own vat of mushroom and there the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.650
 make out cook noodles 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.870
 and stand out in this past of 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.370
 Mushroom is just so you pull yourself 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.620
 you just heard it 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.900
 noodles the cutter to do 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.690
 a sort of annealing but the past 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.510
 together with the potato it will almost bite like 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.220
 a natural cream without the cream and for 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.670
 heaven's love makes sense and 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.100

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.250
 at this exalted shape you have taken one 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.479
 chapel to the most beautiful raw 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.780

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.320
 ture in the stands then invited 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.939

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.070
 obnoxious to which you want to give this
