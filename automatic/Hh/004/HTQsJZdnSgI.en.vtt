hey it said me again in this session
we're<00:00:07.880> going<00:00:08.000> to<00:00:08.059> learn<00:00:08.149> the<00:00:08.330> premier<00:00:08.809> stack

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
we're going to learn the premier stack

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.500 
we're going to learn the premier stack
in<00:00:09.410> Sport<00:00:09.679> Stacking<00:00:09.830> the<00:00:10.250> cycle<00:00:10.580> stack<00:00:10.820> it

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
in Sport Stacking the cycle stack it

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.480 
in Sport Stacking the cycle stack it
consists<00:00:11.840> of<00:00:11.930> three<00:00:12.230> parts<00:00:12.500> looks<00:00:13.130> like<00:00:13.280> this

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
consists of three parts looks like this

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.349 
consists of three parts looks like this
it's<00:00:14.030> going<00:00:14.120> to<00:00:14.180> be<00:00:14.269> a<00:00:14.300> three<00:00:15.039> six<00:00:16.039> three<00:00:16.369> up

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
it's going to be a three six three up

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:24.249 
it's going to be a three six three up
and<00:00:17.599> down<00:00:17.750> a<00:00:18.939> six<00:00:20.409> say<00:00:21.409> up<00:00:22.249> and<00:00:22.519> down<00:00:23.079> one<00:00:24.079> end

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
and down a six say up and down one end

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.419 
and down a six say up and down one end
with<00:00:24.470> a<00:00:24.499> one<00:00:24.800> ten<00:00:25.130> one<00:00:26.289> ending<00:00:27.289> in<00:00:27.529> a<00:00:27.980> three<00:00:28.189> six

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
with a one ten one ending in a three six

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:29.919 
with a one ten one ending in a three six
three<00:00:28.489> so<00:00:29.269> let's<00:00:29.419> learn<00:00:29.539> how<00:00:29.630> to<00:00:29.689> do<00:00:29.839> that

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
three so let's learn how to do that

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.419 
three so let's learn how to do that
cycle<00:00:30.319> stack<00:00:30.499> we're<00:00:30.679> going<00:00:30.800> to<00:00:30.859> start<00:00:31.130> with<00:00:31.399> a

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
cycle stack we're going to start with a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.370 
cycle stack we're going to start with a
three<00:00:31.849> six<00:00:32.270> three<00:00:32.390> we<00:00:32.780> already<00:00:33.050> know<00:00:33.170> how<00:00:33.350> to

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
three six three we already know how to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.190 
three six three we already know how to
do<00:00:33.620> this<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.160> we're<00:00:34.280> gonna<00:00:34.370> set<00:00:34.550> up<00:00:34.579> a<00:00:34.760> three

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
do this so we're gonna set up a three

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.020 
do this so we're gonna set up a three
six<00:00:36.200> using<00:00:36.530> that<00:00:36.680> three<00:00:37.100> two<00:00:37.430> one<00:00:37.640> method

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
six using that three two one method

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.740 
six using that three two one method
three<00:00:38.990> back<00:00:39.950> to<00:00:40.130> the<00:00:40.250> beginning<00:00:40.550> down<00:00:41.390> stack

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
three back to the beginning down stack

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.410 
three back to the beginning down stack
down<00:00:42.740> stack<00:00:43.130> now<00:00:43.310> I<00:00:43.340> want<00:00:43.460> you<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.640> freeze<00:00:44.000> this

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
down stack now I want you to freeze this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.210 
down stack now I want you to freeze this
is<00:00:44.540> going<00:00:44.660> to<00:00:44.720> be<00:00:44.780> our<00:00:44.870> first<00:00:45.170> transition

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
is going to be our first transition

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.520 
is going to be our first transition
we're<00:00:46.640> knees<00:00:46.760> one<00:00:47.120> hand<00:00:47.510> take<00:00:48.110> down<00:00:48.350> that

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
we're knees one hand take down that

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.160 
we're knees one hand take down that
three<00:00:48.860> bring<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:49.850> over<00:00:50.060> here<00:00:50.090> now<00:00:50.840> instead<00:00:50.990> of

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
three bring it over here now instead of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.720 
three bring it over here now instead of
putting<00:00:51.470> it<00:00:51.710> on<00:00:51.770> top<00:00:52.130> we're<00:00:52.460> going<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.610> go

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
putting it on top we're going to go

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.670 
putting it on top we're going to go
straight<00:00:53.030> into<00:00:53.270> a<00:00:53.420> three<00:00:53.720> to<00:00:53.900> one<00:00:53.930> method<00:00:54.500> so

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
straight into a three to one method so

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.260 
straight into a three to one method so
just<00:00:54.860> pick<00:00:54.980> up<00:00:55.010> two<00:00:55.340> cups<00:00:55.640> in<00:00:55.820> your<00:00:55.970> left<00:00:56.150> hand

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
just pick up two cups in your left hand

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.870 
just pick up two cups in your left hand
we're<00:00:56.960> gonna<00:00:57.050> go<00:00:57.170> right<00:00:57.410> left<00:00:58.100> right<00:00:58.370> left

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
we're gonna go right left right left

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.400 
we're gonna go right left right left
right<00:00:59.450> then<00:01:00.320> let's<00:01:00.500> stack<00:01:00.710> up<00:01:00.860> our<00:01:01.070> second<00:01:01.489> six

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
right then let's stack up our second six

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.469 
right then let's stack up our second six
let's<00:01:03.410> try<00:01:03.500> that<00:01:03.620> all<00:01:03.800> over<00:01:04.129> again<00:01:04.369> down<00:01:05.089> stack

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
let's try that all over again down stack

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.779 
let's try that all over again down stack
put<00:01:05.840> your<00:01:05.930> cups<00:01:06.170> like<00:01:06.409> mine<00:01:06.680> in<00:01:07.159> a<00:01:07.310> three<00:01:07.549> six

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
put your cups like mine in a three six

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.090 
put your cups like mine in a three six
three<00:01:07.850> stack<00:01:08.240> let's<00:01:08.450> try<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:08.780> again<00:01:09.100> stack

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
three stack let's try that again stack

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.010 
three stack let's try that again stack
up<00:01:10.249> our<00:01:10.399> first<00:01:10.640> three<00:01:11.560> six<00:01:12.560> three<00:01:13.780> back<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.960> the

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
up our first three six three back to the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.520 
up our first three six three back to the
beginning

three three two one up stack up stack
time<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.670> move<00:01:25.789> on<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.030> our<00:01:26.060> second<00:01:26.600> transition

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
time to move on to our second transition

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.230 
time to move on to our second transition
we're<00:01:27.710> actually<00:01:27.799> going<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.069> use<00:01:28.130> these<00:01:28.819> cups

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
we're actually going to use these cups

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.190 
we're actually going to use these cups
to<00:01:29.539> take<00:01:29.810> down<00:01:30.079> these<00:01:30.289> cups<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:31.429> slide<00:01:31.999> out<00:01:32.299> get

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
to take down these cups so slide out get

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.559 
to take down these cups so slide out get
two<00:01:33.499> stacks<00:01:33.889> of<00:01:34.130> three<00:01:34.159> now<00:01:34.909> just<00:01:35.209> like<00:01:35.359> if<00:01:35.479> you

for<00:02:17.109> you<00:02:17.260> we're<00:02:17.409> going<00:02:17.499> to<00:02:17.560> practice<00:02:17.769> a<00:02:18.069> couple

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
for you we're going to practice a couple

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.190 
for you we're going to practice a couple
things<00:02:18.489> here<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:19.599> first<00:02:19.629> thing<00:02:19.930> we<00:02:20.049> need<00:02:20.170> to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
things here the first thing we need to

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.379 
things here the first thing we need to
do<00:02:20.409> is<00:02:20.590> pick<00:02:20.799> up<00:02:20.859> one<00:02:21.010> cup<00:02:21.459> in<00:02:21.700> either<00:02:22.060> hand

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:22.389 
do is pick up one cup in either hand

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.690 
do is pick up one cup in either hand
right<00:02:23.200> now<00:02:23.230> we're<00:02:23.469> going<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.620> turn<00:02:24.010> one<00:02:24.430> cup

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
right now we're going to turn one cup

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.660 
right now we're going to turn one cup
upside<00:02:25.269> down<00:02:25.599> now<00:02:26.139> most<00:02:26.469> right-handers<00:02:27.340> will

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
upside down now most right-handers will

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.910 
upside down now most right-handers will
turn<00:02:27.909> their<00:02:28.120> right<00:02:28.450> hand<00:02:28.810> inward<00:02:29.109> most

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
turn their right hand inward most

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.789 
turn their right hand inward most
left-handers<00:02:30.609> turn<00:02:30.849> their<00:02:31.000> left<00:02:31.269> hand<00:02:31.569> inward

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
left-handers turn their left hand inward

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.020 
left-handers turn their left hand inward
really<00:02:32.799> doesn't<00:02:33.099> matter<00:02:33.310> whatever<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.909> most

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
really doesn't matter whatever is most

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.000 
really doesn't matter whatever is most
comfortable<00:02:34.299> for<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.500> I'm<00:02:35.650> going<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:35.829> set

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
comfortable for you so I'm going to set

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.640 
comfortable for you so I'm going to set
my<00:02:36.159> right<00:02:36.400> hand<00:02:36.700> upside<00:02:37.540> down<00:02:37.780> just<00:02:38.290> like<00:02:38.469> this

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
my right hand upside down just like this

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.640 
my right hand upside down just like this
now<00:02:39.489> practice<00:02:40.120> picking<00:02:40.359> up<00:02:40.659> the<00:02:40.959> exact<00:02:41.379> same

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
now practice picking up the exact same

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.440 
now practice picking up the exact same
way<00:02:41.889> we<00:02:42.040> set<00:02:42.249> it<00:02:42.280> down<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:43.120> we're<00:02:43.209> just<00:02:43.239> going

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
way we set it down so we're just going

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.119 
way we set it down so we're just going
to<00:02:43.480> pick<00:02:43.719> these<00:02:43.840> cups<00:02:44.109> up<00:02:44.290> put<00:02:44.919> them<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.040> the
