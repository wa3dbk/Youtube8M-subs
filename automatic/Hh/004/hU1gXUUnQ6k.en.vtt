knees<00:00:18.330> come<00:00:18.539> off<00:00:18.690> as<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> hood<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:20.510> then<00:00:21.510> that

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
knees come off as a hood and then that

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.349 
knees come off as a hood and then that
finger<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.470> put<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.340> fun<00:00:23.640> grill<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.910> need<00:00:24.210> to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
finger and put this fun grill I need to

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.000 
finger and put this fun grill I need to
take<00:00:24.689> off<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:24.930> Bend<00:00:25.740> back<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> basically<00:00:28.010> most

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
take off and Bend back so basically most

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.700 
take off and Bend back so basically most
of<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.699> guess<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.689> believe<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.140> fender<00:00:31.590> an

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
of this I guess I believe that fender an

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.200 
of this I guess I believe that fender an
inner<00:00:31.859> fender<00:00:32.219> own<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.790> it'd<00:00:32.880> probably<00:00:32.910> start

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
inner fender own but it'd probably start

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.870 
inner fender own but it'd probably start
bending<00:00:34.140> kind<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.590> fun<00:00:34.739> yet<00:00:34.950> because<00:00:35.640> once<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
bending kind of fun yet because once you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.250 
bending kind of fun yet because once you
take<00:00:36.000> off<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> grill<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.809> what<00:00:36.930> supports

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
take off the grill this is what supports

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.510 
take off the grill this is what supports
the<00:00:37.500> front<00:00:37.710> part<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.840> but<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.460> mean<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the front part of it but I mean you

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.970 
the front part of it but I mean you
start<00:00:41.730> doing<00:00:41.790> some<00:00:42.030> work<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.300> side<00:00:42.980> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
start doing some work on the side you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.850 
start doing some work on the side you
need<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.190> get<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.460> done<00:00:45.469> hopefully<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.559> save

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
need to get it done hopefully I can save

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.270 
need to get it done hopefully I can save
this<00:00:47.270> core<00:00:48.270> support<00:00:48.690> i'm<00:00:48.780> not<00:00:48.960> sure<00:00:49.350> i<00:00:49.649> think<00:00:50.190> i

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
this core support i'm not sure i think i

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.810 
this core support i'm not sure i think i
can<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.090> rebend<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.730> got<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
can I think they just rebend it I got to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.279 
can I think they just rebend it I got to
cut<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> frame<00:00:54.270> right<00:00:54.570> there<00:00:55.280> no<00:00:56.960> I'll<00:00:57.960> start

got a replacement for so I don't care

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.200

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
about the cat is attacking my truck are

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:21.630 
about the cat is attacking my truck are
you<00:02:13.330> doing<00:02:13.600> kidding<00:02:14.310> are<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.460> doing<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:20.640> got

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
you doing kidding are you doing I got

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.360 
you doing kidding are you doing I got
that<00:02:21.850> bolt<00:02:22.090> out<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.630> got<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.620> bolts<00:02:23.890> holding<00:02:24.160> on

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
that bolt out I got the bolts holding on

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.550 
that bolt out I got the bolts holding on
to<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:26.340> now<00:02:27.340> there<00:02:27.610> should<00:02:27.640> be<00:02:28.350> some<00:02:29.350> type<00:02:29.530> of

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
to that now there should be some type of

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.580 
to that now there should be some type of
fastener<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.490> think<00:02:30.880> that's<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.240> leather<00:02:31.590> that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
fastener I think that's it leather that

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.610 
fastener I think that's it leather that
piece<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.950> rubber<00:02:33.130> with<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.460> bolts<00:02:33.730> are

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
piece of rubber with the bolts are

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.900 
piece of rubber with the bolts are
holding<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.770> onto<00:02:36.130> here<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.700> might

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
holding that onto here and I might

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.460 
holding that onto here and I might
consider<00:02:37.030> there's<00:02:37.570> just<00:02:37.870> one<00:02:38.050> bolt<00:02:38.230> hole

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
consider there's just one bolt hole

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.800 
consider there's just one bolt hole
there<00:02:38.620> exactly<00:02:38.950> over<00:02:39.400> there<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.240> right<00:02:40.630> then

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
there exactly over there this right then

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.680 
there exactly over there this right then
you<00:02:40.959> take<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.320> off<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.970> isn't<00:02:43.300> glued<00:02:43.480> so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
you take that off this isn't glued so

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.150 
you take that off this isn't glued so
that's<00:02:43.870> probably<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.320> piece<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.800> rubber<00:02:44.950> the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
that's probably the piece of rubber the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.550 
that's probably the piece of rubber the
only<00:02:45.310> thing<00:02:45.490> hold<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.820> oh<00:02:45.910> my<00:02:46.120> gosh<00:02:48.990> alright<00:02:49.990> as

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
only thing hold it oh my gosh alright as

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.110 
only thing hold it oh my gosh alright as
you<00:02:50.590> see<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.100> both<00:02:51.340> actually<00:02:51.820> pulled

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
you see that both actually pulled

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.210 
you see that both actually pulled
through<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.900> got<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> fender<00:02:53.800> off<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.100> was

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
through I got the fender off I was

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.370 
through I got the fender off I was

loosened outside of this and lift this
up<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:57.270> probably<00:02:58.270> take<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.630> off<00:02:58.870> see<00:02:59.230> if<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.350> can

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.949 
up I probably take this off see if I can
fix<00:02:59.709> it<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:01.150> looks<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.390> lot<00:03:01.480> better<00:03:01.690> another
