as far as picking your jalapenos I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.850 
as far as picking your jalapenos I
prefer<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.890> use<00:01:46.920> shears<00:01:48.500> instead<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.619> picking

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860

it<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.280> from<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> plant<00:01:50.939> because<00:01:51.180> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it right from the plant because that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.719 
it right from the plant because that
could<00:01:51.509> damage<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.049> plant<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.549> want

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
could damage the plant so what you want

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.920 
could damage the plant so what you want
to<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> plate<00:01:55.070> bowl

without damaging them because once they
are<00:02:35.030> damaged<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:36.170> hard<00:02:36.470> for<00:02:36.620> jalapenos<00:02:37.250> to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.420 
are damaged it's hard for jalapenos to
grow<00:02:37.610> back<00:02:37.820> in<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.209> area<00:02:38.920> continue<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.040> do<00:02:40.220> it

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
grow back in that area continue to do it

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.310
