00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hello, I want to share everything with you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:12.290
 recipe for your homemade brandy 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.290
 or rather like the likeness of brandy 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:23.090
 ingredients that are needed for this 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:26.550
 dice cylinder fortress 85 90 degrees 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.119
 triple distillation well three-stage 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.649
 cleaning system I mean now this one 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.850
 the same alcohol that we buy at the pharmacy for 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.750
 except iodine 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.980
 content required ingredients in 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.980
 bay leaf clove 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.500
 vanillin and peppercorns and oak bark 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:59.370
 Well, the essence is that the year dice cylinder has 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:02.910
 Fortress approximately 87 dash 90 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.390
 degrees 90 degrees with an error 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:12.020
 alcoholometer and with our error 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.320
 thermometer and so we have water 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.770
 filtered through a carbon filter and 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:24.810
 landing all the difficulty lies in 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:29.520
 what we need to pour heals in water they 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.500
 water where zilla to achieve content 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.500
 alcohol order 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.220
 45-50 degrees now I will try it 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.220
 to make 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.240
 carnation 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.799
 carnations 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:09.600
 cheats need 4 points in the head such 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.190
 serious bay leaf him too need 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:19.800
 either two big 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:24.440
 either four little peppers like here 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.440
 all small so I threw 4 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.630
 vanillin vanillin on the tip of the knife but so 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:45.130
 how here vanillin I already used it 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.760
 so here just stayed on 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.760
 knife tip 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:58.080
 mint mint optional ingredient 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:04.170
 the day you, too, just a little bit well here at 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:08.280
 roughly speaking two liters 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:17.020
 intuitively that's about even less 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:19.990
 about that much now itâ€™s ours 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.280
 liquid is put in a warm place by 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.970
 watered cover naturally put 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:32.830
 in a warm place for two days 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.240
 but before use you just need 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.340
 to soften 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.870
 here pour about half a tea 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.030
 spoons of sugar 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.910
 all this mix and filter 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:51.010
 seven minutes have passed and can be seen as dice 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:56.850
 the cylinder changed color after 3 7 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.850
 days the color will be cognac
