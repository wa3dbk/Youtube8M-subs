00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.040 
well known in my own foundation at home
always

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
always

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.440 
always
different<00:01:53.560> colors<00:01:53.830> yeah<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.610> mean<00:01:54.760> it<00:01:55.000> changes

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
different colors yeah I mean it changes

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.140 
different colors yeah I mean it changes
with<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.720> Sun<00:01:55.930> as<00:01:56.110> well<00:01:56.290> quite<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.560> lot<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.160> yeah

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
with the Sun as well quite a lot so yeah

with the Sun as well quite a lot so yeah
so<00:01:58.360> it's<00:01:58.690> probably<00:01:58.960> worth<00:01:59.290> investing<00:01:59.860> in<00:02:00.160> a

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
so it's probably worth investing in a

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.040 
so it's probably worth investing in a
couple<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:00.970> different<00:02:01.270> shades<00:02:01.510> that<00:02:01.750> you<00:02:01.900> can

couple of different shades that you can
blend<00:02:02.230> together<00:02:02.470> depending<00:02:03.460> on<00:02:03.820> where<00:02:04.330> you

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
blend together depending on where you

into that sheer base okay that that

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.970 
into that sheer base okay that that
gives<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.580> you<00:03:56.360> can<00:03:56.510> actually<00:03:56.840> change<00:03:57.590> the
