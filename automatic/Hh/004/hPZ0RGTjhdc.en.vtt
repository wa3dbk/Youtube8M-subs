starting I know is that looking at some
reference<00:00:12.750> knowing<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.500> there<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:14.460> core

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
reference knowing that there is a core

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.510 
reference knowing that there is a core
inside<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> surface<00:00:17.570> it<00:00:18.570> has<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:19.520> translucent

transform<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.630> then<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.109> go<00:00:22.560> through<00:00:23.090> and<00:00:24.090> a

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
transform and then I go through and a

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.269 
transform and then I go through and a
same<00:00:24.990> effect<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.380> happens<00:00:25.830> when<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.039> put<00:00:26.250> a

there when you create a - no

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.420 
there when you create a - no
and<00:01:51.910> I<00:01:52.000> start<00:01:52.330> with<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.710> even<00:01:53.710> dark<00:01:53.950> part<00:01:54.310> of

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
and I start with the even dark part of

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.650 
and I start with the even dark part of
this<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.890> me<00:01:56.920> it's<00:01:57.220> better<00:01:57.370> to<00:01:57.490> always<00:01:58.120> walk

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
this for me it's better to always walk

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.470 
this for me it's better to always walk
like<00:01:58.930> that<00:01:58.960> do<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:01.380> dual<00:02:02.380> layer<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:04.150> dark

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
like that do the dual layer the dark

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.290 
like that do the dual layer the dark
stuff<00:02:04.840> first<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:06.340> then<00:02:06.550> with<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:06.850> light<00:02:07.060> you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
stuff first and then with the light you

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.430 
stuff first and then with the light you
can<00:02:07.420> start<00:02:07.950> changing<00:02:08.950> things<00:02:10.320> so<00:02:13.230> right<00:02:14.230> up

that's<00:04:18.250> possible<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.480> I<00:04:19.600> just<00:04:19.810> push<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:21.220> calls

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
that's possible so I just push the calls

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.250 
that's possible so I just push the calls
and<00:04:22.090> values<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:23.110> make<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.680> even<00:04:23.980> disappear<00:04:25.260> and

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260
