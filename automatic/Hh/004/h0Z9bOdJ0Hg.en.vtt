00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
hands so if you want to do that and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.930 
hands so if you want to do that and
actually<00:00:47.760> wrap<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.450> around<00:00:49.129> your<00:00:50.129> wrist<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
actually wrap it around your wrist to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.880 
actually wrap it around your wrist to
for<00:00:51.239> extra<00:00:51.600> security<00:00:51.780> then<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> can

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
for extra security then you can

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.310 
for extra security then you can
absolutely<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.930> she<00:00:55.140> does

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
absolutely do that and then all she does

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.250 
absolutely do that and then all she does
is<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.670> could<00:00:57.090> let<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:58.079> could

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
is actually so I could let go you could

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.560 
is actually so I could let go you could
have<00:00:58.410> gone<00:00:58.559> yeah<00:00:58.829> maybe<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.850> god<00:01:00.180> absolutely

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
have gone yeah maybe that god absolutely

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.869 
have gone yeah maybe that god absolutely
now<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.680> she<00:01:01.829> doesn't<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.670> don't

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
now if she doesn't want it and I don't

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.340 
now if she doesn't want it and I don't
think<00:01:03.059> Lindsey<00:01:03.449> would<00:01:03.570> let<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.960> let<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.140> go

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
think Lindsey would let it let it go

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
think Lindsey would let it let it go
anyway<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.460> add<00:01:05.640> an<00:01:05.909> absolute

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
anyway because you can add an absolute

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.450 
anyway because you can add an absolute
pop<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> out<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.560> don't<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:07.979> another

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
pop it out so you don't have another

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
pop it out so you don't have another
thing<00:01:08.670> dangling<00:01:09.060> from<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> most

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
thing dangling from it to that the most

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.859 
thing dangling from it to that the most
important<00:01:11.310> thing<00:01:11.520> when<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.150> slide<00:01:12.479> your<00:01:12.659> hand

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
important thing when you slide your hand

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.690 
important thing when you slide your hand
you're<00:01:13.020> shooting<00:01:13.350> shooting<00:01:13.619> shooting<00:01:13.700> before

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
you're shooting shooting shooting before

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.429 
you're shooting shooting shooting before
you<00:01:14.820> put<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> holster<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.020> so

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you put it in the holster and so

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.219 
you put it in the holster and so
chocolate<00:01:16.950> from<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
chocolate from the

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.499 
chocolate from the
and<00:01:18.560> then<00:01:18.799> it's<00:01:19.219> much<00:01:19.430> easier<00:01:19.909> to<00:01:19.939> take<00:01:20.360> it

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
and then it's much easier to take it

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.399 
and then it's much easier to take it
down<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:20.869> out<00:01:20.990> yeah<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.770> don't<00:01:22.039> have<00:01:22.159> to<00:01:23.409> hand

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
down and out yeah you don't have to hand
