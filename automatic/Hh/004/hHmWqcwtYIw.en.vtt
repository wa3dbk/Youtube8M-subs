00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
I still want to see a fight between the

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.400 
I still want to see a fight between the
two<00:04:07.540> but<00:04:07.690> that's<00:04:07.840> just<00:04:07.930> because<00:04:08.079> I'm<00:04:08.320> an

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
two but that's just because I'm an

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.170 
two but that's just because I'm an
action<00:04:08.799> fan<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.430> think<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:09.700> action<00:04:10.000> in<00:04:10.090> the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
action fan and I think the action in the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.420 
action fan and I think the action in the
series<00:04:10.480> is<00:04:10.600> actually<00:04:10.900> really<00:04:11.049> cool<00:04:11.170> but<00:04:12.160> the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
series is actually really cool but the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.640 
series is actually really cool but the
fact<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.820> pito<00:04:13.720> might<00:04:14.019> be<00:04:14.170> actually<00:04:14.320> two

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
fact that pito might be actually two

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.430 
fact that pito might be actually two

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.529 
shonen jump series so I just maybe I
just<00:04:32.340> sort<00:04:32.789> of<00:04:32.849> expect<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.360> but<00:04:33.479> again

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
just sort of expect that but again

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.809 
just sort of expect that but again
that's<00:04:34.440> why<00:04:34.770> this<00:04:34.830> series<00:04:35.280> sort<00:04:35.490> of<00:04:35.550> breaks

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
that's why this series sort of breaks

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.490 
that's why this series sort of breaks
away<00:04:36.000> from<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.449> the<00:04:36.720> tradition<00:04:37.169> of<00:04:37.259> the<00:04:37.380> other

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.260 
away from the the tradition of the other
stuff<00:04:37.770> if<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.310> only<00:04:38.400> had<00:04:38.550> one<00:04:38.669> negative<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.150> say

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270

about<00:04:39.300> this<00:04:39.539> episode<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:39.990> would<00:04:40.229> say<00:04:40.349> maybe<00:04:40.380> the

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
about this episode I would say maybe the

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.409 
about this episode I would say maybe the
first<00:04:41.250> half<00:04:41.460> of<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.610> episode<00:04:41.940> was<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.090> little

first half of the episode was a little

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.029

slow<00:04:42.720> because<00:04:42.960> they<00:04:43.080> showed<00:04:43.319> a<00:04:43.349> lot<00:04:43.710> of<00:04:43.740> stuff

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
slow because they showed a lot of stuff

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.520 
slow because they showed a lot of stuff

until<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.000> saw<00:05:24.240> this<00:05:24.419> version<00:05:24.810> of<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:25.250> you

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
until I saw this version of it and you

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.850 
until I saw this version of it and you
know<00:05:26.280> it<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:27.240> whole<00:05:27.270> change<00:05:28.139> that<00:05:28.409> gone<00:05:28.590> has

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
know it the whole change that gone has

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.990 
know it the whole change that gone has
gone<00:05:29.070> through<00:05:29.310> since<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.669> very<00:05:29.789> first

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
gone through since the very first

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.810 
gone through since the very first
episode<00:05:30.270> two<00:05:30.720> now<00:05:30.750> is<00:05:31.229> incredibly<00:05:31.820> drastic

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
episode two now is incredibly drastic

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.180 
episode two now is incredibly drastic
and<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.300> think<00:05:33.570> really<00:05:34.169> shows<00:05:34.440> why<00:05:34.680> this<00:05:34.740> is<00:05:35.009> one

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
and I think really shows why this is one

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.670 
and I think really shows why this is one
