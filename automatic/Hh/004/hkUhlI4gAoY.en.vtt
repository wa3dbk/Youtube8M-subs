open up coconuts there is a theory of

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.190 
open up coconuts there is a theory of
dietary<00:00:20.580> appropriateness<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.810> says<00:00:21.990> that

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
dietary appropriateness that says that

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.670 
dietary appropriateness that says that
if<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.529> can't<00:00:23.010> access<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.240> food<00:00:25.170> easily

if you can't access a food easily
without<00:00:26.250> tools<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:27.000> probably<00:00:27.300> not

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
without tools it's probably not

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.050 
without tools it's probably not
appropriate<00:00:27.540> for<00:00:28.110> human<00:00:28.619> consumption

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
appropriate for human consumption

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.670 
appropriate for human consumption
whatever<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.630> about<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.990> idea<00:00:31.200> it's

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
whatever you think about this idea it's

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.680 
whatever you think about this idea it's
interesting<00:00:31.950> that<00:00:32.279> people<00:00:32.520> usually<00:00:33.059> put

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
interesting that people usually put

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.810 
interesting that people usually put
coconuts<00:00:34.379> or<00:00:34.559> silly<00:00:35.129> some<00:00:35.430> people<00:00:35.730> put

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
coconuts in this category because they

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.049 
coconuts in this category because they
think<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.650> need<00:00:37.830> a<00:00:37.860> machete<00:00:38.250> or<00:00:38.400> other<00:00:38.699> tool

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
to access them it's actually not that

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.790 
to access them it's actually not that
hard<00:00:41.489> today<00:00:42.449> I'm<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.720> to<00:00:42.809> show<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.050> how<00:00:43.739> you

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
hard today I'm going to show you how you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.210 
hard today I'm going to show you how you

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
can just smash open a coconut and our

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.039 
can just smash open a coconut and our
early<00:00:47.670> human<00:00:48.000> ancestors<00:00:48.659> would<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:48.900> been

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
early human ancestors would have been

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.439 
early human ancestors would have been
able<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.290> do<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.949> as<00:00:50.100> easily<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.239> just

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
able to do this just as easily so I just

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.410 
able to do this just as easily so I just
pick<00:00:51.659> this<00:00:51.809> coconut<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.400> can<00:00:53.729> hit<00:00:54.180> this

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
pick this coconut and you can hit this

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.710 
pick this coconut and you can hit this
coconut<00:00:54.690> against<00:00:55.110> any<00:00:55.470> drunk<00:00:56.400> that's<00:00:56.610> hard<00:00:56.970> or

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
coconut against any drunk that's hard or

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.189 
coconut against any drunk that's hard or
any<00:00:58.019> rock<00:00:58.409> it's<00:00:58.769> actually<00:00:59.070> pretty<00:00:59.280> easy

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
any rock it's actually pretty easy

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.890 
any rock it's actually pretty easy
ideally<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.680> want<00:01:01.860> to<00:01:01.949> hit<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.220> two<00:01:02.790> sides

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
ideally you want to hit it on two sides

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.649 
ideally you want to hit it on two sides
crack<00:01:03.900> it<00:01:04.080> open<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.379> two<00:01:04.769> sides<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.940> one<00:01:06.390> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
crack it open on two sides and one of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:17.030 
crack it open on two sides and one of
those<00:01:06.840> will<00:01:07.049> start<00:01:07.290> squirting<00:01:07.560> water<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
those will start squirting water so you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:36.860 
those will start squirting water so you
can<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:18.890> it's<00:01:19.890> really<00:01:20.130> easy<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.910> I<00:01:35.910> just<00:01:36.540> open

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
can see it's really easy so I just open

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.260 
can see it's really easy so I just open
that<00:01:36.900> up<00:01:37.050> I<00:01:37.440> oh<00:01:37.980> just<00:01:38.370> open<00:01:38.580> up<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.760> really<00:01:39.030> young

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270

coconut which doesn't have a huge husk

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.790 
coconut which doesn't have a huge husk
on<00:01:41.730> and<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.120> relatively<00:01:42.630> small<00:01:42.960> those<00:01:43.590> are

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
on and it's relatively small those are

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.190 
on and it's relatively small those are
by<00:01:43.890> far<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> easiest<00:01:44.460> ones<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.090> open<00:01:45.300> up<00:01:45.420> but

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
by far the easiest ones to open up but

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.740 
by far the easiest ones to open up but
you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.800> as<00:01:46.980> easily<00:01:47.210> open<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.480> large

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
the coconut the husk enough times to

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.399 
the coconut the husk enough times to
just<00:01:55.740> pulverize<00:01:56.370> it<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:57.150> knock<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.570> off<00:01:57.690> then

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
just pulverize it and knock it off then

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.580 
just pulverize it and knock it off then
the<00:01:58.650> inside<00:01:59.280> area

then<00:02:00.770> it<00:02:01.609> open<00:02:01.909> until<00:02:02.179> it<00:02:02.299> starts<00:02:02.570> cracking

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
then it open until it starts cracking

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.039 
then it open until it starts cracking
and<00:02:03.740> one<00:02:04.130> or<00:02:04.250> two<00:02:04.399> good<00:02:04.640> whacks<00:02:04.909> that's<00:02:05.600> all<00:02:05.869> it

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
and one or two good whacks that's all it

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.749 
and one or two good whacks that's all it
takes<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.380> open<00:02:06.530> I'm<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.770> coconut<00:02:07.280> without<00:02:07.429> any

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
takes to open I'm a coconut without any

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.729 
takes to open I'm a coconut without any
tools<00:02:08.060> it's<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:09.050> little<00:02:09.319> bit<00:02:09.440> messy<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:11.170> if<00:02:12.170> it's

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
tools it's a little bit messy it if it's

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.530 
tools it's a little bit messy it if it's
not<00:02:13.040> as<00:02:13.220> clean<00:02:13.640> as<00:02:13.879> copening<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.420> with<00:02:14.510> a

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
not as clean as copening it with a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.690 
not as clean as copening it with a
machete<00:02:14.870> but<00:02:15.140> obviously<00:02:16.069> our<00:02:16.160> early

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
machete but obviously our early

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.280 
machete but obviously our early
ancestors<00:02:17.030> would<00:02:17.480> have<00:02:17.599> been<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:17.930> Vikki<00:02:18.170> and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
ancestors would have been so Vikki and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.339 
ancestors would have been so Vikki and
it's<00:02:18.500> easy<00:02:18.769> enough<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.069> do<00:02:22.900> here's<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.959> coconut

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
it's easy enough to do here's a coconut
