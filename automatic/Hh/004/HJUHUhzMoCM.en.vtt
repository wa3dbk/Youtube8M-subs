00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.640 
that and now he has a third mode it's a
jackhammer<00:02:40.120> mode<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:41.110> think<00:02:41.140> that's<00:02:41.440> what<00:02:41.530> they

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
jackhammer mode I think that's what they

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.420 
jackhammer mode I think that's what they
call<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:43.320> it's<00:02:44.320> pretty<00:02:44.560> much<00:02:44.709> this<00:02:44.980> it's<00:02:45.220> not

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:14.689 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:16.779 

head<00:06:15.169> articulation<00:06:15.860> he<00:06:15.979> can<00:06:16.129> look<00:06:16.279> up<00:06:16.550> and

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
head articulation he can look up and

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.369 
head articulation he can look up and
down<00:06:17.029> but<00:06:17.330> he<00:06:17.449> can't<00:06:17.659> look<00:06:17.779> back<00:06:18.020> and<00:06:18.169> forth

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:18.379

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.279 
down but he can't look back and forth
legs<00:06:19.059> because<00:06:20.059> they're<00:06:20.210> spring-loaded<00:06:20.569> kind

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
legs because they're spring-loaded kind

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.510 
legs because they're spring-loaded kind
of<00:06:23.020> not<00:06:24.020> a<00:06:24.050> whole<00:06:24.229> lot<00:06:24.379> of<00:06:24.409> articulation<00:06:25.189> and

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
of not a whole lot of articulation and

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.279 
of not a whole lot of articulation and
if<00:06:25.909> you<00:06:25.999> move<00:06:26.149> one<00:06:26.389> leg<00:06:26.599> it<00:06:26.960> moves<00:06:27.139> the<00:06:27.259> other

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
if you move one leg it moves the other

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:33.159 
if you move one leg it moves the other
so<00:06:29.169> they<00:06:30.169> can<00:06:30.319> go<00:06:30.409> out<00:06:30.439> like<00:06:30.830> that<00:06:30.860> so<00:06:32.139> school<00:06:33.139> I

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
so they can go out like that so school I

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:34.899
