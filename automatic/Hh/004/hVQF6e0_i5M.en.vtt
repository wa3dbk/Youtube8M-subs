00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 you have to dig up old photos for 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.799
 find trace of a Toulouse stadium 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.140
 defeated three times in a league 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.480
 the victory against clermont is so 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.880
 imperative not to see this 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.929
 ten-year- old ghost decimated in 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.340
 first line the Toulouse 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.750
 get their first 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.090
 penalty on a closed scrum 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.869
 dominatrix kick of toby flood 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.580
 and 30 after five minutes of play the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.109
 possession and occupation are then 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 auvergnate but the jaunards do not 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.539
 concretizes copy 6 everywhere at the break 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.219
 after this camille penalty lopez in 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.960
 second period clermont who stays on 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.000
 a triumph in front of the racing takes the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.590
 things in hand game offshore game close up 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.200
 and in the middle of this pack of players 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.430
 Julian Bardy who flattens despite a 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.640
 video that do not provide any help 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.399
 the referee and sure to pay him 13 6 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.870
 after transformation 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.399
 Toulouse replies but breaks 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.329
 on a yellow wall we play the last 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.250
 seconds 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.469
 symbol of an incredible renunciation 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.050
 Dusautoir told to take the fleet 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.940
 penalty synonymous with defensive bonus 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.949
 rather than trying to equalize in 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.540
 scoring a third defeat test of 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.580
 checks for toulouse for the first 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.130
 times since 2004 and first victory 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.530
 history of clermont in ernest wallon 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.760
 we won in Toulouse but the hardest 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.890
 remains to do the road is still long 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.869
 we also know that this great team 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.580
 will be on one of the last ones so I 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.049
 do not worry about them as well 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.450
 for their collective than for the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.740
 individuals who compose it so we are at 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.090
 we are happy we are satisfied with 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.460
 the state of mind tonight a well of 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.600
 especially bottom of this result that goes 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.479
 well you will love my shroud 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.439
 rochelle and yet another challenge in 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.600
 taking more often says so that's true 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.570
 it's not easy because our audience 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.950
 we put it to envy we put what we 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.970
 could the montferrandais were 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.050
 better and maybe they've been 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.270
 more than inefficient and concretized 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.670
 they concretized our highlights finally 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.100
 we fought in the battle and we 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.950
 could never cross this defense 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.440
 so here is a lot of positive 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.670
 but it's true that this defeat we 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.590
 hurts it's a third in a row 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.700
 so it's true that will have to get 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.200
 quickly question 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.110
 here we were on a team 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.730
 very aggressively defensively 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.740
 those who have a little dictated the pace of 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.790
 match with a bit of a false rhythm and we 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.980
 did not manage to adapt so 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.970
 congratulations to them but we will not 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.970
 let go in my possession to work
