hello everyone my name is grant and I
just<00:00:03.210> bought<00:00:03.389> this<00:00:03.600> thing

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
just bought this thing

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.320 
just bought this thing
it<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.890> replacement<00:00:05.460> battery<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.000> charging

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
it is a replacement battery and charging

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.110 
it is a replacement battery and charging
base<00:00:06.629> for<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.379> 3ds<00:00:07.740> adds<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.700> little<00:00:08.910> bit<00:00:09.030> of

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
base for the 3ds adds a little bit of

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.000 
base for the 3ds adds a little bit of
bulk<00:00:09.360> but<00:00:09.660> apparently<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.170> gets<00:00:10.290> rid<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.620> the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
bulk but apparently it gets rid of the

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.789 
bulk but apparently it gets rid of the
terrible<00:00:11.370> terrible<00:00:11.730> battery<00:00:12.150> problems<00:00:12.799> that

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
terrible terrible battery problems that

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.440 
terrible terrible battery problems that
we<00:00:13.889> are<00:00:14.070> all<00:00:14.190> experiencing<00:00:14.820> those<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.210> us<00:00:15.299> who

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
we are all experiencing those of us who

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.500 
we are all experiencing those of us who
have<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> 3ds<00:00:16.670> 3<00:00:17.670> s's<00:00:17.820> battery<00:00:18.240> life<00:00:18.359> is

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
have a 3ds 3 s's battery life is

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.000 
have a 3ds 3 s's battery life is
absolutely<00:00:19.080> terrible<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.619> would<00:00:19.740> say<00:00:19.890> it's

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
absolutely terrible I would say it's

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.920 
absolutely terrible I would say it's
probably<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.279> worst<00:00:20.460> battery<00:00:20.820> life<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.720> any

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
probably the worst battery life of any

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.320 
probably the worst battery life of any
device<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.890> bought<00:00:23.070> any<00:00:23.880> gadget

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
device that I have bought any gadget

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.700 
device that I have bought any gadget
it's<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.660> terrible<00:00:24.960> two<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> half<00:00:25.410> hours

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
it's just terrible two and a half hours

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.189 
it's just terrible two and a half hours
and<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:25.949> gone<00:00:26.150> some<00:00:27.150> people<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.990> know<00:00:28.019> we're

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
and it's gone some people you know we're

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.630 
and it's gone some people you know we're
saying<00:00:28.410> don't<00:00:28.650> whine<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.460> bad

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
saying don't whine it's not that bad

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.519 
saying don't whine it's not that bad
well<00:00:30.000> if<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.330> are<00:00:30.420> trying<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.750> travel<00:00:31.109> at<00:00:31.349> all

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
well if you are trying to travel at all

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.340 
well if you are trying to travel at all
and<00:00:31.859> actually<00:00:32.070> use<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.520> 3d<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.630> 3ds<00:00:33.960> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and actually use the 3d on the 3ds it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.799 
and actually use the 3d on the 3ds it
will<00:00:34.530> go<00:00:34.680> away<00:00:34.829> quickly<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> figured<00:00:36.719> I'd

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
will go away quickly so I figured I'd

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.610 
will go away quickly so I figured I'd
try<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.219> might<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.370> worth<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.530> quarter<00:00:40.530> of

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
try this might be worth the quarter of

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.080 
try this might be worth the quarter of
an<00:00:40.680> inch<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.340> might<00:00:41.460> add<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
an inch or so that it might add to the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.330 
an inch or so that it might add to the
device<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.629> let's<00:00:43.170> see<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.680> thought<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.160> would

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
device so let's see I thought I would

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.770 
device so let's see I thought I would
make<00:00:44.489> an<00:00:44.640> unboxing<00:00:44.969> video<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.570> actually

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
make an unboxing video and actually

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
make an unboxing video and actually
install<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> thing<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.160> can't<00:00:47.399> really<00:00:47.460> find

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
install the thing you can't really find

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.229 
install the thing you can't really find
it<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.840> easily<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.460> retailers<00:00:50.460> yet<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.850> got<00:00:51.090> it

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
it as easily at retailers yet I got it

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.709 
it as easily at retailers yet I got it
from<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.449> guy<00:00:51.600> off<00:00:51.750> eBay<00:00:52.250> looks<00:00:53.250> new<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> let's

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
from a guy off eBay looks new so let's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.420 
from a guy off eBay looks new so let's
get<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.930> thing<00:00:54.989> open

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.819 

there<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.699> here<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.379> this<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.680> new

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
there we go here it is this is the new

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.539 
there we go here it is this is the new
dock<00:01:02.870> this<00:01:03.870> will<00:01:04.080> replace<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.890> current<00:01:05.280> 3d

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
dock this will replace the current 3d

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.560 
dock this will replace the current 3d
dock<00:01:06.740> feel<00:01:07.740> solid<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.460> shiny<00:01:08.820> plastic<00:01:09.090> it's

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
dock feel solid it's shiny plastic it's

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.510 
dock feel solid it's shiny plastic it's
got<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> button<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> side<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.280> guess

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
got a button here on the side I guess

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.140 
got a button here on the side I guess
for<00:01:11.700> power<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:13.170> has<00:01:13.320> some<00:01:13.560> rubber<00:01:13.770> feet<00:01:14.150> which

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
for power it has some rubber feet which

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.760 
for power it has some rubber feet which
is<00:01:15.270> kind<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> nice<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.170> won't<00:01:16.320> move<00:01:16.500> at

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
is kind of nice because it won't move at

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.760 
is kind of nice because it won't move at
all<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.270> original<00:01:18.450> dock<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.590> size

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
all here is the original dock for size

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.179 
all here is the original dock for size
comparison<00:01:20.430> see<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:20.970> substantially<00:01:21.630> bigger

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
comparison see it's substantially bigger

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.730 
comparison see it's substantially bigger
and<00:01:23.189> here<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.670> yes<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> fit

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and here is yes so you can see the fit

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.050 
and here is yes so you can see the fit
in<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> battery

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
in there like that I think the battery

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.840 
in there like that I think the battery
in<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:31.229> bad<00:01:31.380> feels<00:01:31.770> solid<00:01:31.979> we'll<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.759> how

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
in so not bad feels solid we'll see how

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.630 
in so not bad feels solid we'll see how
it<00:01:32.939> works

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
it works

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.630 
it works
got<00:01:35.640> some<00:01:35.850> instructions<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:37.460> did<00:01:38.460> read<00:01:38.610> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
got some instructions here I did read a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.580 
got some instructions here I did read a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
note that said to not to charge the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.350 
note that said to not to charge the
battery<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.220> first<00:01:44.430> time<00:01:44.670> by<00:01:45.090> plugging

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
battery for the first time by plugging

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.149 
battery for the first time by plugging
the<00:01:45.509> power<00:01:45.750> cable<00:01:46.110> directly<00:01:46.290> into<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.009> let

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the power cable directly into it and let

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.760 
the power cable directly into it and let
it<00:01:47.250> charge<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.700> its<00:01:47.850> full<00:01:48.030> capacity<00:01:48.770> yeah

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it charge to its full capacity yeah

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.600 
it charge to its full capacity yeah
there's<00:01:50.130> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.920 

yep<00:01:54.610> charge<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.299> for<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.509> first<00:01:55.659> time<00:01:55.840> you

out<00:02:01.119> of<00:02:01.179> the<00:02:01.240> battery<00:02:01.509> gecko<00:02:02.229> which<00:02:02.500> is<00:02:02.619> great

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
out of the battery gecko which is great

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.260 
out of the battery gecko which is great
that's<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.369> good<00:02:03.490> idea<00:02:04.079> here's<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.200> battery

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
that's a good idea here's the battery

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.370 
that's a good idea here's the battery
see<00:02:07.270> that's<00:02:07.450> about<00:02:07.570> how<00:02:07.780> much<00:02:07.899> space<00:02:08.170> it's

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
see that's about how much space it's

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.850 
see that's about how much space it's
going<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.619> be<00:02:08.679> adding<00:02:09.069> to<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:10.119> 3s<00:02:10.569> you<00:02:11.560> know<00:02:11.650> it

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
going to be adding to the 3s you know it

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.680 
going to be adding to the 3s you know it
doesn't<00:02:12.220> really<00:02:12.459> weigh<00:02:12.670> much<00:02:12.849> of<00:02:13.030> anything<00:02:13.239> it

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
doesn't really weigh much of anything it

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.259 
doesn't really weigh much of anything it
actually<00:02:13.989> feels<00:02:14.260> kind<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:14.590> like<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:16.030> weight

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
actually feels kind of like the weight

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.300 
actually feels kind of like the weight
is<00:02:16.480> definitely<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:16.959> this<00:02:17.140> side<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.890> feels<00:02:18.099> like

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
is definitely on this side it feels like

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.770 
is definitely on this side it feels like
about<00:02:18.849> as<00:02:18.940> heavy<00:02:19.120> as<00:02:19.239> if<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.420> connect<00:02:19.690> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
about as heavy as if you connect the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.330 
about as heavy as if you connect the
battery<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.140> way<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.650> rest<00:02:20.799> feels<00:02:21.129> quite

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
battery to way and the rest feels quite

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.070 
battery to way and the rest feels quite
kind<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.730> like<00:02:21.879> hollow<00:02:22.180> plastic<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:23.019> it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
kind of like hollow plastic so it

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.140 
kind of like hollow plastic so it
doesn't<00:02:23.349> feel<00:02:23.440> really<00:02:23.799> doesn't<00:02:24.760> feel<00:02:24.910> really

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
doesn't feel really doesn't feel really

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.000 
doesn't feel really doesn't feel really
heavy<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:26.140> would<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.349> nice<00:02:26.530> if<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.799> didn't

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
heavy that would be nice if it didn't

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.520 
heavy that would be nice if it didn't
add<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.160> lot<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.310> weight<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.200> has<00:02:29.349> this<00:02:29.470> kind

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
add a lot of weight and it has this kind

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.550 
add a lot of weight and it has this kind
of<00:02:29.860> it's<00:02:30.640> not<00:02:30.790> rubber<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:32.079> rubber<00:02:32.170> rubber

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
of it's not rubber and rubber rubber

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.000 
of it's not rubber and rubber rubber
it's<00:02:32.860> kind<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:34.410> matte<00:02:35.410> finish<00:02:35.860> as

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
it's kind of this matte finish as

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.770 
it's kind of this matte finish as
opposed<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.459> being<00:02:36.730> sticky<00:02:37.120> rubber<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.750> I

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
opposed to being sticky rubber so I

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.170 
opposed to being sticky rubber so I
don't<00:02:37.989> see<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.349> getting<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.860> lot<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.099> dirt<00:02:40.000> on

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
don't see this getting a lot of dirt on

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.050 
don't see this getting a lot of dirt on
it<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.720> one<00:02:40.870> thing<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.200> think<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.590> kind<00:02:41.739> of

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
it the one thing that I think is kind of

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.620 
it the one thing that I think is kind of
frustrating<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.180> fact<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.450> it'll

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
frustrating is the fact that it'll

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.089 
frustrating is the fact that it'll
probably<00:02:43.840> be<00:02:44.019> slightly<00:02:44.620> less<00:02:44.829> of<00:02:44.890> a

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
probably be slightly less of a

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.979 
probably be slightly less of a
pocketable<00:02:45.519> device<00:02:45.880> by<00:02:46.480> having<00:02:46.720> this<00:02:46.780> on

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
pocketable device by having this on

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.930 
pocketable device by having this on
there<00:02:47.200> but<00:02:47.349> and<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:47.799> won't<00:02:47.920> be<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.130> bad<00:02:48.340> we'll

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
there but and it won't be that bad we'll

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:57.319 
there but and it won't be that bad we'll
see<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:51.930> here's<00:02:52.930> some<00:02:53.319> there's<00:02:54.280> some<00:02:54.340> tools

seen
it's<00:03:19.180> like<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.660> actual<00:03:20.049> shape<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.590> big

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
it's like the actual shape of a big

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.160 
it's like the actual shape of a big
screwdriver<00:03:21.310> but<00:03:21.579> it's<00:03:21.700> tiny

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
screwdriver but it's tiny

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.930 
screwdriver but it's tiny
it<00:03:23.470> looks<00:03:23.650> like<00:03:23.769> it's<00:03:23.889> not<00:03:24.010> actually<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.579> tri

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
it looks like it's not actually a tri

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.050 
it looks like it's not actually a tri
wing<00:03:25.799> that's<00:03:26.799> interesting<00:03:27.370> because<00:03:27.579> I'm<00:03:27.910> used

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
wing that's interesting because I'm used

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.180 
wing that's interesting because I'm used
to<00:03:28.120> seeing<00:03:28.329> trying<00:03:28.900> stuff<00:03:29.200> on<00:03:29.410> under<00:03:29.799> products

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
to seeing trying stuff on under products

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.360 
to seeing trying stuff on under products
but<00:03:30.400> apparently<00:03:30.730> it's<00:03:30.880> not<00:03:31.000> like<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.299> at<00:03:31.389> all

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
but apparently it's not like that at all

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.690 
but apparently it's not like that at all
also<00:03:33.370> included<00:03:34.359> our<00:03:34.620> loosely<00:03:35.620> packed<00:03:35.920> screws

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
also included our loosely packed screws

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.539 
also included our loosely packed screws
and<00:03:37.120> what<00:03:37.389> look<00:03:37.660> like<00:03:37.690> washers<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.739> those<00:03:39.400> are

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
and what look like washers and those are

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:40.890 
and what look like washers and those are
extras<00:03:40.030> because<00:03:40.329> it<00:03:40.420> looks<00:03:40.569> like<00:03:40.720> there's

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
extras because it looks like there's

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.990 
extras because it looks like there's
already<00:03:41.139> some<00:03:41.380> screws<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:41.799> washers<00:03:42.280> on<00:03:42.790> the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
already some screws and washers on the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.839 
already some screws and washers on the
device<00:03:43.269> itself

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
device itself

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.349 
device itself
so<00:03:45.629> I<00:03:46.400> guess<00:03:47.400> now<00:03:47.579> we<00:03:47.640> have<00:03:47.879> to<00:03:47.999> do<00:03:48.120> some

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
so I guess now we have to do some

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.660 
so I guess now we have to do some
surgery<00:03:48.689> with<00:03:48.989> our<00:03:49.139> tiny<00:03:49.379> little<00:03:49.499> screwdriver

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670

screwdriver so wish me luck
so<00:04:00.389> from<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.109> looks<00:04:01.349> like<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.769> screws<00:04:02.579> aren't

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
so from it looks like the screws aren't

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.240 
so from it looks like the screws aren't
actually<00:04:03.209> going<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.569> come<00:04:03.810> out<00:04:04.219> they<00:04:05.219> just

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
actually going to come out they just

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.220 
actually going to come out they just
stay<00:04:05.700> on<00:04:05.730> there<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.659> just<00:04:06.870> kind<00:04:07.019> of<00:04:07.079> have<00:04:07.200> to

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
stay on there you just kind of have to

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.220 
stay on there you just kind of have to
loosen<00:04:07.620> them<00:04:07.790> okay

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
loosen them okay

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.110 
loosen them okay
screws<00:04:10.230> loosen<00:04:11.000> possibly<00:04:13.519> okay<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.700> think<00:04:15.060> I

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
screws loosen possibly okay I think I

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.800 
screws loosen possibly okay I think I
got<00:04:15.299> it<00:04:15.450> here

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810

one<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.519> screws<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:18.989> helping<00:04:19.410> it

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
one of the screws and that is helping it

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.200 
one of the screws and that is helping it
hey<00:04:22.370> there's<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.520> back<00:04:25.639> trying<00:04:26.639> to<00:04:26.880> kind<00:04:27.120> of

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
hey there's the back trying to kind of

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.659 
hey there's the back trying to kind of
slide<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.750> up<00:04:28.110> since<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.590> has<00:04:28.889> little<00:04:29.099> tabs<00:04:29.370> at

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
slide it up since it has little tabs at

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.379 
slide it up since it has little tabs at
the<00:04:29.699> bottom<00:04:29.910> here<00:04:31.039> okay<00:04:32.039> there<00:04:32.610> we<00:04:32.729> are

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
the bottom here okay there we are

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:41.279 
the bottom here okay there we are
got<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:36.030> here's<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.150> battery<00:04:39.870> this<00:04:40.870> is<00:04:40.930> going

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
got it here's the battery this is going

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.980 
got it here's the battery this is going
away<00:04:42.659> so<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:44.710> plan<00:04:44.979> should<00:04:45.280> be<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.810> just<00:04:46.810> kind

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
away so the plan should be to just kind

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.929 
away so the plan should be to just kind
of<00:04:47.020> slide<00:04:47.379> this<00:04:47.650> in<00:04:47.889> place<00:04:48.189> of<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.490> old<00:04:48.520> one

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
of slide this in place of the old one

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:50.580 
of slide this in place of the old one
and<00:04:49.120> then<00:04:49.240> I'll<00:04:49.659> be<00:04:49.780> pushing<00:04:49.960> these<00:04:50.199> screws

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
and then I'll be pushing these screws

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.249 
and then I'll be pushing these screws
down<00:04:51.240> after<00:04:52.240> we<00:04:52.330> get<00:04:52.449> it<00:04:52.599> on<00:04:52.719> here<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:53.229> let's

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
down after we get it on here so let's

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.959 
down after we get it on here so let's
see<00:04:53.530> if<00:04:53.620> this<00:04:53.740> works

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:56.969 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:04.320 

snap<00:04:58.469> snap<00:04:59.490> it's<00:05:00.490> on<00:05:01.770> it's<00:05:02.770> on<00:05:03.030> let's<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:04.270> let's

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
snap snap it's on it's on let's so let's

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.999 
snap snap it's on it's on let's so let's
screw<00:05:05.020> these<00:05:05.139> screws<00:05:05.409> down<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:05.800> then<00:05:05.889> we<00:05:05.979> can

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
screw these screws down and then we can

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.360 
screw these screws down and then we can
take<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.310> closer<00:05:06.580> look<00:05:06.990> it's<00:05:07.990> working<00:05:08.379> almost

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
take a closer look it's working almost

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.350 
take a closer look it's working almost
there<00:05:09.789> almost<00:05:10.210> there<00:05:10.539> okay<00:05:11.469> there<00:05:12.129> it<00:05:12.219> is

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
there almost there okay there it is

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.580 
there almost there okay there it is
there<00:05:13.360> is<00:05:13.569> the<00:05:13.840> Nyko<00:05:14.409> power<00:05:14.860> pack<00:05:15.250> plus<00:05:16.349> on<00:05:17.349> the

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
there is the Nyko power pack plus on the

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.860 
there is the Nyko power pack plus on the
outside<00:05:17.949> of<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.490> three<00:05:18.639> yes<00:05:18.909> one<00:05:19.719> of<00:05:19.750> the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
outside of the three yes one of the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.119 
outside of the three yes one of the
things<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:20.139> also<00:05:20.289> thought<00:05:20.620> felt<00:05:20.860> about<00:05:21.009> the

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
things I also thought felt about the

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:22.559 
things I also thought felt about the
device<00:05:21.340> is<00:05:21.490> it<00:05:21.610> feels<00:05:21.819> kind<00:05:22.000> of<00:05:22.060> felt<00:05:22.389> kind<00:05:22.539> of

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
device is it feels kind of felt kind of

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.260 
device is it feels kind of felt kind of
thin<00:05:22.840> to<00:05:23.080> me<00:05:23.610> so<00:05:24.610> if<00:05:24.669> I<00:05:24.729> don't<00:05:24.879> mind<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.090> bulk

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
thin to me so if I don't mind the bulk

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.249 
thin to me so if I don't mind the bulk
in<00:05:25.389> my<00:05:25.479> pocket<00:05:25.840> I<00:05:25.930> might<00:05:26.050> actually<00:05:26.199> like<00:05:26.560> it

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
in my pocket I might actually like it

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.769 
in my pocket I might actually like it
as<00:05:29.259> an<00:05:29.469> addition<00:05:29.830> to<00:05:29.860> the<00:05:30.009> device<00:05:30.779> interesting

that<00:06:13.930> little<00:06:14.050> the<00:06:14.259> little<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:15.400> bottom<00:06:15.580> of<00:06:15.789> the

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
that little the little the bottom of the

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.059 
that little the little the bottom of the
device<00:06:15.969> that<00:06:16.419> lighter<00:06:16.810> color<00:06:17.080> part<00:06:17.589> sort<00:06:17.979> of

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:18.069 
device that lighter color part sort of

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:20.189 
device that lighter color part sort of
doubles<00:06:18.400> the<00:06:18.610> width<00:06:18.789> of<00:06:18.939> that<00:06:19.089> looks<00:06:19.479> like<00:06:19.659> so

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
doubles the width of that looks like so

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.439 
doubles the width of that looks like so
yeah<00:06:20.979> add<00:06:21.189> some<00:06:21.430> bulk<00:06:21.639> but<00:06:21.849> it<00:06:21.939> is<00:06:22.029> essentially

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
yeah add some bulk but it is essentially

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.360 
yeah add some bulk but it is essentially
supposed<00:06:22.629> to<00:06:22.719> double<00:06:23.020> the<00:06:23.080> life<00:06:23.259> of<00:06:23.529> the

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
supposed to double the life of the

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.390 
supposed to double the life of the
battery<00:06:24.960> joystick<00:06:25.960> comm<00:06:26.919> ran<00:06:27.189> some<00:06:27.460> tests<00:06:27.939> and

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
battery joystick comm ran some tests and

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.110 
battery joystick comm ran some tests and
apparently<00:06:30.400> they<00:06:30.520> are<00:06:30.550> actually<00:06:31.000> getting

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
apparently they are actually getting

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.369 
apparently they are actually getting
double<00:06:31.509> the<00:06:31.569> life<00:06:31.719> out<00:06:31.870> of<00:06:31.900> the<00:06:32.020> battery<00:06:32.319> if

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:32.379 
double the life out of the battery if

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:34.679 
double the life out of the battery if
that's<00:06:32.529> the<00:06:32.650> case<00:06:32.830> I<00:06:33.099> will<00:06:33.250> enjoy<00:06:33.580> this<00:06:33.789> so

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:34.689 
that's the case I will enjoy this so

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
just like there's a lip on the battery

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.980 
just like there's a lip on the battery
itself<00:06:47.090> just<00:06:48.090> kind<00:06:48.240> of<00:06:48.270> dump<00:06:48.450> it<00:06:48.570> in<00:06:48.660> you<00:06:48.840> just
