00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.440
 blackberry messenger the application of 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.970
 messaging that many of you 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.410
 you were waiting and that is already 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.140
 available to download 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.120
 free in the app store blackberry 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.470
 Messenger requires a request to 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.080
 enter a waiting list to be able to 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.630
 access the application the list of 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.010
 wait, it's not too long, I'll explain 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.260
 me when the application came out the 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.210
 download I sent the invitation so that 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.340
 they will send me my code and logically 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.440
 put me on the waiting list and take a 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.540
 day in just one day I could enter 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.130
 to blackberry teach me then while I 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.800
 arrimÃ© seniat I said it in a video does 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.240
 a few weeks ago a few days ago I did not 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.310
 He was going to take a lot of advantage but he has already 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.979
 I looked utility will use to 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.540
 talk to you so nothing that 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.210
 I know that people are worth adding to 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.670
 right now I have 60 more contacts than 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.710
 nothing because yesterday I uploaded my blackberry pin 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.630
 to twitter and twitter so good 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.580
 you have been adding good we are going to 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.080
 talk a little roughly what 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.600
 who have blackberry messenger either 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.070
 It is a complex application to understand 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.990
 late I think it would have 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.149
 much more welcome much more successful if 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.050
 I would have arrived much earlier in time 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.720
 because this one 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.310
 extended wasabi line but good we're going to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.620
 see this can come for a very public 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.240
 specific and especially for 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.650
 america in america so it's used a lot 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.200
 more blackberry here than in Europe 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.460
 example in spain well let's see the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.320
 menus let's start from right to 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.000
 left better from right to left 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.740
 we see in the menu on the right of the whole 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.230
 this configuration where after as 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.120
 says the name we can see a menu of 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.290
 Help plant me invite settings 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.420
 teach contacts who are not 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.920
 registered the application make a chat 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.020
 of several people spread a message 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.180
 that we want to send the same message to 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.590
 several contacts and start a chat in the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.930
 we can now touch 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.600
 more specific and more specific options 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.310
 of our application then we have the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.170
 tab of groups with which we 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.080
 we can create groups for example group 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.880
 from youtube group of podcast group of 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.160
 iphone group android and talk to 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.440
 people that talk about the theme that you 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.180
 you want to talk in that group then 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.650
 we have here the contacts tab 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.140
 where we have all the contacts that 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.480
 we have added to our blackberry 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.310
 right now I have 60 contacts me 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.010
 here I could do a search for a 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.290
 specific contact etcetera and here then 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.450
 I see the preview in images 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.370
 profile of all my contacts and that 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.859
 yes I of the ones that I added I prefer 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.090
 that his vice a picture of agreements 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.500
 put a profile picture 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.060
 silva that more than anything to put you 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.650
 faces since you with the cops to me 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.079
 on a daily basis at least to put 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.420
 face the people who added then 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.980
 contacts then the chat window here 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.709
 Right now I have three open chats 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.200
 etcetera and then we have this tab 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.780
 which is the tab where we can see from 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.030
 quick way the essential menus that in 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.909
 this case are the chats the contacts 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.290
 the groups the updates of 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.970
 our contacts for example if 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.580
 they change state if they change the photo of 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.690
 profile and so on 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.800
 and then we also have a tab for 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.510
 accept invitations and send 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.720
 invitations for example if you guys 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.980
 you want to add here you will have to 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.390
 invite me suppose to a chat I have not 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.280
 added to anyone I simply have you 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.010
 I was accepting you I guess 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.900
 will be through there and if you click on 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.910
 your profile where you put fernando del 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.740
 morally available is worth if you click there 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.590
 you can edit the data of your 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.570
 profile either a state you can put in 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.800
 that you are thinking the updates 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.920
 what you have done in your profile 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.050
 with modification date and then 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.770
 logically you can look at your pin that 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.660
 mine is seven times 515 of you can 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.100
 copy it and that pin then you can paste it 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.840
 on social networks so that people get 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.310
 add and this is what you have 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.780
 blackberry messenger bonus I'm going to put 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.220
 the pin there on screen a few seconds 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.320
 so that if you want you can add me 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.180
 I'm going to put the description and I'll say 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.890
 I hope you liked this little one 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.330
 analysis that you know that more or less more 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.620
 which analysis is a bit informative 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.750
 because an analysis of an application of 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.190
 messaging does not have much mystery but 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.540
 good that you do not know and that you know that 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.080
 You can contact me if you want 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.730
 there to understand that I am 60 more contacts 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.510
 those who come now through this 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.280
 video 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.560
 maybe I can not contact them at all 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.170
 at the same time but that little by little I will go 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.490
 adding that continue to respond so 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.610
 may soon be worth it because it comes together 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.510
 also post and it's crazy what 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.760
 I've done guys I hope that I have 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.830
 liked that you enjoy the service and 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.270
 this has been all that you know that in 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.830
 blackberry messenger was had 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.380
 problems with updating the 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.240
 703 but today blackberry has launched a 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.650
 update in the appstore with which 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.710
 in theory he has fixed these problems 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.210
 will also permeate the company yesterday 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.470
 said a statement sent a statement 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.440
 saying that precisely these 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.700
 problems that I had generated in relation 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.530
 to class I was having the 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.390
 application were being produced from 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.680
 updating them 703 because at 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.020
 seem to point co something in that 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.970
 update that harmed the data 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.980
 that they had and that's why the application 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.750
 that it is going well the application has 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.920
 received an update today this 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.270
 tomorrow when he woke me up he has updated 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.950
 and at the moment I have not had any 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.910
 problem so in theory it's all already 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.460
 solved and blackberrymessenger 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.110
 works perfectly on it 7 now 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.580
 yes that you enjoy it you already know that if you 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.820
 liked the video you can support giving 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.110
 one hand up and subscribing if not 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.940
 you have done it 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.940
