00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.750
 dead soldiers behave strangely 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.439
 there now again crawled somewhere 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.870
 And these generally on the second space 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.870
 starts 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:48.030
 yes they are all obsessed here now clear 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.030
 what commander is such an army 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.760
 It seems the Americans are also actively put 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.500
 experiences in humans are for example a person 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.990
 almost invisible 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.100
 some fighters of the Third Reich were well 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.640
 very close 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.750
 and here the dog is obviously superfluous now we 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.530
 this watchdog 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.530
 eliminated 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.020
 yeah probably he has a soul with his body 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.020
 move away 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.229
 tricky question 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:37.580
 how many hands does a real soldier have for 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:40.790
 what's not guess that's what it means 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:45.490
 chaos of war where to run where they shoot and 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.490
 when it all ends nothing is clear 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.369
 there is a suspicion that before the fight local 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.850
 paratroopers are taking something for 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.850
 courage 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.750
 side effect 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.369
 slow reaction the poor fellow whistled 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.200
 car and it only comes to 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.060
 the next release of our show 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.470
 alternative soon a topic 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.090
 fascinating but don't forget that on 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.420
 actually happened in the middle 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.700
 of the last century and such heroes saved the world 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.700
 Good luck and less glitches
