00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 so for assembling the rcfs w18 you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.960
 have nine panels always have to 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.160
 so start a little mallet that's 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.710
 important to have what it takes like 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.039
 tooling there you have one of the sides on 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.119
 laying flat simply we take 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:26.130
 the inner back part 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.130
 position a little in the groove 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.730
 it must be done we do not take 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.260
 gone two sous inside we come to 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.300
 position so it's grooves s 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.239
 is just past it's done to hold 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.620
 all by itself almost obviously does the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.050
 blank mount to show you a 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 little bit how we proceed in stages 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.770
 because those who are there can not 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.360
 to ride anyhow but would 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.129
 possibly stick it on the beauty 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.829
 in time once that part 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.170
 there to assemble them right here and a 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.149
 little bit anyway 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.590
 Here we take the front its 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.909
 which the parliament set in place 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.360
 is the most delicate part 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.520
 you have to go back once 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.650
 fully break it will not move 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.890
 the more we make sure we are in place 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.020
 and then we push that's the part 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.390
 assembly the most delicate time that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.460
 this part there and do we stay when 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.950
 even simpler with their parts 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.950
 interior serving the dish 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.110
 the two reinforcements is absolutely the m 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.110
 before the other or we can more m 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.479
 she's really unfair and that's it 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.520
 that she is in place all done when 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.350
 even a block his red mouth for the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.580
 above where we at the meeting of the facade 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:08.720
 the groove for the inner reinforcement 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:10.110
 so we put ourselves on it's just that it's good 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.410
 tidied up 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.100
 we check that everything is well aligned a 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.980
 little blow of mallet we go slowly 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.610
 Here once this is done your 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.610
 questions to the assembly 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.750
 almost finished the back side so the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.799
 back side 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.470
 there is a hole for a base other 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.510
 hic the ned ktm stone and there you have the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.280
 part of the hooks to be able cable 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.280
 and properly 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.470
 you can do more in adjusting yourself 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:22.550
 a first part you stuck two 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:27.800
 hours later the room and 45 the 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.190
 underneath so there's no way of getting 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.680
 deceive 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.870
 she can not go anywhere else see the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:39.530
 renyon downstairs it's gone there that 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:46.820
 block or impose in it we push the 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:49.400
 below ended the whole party 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.590
 inside and assembled and adjust the 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.810
 see that at each end you bring 0.25 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.840
 mm is very little but it corresponds to 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.160
 the extra thickness created by the alcohol a 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.209
 once it was done without us going 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:08.870
 go back to high school see a little bit there 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:12.680
 seemed banal a ps comes to cover the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.760
 all over it is your courage to 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.239
 mounting your pc 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.239
 see you soon
