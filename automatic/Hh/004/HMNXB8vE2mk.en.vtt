mixture when you add the baking soda and
start<00:01:27.569> to<00:01:27.689> stir<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.929> around<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.469> will<00:01:28.770> begin<00:01:29.039> to

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
start to stir it around it will begin to

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.330 
start to stir it around it will begin to
foam<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.499> increase<00:01:31.499> in<00:01:31.649> volume<00:01:31.859> that's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
foam up and increase in volume that's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.069 
foam up and increase in volume that's
why<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.639> important<00:01:32.999> that<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.659> large

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
why it's important that you have a large

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.340 
why it's important that you have a large
saucepan<00:01:34.499> so<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.069> doesn't<00:01:35.280> go<00:01:35.369> over<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.579> sides

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
saucepan so it doesn't go over the sides

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
saucepan so it doesn't go over the sides
once<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.499> foams<00:01:37.770> up<00:01:38.009> continue<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> stir<00:01:38.939> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
once it foams up continue to stir and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510 
once it foams up continue to stir and
cook<00:01:39.749> for<00:01:40.109> another<00:01:40.170> minute<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:40.709> so<00:01:40.950> until<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
cook for another minute or so until the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.260 
cook for another minute or so until the
foaming<00:01:41.819> comes<00:01:42.270> down<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> little<00:01:42.780> bit<00:01:42.959> and<00:01:44.270> then

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
foaming comes down a little bit and then

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.730 
foaming comes down a little bit and then
you're<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.929> to<00:01:46.049> pour<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.350> over<00:01:46.409> top<00:01:46.709> of

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you're just going to pour it over top of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.179 
you're just going to pour it over top of
the<00:01:47.249> corn<00:01:47.459> twists<00:01:51.319> just<00:01:52.319> pour<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.709> as<00:01:52.829> evenly

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
the corn twists just pour it as evenly

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.859 
the corn twists just pour it as evenly
as<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.459> can<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.299> will<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.630> combining

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
as you can but we will be combining

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
as you can but we will be combining
those<00:01:55.200> two<00:01:55.409> together<00:01:55.529> later<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.999> would

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
those two together later and I would

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.149 
those two together later and I would
suggest<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.689> when<00:01:57.990> you're<00:01:58.139> done<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.889> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
suggest that when you're done with the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.029 
suggest that when you're done with the
pot<00:01:59.539> fill<00:02:00.539> it<00:02:00.689> with<00:02:00.810> hot<00:02:00.990> water<00:02:01.039> immediately

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
pot fill it with hot water immediately

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.779 
pot fill it with hot water immediately
so<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.729> easy<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.299> clean<00:02:03.689> later<00:02:03.959> and

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
so that it's easy to clean later and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.669 
so that it's easy to clean later and
using<00:02:05.789> a<00:02:06.060> spatula<00:02:06.359> or<00:02:06.840> wooden<00:02:06.869> spoon<00:02:07.439> just
