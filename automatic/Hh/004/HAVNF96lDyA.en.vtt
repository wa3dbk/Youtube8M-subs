at any point you can just hook yourself

at any point you can just hook yourself
up<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.489> back<00:00:49.670> of<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.940> tow<00:00:50.120> truck<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.660> yeah<00:00:51.320> this

up the back of a tow truck and yeah this

up the back of a tow truck and yeah this
will<00:00:52.040> more<00:00:52.460> likely<00:00:52.519> happen<00:00:53.120> at<00:00:53.210> one<00:00:53.300> point

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.959 

right<00:00:56.809> this<00:00:57.140> next<00:00:57.379> glitch<00:00:57.770> is<00:00:58.399> called<00:00:58.789> the

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
right this next glitch is called the

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.170 
right this next glitch is called the
pulse<00:00:59.120> glitch<00:00:59.510> and<00:00:59.870> I<00:01:00.530> found<00:01:01.460> this<00:01:01.550> out<00:01:01.760> by<00:01:02.149> a

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
pulse glitch and I found this out by a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.620 
pulse glitch and I found this out by a
youtuber<00:01:02.600> coolest<00:01:03.050> couple<00:01:03.260> dragon<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.630> first

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
youtuber coolest couple dragon and first

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.940 
youtuber coolest couple dragon and first
go<00:01:05.869> up<00:01:05.899> to<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.110> bush<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:06.380> just<00:01:06.530> hit<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.800> back

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
go up to the bush you just hit the back

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.190 
go up to the bush you just hit the back
of<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.250> then<00:01:07.880> after<00:01:08.270> that<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.570> grab<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.050> back

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
of it then after that you grab the back

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:20.039 
of it then after that you grab the back
of<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.440> bus<00:01:09.619> repeatedly<00:01:10.369> until<00:01:10.789> in<00:01:11.030> relics

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.410 

more<00:01:20.590> than<00:01:20.710> likely<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.640> release<00:01:22.390> should

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
more than likely the release should

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.350 
more than likely the release should
occur<00:01:22.930> after<00:01:23.409> you<00:01:23.530> bracket<00:01:24.009> it<00:01:24.189> and<00:01:24.520> this<00:01:25.060> is

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
occur after you bracket it and this is

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.440 
occur after you bracket it and this is
what<00:01:25.570> happens

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.700 

so<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.510> won't<00:01:32.810> be<00:01:32.990> able<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.229> shift<00:01:33.409> into

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
so you won't be able to shift into

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.010 
so you won't be able to shift into
because<00:01:34.009> t-rex<00:01:34.549> put<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:35.030> as<00:01:35.150> sort<00:01:35.780> of<00:01:35.840> weird

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
because t-rex put it as sort of weird

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.010 
because t-rex put it as sort of weird
effects<00:01:36.500> they<00:01:36.590> start<00:01:37.040> sort<00:01:38.030> of<00:01:38.210> sliding<00:01:38.630> about

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
effects they start sort of sliding about

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.710 
effects they start sort of sliding about
down<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.500> road<00:01:42.549> okay<00:01:43.549> let's<00:01:44.330> move<00:01:44.450> on<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.630> the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
down the road okay let's move on to the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.039 
down the road okay let's move on to the
next<00:01:44.810> glitch

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.289 

so<00:01:52.039> there's<00:01:52.189> a<00:01:52.250> part<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.609> this<00:01:52.729> glitch<00:01:52.969> which<00:01:53.240> I

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
so there's a part to this glitch which I

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.569 
so there's a part to this glitch which I
haven't<00:01:53.479> sown<00:01:53.869> but<00:01:54.109> basically<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:55.310> have

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
haven't sown but basically you have

normally<00:03:00.700> in<00:03:00.970> free<00:03:01.210> room<00:03:01.800> so<00:03:02.800> but<00:03:03.130> cops<00:03:03.610> will

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
normally in free room so but cops will

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.550 
normally in free room so but cops will
keep<00:03:04.030> spawning<00:03:04.330> even<00:03:05.020> if<00:03:05.110> you've<00:03:05.230> got<00:03:05.380> ten

keep spawning even if you've got ten

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.720 
keep spawning even if you've got ten
I've<00:03:05.650> got<00:03:05.770> ten<00:03:05.950> cops<00:03:06.160> there<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.490> can<00:03:06.610> see<00:03:06.700> a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
I've got ten cops there you can see a

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.100 
I've got ten cops there you can see a
glutton<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.150> blue<00:03:07.300> dot<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.720> left<00:03:07.960> there

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
glutton of a blue dot to the left there

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.450 
glutton of a blue dot to the left there
a<00:03:08.230> little<00:03:08.470> blue<00:03:08.680> dot<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.040> right<00:03:09.220> on<00:03:09.370> the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
a little blue dot to the right on the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.600 
a little blue dot to the right on the
map<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:11.410> they<00:03:11.740> won't<00:03:11.950> go<00:03:12.070> after<00:03:12.340> if<00:03:12.430> you<00:03:12.490> go

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
map so but they won't go after if you go

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.950 
map so but they won't go after if you go
near<00:03:12.790> them<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:15.550> can<00:03:15.790> keep<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.300> all<00:03:16.540> limited

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
near them you can keep it all limited

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.860 
near them you can keep it all limited
amount<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.380> time<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.620> have<00:03:17.890> cops<00:03:18.130> on<00:03:18.280> you

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.380 

so<00:03:22.530> next<00:03:22.770> up<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.130> true<00:03:23.849> glitch<00:03:23.910> just

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
so next up is the true glitch just

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.420 
so next up is the true glitch just
repeatedly<00:03:24.959> hit<00:03:25.440> me<00:03:25.560> underneath<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:26.130> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
repeatedly hit me underneath of the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.190 
repeatedly hit me underneath of the
trophy<00:03:26.790> like<00:03:26.849> I've<00:03:27.150> done<00:03:27.360> there<00:03:27.599> now<00:03:27.900> I've

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
trophy like I've done there now I've

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.540 
trophy like I've done there now I've
come<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.560> point<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.920> where<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.160> have

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
come to the point of where I have

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.550 
come to the point of where I have
wrecked<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:30.090> truck<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.599> it'll<00:03:31.170> do<00:03:31.319> this

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
wrecked the truck and it'll do this

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.430 
wrecked the truck and it'll do this
crazy<00:03:32.160> thing

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:04:01.399 

prepare<00:03:38.220> yourself

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.270 

and<00:04:02.409> eventually<00:04:03.010> it'll<00:04:03.280> come<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.640> an<00:04:03.760> end<00:04:03.909> and

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
and eventually it'll come to an end and

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.420 
and eventually it'll come to an end and
so<00:04:06.280> yeah<00:04:06.580> that's<00:04:06.819> that's<00:04:07.060> normal<00:04:07.720> right<00:04:11.430> okay

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
so yeah that's that's normal right okay

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.850 
so yeah that's that's normal right okay
so<00:04:12.489> this<00:04:12.970> next<00:04:13.209> glitch<00:04:13.510> is<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.959> crazy<00:04:14.410> tow

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
so this next glitch is the crazy tow

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.039 
so this next glitch is the crazy tow
truck<00:04:15.190> glitch<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.479> want<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.690> go<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.840> this

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
truck glitch and you want to go to this

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.659 
truck glitch and you want to go to this
barrier<00:04:17.440> that's<00:04:17.650> on<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.889> map<00:04:18.070> with<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.430> tow

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
barrier that's on the map with a tow

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.250 
barrier that's on the map with a tow
truck<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.269> car<00:04:19.299> on<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:19.949> and<00:04:21.840> then<00:04:22.840> you<00:04:23.080> want

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
truck and a car on it and then you want

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.930 
truck and a car on it and then you want
to<00:04:23.350> leave<00:04:23.680> your<00:04:23.889> tow<00:04:24.130> truck<00:04:24.160> just<00:04:24.580> shift<00:04:24.790> away

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
to leave your tow truck just shift away

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.330 
to leave your tow truck just shift away
from<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.449> go<00:04:26.199> where<00:04:26.440> this<00:04:26.560> is<00:04:26.770> away<00:04:26.949> from<00:04:27.010> it

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
from it go where this is away from it

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.730 
from it go where this is away from it
and<00:04:27.490> leave<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.150> for<00:04:28.180> about<00:04:28.330> 10<00:04:28.780> seconds<00:04:29.320> here<00:04:29.710> I

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
and leave it for about 10 seconds here I

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.920 
and leave it for about 10 seconds here I
go<00:04:29.919> back<00:04:30.100> actually<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.460> bit<00:04:30.610> too<00:04:30.850> soon<00:04:31.180> what

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
go back actually a bit too soon what

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.450 
go back actually a bit too soon what
you'll<00:04:32.080> see<00:04:32.169> is<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.530> total<00:04:32.919> having<00:04:33.250> gone

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
you'll see is the total having gone

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.969 
you'll see is the total having gone
through<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:34.120> barrier<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:35.199> just<00:04:35.620> can<00:04:35.770> shift

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
through the barrier so I just can shift

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.170 
through the barrier so I just can shift
away<00:04:36.160> again<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.460> next<00:04:39.699> time<00:04:39.820> I<00:04:39.940> come<00:04:40.120> to

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
away again and the next time I come to

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.890 
away again and the next time I come to
it<00:04:40.570> both<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.770> tow<00:04:41.949> truck<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.970> car<00:04:43.510> should

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
it both the tow truck and the car should

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.930 
it both the tow truck and the car should
be<00:04:44.050> through<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.470> barrier<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.070> out<00:04:45.430> of<00:04:45.669> the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
be through the barrier and out of the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.969 
be through the barrier and out of the
normal<00:04:46.570> map<00:04:46.900> area<00:04:47.260> we<00:04:47.410> supposed<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:47.740> be<00:04:49.979> okay

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
normal map area we supposed to be okay

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.409 
normal map area we supposed to be okay
so<00:04:51.039> apparently<00:04:51.340> of<00:04:51.610> a<00:04:51.669> different<00:04:51.910> color<00:04:52.060> karts

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
so apparently of a different color karts

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.420 
so apparently of a different color karts
just<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.660> way<00:04:52.750> I've<00:04:52.870> edited<00:04:53.050> it<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:54.400> just
