 install others and muleteers 2 multiplayer 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.410
 while the bus passes from behind if not 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.539
 they have a bus behind they are already fucked 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.669

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.230
 no but good out of jokes what is 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.930
 they will need is to have their website or in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.710
 steam if you do not have it the sim are not going to 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.140
 can download since I have my game 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.330
 original but it is not destiny that I do if 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.980
 game is original eye very important 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.860
 because if it's not original it's not going to 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.660
 serve and if it gave the original game and it's 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.030
 and it's not for steam what they can do 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.460
 is to look for your kit come to this and look 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.430

 next I accept and they put here the chj of 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.190
 simple play download it again yes 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.250
 their profiles are not going to be lost but they 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.040
 it's time to download it again and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.170
 and if they are going to be able to play and play 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.700
 multiplayer I recommend you do that 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.010
 who have the game out steam 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.989
 why should we be a platform 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.570
 that allows you to handle games easier 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.710
 allows them to be controlled there once 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.420
 that they have them there do not have to go back 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.630
 to look for your computer for nothing so 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.670
 is very good now yes continuing with 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.590
 this tutorial on how to install the game 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.270
 The first thing we are going to do is go to the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.119
 Official page of euro troxy muleros 2 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.800
 multiplayer what is the sts page of 2 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.810
 mp dotcom that I'm going to leave 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.910
 in the description so it gives you does not say 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.920
 open more information or whatever and there 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.140
 will go out they go to the page and continue 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.720
 the steps very simple very simple 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.979
 we come to the download button and once 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.420

 we do this here we give and continue 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.860
 quietly because they must 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.479
 confirm that you have the game in steam 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.120
 If you do not have it in if you do not they will 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.920
 let download 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.360
 once here remember that this is a way 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.190
 this is not a game by the way this is not 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.620
 it's a separate game this is a 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.690
 modification for the original game you 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.370
 we give the red button that says download the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.140

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.250

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.650

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.940
 we open the file to me it opens 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.490
 automatically because I have it 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.770
 already configured this file that we 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.330
 it goes in here we give it simply 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.380
 double click or enter and it's going to 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.660
 run 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.390
 here we get a notification from you 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.820
 they are not seeing but that's where it came out 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.650
 who says you want to allow this 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.440
 program to make changes in the team will 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.210
 we give yes yes yes and now if you 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.520
 you are seeing this again we give you 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.950
 here to choose the English language obviously 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.490
 unless you speak Polish German 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:40.360
 or Russian we give you continue we give you 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.160
 next I accept next we give 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.690
 below and here we will ask 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.910
 choose the directory where is 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.520
 saved our in another we give to the 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.080
 browse button and we're just going to disk 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.850
 local or wherever you keep 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.300
 your things normal people keep the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.420
 things in cee 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.960
 here we search according to your windows windows 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.390
 of 64 bits we go to program files 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.790
 x86 if your windows is 32 bits while 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.150
 the bus passes from behind they go simply to 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.120
 program files text how the hell 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.300
 something to know if my windows is 64 or 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.330
 32 bit is very simple if you get the 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.000
 x86 folder is 64 bit do not look for it 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.440
 more if it does not come out is 32 so already 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.440
 they know which ones they choose the folder 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.970
 necessary and hereinafter the steps 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.040
 they are the same once in the folder 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.340
 program files in it 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.579
 we go and we look for this month it is here 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.319
 in the end this esteemed are you if not 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.609
 have obviously we are going to look for it 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.040
 we give you here on the little arrow is for 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.500
 that we are deployed and we seek the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.560
 estimated folder we deploy and search 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.269
 We also deploy the common folder 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.310
 and we look for the euro folder -which 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.560
 simulator but this one we're not going to 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.109
 unfold we just click and you 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.120
 we give ok once this is done simply 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.069
 we give you next we give you next 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.170
 here if you want me to create an icon for you 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.650
 desktop and we give you next install 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.569
 and uninstall easy and simple which is what 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.959
 that is still here will tell us that if 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.380
 we want to throw say that not simply 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.330
 no no 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.070
 let's close this let's close this 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.410
 as here I keep my icon in the 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.870
 desk this is very important that what 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.000
 let me tell you why you do not go 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.520
 to enter the game from steam but from 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.650
 here if you do not believe in the icon 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.720
 simply go to your desktop menu 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.160
 start if they have windows 7 or if they have 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.470
 windows 8 let's read the home key and now 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.360
 is and they copy euro truck and they are going to 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.660
 leave here this is the simple multiplayer 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.980
 and simple easy another important thing 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.690
 very important is that they have open 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.700
 steam and that the game is downloaded if 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.260
 they do not have open steam they will leave 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.060
 an error so have it open and 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.850
 have the game downloaded in steam 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.430
 obviously obviously once this is done 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.560
 simply because we open this they ask us 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.020
 permissions we give you yes 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.200
 and this does not come out as online that here 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.210
 ignore what completely server me 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.790
 I'm in america, so I choose the server 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.260
 of the us if you are in europe or 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.760
 On the other hand, they choose the one in Europe 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.980
 the one that is closest to you I know 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.930
 in america across the continent they 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.910
 I recommend the US because it's going 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.190
 to give a lower pin there are fewer people 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.680
 playing in the America's if there's a lot 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.750
 less people but they will be much better 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.360
 in the world so it's better and they're going to 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.510
 avoid many accidents seriously 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.280
 let's just play and as you see we are 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.990
 open the game 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.990
 here we have the game open you 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.210
 they will see that suddenly they see how they 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.800
 it flashes that's just because I have 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.720
 open also camp 6 to which 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.360
 interferes with the fraps 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.210
 but hey let's see what we just going 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.100
 what are the basses and here simply 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.840
 we choose a profile that we want to 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.650
 I continue with this which is what he used to 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.650
 fuck out there 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.330
 I frames are a bit low are 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.910
 plus the brakes that give me a little bit 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.070
 low by the fatigue fucked you sing already 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.510
 but well we wait for him to load and a 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.729
 once he has simply loaded us 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.669
 let's drive 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.650
 and as they see online and you see no collision 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.039
 I would be already connected to easy 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.809
 down here I get the sign 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.520
 connecting to the server from us connection 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:19.529
 established blah blah blah and I do not know where 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.820
 I'm riding but I do not think 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:24.560
 I should so nothing or where I am 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.060
 this is basically how you play at 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.670
 multiplayer let's see I do not have players 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.680
 close I really do not have players near 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.780
 but up there he confirms that I'm 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.040
 connected that is the important thing I do not know 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.710
 even in what city am I for 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.630
 start 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.610
 this is a small problem that happens 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.200
 always connected today in bratislava it 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.970
 explains everything 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.230
 but good people this has been all her 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.730
 I'm connected sometimes if I do not 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.380
 you connect because the server is full 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.690
 things that really only happen in the 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.570
 server of europe in the USA 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.820
 I've never really seen it happen and so 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.560
 already important things make sure that 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.139
 they have downloaded the latest version of the 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.120
 I play the latest version of the mod 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.069
 and then yes that's all I hope there is 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.069
 liked if rather like to add 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:10.740
 to bookmark subscribe and then nothing this 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.740
 has been everything until the next fate 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.530
 I have 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.530
 bye Bye
