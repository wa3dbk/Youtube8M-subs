00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.529
 all the best everyone here you have me 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.130
 with the following game from thel book 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.230
 and center adults of the fundamental shooting 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.450
 with the French deck as always for 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.609
 to do it the simplest and everything is easy 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:24.230
 possible this game is the game is called 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:26.640
 unexplainable and it's called like that because it's not 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.729
 well here we have the breasts totally 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.570
 mixed though we can try to mix 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:38.730
 a little bit more, if not more 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.280
 perfect possible we do not go like this once 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.840
 mixed 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.809
 although it does not matter because the spectators 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.820
 they're going to mix more yet let's not suppose 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.550
 that we have a couple of spectators 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.559
 we predict we can bring the deck more 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.820
 or less program and we're going to 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.620
 deliver a half 1 we try the good 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.089
 Now we make an explanation of what 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.500
 They have to do what they have to do 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:06.470
 is to cut at the point they want to turn 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.509
 and exchange the piles then 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.590
 it is also rotated and exchanged 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:16.149
 that what they have to do cut spin 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.149
 exchange and now mixed with 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.730
 that is face up and face down 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.500
 now the recorded calm that what they have 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.580
 what to do 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.030
 then the spectators proceed 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.600
 cut where they want to turn and 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.600
 they exchange 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.759
 and one of them asks beloved people 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.289
 mix as we want and happy and if 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.549
 Of course the question is that I like it 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.659
 place 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:52.560
 to choose is what the viewer does 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:56.560
 mix makes two cakes like that so it becomes 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.869
 mixed and take a smell was a 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.280
 spectator who liked him astro 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.920
 same does it like this and mix portado 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.090
 vulgar channel in by letters on top of 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.090
 low and the viewers is over tells you to 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.150
 viewers thought you liked 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.569
 he did not like this this way 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.730
 globular squares the cards a little 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.329
 short where they want to turn 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.170
 exchange and redo again 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:32.010
 the mixture is so pretty 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.010
 so almost 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.340
 will recompose everything a little and 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.150
 says that this they do so many times 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:48.260
 as they want , we are not going to do it 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.260
 know more rotate exchange and mexica 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.410
 for costs if the mouse 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.890
 they have says that when they finish 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.230
 Mix 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.360
 in the same 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.310
 this is also how it is so clear everything 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.849
 all 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.849
 good 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.550
 mix the dots too 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:27.930
 if so, for example, it's like that 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.310
 if this cuts through here and I'm that 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.030
 matter around here is 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.030
 and good 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.099
 the bad guy tells them that this was 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.320
 an entertainment to mix our 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.390
 mix in the rhyme in work to see 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.910
 what visual ability can reach 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.480
 have a picture and then I told them 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.680
 well let's go with the first one with the first 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.730
 effect 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.310
 that my vision of age is that of the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.730
 letters there's there's one face up 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.230
 Well, I can say that there are just 23 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.500
 houses that are face of the plane to balbina 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.500
 of the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:17.750
 it can not be and we are going to cut 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.390
 let's count them upside down 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:27.730
 that is, we have to count what there is 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:35.700
 work then I will say because it is a 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:42.980
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.980
 9 then has 12 13 14 15 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:53.840
 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 and effectively 23 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.720
 letters were only gestated face to the magnet 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.040
 that we have counted them chickpea and now 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.889
 I tell you why because I can also 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.830
 ensure I know assured that of all 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.470
 these, for example, have already 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.229
 black or I can say that there is a total of 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.840
 eleven black cards, you do not go or the speed 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.940
 that's why we know it so do not think about 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.790
 those who have been regarded been 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.400
 counting it without seeing them I can sure 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.070
 Hot hence the visual capacity 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:31.220
 of the magician is good , let's tell 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:33.940
 the feathers 2 3 4 5 6 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.940
 7 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:46.500
 8 9 10 and 11 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:46.500
 eleven black letters the rest red 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.440
 that the professor gave to the body 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.169
 nice fire truth put him on the ledro 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.190
 book put a little bit of our 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.910
 history and enjoy it and until the 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.180
 next 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.180
 bye
