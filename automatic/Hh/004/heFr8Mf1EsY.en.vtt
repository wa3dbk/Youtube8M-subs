show you all right this is just a car by
this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.180> call<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> duty<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:09.619> that's<00:01:10.619> turbos

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
this is call of duty to that's turbos

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:27.740 
this is call of duty to that's turbos
off<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.400> now<00:01:18.409> let's<00:01:19.409> try<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:21.590> nope

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.710 

right<00:01:35.340> now<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.399> way<00:01:36.610> this<00:01:36.789> controller<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.330> set

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
right now the way this controller is set

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.649 
right now the way this controller is set
up<00:01:37.899> it's<00:01:38.320> not<00:01:38.700> literally<00:01:39.700> turbo<00:01:40.299> because

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
up it's not literally turbo because

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.999 
up it's not literally turbo because
turbo<00:01:41.049> is<00:01:41.200> illegal<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:42.310> does<00:01:42.820> just<00:01:43.570> under<00:01:44.229> the

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
turbo is illegal it does just under the

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.940 
turbo is illegal it does just under the
rate<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.250> fire<00:01:45.610> so<00:01:46.270> turbo<00:01:46.960> mods<00:01:47.380> can't<00:01:47.710> detect

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
rate of fire so turbo mods can't detect

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.320 
rate of fire so turbo mods can't detect
it<00:01:48.070> that's<00:01:48.250> how<00:01:48.399> it<00:01:48.490> works<00:01:48.670> for<00:01:48.880> call<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.090> duty

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
it that's how it works for call of duty

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.620 
it that's how it works for call of duty
5<00:01:50.549> there's<00:01:51.549> a<00:01:51.610> burst<00:01:51.939> setting<00:01:52.390> on<00:01:52.509> here<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:55.509> a

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
5 there's a burst setting on here it's a

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:15.420 
5 there's a burst setting on here it's a
second<00:01:58.380> here's<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.470> birth<00:01:59.709> setting<00:02:14.430> around

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
second here's the birth setting around

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:36.620 
second here's the birth setting around
lash<00:02:15.880> there<00:02:16.120> we<00:02:16.239> go<00:02:17.489> that's<00:02:18.489> it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.070 

there<00:02:37.630> we<00:02:37.720> go
