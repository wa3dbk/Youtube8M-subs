as<00:01:22.049> bad<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.700> many<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> seem<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
as bad as many of you seem to think it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.740 
as bad as many of you seem to think it
is<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:26.310> video<00:01:26.549> will<00:01:26.700> come<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:26.939> after<00:01:27.540> we

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
is so that video will come out after we

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.700 
is so that video will come out after we
get<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.170> full<00:01:28.500> HD<00:01:29.130> pictures<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.720> sets<00:01:31.079> so

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
get like full HD pictures of the sets so

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.580 
get like full HD pictures of the sets so
we<00:01:32.100> know<00:01:32.250> what<00:01:32.430> they'll<00:01:32.549> actually<00:01:32.759> look<00:01:33.479> like

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
we know what they'll actually look like

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.200 
we know what they'll actually look like
but<00:01:34.590> basically<00:01:35.340> right<00:01:35.460> now<00:01:35.700> those<00:01:35.939> are<00:01:35.970> just

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
but basically right now those are just

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.770 
but basically right now those are just
um

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
um

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.840 
um
the<00:01:36.990> preliminary<00:01:37.290> images<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.490> figures

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the preliminary images they the figures

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.450 
the preliminary images they the figures
in<00:01:39.030> them<00:01:39.150> aren't<00:01:39.329> final<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.229> figures<00:01:40.500> are

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
in them aren't final the figures are

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.219 
in them aren't final the figures are
usually<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.000> placeholders<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.079> you'll
