it's<00:01:00.059> been<00:01:00.239> very<00:01:00.480> successful<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:01.109> us<00:01:01.379> at<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
it's been very successful for us at the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
it's been very successful for us at the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
shortcutted system for x1 I believe that

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.789 
shortcutted system for x1 I believe that
there's<00:01:18.090> no<00:01:18.360> magic<00:01:18.810> bullet<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.200> has<00:01:19.590> made

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
there's no magic bullet that has made

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
our 1 by drivetrain successful it's many

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.740 
our 1 by drivetrain successful it's many

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
things that all come together I think

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.070 
things that all come together I think
the<00:01:24.990> customer<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.740> x1<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.549> simply<00:01:27.509> mountain

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the customer for x1 is simply mountain

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
the customer for x1 is simply mountain

our X Inc chain ring and it's easy to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.399 
our X Inc chain ring and it's easy to
see<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.820> there<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> thicker<00:01:42.840> tooth<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
see that there is a thicker tooth and a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.810 
see that there is a thicker tooth and a
thinner<00:01:43.649> tooth<00:01:43.920> when<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> look<00:01:44.399> at<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> chain

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820

ring but it's not the only feature there
is<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> lot<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.939> other<00:01:48.210> design<00:01:48.750> elements<00:01:49.320> that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
is a lot of other design elements that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.170 
is a lot of other design elements that
go<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:49.710> both<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.340> chain<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.149> chain

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
go into both the chain and the chain

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.210 
go into both the chain and the chain
ring<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.899> make<00:01:52.049> those<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.500> work<00:01:52.740> perfectly
