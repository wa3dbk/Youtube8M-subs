00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.710 

dishwasher<00:00:00.960> was<00:00:01.380> so<00:00:01.680> clogged<00:00:02.520> that<00:00:03.270> we<00:00:03.570> were

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
dishwasher was so clogged that we were

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.849 
dishwasher was so clogged that we were
thinking<00:00:04.049> about<00:00:04.140> buying<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.710> new<00:00:04.740> ones<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.730> the

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
thinking about buying a new ones and the

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.580 
thinking about buying a new ones and the
the<00:00:07.859> spinner<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.490> goes<00:00:08.700> around<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.590> would

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
the spinner that goes around that would

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.440 
the spinner that goes around that would
be<00:00:10.769> holes<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.490> spinner<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.150> then<00:00:12.300> this

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
be holes in the spinner and then this

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.600 
be holes in the spinner and then this
very<00:00:12.870> end<00:00:13.200> there'd<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.650> tiny<00:00:14.009> little<00:00:14.219> hole

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
very end there'd be a tiny little hole

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.939 
very end there'd be a tiny little hole
that<00:00:15.150> would<00:00:15.299> get<00:00:15.509> clogged<00:00:15.809> either<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.560> or<00:00:16.740> two

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
that would get clogged either one or two

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.710 
that would get clogged either one or two
and<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.340> course<00:00:17.580> there<00:00:17.730> were<00:00:17.850> two<00:00:18.090> spinners

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
and of course there were two spinners

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.189 
and of course there were two spinners
yeah<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.439> was<00:00:19.590> hitting<00:00:20.340> my<00:00:20.520> silverware

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
yeah so that was hitting my silverware

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.320 
yeah so that was hitting my silverware
evidently<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.920> my<00:00:23.310> silverware<00:00:23.730> would<00:00:24.090> come

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
evidently and my silverware would come

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.890 
evidently and my silverware would come
out<00:00:24.680> sort<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.890> with<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> film<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.240> it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
out sort of with a film on it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.410 
out sort of with a film on it
kind<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> calcium<00:00:29.580> buildup<00:00:30.179> or

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
kind of like a calcium buildup or

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.610 
kind of like a calcium buildup or
something<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.719> would<00:00:33.899> keep<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.350> closing

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
something and so I would keep on closing

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.979 
something and so I would keep on closing
that<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> toothpick<00:00:35.880> or<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.239> real<00:00:36.510> sharp

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.190

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
sure what we're digging out here it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.030 
sure what we're digging out here it
looked<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.210> goo<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.229> never<00:01:28.439> know<00:01:28.770> maybe

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
looked like goo but you never know maybe

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.940 
looked like goo but you never know maybe
it<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.430> supposed<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.509> there<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.439> after

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it was supposed to be there so after

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.460 
it was supposed to be there so after
using<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.579> washing<00:01:33.030> machine<00:01:33.060> I'd<00:01:33.720> say<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
using that washing machine I'd say a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.550 
using that washing machine I'd say a
month<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.280> open<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.750> there's<00:01:37.079> it's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
month I open it up and there's it's

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:51.550 
month I open it up and there's it's
clean<00:01:37.950> around<00:01:44.659> well<00:01:45.659> good<00:01:45.840> good<00:01:46.380> good<00:01:46.590> good

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.859 

probably<00:01:52.490> switch<00:01:52.759> over<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.149> this<00:01:53.390> because

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
probably switch over to this because

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.880 
probably switch over to this because
it's<00:01:54.350> not<00:01:54.439> good<00:01:55.009> adding<00:01:55.700> all<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.030> song<00:01:56.890> yeah

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
it's not good adding all that song yeah

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.700 
it's not good adding all that song yeah
this<00:01:58.579> house<00:01:59.570> she<00:02:00.140> had<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.259> softener<00:02:00.680> a

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
this house she had a softener a

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:11.380 
this house she had a softener a
long<00:02:00.890> time<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:09.830> think<00:02:09.979> wow<00:02:10.340> these<00:02:10.880> dishes<00:02:11.150> look

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
long time I think wow these dishes look

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.110 
long time I think wow these dishes look
nice<00:02:11.810> she<00:02:12.230> must<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:13.040> water<00:02:13.400> softener<00:02:13.819> and

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
nice she must have a water softener and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.070 
nice she must have a water softener and
that's<00:02:14.269> what<00:02:14.510> really<00:02:15.370> got<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.810> what

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
that's what really got you and so what

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.660 
that's what really got you and so what
was<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.290> reason<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.560> chose<00:02:18.769> easy<00:02:19.040> water<00:02:19.310> over

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
was the reason you chose easy water over

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:29.320 
was the reason you chose easy water over
the<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.510> softener<00:02:20.890> okay<00:02:27.670> well<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.880> was<00:02:29.090> one

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
the the softener okay well that was one

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.479 
the the softener okay well that was one
big<00:02:29.540> reason<00:02:29.750> but<00:02:30.140> really<00:02:30.650> we<00:02:30.830> just<00:02:30.860> didn't

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
big reason but really we just didn't

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.210 
big reason but really we just didn't
like<00:02:31.670> adding<00:02:32.269> all<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.450> salt<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.739> know<00:02:33.920> shoe

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
like adding all that salt you know shoe
