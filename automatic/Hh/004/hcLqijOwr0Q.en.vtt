field using course play alright so first

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.990 
field using course play alright so first
thing<00:00:16.680> we<00:00:16.800> need<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.949> do<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.460> need<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.699> load

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
thing we need to do is we need to load

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.109 
thing we need to do is we need to load
our<00:00:18.359> outline<00:00:19.170> course<00:00:19.760> which<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.880> right<00:00:21.090> here

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
our outline course which is right here

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.340 
our outline course which is right here
so<00:00:22.109> field<00:00:22.830> outline<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.990> then<00:00:24.990> what<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.230> need

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
so field outline and then what we need

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.939 
so field outline and then what we need
to<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.039> go<00:00:26.880> into<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.539> field<00:00:28.170> work<00:00:28.410> mode<00:00:28.680> for

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
to do is go into the field work mode for

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
to do is go into the field work mode for
Baylor's<00:00:29.369> forge<00:00:29.730> wagons<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.269> bale<00:00:30.449> loaders

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
Baylor's forge wagons and bale loaders

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440 
Baylor's forge wagons and bale loaders
and<00:00:31.080> then<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.309> need<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.640> go<00:00:32.790> into<00:00:32.940> my<00:00:33.090> course

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
and then I need to go into my course

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.900 
and then I need to go into my course
generation<00:00:34.140> section<00:00:34.620> here<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.070> select<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
generation section here and select the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
generation section here and select the
appropriate<00:00:36.030> width<00:00:36.920> for<00:00:37.920> your<00:00:38.309> header<00:00:39.180> last

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
appropriate width for your header last

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.220 
appropriate width for your header last
in<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.230> case<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.680> header<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.540> 10<00:00:42.540> meters<00:00:42.989> I

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
in this case this header is 10 meters I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.920 
in this case this header is 10 meters I
believe<00:00:43.530> let's<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.489> double<00:00:44.820> check<00:00:44.850> here<00:00:45.329> is

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
believe let's just double check here is

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.700 
believe let's just double check here is
it<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.230> 10<00:00:46.469> meter<00:00:46.710> header<00:00:47.930> 10.5<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.350> put<00:00:49.590> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it a 10 meter header 10.5 so if I put it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.850 
it a 10 meter header 10.5 so if I put it
up<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.190> 10<00:00:51.000> meters<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:52.140> should<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.440> fine<00:00:52.649> so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
up to 10 meters that should be fine so

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.439 
up to 10 meters that should be fine so
we<00:00:53.010> are<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> southwest<00:00:53.879> corner<00:00:54.090> II<00:00:54.270> wanna

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
we are in the southwest corner II wanna

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.490 
we are in the southwest corner II wanna
head<00:00:54.719> north

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
head north

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.380 
head north
now<00:00:56.190> sometimes<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:56.820> happen<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.300> you

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
now sometimes will happen so if you

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.349 
now sometimes will happen so if you
generate<00:00:57.750> courses<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.320> course<00:00:58.530> play

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
generate courses with the course play

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.639 
generate courses with the course play
specifically<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> combine<00:01:01.020> 'hail<00:01:01.289> drive

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
specifically with a combine 'hail drive

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.650 
specifically with a combine 'hail drive
a<00:01:01.680> little<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.039> further<00:01:02.250> around<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.000> also

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
a little bit further around and also

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.000 
a little bit further around and also
depending<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.110> type<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> field<00:01:04.739> it's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
depending on the type of field it's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.600 
depending on the type of field it's
helpful<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.330> headland<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> I'm<00:01:08.400> gonna<00:01:08.490> do

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
helpful to do a headland so I'm gonna do

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.630 
helpful to do a headland so I'm gonna do
a<00:01:08.640> headland<00:01:09.030> before<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.710> course<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.549> I'm

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
a headland before the course so I'm

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.270 
a headland before the course so I'm
gonna<00:01:11.729> go<00:01:11.820> ahead<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.270> generate<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.900> course

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
gonna go ahead and generate the course

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.679 
gonna go ahead and generate the course
there<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.369> go<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:14.760> generated<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> course

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
there you go I've generated the course

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.280 
there you go I've generated the course
now<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:18.390> combine<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.200> gonna

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
now for this combine so what I'm gonna

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.859 
now for this combine so what I'm gonna
do<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.460> align<00:01:21.090> him<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.750> know

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
do is I'm going to align him up I know

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.399 
do is I'm going to align him up I know
where<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> first<00:01:22.500> line<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> what

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
where is the first line here so what

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.749 
where is the first line here so what
I've<00:01:25.530> done<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.979> sent<00:01:26.220> him<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.369> his<00:01:26.430> way<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
I've done is I sent him on his way and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.490 
I've done is I sent him on his way and
sometimes<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.420> need<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> do<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.110> it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
sometimes what you need to do to get it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.670 
sometimes what you need to do to get it
to<00:01:28.710> work<00:01:28.799> properly<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.000> set<00:01:30.210> him<00:01:30.680> set

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
to work properly so you just set him set

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.760 
to work properly so you just set him set
him<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:32.490> say<00:01:33.000> lower<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.570> header<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.380> make<00:01:34.560> sure

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
him or say lower the header to make sure

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.069 
him or say lower the header to make sure
it's<00:01:34.920> working<00:01:35.100> properly<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:36.479> sometimes<00:01:36.869> what

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it's working properly and sometimes what

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.649 
it's working properly and sometimes what
happens<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.009> need<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.460> adjust<00:01:38.939> certain

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
happens is you need to adjust certain

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.590 
happens is you need to adjust certain
things<00:01:40.130> for<00:01:41.130> example<00:01:41.220> where<00:01:41.790> where<00:01:42.479> it's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
things for example where where it's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270 
things for example where where it's
going<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.200> case<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.710> fine<00:01:44.009> he's

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
going so in this case it was fine he's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.219 
going so in this case it was fine he's
doing<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> headlands<00:01:45.030> heading<00:01:45.659> north<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.079> this

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
doing a headlands heading north on this

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.560 
doing a headlands heading north on this
field<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:46.710> good

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
field so that's good

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
field so that's good
subspace<00:01:48.570> all<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.869> need<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.049> do<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.530> set<00:01:50.340> up<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
subspace all you need to do to set up a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.260 
subspace all you need to do to set up a
course<00:01:52.460> for<00:01:53.460> combining<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:54.060> field

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
course for combining your field

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.999 
course for combining your field
basically<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:55.110> all<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.320> need<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.470> do<00:01:55.590> one

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
basically that's all you need to do one

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.230 
basically that's all you need to do one
of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.159> really<00:01:56.369> big<00:01:56.490> advantages<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.060> doing

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
of the really big advantages of doing

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.270 
of the really big advantages of doing
this<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.810> if<00:01:58.020> let's<00:01:58.229> say<00:01:58.350> I'm<00:01:58.680> dropping

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
this is that if let's say I'm dropping

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.510 
this is that if let's say I'm dropping
straw<00:01:59.930> like<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.170> all<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.829> need<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> do<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.219> load

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
straw like that all I need to do is load

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.490 
straw like that all I need to do is load
the<00:02:02.549> same<00:02:03.000> course<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.570> I've<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.200> created

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the same course that I've just created

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.010 
the same course that I've just created
to<00:02:05.310> use<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:06.060> stuff<00:02:07.020> like

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
to use it for stuff like

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.200 
to use it for stuff like
for<00:02:10.020> dragons<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.620> example<00:02:11.040> or<00:02:11.250> Baylor's<00:02:12.000> and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
for dragons for example or Baylor's and

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.120 
for dragons for example or Baylor's and
stuff<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.570> that<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.350> that's<00:02:13.740> one<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.070> the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
stuff like that so that's one of the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.420 
stuff like that so that's one of the
real<00:02:14.670> big<00:02:14.910> advantages<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.950> doing<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.280> so

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
real big advantages of doing that so

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.740 
real big advantages of doing that so
let's<00:02:17.580> go<00:02:17.670> ahead<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:17.910> just<00:02:18.090> save<00:02:18.270> this<00:02:18.480> course

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
let's go ahead and just save this course

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.970 
let's go ahead and just save this course
I'm<00:02:18.870> gonna<00:02:18.990> stop<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.290> guy<00:02:19.380> for<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.710> second

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
I'm gonna stop this guy for a second

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.980 
I'm gonna stop this guy for a second
here<00:02:20.480> turn<00:02:21.480> him<00:02:21.600> off

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
here turn him off

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.610 
here turn him off
save<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> course<00:02:22.620> as<00:02:24.080> that's<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.260> combi<00:02:27.560> f38

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
save the course as that's a combi f38

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.510 
save the course as that's a combi f38
let's<00:02:28.980> say<00:02:29.130> that

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
let's say that

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.210 
let's say that
so<00:02:29.820> f38<00:02:30.330> stands<00:02:30.660> with<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.930> field<00:02:31.590> number<00:02:31.770> basis

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
so f38 stands with a field number basis

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.190 
so f38 stands with a field number basis
so<00:02:32.370> now<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.300> you've<00:02:33.540> done<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.930> just

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
so now that you've done that you just

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.870 
so now that you've done that you just
let<00:02:34.320> him<00:02:34.410> do<00:02:34.560> his<00:02:34.680> thing<00:02:34.710> he'll<00:02:35.130> go<00:02:35.310> all<00:02:35.580> around

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
let him do his thing he'll go all around

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.610 
let him do his thing he'll go all around
the<00:02:35.970> field<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.480> you'll<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.110> nice<00:02:37.380> little

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
the field and you'll have a nice little

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.470 
the field and you'll have a nice little
trail<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.610> said<00:02:38.790> one<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.090> really<00:02:39.330> nice

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
trail like I said one of the really nice

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.060 
trail like I said one of the really nice
things<00:02:39.810> about<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> fact<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:40.890> you

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
things about that is the fact that you

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.060 
things about that is the fact that you
can<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.520> follow<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.960> using<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:43.110> forge<00:02:43.650> wagon

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
can just follow that using a forge wagon

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.050 
can just follow that using a forge wagon
or<00:02:44.220> using<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.850> baler<00:02:45.500> no<00:02:46.500> problem<00:02:46.980> all<00:02:47.700> right<00:02:47.760> so

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
or using a baler no problem all right so

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.120 
or using a baler no problem all right so
that's<00:02:48.150> all<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.390> have<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.600> do<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.990> use<00:02:49.920> your

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
that's all you have to do to use your

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.740 
that's all you have to do to use your
combine<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:51.140> harvest<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.230> field<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:52.650> once<00:02:52.830> again

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
combine to harvest a field so once again

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.610 
combine to harvest a field so once again
open<00:02:54.750> up<00:02:54.870> your<00:02:55.700> field<00:02:56.700> outline<00:02:57.180> like<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.690> go<00:02:58.560> to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
open up your field outline like so go to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.410 
open up your field outline like so go to
a<00:02:58.710> course<00:02:58.980> generation<00:02:59.640> select<00:03:00.270> the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
a course generation select the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.850 
a course generation select the
appropriate<00:03:00.690> width<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.350> this<00:03:01.440> case<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.770> was

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
appropriate width so in this case it was

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.190 
appropriate width so in this case it was
10<00:03:02.070> meters<00:03:02.220> choose<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> South<00:03:03.450> wet<00:03:03.720> I'll<00:03:03.900> choose

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
10 meters choose a South wet I'll choose

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.630 
10 meters choose a South wet I'll choose
a<00:03:04.230> corner<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.680> works<00:03:04.890> for<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:05.490> in<00:03:05.580> this

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
a corner that works for you it's in this

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.580 
a corner that works for you it's in this
case<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.970> was<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.300> southwest<00:03:06.750> corner<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.500> I

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
case I was in the southwest corner and I

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.800 
case I was in the southwest corner and I
was<00:03:07.710> heading<00:03:07.980> north<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.030> wanted<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.690> do

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
was heading north and I wanted it to do

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.240 
was heading north and I wanted it to do
a<00:03:09.840> headland<00:03:10.290> in<00:03:10.440> order<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.830> make<00:03:11.010> sure<00:03:11.040> it

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
a headland in order to make sure it

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.890 
a headland in order to make sure it
stayed<00:03:11.460> within<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.910> certain<00:03:12.120> area<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.720> did<00:03:12.870> a

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
stayed within a certain area so I did a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.199 
stayed within a certain area so I did a
headland<00:03:13.410> before<00:03:13.800> again<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.730> headland<00:03:15.000> just

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
headland before again the headland just

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.610 
headland before again the headland just
going<00:03:15.450> around<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.840> outside<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.350> field

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
going around the outside of the field

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.710 
going around the outside of the field
and<00:03:16.860> then<00:03:17.250> starting<00:03:17.700> going<00:03:18.030> up<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.420> down<00:03:18.540> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
and then starting going up and down the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.440 
and then starting going up and down the
field<00:03:18.900> from<00:03:19.050> then<00:03:19.260> on<00:03:19.440> all<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.940> do<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.150> generate

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
field from then on all I do is generate

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.560 
field from then on all I do is generate
course<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.110> set<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.190> into<00:03:23.370> field<00:03:24.120> work<00:03:24.330> mode

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
course and set it into field work mode

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.830 
course and set it into field work mode
and<00:03:24.750> usually<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.800> best<00:03:25.950> thing<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.160> do<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.490> to

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
and usually the best thing to do is to

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.780 
and usually the best thing to do is to
is<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.770> start<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.459> combine<00:03:30.240> up<00:03:31.020> and<00:03:31.790> also

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
is to start the combine up and also

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.570 
is to start the combine up and also
start<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.570> header<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.160> usually<00:03:35.160> that's<00:03:35.340> the

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
start the header and usually that's the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.850 
start the header and usually that's the
most<00:03:35.850> effective<00:03:36.240> way<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.630> work<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.260> making<00:03:37.739> it

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
most effective way of work of making it

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.800 
most effective way of work of making it
work<00:03:38.070> properly<00:03:38.310> basically<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.150> there<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.690> go

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
work properly basically so there you go

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.570 
work properly basically so there you go
and<00:03:40.290> that's<00:03:40.620> how<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:41.390> put<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.450> combine<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:46.580> cut

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
and that's how you put a combine to cut

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.040
