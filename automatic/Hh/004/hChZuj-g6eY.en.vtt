00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
especially when it's a good girl who I

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.330 
especially when it's a good girl who I
think<00:04:30.660> is<00:04:30.930> pretty<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.260> like<00:04:31.620> can't<00:04:31.950> talk<00:04:32.190> to

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.980 
them anymore oh no I'm definitely the
same<00:04:34.110> way<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.620> I<00:04:34.680> think<00:04:34.710> it's<00:04:35.100> because<00:04:35.690> like<00:04:36.690> I

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
same way and I think it's because like I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.070 
same way and I think it's because like I
just<00:04:37.290> always<00:04:37.710> wanted<00:04:38.370> female<00:04:39.270> friends
