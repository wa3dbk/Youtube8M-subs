out move it and I do that maybe three or
four<00:01:46.350> times<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.240> get<00:01:48.720> some<00:01:48.890> regular

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
four times and then I get some regular

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.960 
four times and then I get some regular
tap<00:01:50.189> water<00:01:50.220> clean<00:01:51.030> tap<00:01:51.299> water<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.970> move

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
tap water clean tap water and just move

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.179 
tap water clean tap water and just move
it<00:01:54.119> again<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.810> rinse<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.200> out<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.950> salt

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it again and rinse it out so the salt

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.550 
it again and rinse it out so the salt
doesn't<00:01:56.520> stay<00:01:56.759> inside<00:01:57.119> your<00:01:57.180> nose<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:58.350> only

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
doesn't stay inside your nose the only

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.020 
doesn't stay inside your nose the only
thing<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.950> guess<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.340> bothers<00:01:59.759> me<00:01:59.790> is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
thing that I guess that bothers me is

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.850 
thing that I guess that bothers me is
that<00:02:00.119> when<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.360> flip<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.719> up<00:02:01.020> since<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.770> still

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that when I flip it up since it's still

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.179 
that when I flip it up since it's still
