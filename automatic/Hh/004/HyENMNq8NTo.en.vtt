00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:26.300
 I think you want to do minecraft 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.570
 I just touched the tutorial a little 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.880
 Well ぇ somehow 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.900
 Because I think that was the arm the invitation of the much Utte you can live in its own way 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.560
 Create a new world from 10 years now 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.360
 I would like to make a Minecraft debut by all means Thank you in the next 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.870
 That's the new world Hui 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.870
 Thickness 3 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.750
 Yes i'm ok 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.079
 I once I Well I it's a I also I 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.600
 Because I like the game lively 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:03.579
 Not looking and crispy the play-by-play of sound Mine craft of various people in Nari other Nemakari 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.430
 So let's decide a little bit 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.480
 Then 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.820
 Name is 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:16.560
 Abe Bear 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:18.450
 The game mode is survival in the Abe room without spending so much time 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.220
 Normal difficulty 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.840
 Teck car back 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:30.030
 Yeah we've got a variety of the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.630
 No, maybe this is probably the paid version and the sky rim pack, or I thought that it was the Yan Ryu Ryuban 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.360
 Because 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.990
 Well, here is the first time 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.350
 From before 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.299
 Let's go with the imposing sound orthodox texture 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.299
 The online game is a bird's eye view 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.590
 do it 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.590
 So it might be good Let's hereabouts be messing around here 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.520
 If you can see I though I was playing around just because hereabouts Henwasune do not know something 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.170
 is not it 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.850
 Decide this world in seed value, which is there Netto 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.350
 There is a lot of water that you can see from the constituent materials 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.250
 I like or many genre is often or desert 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.460
 It is decided that such a seed value is finished 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.810
 Because it means 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.850
 Although random is also good, I would like to differentiate slightly from other people 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.910
 Between 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.880
 Fire edge 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:31.810
 Abe Aberi national ok that is not an eating room 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:34.860
 Because I did not understand well here for a moment 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.860
 Bonus chess and whistle 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.350
 I feel like this now ok 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:48.180
 It's not a mountain, but it's not a long time ago. 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:51.080
 Chronologically speaking, suitable Hey, once I tutorial play start but I know a little while ago 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.270
 It had also seen little in the world generated 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.990
 If we'll be fine without becoming Well I also secondary will somehow become 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.690
 Since only I had to remove all if you do not know Toka this bonus chest This only 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:06.280
 I put on a little 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:10.270
 Well, I wonder if this is like this , because I'm off-line basically 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.460
 I 'm going to go by potch play so it's ok ok ok 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.520

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.660
 Though 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.270
 Hey, because it is a creative game of minecraft in Man 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.819
 I 'm looking forward to it 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.740
 Though it is said that real mine craft 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.600
 After all, it is because it is not a production . 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.350
 So let's cut the wood with gasgas 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.920
 Let's build a Kato Aredane house and do our best 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.920
