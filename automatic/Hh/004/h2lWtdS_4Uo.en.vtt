it<00:00:08.260> is<00:00:08.469> possible<00:00:09.540> if<00:00:10.540> you<00:00:10.660> have<00:00:10.900> the<00:00:11.020> coupling

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
it is possible if you have the coupling

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.629 
it is possible if you have the coupling
loose<00:00:11.889> like<00:00:12.610> this<00:00:12.820> two<00:00:13.690> files<00:00:14.019> dropper<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:15.610> a

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
loose like this two files dropper with a

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.249 
loose like this two files dropper with a
slight<00:00:15.969> groove<00:00:16.290> about<00:00:17.290> 1.5<00:00:18.220> millimeters<00:00:19.259> from

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259 
slight groove about 1.5 millimeters from

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.370 
slight groove about 1.5 millimeters from
the<00:00:20.349> very<00:00:20.619> bottom<00:00:21.009> of<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.310> dropper<00:00:22.140> there<00:00:23.140> is

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
the very bottom of the dropper there is

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.109 
the very bottom of the dropper there is
the<00:00:24.600> groove<00:00:26.189> not<00:00:27.189> sure<00:00:27.369> how<00:00:27.490> the<00:00:27.550> color<00:00:27.849> comes

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
the groove not sure how the color comes

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.450 
the groove not sure how the color comes
up<00:00:28.300> but<00:00:28.510> as<00:00:29.439> you<00:00:29.619> file<00:00:29.859> through<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.220> black

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
up but as you file through the black

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.100 
up but as you file through the black
paint<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.610> can<00:00:33.790> probably<00:00:34.059> see<00:00:34.420> that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
paint then you can probably see that

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.939 
paint then you can probably see that
it's<00:00:35.320> more<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.830> a<00:00:36.010> brass<00:00:36.340> rather<00:00:36.940> than<00:00:37.180> steel

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
it's more of a brass rather than steel

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.560 
it's more of a brass rather than steel
material<00:00:38.949> that's<00:00:39.129> underneath<00:00:39.400> and<00:00:40.180> a<00:00:40.210> little

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
material that's underneath and a little

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.390 
material that's underneath and a little
groove<00:00:40.780> on<00:00:41.049> each<00:00:41.350> side<00:00:41.650> of<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:41.890> drop-in<00:00:42.250> is

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
groove on each side of the drop-in is

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.360 
groove on each side of the drop-in is
just<00:00:42.729> a<00:00:43.059> key<00:00:43.589> to<00:00:44.589> hold<00:00:44.830> the<00:00:45.280> staple<00:00:46.949> now<00:00:47.949> I'm

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
just a key to hold the staple now I'm

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.460 
just a key to hold the staple now I'm
reusing<00:00:48.909> a<00:00:49.330> staple<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:49.930> I've<00:00:50.110> just<00:00:50.260> taken

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
reusing a staple that I've just taken

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.509 
reusing a staple that I've just taken
out<00:00:50.739> or<00:00:50.920> something

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
out or something

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.299 
out or something
and<00:00:52.420> so<00:00:52.869> I<00:00:52.900> grip<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.619> end<00:00:53.799> and<00:00:54.510> wrap<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:57.250> around

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
and so I grip the end and wrap it around

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.570 
and so I grip the end and wrap it around
so<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.799> get<00:01:00.250> a<00:01:00.460> loop<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:02.350> that's<00:01:02.769> the<00:01:03.100> bit

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
so that I get a loop and that's the bit

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.580 
so that I get a loop and that's the bit
which<00:01:03.850> is<00:01:03.879> attracted<00:01:04.510> by<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.720> magnet<00:01:05.140> between

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
which is attracted by the magnet between

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.969 
which is attracted by the magnet between
the<00:01:05.710> tracks<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:07.060> other<00:01:07.210> end<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.930> just<00:01:07.990> folded

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
the tracks the other end is just folded

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.680 
the tracks the other end is just folded
over<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.390> that<00:01:11.350> it<00:01:11.530> will<00:01:11.770> grip<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.970> bottom<00:01:13.510> of

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
over so that it will grip the bottom of

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.980 
over so that it will grip the bottom of
the<00:01:13.810> dropper<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:16.770> being<00:01:17.770> steel<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.540> material

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
the dropper now being steel the material

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.350 
the dropper now being steel the material
of<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.140> staples<00:01:20.650> will<00:01:20.800> fatigue<00:01:20.980> and<00:01:22.650> so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of the staples will fatigue and so

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.550 
of the staples will fatigue and so
rather<00:01:25.360> than<00:01:25.510> using<00:01:25.690> secondhand<00:01:26.260> ones<00:01:26.500> you

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
rather than using secondhand ones you

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.340 
rather than using secondhand ones you
might<00:01:26.710> want<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:26.950> use<00:01:27.100> new<00:01:27.340> ones<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:29.080> that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
might want to use new ones so that

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.820 
might want to use new ones so that
you're<00:01:30.340> not<00:01:30.460> going<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.730> run<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.300> risk<00:01:31.450> of<00:01:31.830> it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
you're not going to run the risk of it

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.740 
you're not going to run the risk of it
fracturing<00:01:33.400> at<00:01:33.670> that<00:01:33.909> point<00:01:34.150> there<00:01:34.450> because

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
fracturing at that point there because

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.750 
fracturing at that point there because
it's<00:01:35.050> been<00:01:35.230> bent<00:01:35.500> too<00:01:35.710> much<00:01:35.890> been<00:01:36.280> taken<00:01:36.310> out

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
it's been bent too much been taken out

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.450 
it's been bent too much been taken out
or<00:01:36.970> something<00:01:37.300> I<00:01:37.480> know<00:01:38.050> some<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.650> my<00:01:38.830> friends

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
or something I know some of my friends

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.370 
or something I know some of my friends
who<00:01:39.760> like<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.450> use<00:01:40.540> secondhand<00:01:40.990> because

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
who like to use secondhand because

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.880 
who like to use secondhand because
they're<00:01:41.590> very<00:01:41.740> much<00:01:41.950> into<00:01:42.190> recycling<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
they're very much into recycling the

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.890 
they're very much into recycling the
staple<00:01:45.370> is<00:01:45.550> then<00:01:46.409> poked<00:01:48.450> over<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.540> end<00:01:49.690> of<00:01:49.840> the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
staple is then poked over the end of the

staple is then poked over the end of the
dropper<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:52.270> squeezed<00:01:52.690> on

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.190 

that's<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.150> part<00:02:00.420> formed<00:02:02.930> staple<00:02:03.930> paper

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that's the part formed staple paper

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.910 
that's the part formed staple paper
staple<00:02:05.330> if<00:02:06.330> you're<00:02:06.570> not<00:02:06.870> recycling<00:02:07.560> them<00:02:07.710> then

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
staple if you're not recycling them then

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.950 
staple if you're not recycling them then
you<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.580> take<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.940> off<00:02:09.800> bunch<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:11.009> staples

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.510 

you<00:02:15.960> don't<00:02:16.080> file<00:02:16.590> through<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> dropper<00:02:17.250> too

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
you don't file through the dropper too

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.650 
you don't file through the dropper too
far<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.000> risk<00:02:21.980> risk<00:02:23.000> actually<00:02:24.000> filing<00:02:24.420> all

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
far and risk risk actually filing all

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.060 
far and risk risk actually filing all
the<00:02:24.720> way<00:02:24.840> through<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:27.530> my<00:02:28.530> fingers<00:02:28.590> are<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.950> bit

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
the way through it my fingers are a bit

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.690 
the way through it my fingers are a bit
big<00:02:29.220> for<00:02:29.250> this

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
big for this

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.770 
big for this
so<00:02:30.650> squeezing<00:02:31.650> up<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.330> other<00:02:33.330> end<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.690> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
so squeezing up the other end of the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.420 
so squeezing up the other end of the
staple<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:36.920> hooking<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.010> over<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
staple like that hooking it over the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:46.070 
staple like that hooking it over the
dropper<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:40.200> then<00:02:41.900> squeezing<00:02:42.900> up<00:02:42.989> there<00:02:45.080> like

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
dropper and then squeezing up there like

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.370 
dropper and then squeezing up there like
that<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:47.930> it's<00:02:48.930> mechanically<00:02:49.530> attached<00:02:50.040> now

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
that and it's mechanically attached now

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.470 
that and it's mechanically attached now
with<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:54.620> big<00:02:55.620> clumsy<00:02:55.890> fingers<00:02:56.300> so<00:02:57.300> it's

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
with the big clumsy fingers so it's

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.170 
with the big clumsy fingers so it's
mechanically<00:02:57.959> attached<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.590> bottom<00:02:59.180> but

mechanically attached to the bottom but

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.850 
mechanically attached to the bottom but
I<00:03:00.360> always<00:03:00.540> apply<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.870> little<00:03:01.230> bit<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.500> superglue

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
I always apply a little bit of superglue

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.970 
I always apply a little bit of superglue
to<00:03:02.160> make<00:03:02.310> sure<00:03:02.489> it's<00:03:02.700> fully<00:03:02.910> held<00:03:03.239> in<00:03:03.390> place<00:03:03.980> no

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
to make sure it's fully held in place no

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.009 
to make sure it's fully held in place no
in<00:03:05.040> fact<00:03:05.190> when<00:03:05.430> I'm<00:03:05.519> doing<00:03:05.730> them<00:03:05.900> there's<00:03:06.900> two

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
in fact when I'm doing them there's two

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.780 
in fact when I'm doing them there's two
things<00:03:07.170> one<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:07.890> likely<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
things one is it's likely that the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.699 
things one is it's likely that the
coupling<00:03:09.570> has<00:03:09.810> already<00:03:10.140> attached<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.650> a

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
coupling has already attached to a

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.530 
coupling has already attached to a
vehicle<00:03:10.830> as<00:03:11.310> in<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:11.640> case<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:12.060> know<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.390> will

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
vehicle as in this case I know that will

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.539 
vehicle as in this case I know that will
pull<00:03:12.780> out<00:03:12.930> because<00:03:13.380> it's<00:03:13.709> any<00:03:13.980> imports

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
pull out because it's any imports

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.360 
pull out because it's any imports
they're<00:03:15.269> not<00:03:15.360> always<00:03:15.540> any<00:03:15.810> air<00:03:15.989> pockets<00:03:16.370> so

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
they're not always any air pockets so

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.420 
they're not always any air pockets so
generally<00:03:18.000> what<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.209> do<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.690> actually<00:03:19.250> take<00:03:20.250> the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
generally what I do is actually take the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.840 
generally what I do is actually take the
dropper<00:03:20.700> off<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.780> coupling<00:03:22.310> they<00:03:23.310> do<00:03:23.370> spin

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
dropper off the coupling they do spin

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.360 
dropper off the coupling they do spin
off<00:03:26.989> if<00:03:27.989> you're<00:03:28.230> not<00:03:28.590> sure<00:03:28.769> about<00:03:28.890> doing<00:03:29.280> it

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
off if you're not sure about doing it

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:40.220 
off if you're not sure about doing it
then<00:03:29.519> just<00:03:30.390> do<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.840> with<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> pair<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.530> players

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.940 

that's<00:03:41.230> not<00:03:41.410> springing<00:03:41.830> off<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:44.260> only<00:03:44.739> thing

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
that's not springing off the only thing

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.320 
that's not springing off the only thing
you<00:03:45.040> have<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.310> look<00:03:45.400> out<00:03:45.610> for<00:03:45.849> is<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.209> when

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
you have to look out for is that when

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.610 
you have to look out for is that when
you<00:03:46.450> put<00:03:46.630> it<00:03:46.750> back<00:03:46.780> on<00:03:47.080> and<00:03:47.200> you<00:03:47.260> put<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.590> back

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
you put it back on and you put it back

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.640 
you put it back on and you put it back
on<00:03:47.860> properly<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:49.300> that<00:03:49.330> it<00:03:49.660> is<00:03:49.930> very<00:03:50.260> free<00:03:50.620> to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.890 
on properly so that it is very free to
move<00:03:50.950> if<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.940> doesn't<00:03:52.180> go<00:03:52.270> on<00:03:52.300> properly<00:03:52.750> then

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
move if it doesn't go on properly then

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.710 
move if it doesn't go on properly then
it<00:03:53.050> will<00:03:53.200> still<00:03:53.560> be<00:03:54.599> clipped<00:03:55.599> in<00:03:57.060> or<00:03:58.060> it'll<00:03:58.480> not

it will still be clipped in or it'll not

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.820 
it will still be clipped in or it'll not
clips<00:03:59.019> in<00:03:59.200> it'd<00:03:59.380> be<00:03:59.590> very<00:04:00.120> awkward<00:04:01.500> not<00:04:02.500> moving

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830

wagons there's something I'm part way
through<00:06:02.830> modifying<00:06:03.930> 50<00:06:04.930> new<00:06:05.080> wheels<00:06:05.319> and<00:06:05.560> I've

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
through modifying 50 new wheels and I've

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:12.089 
through modifying 50 new wheels and I've
cut<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.370> door<00:06:06.580> open<00:06:09.240> and<00:06:10.240> so<00:06:10.569> are<00:06:10.930> these<00:06:11.139> it

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
cut the door open and so are these it

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.129 
cut the door open and so are these it
will<00:06:12.220> be<00:06:12.370> necessary<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.819> glue<00:06:13.449> some<00:06:13.690> plastic

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
will be necessary to glue some plastic

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:20.760 
will be necessary to glue some plastic
hard<00:06:14.349> on<00:06:14.910> under<00:06:15.910> touch<00:06:16.150> the<00:06:17.849> the<00:06:19.500> coupling<00:06:20.500> so

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
hard on under touch the the coupling so

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.600 
hard on under touch the the coupling so
I've<00:06:20.919> got<00:06:21.099> a<00:06:21.130> packet<00:06:21.639> of<00:06:21.789> coupons<00:06:22.210> ready<00:06:23.550> with

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.740 

and<00:06:27.610> I've<00:06:27.699> already<00:06:27.849> converted<00:06:29.310> some<00:06:30.310> items

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
and I've already converted some items

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.920 
and I've already converted some items
again<00:06:31.750> such<00:06:32.259> as<00:06:32.500> this<00:06:32.680> break<00:06:33.460> run<00:06:33.930> that's

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
again such as this break run that's

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.559 
again such as this break run that's
already<00:06:35.259> converted<00:06:35.680> and<00:06:36.069> works<00:06:36.220> quite<00:06:36.520> nicely

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:36.569 
already converted and works quite nicely

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.289 
already converted and works quite nicely
if<00:06:37.569> using<00:06:37.930> this<00:06:38.050> system
