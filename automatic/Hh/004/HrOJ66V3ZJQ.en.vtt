00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.850 
but what I'm experiencing in here is
splitting<00:00:32.640> these<00:00:33.570> dang<00:00:33.960> tomatoes<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.680> mine

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
splitting these dang tomatoes in mine

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.250 
splitting these dang tomatoes in mine
are<00:00:35.070> splitting<00:00:35.640> now<00:00:35.850> I've<00:00:36.659> had<00:00:36.839> this<00:00:36.989> problem

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
are splitting now I've had this problem

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.049 
are splitting now I've had this problem
before<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> dirt<00:00:38.190> greenhouse<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.500> it

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
before in the dirt greenhouse and it

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.290 
before in the dirt greenhouse and it
seems<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.409> if<00:00:43.409> I'm<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:43.979> mistaken<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.940> it's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
seems like if I'm not mistaken it's it's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.020 
seems like if I'm not mistaken it's it's
just<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:46.890> know<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.010> me<00:00:47.339> regulating<00:00:47.909> them

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
just you know it's me regulating them

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.820 
just you know it's me regulating them
the<00:00:48.329> water<00:00:48.570> improperly<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:49.350> something

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
the water improperly or something

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.229 
the water improperly or something
because<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.309> seems<00:00:50.580> like<00:00:50.850> every<00:00:51.379> time<00:00:53.239> that

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
because it seems like every time that

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.719 
because it seems like every time that
you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:55.229> I<00:00:55.259> let<00:00:55.470> him<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.949> give<00:00:56.519> him<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
you know I let him go and I give him a

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.840 
you know I let him go and I give him a
great<00:00:56.879> big<00:00:57.290> you<00:00:58.290> know<00:00:58.409> a<00:00:58.439> real<00:00:58.799> big<00:00:59.250> blast<00:00:59.640> of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
great big you know a real big blast of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.530 
great big you know a real big blast of
water<00:01:00.059> ah<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.549> get<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> splitting<00:01:03.239> thing

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
water ah and I get the splitting thing

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.109 
water ah and I get the splitting thing
happening<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.250> it's

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
happening and it's just it's

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.380 
happening and it's just it's
disappointing<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.579> haven't<00:01:09.119> noticed

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
disappointing right so I haven't noticed

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.859 
disappointing right so I haven't noticed
this<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:10.189> with<00:01:11.189> hydroponics<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.299> don't

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this at all with hydroponics and I don't

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.190 
this at all with hydroponics and I don't
know<00:01:12.990> whether<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:15.049> like<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
know whether that's because like the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.870 
know whether that's because like the
moisture<00:01:16.560> level<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.979> them<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.250> probably<00:01:17.640> just

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
moisture level in them is probably just

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
moisture level in them is probably just
always<00:01:18.210> dead<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.840> same<00:01:19.049> right<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.710> mean

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
always dead on the same right I mean

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.559 
always dead on the same right I mean
they're<00:01:19.979> grown<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.310> water<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:20.759> bang<00:01:20.999> it's

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
they're grown in water right bang it's

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:25.249 
they're grown in water right bang it's
always<00:01:21.840> available<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.579> I<00:01:23.579> think<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.990> maybe

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
always available so I think that's maybe

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.349 
always available so I think that's maybe
why<00:01:25.679> I<00:01:25.710> haven't<00:01:26.039> seen<00:01:26.249> them<00:01:26.399> split<00:01:26.819> anyway<00:01:27.179> and

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
why I haven't seen them split anyway and

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.760 
why I haven't seen them split anyway and
it<00:01:27.569> seems<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.960> me<00:01:28.079> in<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> dirt<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.619> they

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it seems to me in the dirt like they

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.050 
it seems to me in the dirt like they
kind<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.009> dry<00:01:29.219> out<00:01:29.399> a<00:01:29.429> little<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.789> really

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
kind of dry out a little on a really

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.179 
kind of dry out a little on a really
really<00:01:30.210> hot<00:01:30.450> day<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.689> water<00:01:31.020> them<00:01:31.200> banging

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
really hot day you water them banging

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.709 
really hot day you water them banging
that<00:01:32.369> night<00:01:32.609> they<00:01:32.789> pop<00:01:33.030> open<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.539> think

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
that night they pop open and I think

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.359 
that night they pop open and I think
it's<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.899> just<00:01:34.109> sucking<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.829> much<00:01:34.950> doggone

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
it's I just sucking up so much doggone

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.319 
it's I just sucking up so much doggone
moisture<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.880> know<00:01:36.090> cuz<00:01:36.299> they're<00:01:36.539> thirsty

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
moisture you know cuz they're thirsty

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.690 
moisture you know cuz they're thirsty
yeah<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.659> they<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:40.020> let<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.590> skins<00:01:41.429> don't

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
yeah that they just let the skins don't

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120 
yeah that they just let the skins don't
stretch<00:01:41.969> and<00:01:42.149> they<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.389> pop<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.920> think<00:01:43.920> that's

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
stretch and they just pop I think that's

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.139 
stretch and they just pop I think that's
what's<00:01:44.840> guessing<00:01:45.840> really<00:01:46.189> but<00:01:47.189> yeah<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.429> seem

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
what's guessing really but yeah I seem

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.959 
what's guessing really but yeah I seem
to<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.569> problem<00:01:49.490> just<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.609> here<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.880> the
