that's<00:02:32.560> actually<00:02:32.710> designed<00:02:33.100> for<00:02:33.340> us<00:02:33.460> when<00:02:33.580> it

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
that's actually designed for us when it

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.370 
that's actually designed for us when it
goes<00:02:33.760> against<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.240> zip<00:02:34.420> if<00:02:34.960> there<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.260> any

goes against the zip if there is any

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.720 
goes against the zip if there is any
penetration<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.980> water<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.430> comes<00:02:36.550> through

penetration of water that comes through

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.950 
penetration of water that comes through
the<00:02:36.820> top<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.180> suits<00:02:37.360> runs<00:02:37.690> down<00:02:37.870> this

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
the top of the suits runs down this

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.380 
the top of the suits runs down this
panel<00:02:38.320> and<00:02:38.650> runs<00:02:38.980> out<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.250> suit<00:02:39.460> thus<00:02:40.210> keeping

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
panel and runs out the suit thus keeping

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.530 
panel and runs out the suit thus keeping
the<00:02:40.630> chart<00:02:40.810> as<00:02:40.960> warm<00:02:41.140> as<00:02:41.230> possible<00:02:42.480> well<00:02:43.480> the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the chart as warm as possible well the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.590 
the chart as warm as possible well the
zip<00:02:43.750> goes<00:02:43.930> up<00:02:44.760> two<00:02:45.760> pieces<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.030> material<00:02:46.150> back

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
zip goes up two pieces of material back

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.900 
zip goes up two pieces of material back
overlock<00:02:47.410> that's<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.860> just<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:48.550> again<00:02:48.760> the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
overlock that's it just so again the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.970 
overlock that's it just so again the
whole<00:02:49.000> idea<00:02:49.360> is<00:02:49.420> your<00:02:49.630> minime<00:02:49.980> minimizing

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
whole idea is your minime minimizing

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.500 
whole idea is your minime minimizing
rather<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.490> amount<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.760> water<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.120> can

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
rather the amount of water that can

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.850 
rather the amount of water that can
actually<00:02:52.660> get<00:02:52.870> into<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.170> wet<00:02:53.320> suit<00:02:53.500> yourself

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
actually get into the wet suit yourself

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.070 
actually get into the wet suit yourself
so<00:02:54.490> really<00:02:54.820> really<00:02:55.120> nice<00:02:55.300> key<00:02:55.570> features<00:02:55.960> are

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
so really really nice key features are

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.770 
so really really nice key features are
there<00:02:56.220> real<00:02:57.220> nice<00:02:57.370> coloring<00:02:57.790> real<00:02:58.180> nice<00:02:58.330> logos

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
there real nice coloring real nice logos

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.100 
there real nice coloring real nice logos
and<00:03:00.270> exceptional<00:03:01.270> value<00:03:01.540> for<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.900> price<00:03:02.050> that
