00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.290
 Hello everyone, today we'll go and see 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.480
 together how it works and diffuser for 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.660
 aromatherapy has a base of a trans 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.020
 smith this object is useful for 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.259
 spread essential oils also one 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.260
 ionization function of the area ea 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.900
 LED lights that have a function 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.329
 of color therapy we go to see the 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.980
 what package contains 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.280
 we open the box on top there is a 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.430
 cardboard that we are going to remove the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.370
 the first thing we find is the egg 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.930
 diffuser that is so composed to one 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.020
 upper part is a lower part 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:08.820
 then still in the package 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:11.000
 at the base raising the cards 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000
 I fear 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:24.640
 a measuring cup for pouring water 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:27.100
 inside the diffuser e 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.750
 the power adapter to attach 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.750
 the appliance but the power outlet 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.399
 obviously inside the package 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.929
 you will also find the booklet of the 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.929
 instructions in more than 2 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:50.069
 let's see how it works in Rome 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:55.750
 first of all we carry out the cable 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:57.789
 of the feeder you see is a simple one 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.009
 power supply that will be connected to the 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.799
 power outlet 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.140
 before filling the diffuser with 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.929
 the water to avoid precisely that the water 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.970
 let's turn over let's remove the 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.250
 cover 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.950
 reverse the diffuser below 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.870
 we find we say the inlet of the outlet 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.269
 of current 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.370
 here we are going to insert the cable a 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.840
 this point we are going to connect to the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.840
 the power supply socket 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.670
 Now 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.640
 we're going to fill the measuring cup for a 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.849
 maximum of 80 ml of water this is the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.170
 maximum speaker capacity 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.530
 inside the diffuser you will see that 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.290
 there is a line that shows you that over 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.510
 that threshold the water must not go 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.480
 hence the maximum capacity of this 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.390
 diffusion is 80 ml for a duration 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.129
 think of a good five hours of circulation 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.129
 but take the water 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.750
 here they are the measuring cup to wonder 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:23.340
 pour the water inside the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:26.460
 diffuser in maximum capacity 80 ml a 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.350
 this point I will take 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.470
 an essential oil of your favorites 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:37.760
 which can be me in this case like 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:40.560
 eucalitto I will go to put two three 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.910
 maximum four drops then exaggerated 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:49.960
 depends on three types of oils 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:52.630
 let's make three drops at this point I'll go 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.140
 to put the lid on 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.610
 diffuser the speaker has two 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.400
 switches 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.880
 I don't know if you can see two 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.270
 one separate switches for the 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.190
 dissemination operation 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.980
 of aromatherapy and ionization cloth 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.160
 of valorisation and the other for the 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:18.190
 operation of the two LEDs 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.280
 switches can be activated 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.620
 also separately in the sense that 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.770
 if I want to run only the 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.590
 spreading device I can do it 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.810
 excluding the luminous leds in this case 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.450
 let's see how they work 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.840
 both then the right switch 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.510
 I activate the aromatherapy function 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.490
 I don't know if you can see ionization 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:48.430
 perhaps the luminous LEDs vi also light up 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.520
 will appear more obvious 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.330
 the steam outlet the switch of 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.550
 left will activate the color therapy and 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.490
 very simple as you see operation 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.169
 but to turn off the light to show you 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.640
 with more intensity 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.600
 the effect of this wonderful 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.600
 spread 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.550
 how can you see the effect 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.879
 Chromotherapy works like this from 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.479
 a lot is equipped with LED lights that 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:25.499
 they vary intermittently as they change 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:28.919
 from one color to the other this gives a 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:31.469
 chromotherapy effect if someone is 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:35.210
 interested will find that colors 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:37.259
 have effects on mood 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.860
 what the appliance allows 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.789
 doing is also about fixing a color 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.819
 favorite 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.949
 if for example I in this in this 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:50.759
 day I need energy and I have 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:53.279
 want red color when it arrives 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.469
 the red color crushes again 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:58.110
 the left switches with note 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:02.119
 which activates and deactivates the LED 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.119
 bright and in this way 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.819
 in this way the appliance will stop 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.620
 the color I've chosen here 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.310
 let's pretend now red of course 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.259
 no longer does we do that it is 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:18.229
 let's see what the perfect blue is 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:20.330
 then I click the button again 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:22.460
 left and at this point 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.879
 the appliance will stop me on that 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.879
 color 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.729
 as you can see the appliance is a lot 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:33.030
 simple very important thing 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:36.100
 the appliance is equipped with a device 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:39.190
 which interrupts the operation 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:43.120
 when the water inside the 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:47.110
 tank finished this means that no 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.780
 you have to worry about turning off rosin 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.600
 I forget you don't 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.639
 peck out of the house or even if 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.470
 you are ungrateful forget to have it 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:59.380
 a lot to the 100 in the moment in which 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.979
 the water automatically ends the 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.690
 old interrupts its operation 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:08.979
 that's all 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.630
 as you can see it's a lot of use 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:14.080
 simple 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.210
 now I put the function back on 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.460
 rotation colors 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.830
 now it's off because we're the functions 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:25.030
 I am on fixed color and I turn off the 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.790
 color now not re-ignite and as you can 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.240
 to see 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:32.810
 the appliance returns again to his 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.650
 color rotation passing from a 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.650
 color to the other
