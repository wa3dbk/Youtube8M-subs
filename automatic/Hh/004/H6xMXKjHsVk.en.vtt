00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.980
 manufacturer is he has despite his 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.169
 own navigation app 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.330
 That this is just one out offers for free 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:15.249
 offline navigation in a large number 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.529
 countries unfortunately not world but 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.180
 in Europe in most countries and in 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.740
 some more handy countries 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.480
 in this video I will just go 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.340
 see how this navigation software that 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.380
 is based on the tomtom cards 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.449
 is just saying something about the 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.009
 Availability of the software 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.660
 syntess you available for all first 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.250
 Phones with a screen of 5 inches or 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.660
 larger they can also be very cheap 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.100
 I have telephones here on the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.840
 liquid z500 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.660
 I with Z500 is a telephone of approximately 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.160
 120 euros so you can just do it too 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.980
 liguigia product is also delicious 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.410
 t700 and yes basically all 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.940
 incoming phones from one 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.330
 says go look at the interface of 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.790
 the software then stands out that yes 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.530
 fairly well divided and you 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.040
 do not have super possibilities but 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.900
 well 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.730
 yes most what I find very awkward 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.330
 think is that you first need a country 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.880
 choose 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.530
 that is possible here it goes per region that 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.420
 is fine in itself but you have to order after 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.869
 To go to another country you need two levels 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.759
 look deeply when you come here for example 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.030
 want a point of interest in the city 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.189
 to have 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.659
 I used Brussels once that is possible 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.170
 now just hand clicking even though it is 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.490
 in Belgium 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.259
 but if I go find another city 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.979
 more than you stand for the new netherlands 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:21.999
 set 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.490
 she is not going to be a stone in belgium 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.439
 and furthermore you can just find one 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.969
 recent destination to vga favorite 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.310
 so that's all fine 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.179
 Imagine going to the Jaarbeurs square 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.850
 ignore that I happen to use 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:39.340
 click on go and what is very handy 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.979
 is that you can add additional waypoints 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.240
 insert here further in terms of 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.639
 route planning is not so bad 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.619
 do a lot you can avoid things yes 

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:53.439
 For example, quickly avoid WFM toll road 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.030
 avoid highway et cetera 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.049
 you can choose between the fastest or 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.729
 shortest route and if you choose that then 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.469
 will immediately do the pressure to the hold 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.520
 the settings up a bit 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.499
 but what you can do is those two 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.319
 add dots 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:12.060
 press the waypoint for example 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.810
 point of interest to me 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.140
 we want a hotel for example it 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.730
 lloyd hotel fine then you get it first 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.110
 see the map and what to do next 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.110
 is pressing the field here 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.260
 oh and then you can do some things here 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.000
 but also the waypoint 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.769
 then it will be good for you then 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.880
 does it come at the end of your route light 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.380
 instead of between 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.849
 so that's a little less convenient but you can 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.530
 that simply easy to exchange so that 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.120
 they don't give them such a big deal because 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.709
 I find it annoying that you like you 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.569
 not on and 2 point rick through that minute 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.920
 but just go that he then your whole route 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.569
 knew it is if you do that by accident 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.799
 lost your route 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.799
 continue as you navigate 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.560
 has now lost another route and who 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.599
 now also not really an easy and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.830
 find my route overview more so me 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.880
 you get the beginning but after that it is 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.239
 it just gone 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.970
 now navigated it here 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.459
 I started well and then find that I 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.560
 here you can switch between your distance 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.720
 whether your arrival time or how long you are left 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.100
 that is nice in itself 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.840
 who own your maximum speed 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.920
 speed instructions here can 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.700
 of course also just on its side 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.380
 throw and then navigate through that again 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.569
 that is all fine with us 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.359
 you can switch between 2D and 3D you can 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.769
 also zooming in and out but really good 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:39.030
 route over says that you will not get 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.859
 to you you can go further in route planning 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.859
 you do a demo of your route so that 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:46.079
 you can just walk on and yes 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.739
 also create what in step-by-step list 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.230
 you all have to do 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.489
 there it holds on to the voices that are in 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.239
 Dutch and in English she is 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.319
 just a voice management in settings 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.370
 and of course you can also use other languages 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.680
 to download 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.180
 but i have dutch and english here 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.190
 download more 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.930
 then you can do anything and the 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.359
 Dutch voice does not know everything sometimes 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.430
 then that distance does not contain 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.709
 and then he says instead of 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.000
 he says about 70 meters to the right 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.310
 he just says about it 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.569
 right yes you need that on it 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.889
 looking at the screen is not a disaster in itself 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.099
 but it is a bit sloppy 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.229
 of course and yes so are the just one 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.930
 number of things that just don't make sense 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.270
 work perfectly 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.620
 what is also true, for example, is like you 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.820
 navigate and try it 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:35.840
 all doing very nicely fluent 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:37.940
 I just put him on the demo that me 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.110
 from 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.570
 then he will just pretend that it is good 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.830
 are driving and he is all trying 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.300
 doing it is very difficult nice smooth 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.530
 naturally very beautiful but what me 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.060
 for example have ever had that 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.090
 when you get up at the traffic light 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.710
 an intersection that your phone then yes on 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.630
 Somehow that you think of 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.310
 continues, so the image is already going 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.229
 past the traffic light 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.349
 and gives up , he comes to Jan quietly 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.580
 standstill and then yes it is again 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.919
 of your route goes that new route 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.180
 calculate stalking itself then called 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.620
 good exit and another one goes 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.599
 calculate a new route are all 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.250
 little things with that works 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.630
 so just not perfect on the cards 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.250
 see you very neatly from further on 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.160
 I think he has none 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.419
 roadway things that is a shame though 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.860
 well otherwise it is a reasonable one 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.750
 well-organized and it just works 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.660
 all will continue well 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.789
 look at the countries you have in 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.159
 settings you can download maps here 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:32.180
 you can do that on your arm memory card or on it 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:34.430
 do your internal memory it is europe 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.080
 is fairly complete and it is in 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.860
 divided into areas for example 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.810
 Benelux 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.760
 but also from germany austria 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.539
 Switzerland and Liechtenstein are among 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.699
 classified 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.169
 Eastern Europe is an area with a lot 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.360
 countries as you can see 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.979
 in itself it works just fine 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.360
 just very busy 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.550
 okay wishing I downloaded then he goes 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.039
 Download and you can choose here or 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.599
 you want to do externally or internally what does 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.070
 pity is that you cannot continue the software 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.599
 can use if you are a download 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.220
 you can, of course, minimize it 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.080
 you can't do anything else in it 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.690
 software is downloading twin cards 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.070
 and yes for this has a number here in asia 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.680
 Nations 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.570
 namely some countries and in southeast asia 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.509
 taiwan and that's it 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.780
 so in america or in africa for example 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.770
 but russia can also call what is possible 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.320
 not out of hand with this software 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.330
 he is therefore somewhat limited so that 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.620
 is a pity for most of us 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.639
 the cards will just suffice 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.169
 to be 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.150
 all in all there is never certainly none 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.009
 software sun is a mistake to you 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.830
 interface that just doesn't work over 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:35.660
 Handy the cards that are in a big 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.040
 number of countries available in europe 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.200
 supply from europe is actually one 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.790
 bit limited but nevertheless it 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.340
 quite a good navigation program 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.340
 and also a nice addition because you 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.750
 just offline on your phone for free 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.250
 can have navigation 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.960
 it must be said that for example 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.120
 with the nokia mister suite 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.710
 that for Android anyway already 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.050
 available is the will is concerned 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.580
 no huge advantage over her 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.450
 more other devices but still beautiful 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.670
 taken along 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.110
 that you have that standard and yes it is 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.940
 so pretty fine software is sitting 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.060
 still some mistakes here and there 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.060
 in
