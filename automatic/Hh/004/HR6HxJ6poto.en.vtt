00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
this is the americium it is concept that

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.259 
this is the americium it is concept that
we<00:00:09.300> came<00:00:09.510> up<00:00:09.690> with<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.559> wrap<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.070> whole<00:00:11.250> car<00:00:11.550> as

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
we came up with to wrap the whole car as

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.539 
we came up with to wrap the whole car as
one<00:00:12.540> big<00:00:12.780> QR<00:00:13.049> code<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:14.009> had<00:00:14.160> another<00:00:14.370> rap

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
one big QR code it had another rap

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.609 
one big QR code it had another rap
before<00:00:14.730> which<00:00:15.210> was<00:00:15.330> great<00:00:15.599> advertising<00:00:16.320> as

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
before which was great advertising as

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.060 
before which was great advertising as
that's<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.750> although<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.990> felt<00:00:19.260> with

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
that's what we do although we felt with

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.859 
that's what we do although we felt with
the<00:00:20.220> introduction<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.539> kind<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
the introduction and the kind of the

the introduction and the kind of the
growing<00:00:22.140> popularity<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> QR<00:00:23.250> code<00:00:23.519> we

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
growing popularity of the QR code we

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.660 
growing popularity of the QR code we
felt<00:00:24.619> let's<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.769> wrap<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> whole<00:00:26.220> car<00:00:26.460> let's

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
felt let's just wrap the whole car let's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.429 
felt let's just wrap the whole car let's
be<00:00:26.789> different<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.480> did<00:00:27.630> some<00:00:27.779> research<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.410> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
be different we did some research on it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.120 
be different we did some research on it
we<00:00:29.220> googled<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.510> didn't<00:00:31.050> find<00:00:31.260> anything<00:00:31.560> like

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
we googled and didn't find anything like

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.400 
we googled and didn't find anything like
this<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.669> there<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.180> far<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.510> full<00:00:33.840> complete

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
this out there as far as a full complete

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.580 
this out there as far as a full complete
rap<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> reasons<00:00:37.050> was<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.350> wanted

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
rap so one of the reasons was we wanted

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.690 
rap so one of the reasons was we wanted
to<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.710> first<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.129> wanted<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.670> there

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
to be first we wanted to get out there

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.940 
to be first we wanted to get out there
but<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.690> love<00:00:39.840> about<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.290> concept<00:00:40.800> is

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
but what we love about the concept is

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
but what we love about the concept is
that<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.280> understandable<00:00:41.790> coats<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:43.079> over

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
that it's understandable coats all over

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.110 
that it's understandable coats all over
the<00:00:43.379> car<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.100> change<00:00:44.370> depending<00:00:44.789> on

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the car that we can change depending on

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.840 
the car that we can change depending on
the<00:00:45.210> time<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> year<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.489> what<00:00:47.489> events

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the time of the year or what events

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.790 
the time of the year or what events
might<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.690> if<00:00:49.020> we're<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> charity

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
might be going on if we're at a charity

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.400 
might be going on if we're at a charity
or<00:00:50.070> grade<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.420> change<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.020> when<00:00:52.230> people

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
or grade we can change it so when people

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.920 
or grade we can change it so when people
scan<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.789> details<00:00:54.390> about<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
scan it you can have details about that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.030 
scan it you can have details about that
event<00:00:55.110> or<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.309> parade<00:00:56.579> around

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
event or that that parade around

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.680 
event or that that parade around
we'll<00:00:59.040> probably<00:00:59.160> keep<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> wrap<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.480> car

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
we'll probably keep the wrap on the car

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.280 
we'll probably keep the wrap on the car
for<00:01:01.080> about<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> year<00:01:02.330> it's<00:01:03.330> just<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:04.020> want<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
for about a year it's just we want to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.200 
for about a year it's just we want to
keep<00:01:04.410> it<00:01:04.559> fresh<00:01:04.770> always<00:01:05.160> so<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.520> figure<00:01:06.090> about

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
keep it fresh always so we figure about

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.090 
keep it fresh always so we figure about
a<00:01:06.270> year<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.660> this<00:01:06.870> that<00:01:07.230> we'll<00:01:07.440> keep<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
a year on this that we'll keep it on the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.850 
a year on this that we'll keep it on the
car<00:01:08.310> what's<00:01:09.150> great<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.870> QR<00:01:10.200> code<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
car what's great about the QR code is

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.760 
car what's great about the QR code is
that<00:01:11.300> we<00:01:12.300> plan<00:01:12.690> like<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.080> example<00:01:13.170> Monday

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that we plan like for example Monday

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
that we plan like for example Monday
being<00:01:13.979> 4th<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.820> July<00:01:15.060> we're<00:01:15.300> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.600> in

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
being 4th of July we're going to be in

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
going to talk about you don't have

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.360

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
we're know what it's going to say it but

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
probably have some sort of a special

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.870 
probably have some sort of a special
come<00:01:27.690> in<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.990> week<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.410> get<00:01:28.530> maybe<00:01:29.160> 50%<00:01:29.520> off

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
come in this week and get maybe 50% off

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.820 
come in this week and get maybe 50% off
your<00:01:30.030> color<00:01:30.210> copy<00:01:30.450> something<00:01:30.780> fun<00:01:31.110> will<00:01:31.710> do

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
your color copy something fun will do

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.440 
your color copy something fun will do
maybe<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.100> rap<00:01:32.310> special<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> things

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
maybe a rap special one of the things

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.210 
maybe a rap special one of the things
the<00:01:34.350> reason<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:34.710> went<00:01:34.800> with<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> marathon

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
the reason we went with the marathon

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
the reason we went with the marathon
gene<00:01:35.520> affects<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.060> vehicle<00:01:36.420> wraps<00:01:36.630> because

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
gene affects the vehicle wraps because

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.620 
gene affects the vehicle wraps because
this<00:01:37.650> car<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.009> want<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:38.220> advertise<00:01:38.400> more<00:01:39.090> ramps

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
this car we want to advertise more ramps

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.630 
this car we want to advertise more ramps
stop<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.740> printing<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.310> design

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
stop because we do printing if we design

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
stop because we do printing if we design
everything<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.960> more<00:01:43.140> geared<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.410> its

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
everything this is more geared for its

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.790 
everything this is more geared for its
vehicle<00:01:44.220> ramp<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.420> code<00:01:46.170> will<00:01:46.200> always

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
vehicle ramp so the code will always
