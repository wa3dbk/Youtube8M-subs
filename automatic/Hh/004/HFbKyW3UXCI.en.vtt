00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
tile that goes across the top of the

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.950 
tile that goes across the top of the
niche<00:02:01.640> does<00:02:01.940> not<00:02:02.119> slide<00:02:02.360> down<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.780> that's

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
niche does not slide down and that's

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.580 
niche does not slide down and that's
what<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.200> have<00:02:03.410> here<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.680> have<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.890> brace<00:02:04.190> to<00:02:05.180> hold

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
what I have here I have a brace to hold

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.300 
what I have here I have a brace to hold
the<00:02:06.590> tiles<00:02:06.800> above<00:02:07.990> until<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.410> thinset<00:02:09.619> sets

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
the tiles above until the thinset sets

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:36.100 
the tiles above until the thinset sets
up

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.930 

okay<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.650> thinset<00:02:37.980> has<00:02:38.250> time<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.640> set<00:02:38.790> up

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
okay so the thinset has time to set up

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.740 
okay so the thinset has time to set up
and<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:40.590> tile<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:41.069> now<00:02:41.580> firmly<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.569> wall

so when you put these shelves and you

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.020 
so when you put these shelves and you
want<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.250> make<00:05:01.340> sure<00:05:01.370> that<00:05:01.639> they're<00:05:01.849> too

tilted towards or into the shower and
not<00:05:05.120> back<00:05:06.099> towards<00:05:07.099> the<00:05:07.190> wall<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:08.180> reason<00:05:08.479> you

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
not back towards the wall the reason you

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.089 
not back towards the wall the reason you
do<00:05:08.690> this<00:05:08.720> is<00:05:08.870> so<00:05:09.169> that<00:05:09.349> any<00:05:09.500> water<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:09.949> might

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
do this is so that any water that might

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.850 
do this is so that any water that might
get<00:05:10.280> on<00:05:10.430> it<00:05:10.610> will<00:05:11.030> run<00:05:11.560> towards<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.650> shower

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
get on it will run towards the shower

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.969 
get on it will run towards the shower
and<00:05:13.099> not<00:05:13.310> sit<00:05:13.759> in<00:05:13.969> the<00:05:14.780> back<00:05:14.960> because<00:05:15.650> if<00:05:15.889> it

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
and not sit in the back because if it

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.740 
and not sit in the back because if it
tilts<00:05:16.310> towards<00:05:16.819> the<00:05:16.940> back<00:05:17.120> it<00:05:17.389> will<00:05:17.479> cause

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
tilts towards the back it will cause

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.689 
tilts towards the back it will cause
like<00:05:18.020> a<00:05:18.050> little<00:05:18.319> trough<00:05:18.530> and<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.370> water<00:05:19.580> will

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
like a little trough and the water will

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:20.980 
like a little trough and the water will
gather<00:05:19.879> there<00:05:20.180> and<00:05:20.330> just<00:05:20.419> sit<00:05:20.569> there<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:20.900> you

you want to make sure that the shower I
mean<00:05:25.159> the<00:05:25.250> Shelf<00:05:25.490> tilts<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.240> wall<00:05:26.449> on<00:05:26.810> towards

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
mean the Shelf tilts the wall on towards

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.390 
mean the Shelf tilts the wall on towards
the<00:05:27.590> shower<00:05:27.800> and<00:05:28.150> I<00:05:29.150> usually<00:05:29.569> put<00:05:29.750> a<00:05:29.780> couple<00:05:30.020> of

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400

the shower and I usually put a couple of
little<00:05:31.400> wedges<00:05:31.580> in<00:05:31.789> the<00:05:31.879> back<00:05:32.060> to<00:05:32.629> help<00:05:32.810> it

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
little wedges in the back to help it

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.570 
little wedges in the back to help it
stay<00:05:33.940> tilted<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.289> then<00:05:36.289> the<00:05:36.800> DS<00:05:37.069> get<00:05:37.280> buried

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
stay tilted and then the DS get buried

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.450 
stay tilted and then the DS get buried
in<00:05:37.789> thin<00:05:38.659> sets<00:05:38.930> so<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.710> plastic<00:05:39.949> so<00:05:40.250> it's<00:05:40.400> not

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
in thin sets so the plastic so it's not

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.170 
in thin sets so the plastic so it's not
a<00:05:40.520> problem<00:05:40.909> and<00:05:41.979> you<00:05:42.979> do<00:05:43.099> that<00:05:43.250> you<00:05:43.969> make<00:05:44.150> sure

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
a problem and you do that you make sure

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.680 
a problem and you do that you make sure
that<00:05:44.539> the<00:05:44.750> both<00:05:45.349> the<00:05:45.560> top<00:05:46.150> at<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.240> bottom<00:05:47.270> and

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
that the both the top at the bottom and

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.980 
that the both the top at the bottom and
the<00:05:47.810> top<00:05:47.960> shelf<00:05:48.259> are<00:05:48.469> both<00:05:48.650> tilted<00:05:49.990> towards

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
the top shelf are both tilted towards

00:05:50.990 --> 00:06:38.460 
the top shelf are both tilted towards
the<00:05:51.050> inside<00:05:51.889> of<00:05:51.979> the<00:05:52.039> shower

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:44.710
