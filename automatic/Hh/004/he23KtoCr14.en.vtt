an indigenous organization and I think

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.030 
an indigenous organization and I think
that's<00:01:27.200> very<00:01:27.259> important<00:01:29.500> you<00:01:30.500> know<00:01:30.619> bangerra

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
that's very important you know bangerra

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.310 
that's very important you know bangerra
is<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.820> as<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.000> company<00:01:32.390> that<00:01:32.540> entertains<00:01:33.080> and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
is it as a company that entertains and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.920 
is it as a company that entertains and
it<00:01:33.380> entertains<00:01:33.800> in<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.039> in<00:01:34.160> a<00:01:34.250> distinctive<00:01:34.930> in

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
it entertains in it in a distinctive in

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.840 
it entertains in it in a distinctive in
a<00:01:36.020> different<00:01:36.320> way<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:37.310> really<00:01:37.670> is

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
a different way and that really is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.090 
a different way and that really is
former<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.690> inner<00:01:39.110> perspective<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:39.920> it's

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
former and inner perspective and it's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.040 
former and inner perspective and it's
from<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.280> spiritual<00:01:40.850> connection<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:41.600> I<00:01:41.630> think

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
from a spiritual connection so I think

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.330 
from a spiritual connection so I think
if<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:42.440> want<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.680> have<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.800> little<00:01:42.890> bit<00:01:43.039> of<00:01:43.130> both

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
if you want to have a little bit of both

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.520 
if you want to have a little bit of both
of<00:01:43.630> discovering<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.780> spirituality<00:01:45.110> through

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
of discovering that spirituality through

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.169 
of discovering that spirituality through
the<00:01:45.680> mainstream<00:01:46.160> entertainment<00:01:46.429> then<00:01:47.000> come

the mainstream entertainment then come

00:01:47.179 --> 00:02:11.559 
the mainstream entertainment then come
and<00:01:47.300> see<00:01:47.360> bangerra
