one<00:02:38.460> particular<00:02:38.940> place<00:02:39.450> every<00:02:39.720> time<00:02:39.840> it

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
one particular place every time it

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.770 
one particular place every time it
spawned<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.920> then<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.460> mail<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> minion<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.600> has

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
spawned so then the mail a minion it has

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.600 
spawned so then the mail a minion it has
with<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.200> would<00:02:43.560> come<00:02:43.800> over<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:44.040> me<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.280> then<00:02:44.580> i

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
with it would come over to me and then i

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.880 
with it would come over to me and then i
would<00:02:44.850> use<00:02:45.120> all<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.780> area<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.380> effect<00:02:46.560> damage

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
would use all the area of effect damage

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.240 
would use all the area of effect damage
that<00:02:47.460> i<00:02:47.490> have<00:02:47.820> using<00:02:48.540> dual<00:02:49.140> wielded<00:02:49.860> draggers

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
that i have using dual wielded draggers

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.250 
that i have using dual wielded draggers
i<00:02:50.550> was<00:02:50.850> able<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.150> kill<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.570> two<00:02:51.750> minions<00:02:51.960> at

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
i was able to kill the two minions at

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.870 
i was able to kill the two minions at
one<00:02:52.440> time<00:02:52.650> or<00:02:52.710> at<00:02:53.040> least<00:02:53.190> get<00:02:53.340> them<00:02:53.460> down<00:02:53.640> like

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
one time or at least get them down like

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.230 
one time or at least get them down like
one<00:02:54.150> hit<00:02:54.360> each<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.770> all<00:02:55.890> i<00:02:56.010> do<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:56.970> use<00:02:57.210> that

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
one hit each and so all i do is use that

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.420 
one hit each and so all i do is use that
threshold<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.320> they<00:02:58.770> would<00:02:58.920> basically<00:02:59.100> be

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
threshold and they would basically be

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.610 
threshold and they would basically be
dead<00:02:59.790> if<00:03:00.000> not<00:03:00.030> completely<00:03:00.480> dead<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.230> then<00:03:01.500> run

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
dead if not completely dead and then run

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.740 
dead if not completely dead and then run
over<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.100> range<00:03:02.370> minion<00:03:02.880> as<00:03:03.150> i'm<00:03:03.360> showing

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
to shot it and then I was able to do

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.290 
to shot it and then I was able to do
that<00:03:07.830> now<00:03:08.040> something<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.640> keep<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:08.850> mind<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
that I got that I was able to put

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.470 
that I got that I was able to put
together<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.490> was<00:03:41.580> just<00:03:41.730> three<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.030> them<00:03:42.240> so<00:03:42.450> i

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
together it was just three of them so i

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.910 
together it was just three of them so i
have<00:03:42.630> three<00:03:42.810> Dragon<00:03:43.170> stones<00:03:43.380> than<00:03:43.710> through

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
have three Dragon stones than through

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.620

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.820 
your own bars off one of those and some
rinse<00:03:45.900> I'm<00:03:46.080> not<00:03:46.200> going<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.380> include<00:03:46.470> RINs

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
rinse I'm not going to include RINs

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.490 
rinse I'm not going to include RINs
because<00:03:47.130> it's<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.400> 200<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:47.940> each<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.500> yeah

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
because it's like 200 of each and yeah

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.990 
because it's like 200 of each and yeah
i'm<00:03:49.590> lazy<00:03:49.830> they<00:03:50.070> kind<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:50.370> want<00:03:50.610> my<00:03:50.760> bank

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
i'm lazy they kind of just want my bank

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.710 
i'm lazy they kind of just want my bank
so<00:03:51.960> i<00:03:51.990> think<00:03:52.200> that's<00:03:52.830> just<00:03:53.610> about<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:54.270> if<00:03:54.570> you
