this way or try it
flat-footed<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.610> figure<00:00:52.150> so<00:00:52.840> family<00:00:53.350> how<00:00:53.740> do

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
flat-footed and figure so family how do

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.380 
flat-footed and figure so family how do
you<00:00:54.100> see<00:00:54.310> the<00:00:54.400> front<00:00:54.610> side<00:00:54.700> show

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
you see the front side show

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.120 
you see the front side show
so<00:00:55.600> I<00:00:55.750> scoop<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.080> front<00:00:56.290> side<00:00:56.440> foot<00:00:56.620> they<00:00:57.010> got

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
so I scoop the front side foot they got

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.620 
so I scoop the front side foot they got
my<00:00:57.250> back<00:00:57.370> leg<00:00:57.610> straight<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.060> my<00:00:58.330> front<00:00:58.570> foot

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
my back leg straight and my front foot

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.290 
my back leg straight and my front foot
kind<00:00:59.080> of<00:00:59.200> like<00:00:59.290> a<00:00:59.350> quarter<00:00:59.830> first<00:01:00.610> pop<00:01:01.150> an

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
kind of like a quarter first pop an

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.360 
kind of like a quarter first pop an
ollie<00:01:01.390> like<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.170> normally<00:01:02.350> would<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.830> then<00:01:02.890> I

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
ollie like you normally would and then I

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.670 
ollie like you normally would and then I
sort<00:01:03.610> of<00:01:03.670> like<00:01:03.850> just<00:01:04.000> my<00:01:04.449> front<00:01:04.989> foot<00:01:05.049> slip<00:01:05.470> off

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.660 
without really flicking it off the board
and<00:01:08.550> crucial<00:01:09.550> part<00:01:09.760> of<00:01:09.820> this

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
and crucial part of this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.210 
and crucial part of this
at<00:01:11.150> this<00:01:11.360> point<00:01:11.630> I<00:01:11.960> dig<00:01:12.530> down<00:01:12.560> with<00:01:12.890> my<00:01:12.979> back

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
at this point I dig down with my back

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.190

to<00:01:15.380> sort<00:01:15.680> of<00:01:15.770> show<00:01:15.979> this<00:01:16.130> on<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.700> side<00:01:16.970> is<00:01:17.210> like

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
to sort of show this on the side is like

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.160 
to sort of show this on the side is like
a<00:01:17.390> it's<00:01:18.170> like<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.290> down<00:01:18.530> in<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.830> push<00:01:19.130> like<00:01:20.060> that

how that works

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
how that works
I<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:55.030> like<00:01:55.210> this<00:01:55.330> angle<00:01:55.510> actually
