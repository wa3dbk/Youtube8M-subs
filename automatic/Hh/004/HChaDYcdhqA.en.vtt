what's up my peeps my name's Anna and
today<00:00:06.089> we<00:00:06.359> are<00:00:06.450> playing<00:00:06.480> on<00:00:07.170> lock<00:00:08.420> lock<00:00:09.420> now

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
today we are playing on lock lock now

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.530 
today we are playing on lock lock now
this<00:00:10.469> game<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.099> shooting<00:00:11.730> game<00:00:11.940> not<00:00:12.269> really

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
this game is a shooting game not really

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.330 
this game is a shooting game not really
sure<00:00:12.719> what<00:00:12.900> else<00:00:13.049> there<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.769> but<00:00:14.160> this

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
sure what else there is to it but this

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.179 
sure what else there is to it but this
is<00:00:14.490> cool<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:15.000> like<00:00:15.059> Iron<00:00:15.420> Man<00:00:15.660> movie<00:00:18.949> me<00:00:19.949> up

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
is cool it's like Iron Man movie me up

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.359 
is cool it's like Iron Man movie me up
there<00:00:20.490> yeah<00:00:21.560> okay<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.830> can't<00:00:23.160> click

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
there yeah okay so we can't click

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.179 
there yeah okay so we can't click
anything<00:00:23.640> close<00:00:24.420> range<00:00:24.960> what's<00:00:25.380> what's<00:00:25.800> range

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
anything close range what's what's range

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.060 
anything close range what's what's range
I<00:00:26.640> wonder<00:00:27.390> if<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.630> oh<00:00:27.869> yeah<00:00:28.320> should<00:00:28.980> have

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
I wonder if it's oh yeah should have

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.429 
I wonder if it's oh yeah should have
guessed<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.689> range<00:00:30.929> all<00:00:31.260> right

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
guessed it's a it's a range all right

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.440 
guessed it's a it's a range all right
now<00:00:32.309> I've<00:00:33.300> got<00:00:33.510> feet<00:00:35.149> although<00:00:36.149> they're<00:00:36.329> not

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
now I've got feet although they're not

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.319 
now I've got feet although they're not
moving<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.520> testing

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
moving so I think this is just testing

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.400 
moving so I think this is just testing
the<00:00:39.960> guns<00:00:40.230> oh<00:00:40.820> okay<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.300> floating<00:00:42.660> I'm<00:00:43.140> using

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the guns oh okay it's floating I'm using

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.170 
the guns oh okay it's floating I'm using
my<00:00:44.040> mind<00:00:44.309> powers<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.559> do<00:00:46.590> okay<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.180> insert

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
my mind powers to do okay so insert

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.750 
my mind powers to do okay so insert
what's<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.780> release<00:00:49.489> okay

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
what's that release okay

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.700 
what's that release okay
insert<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:51.960> least<00:00:52.110> don't<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.469> anything

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
insert in at least don't do anything

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.410 
insert in at least don't do anything
charge<00:00:53.160> Oh<00:00:53.550> God

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
charge Oh God

charge Oh God
I<00:00:54.449> dropped<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> bullet<00:00:55.590> already<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.129> was

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
I dropped a bullet already I was

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.290 
I dropped a bullet already I was
brilliant<00:00:57.020> okay

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.440 

charge<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.649> already<00:01:01.949> done<00:01:03.619> safe<00:01:04.619> oh<00:01:05.150> okay<00:01:06.150> now

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
charge is already done safe oh okay now

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:17.660 
charge is already done safe oh okay now
we<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.720> shoot<00:01:06.930> oh<00:01:07.670> god<00:01:08.670> oh<00:01:10.939> god<00:01:11.939> oh<00:01:12.530> I<00:01:16.610> want<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
we can shoot oh god oh god oh I want to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.520 
we can shoot oh god oh god oh I want to
see<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.939> that's<00:01:18.180> pretty<00:01:18.390> cool<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:18.900> okay

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
see that that's pretty cool right okay

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.859 
see that that's pretty cool right okay
so<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.710> shot<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.369> got<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> target<00:01:20.939> although

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
so I shot it I got the target although

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.760 
so I shot it I got the target although
it<00:01:22.320> appears<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.960> okay<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.170> physics<00:01:25.500> isn't

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it appears that okay the physics isn't

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.219 
it appears that okay the physics isn't
oh<00:01:25.950> god<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.970> ripped<00:01:27.420> off<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.869> fell<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
oh god it ripped off and fell to the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.200 
oh god it ripped off and fell to the
ground<00:01:28.490> that's<00:01:29.490> amazing

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
ground that's amazing

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.679 
ground that's amazing
that<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.720> actually<00:01:31.259> amazing<00:01:31.500> oh<00:01:32.299> god<00:01:33.299> the

that is actually amazing oh god the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.730 
that is actually amazing oh god the
physics<00:01:34.020> D<00:01:34.200> work<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.860> oh<00:01:36.710> god<00:01:37.710> I

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
physics D work on that oh god I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
physics D work on that oh god I
literally<00:01:38.310> blew<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.240> targets<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:41.570> wow<00:01:42.570> that's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
literally blew the targets up wow that's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.340 
literally blew the targets up wow that's
amazing

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
amazing

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.249

so okay oh there we go

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.030 
so okay oh there we go
oh<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.070> directly<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
oh you have to get directly in the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.319 
oh you have to get directly in the
middle<00:01:56.159> no<00:01:56.490> nope<00:01:56.729> there's<00:01:56.969> no<00:01:57.000> reason<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
middle no nope there's no reason it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.929 
middle no nope there's no reason it
doesn't<00:01:57.509> work<00:01:57.799> but<00:01:58.799> that's<00:01:59.009> alright<00:01:59.399> it's

okay<00:02:04.649> oh<00:02:05.540> god<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.840> physics<00:02:07.530> lags<00:02:07.860> me<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.099> bit<00:02:08.340> so

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
okay oh god the physics lags me a bit so

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.609 
okay oh god the physics lags me a bit so
I'm<00:02:08.759> gonna<00:02:08.910> get<00:02:09.149> out<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:09.479> before<00:02:09.599> Oh<00:02:10.020> God
