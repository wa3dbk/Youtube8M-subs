00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:25.529 
bass visual pack both did an okay job
with<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.449> oil<00:04:22.599> control<00:04:23.110> and<00:04:24.090> they<00:04:25.090> both<00:04:25.270> left

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
with the oil control and they both left

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.929 
with the oil control and they both left
my<00:04:25.870> skin<00:04:26.319> feeling<00:04:26.590> very<00:04:26.919> soft<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:27.580> clean

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:27.939 
my skin feeling very soft and clean

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.499 
my skin feeling very soft and clean
afterwards<00:04:28.599> so<00:04:30.060> that's<00:04:31.060> what's<00:04:31.300> similar

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
afterwards so that's what's similar

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.520 
afterwards so that's what's similar
about<00:04:31.659> these<00:04:32.139> two<00:04:32.349> I<00:04:32.379> guess<00:04:34.259> finally<00:04:35.259> this<00:04:35.379> is

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
about these two I guess finally this is

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.990 
about these two I guess finally this is
the<00:04:35.710> last<00:04:35.860> part<00:04:36.219> I'm<00:04:36.310> going<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.639> talk<00:04:36.819> about

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
the last part I'm going to talk about

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.689 
the last part I'm going to talk about
it's<00:04:37.930> called<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.349> nose<00:04:38.560> pack<00:04:39.009> and<00:04:39.310> it's<00:04:39.520> also

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
it's called the nose pack and it's also

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.800 
it's called the nose pack and it's also
from<00:04:40.000> Daiso<00:04:40.479> so<00:04:41.699> this<00:04:42.699> one<00:04:42.909> has<00:04:43.090> not<00:04:43.330> trouble

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
from Daiso so this one has not trouble

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.100 
from Daiso so this one has not trouble
based<00:04:43.990> like<00:04:44.229> the<00:04:44.349> other<00:04:44.530> two<00:04:44.919> it's<00:04:45.849> actually

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
based like the other two it's actually

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.019 
based like the other two it's actually
just<00:04:48.569> it's<00:04:49.569> actually<00:04:49.900> white<00:04:50.219> and<00:04:51.219> it<00:04:51.819> looks

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:52.029 
just it's actually white and it looks

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:59.999 
just it's actually white and it looks
like<00:04:52.180> this<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:58.750> this<00:04:58.900> one<00:04:59.110> has<00:04:59.289> a<00:04:59.319> weird<00:04:59.650> smell

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
like this and this one has a weird smell

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:05.490 
like this and this one has a weird smell
to<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:00.490> smells<00:05:01.060> like<00:05:01.120> Elmer's<00:05:01.629> glue<00:05:02.849> and<00:05:04.500> I've

strong<00:05:24.580> also<00:05:25.330> when<00:05:25.509> spreading<00:05:25.960> this<00:05:26.139> one<00:05:26.409> you

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:26.589 
strong also when spreading this one you

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:29.939 
strong also when spreading this one you
need<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:26.949> put<00:05:27.190> a<00:05:27.219> really<00:05:27.639> thick<00:05:27.940> coat<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.740> make

need to put a really thick coat and make

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.999 
need to put a really thick coat and make
sure<00:05:29.979> there's<00:05:30.370> like<00:05:30.550> no<00:05:30.819> thin<00:05:31.089> areas<00:05:31.539> because

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
sure there's like no thin areas because

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.339 
sure there's like no thin areas because
if<00:05:33.009> you<00:05:33.310> do<00:05:33.520> spread<00:05:34.120> it<00:05:34.240> really<00:05:34.479> thin<00:05:34.810> when

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
if you do spread it really thin when

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.529 
if you do spread it really thin when
when<00:05:35.589> you<00:05:35.800> move<00:05:36.099> it<00:05:36.279> it<00:05:36.460> doesn't<00:05:36.789> remove<00:05:37.180> a<00:05:37.360> lot

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
when you move it it doesn't remove a lot

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.469 
when you move it it doesn't remove a lot
of<00:05:37.569> the<00:05:37.750> things<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:39.219> first<00:05:39.430> time<00:05:39.729> i<00:05:39.909> used<00:05:40.270> it

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
of the things the first time i used it

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:41.999 
of the things the first time i used it
it<00:05:40.659> didn't<00:05:40.870> remove<00:05:41.080> any<00:05:41.319> of<00:05:41.469> the<00:05:41.500> whiteheads

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:42.009 
it didn't remove any of the whiteheads

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:42.930 
it didn't remove any of the whiteheads
because<00:05:42.400> I

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
because I

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.420 
because I
put<00:05:43.540> a<00:05:43.570> very<00:05:43.810> than<00:05:44.080> they<00:05:44.260> are<00:05:44.320> on<00:05:44.440> but<00:05:44.890> the<00:05:45.130> next

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
put a very than they are on but the next

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.860 
put a very than they are on but the next
time<00:05:45.490> I<00:05:45.640> used<00:05:45.940> it<00:05:46.060> I<00:05:46.120> tried<00:05:46.480> putting<00:05:46.690> the

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
time I used it I tried putting the

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.810 
time I used it I tried putting the
thicker<00:05:47.080> layer<00:05:47.350> and<00:05:47.710> removed<00:05:48.190> some<00:05:48.550> the

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
thicker layer and removed some the

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.620 
thicker layer and removed some the
whiteheads<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.450> a<00:05:49.930> lot<00:05:50.140> more<00:05:50.170> of<00:05:50.470> the<00:05:51.630> finer

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
whiteheads and a lot more of the finer

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.110 
whiteheads and a lot more of the finer
hair<00:05:52.870> is<00:05:53.050> like<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:53.440> blackheads<00:05:53.860> and<00:05:54.100> this<00:05:54.910> one

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
hair is like the blackheads and this one

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.460 
hair is like the blackheads and this one
is<00:05:55.330> only<00:05:55.480> two<00:05:55.930> dollars<00:05:57.030> and<00:05:58.170> there<00:05:59.170> is<00:05:59.260> around

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
is only two dollars and there is around

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.520 
is only two dollars and there is around
50<00:05:59.890> grams<00:06:00.130> in<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:00.490> so<00:06:00.700> it's<00:06:00.880> not<00:06:01.060> expensive

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
50 grams in it so it's not expensive

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.620 
50 grams in it so it's not expensive
both<00:06:02.530> the<00:06:02.770> dice<00:06:03.010> el<00:06:03.220> masts<00:06:03.760> actually<00:06:04.240> made<00:06:04.450> in

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
both the dice el masts actually made in

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:11.160 
both the dice el masts actually made in
Korea<00:06:05.130> and<00:06:08.850> i'm<00:06:09.850> not<00:06:10.030> sure<00:06:10.240> about<00:06:10.330> repurchases

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
Korea and i'm not sure about repurchases

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.810 
Korea and i'm not sure about repurchases
and<00:06:11.350> just<00:06:11.530> because<00:06:11.860> it<00:06:11.980> didn't<00:06:12.220> remove<00:06:12.430> many

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
and just because it didn't remove many

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.480 
and just because it didn't remove many
whiteheads<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:13.540> I<00:06:13.780> was<00:06:13.870> expecting<00:06:14.230> it<00:06:14.410> to

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
whiteheads and I was expecting it to

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.680 
whiteheads and I was expecting it to
help<00:06:15.490> clear<00:06:15.820> up<00:06:15.850> more<00:06:16.150> of<00:06:16.240> that<00:06:16.390> on<00:06:17.080> my<00:06:17.290> nose<00:06:18.690> so
