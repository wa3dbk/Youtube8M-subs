couple bevels three some clear glass
actually<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:20.550> four<00:00:20.699> bevels<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.380> some

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
actually it's four bevels and some

scraps that I have I use a lot of clear
textures<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.369> create<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> lot<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.119> scraps

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
textures so I create a lot of scraps

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.110 
textures so I create a lot of scraps
pretty<00:00:27.960> much<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.529> all<00:00:28.740> scraps<00:00:30.080> and<00:00:32.120> just

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120

consistent standardized sizes for you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.710 
consistent standardized sizes for you
it's<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.290> good<00:01:28.470> idea<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.970> around<00:01:30.270> put<00:01:30.689> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it's a good idea have that around put it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.429 
it's a good idea have that around put it
on<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> nail<00:01:31.140> put<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.070> drafting<00:01:32.790> drawer

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
on a nail put it in your drafting drawer

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.740 
on a nail put it in your drafting drawer
and<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.950> might<00:01:35.400> want<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.700> framing<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.329> small

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and you might want to framing a small

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.030 
and you might want to framing a small
frame<00:01:37.049> square<00:01:37.979> that's<00:01:38.490> what<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.030> called

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
frame square that's what this is called

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.460 
frame square that's what this is called
they<00:01:41.040> make<00:01:41.250> larger<00:01:41.700> ones<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.299> from<00:01:43.259> that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
they make larger ones and from that

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.109 
they make larger ones and from that
center<00:01:43.829> point<00:01:44.040> where<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> drew<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> little

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
center point where you drew the little

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.899 
center point where you drew the little
circle<00:01:45.890> just<00:01:46.890> draw<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> little<00:01:47.460> dot<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
circle just draw a little dot in the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.340 
circle just draw a little dot in the
middle<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.270> circle<00:01:49.250> like<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.399> did<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
middle of that circle like I did and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.840 
middle of that circle like I did and
draw<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.560> thing<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.979> half<00:01:53.159> that's<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.700> you're

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
draw this thing in half that's if you're

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.520 
draw this thing in half that's if you're
going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.060> make<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> symmetrical<00:01:54.840> window<00:01:55.200> left

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
going to make a symmetrical window left

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.929 
going to make a symmetrical window left
matches<00:01:56.040> right<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:58.409> I'll<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.680> draw<00:01:58.979> another

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
matches right so I'll just draw another

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.749 
matches right so I'll just draw another
tool<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:01.079> be<00:02:01.229> handy<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.490> your

turn<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.440> here<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.220> draw<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.580> triangle<00:02:23.500> so

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
turn it here to draw that triangle so

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.490 
turn it here to draw that triangle so
you<00:02:24.650> definitely<00:02:24.890> need<00:02:25.220> one<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.580> these<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:26.500> also

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
you definitely need one of these I also

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.890 
you definitely need one of these I also
if<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.010> noticed<00:02:28.490> put<00:02:28.760> my<00:02:28.910> poster<00:02:29.390> board<00:02:29.630> down

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
if you noticed put my poster board down

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.710 
if you noticed put my poster board down
next<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.560> straight<00:02:30.860> stick<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.910> where<00:02:32.480> I

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
next to a straight stick so that where I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.350 
next to a straight stick so that where I
have<00:02:33.140> created<00:02:33.470> myself<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:34.280> straight<00:02:34.640> edge<00:02:34.880> I

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
have created myself a straight edge I

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.560 
have created myself a straight edge I
can<00:02:35.990> draw<00:02:36.350> now<00:02:36.680> wherever<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.850> circle<00:02:38.390> is

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
can draw now wherever that circle is

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.080 
can draw now wherever that circle is
wherever<00:02:38.990> I<00:02:39.170> lay<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.590> circle<00:02:40.070> down<00:02:40.250> as<00:02:40.850> long

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
wherever I lay that circle down as long

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.450 
wherever I lay that circle down as long
as<00:02:41.510> I'm<00:02:41.750> going<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.320> put<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:42.950> up<00:02:43.190> the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
as I'm going to you put this up the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.500 
as I'm going to you put this up the
middle<00:02:43.820> right<00:02:44.000> there

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
middle right there

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.010

that's<00:02:45.320> going<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.650> be<00:02:45.740> my<00:02:45.920> up-and-down<00:02:46.430> line

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
that's going to be my up-and-down line

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.420 
that's going to be my up-and-down line
another<00:02:48.020> reason<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.500> don't<00:02:48.710> need<00:02:49.010> these<00:02:49.250> two
