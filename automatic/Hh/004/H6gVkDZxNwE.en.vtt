hardware<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:35.230> okay<00:03:35.650> on<00:03:35.800> that<00:03:36.150> close<00:03:37.150> all

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
hardware so you okay on that close all

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.670 
hardware so you okay on that close all
that<00:03:37.420> down<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:40.050> all<00:03:41.050> going<00:03:41.290> well<00:03:42.120> onto<00:03:43.120> press

that down and all going well onto press

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.929 
that down and all going well onto press
okay<00:03:45.640> see<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.909> print<00:03:46.180> button<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:47.670> little<00:03:48.670> noise

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
okay see the print button a little noise

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.600 
okay see the print button a little noise
then<00:03:49.599> you'll<00:03:49.810> see<00:03:50.019> it<00:03:50.590> comes<00:03:50.860> directly<00:03:51.340> into

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
then you'll see it comes directly into

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.149 
then you'll see it comes directly into

every<00:04:13.239> time<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.599> unplug<00:04:14.109> and<00:04:14.290> plug<00:04:14.379> in<00:04:14.769> the

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
every time you unplug and plug in the

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.240 
every time you unplug and plug in the
USB<00:04:15.489> port<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.509> creates<00:04:17.139> a<00:04:17.260> new<00:04:17.500> con<00:04:17.739> port<00:04:18.010> it's

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
USB port it creates a new con port it's

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.469 
USB port it creates a new con port it's
really<00:04:18.760> quite<00:04:19.000> annoying

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
really quite annoying

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.230 
really quite annoying
that's<00:04:20.109> why<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:20.680> stand<00:04:21.039> at<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.280> moment<00:04:21.459> it's

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
that's why and stand at the moment it's

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.420 
that's why and stand at the moment it's
easy<00:04:22.449> just<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.870> use<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.229> rs-232<00:04:26.130> port<00:04:27.130> which

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
easy just to use the rs-232 port which

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.469 
easy just to use the rs-232 port which
is<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:28.479> one<00:04:28.630> there<00:04:29.070> yeah<00:04:30.180> every<00:04:31.180> set<00:04:31.330> then

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
is that one there yeah every set then

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.689 
is that one there yeah every set then
just<00:04:32.080> repeat<00:04:32.380> myself<00:04:32.530> every<00:04:33.070> time<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.310> plug<00:04:33.550> it

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
just repeat myself every time I plug it

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.730 
just repeat myself every time I plug it
on<00:04:33.789> plugfest<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.900> creates<00:04:35.229> a<00:04:35.289> new<00:04:35.380> comp<00:04:35.620> board

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
on plugfest it creates a new comp board

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.589 
on plugfest it creates a new comp board
which<00:04:35.919> means<00:04:36.190> I'm<00:04:36.760> gonna<00:04:36.910> go<00:04:37.030> through<00:04:37.240> one

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
grab two more okay so that's why at the

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.350 
grab two more okay so that's why at the
moment<00:05:08.530> rs-232<00:05:09.430> is<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:09.849> better<00:05:10.030> option

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
moment rs-232 is a better option

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.279 
moment rs-232 is a better option
oh<00:05:11.550> yeah<00:05:12.550> so<00:05:12.789> make<00:05:13.150> sure<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.539> screw<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.990> cable

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
oh yeah so make sure you screw the cable

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.439
