 left tv will go on the course 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.059
 designer's days for the occasion 60 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.160
 creators and designers have set up 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.580
 scenographies in the showrooms of the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.049
 Parisian design report I am 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.210
 now with chantal thomass of the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.550
 stylist in the Veronese house who has 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.859
 created for the occasion of designer's days 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.760
 fixtures and mirrors and she goes 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.960
 present us his work 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.720
 then do we see 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.240
 present your different creations and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 well listen I started at the beginning by 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.059
 the chandelier in fact at the beginning we 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.809
 asked me to create a new one 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.690
 new chandelier 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.329
 I first thought about lampshade because 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.800
 I find that his lack of lampshade 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.570
 original I found that in crystal 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 it was nice and I added but touches 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.899
 obviously what I like the side 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.059
 feminine the capiton for example the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.510
 good souls up to date the frilly side 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.620
 ruffled and the dice only using 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.750
 obviously the technique of blown glass 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.800
 in all styles and then I served 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.210
 and above all, I wanted to make 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.170
 mirrors because I find it very 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.549
 long time we did not make mirrors 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.920
 originals actually says how you got 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.970
 worked with the house veronese I 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.170
 worked very simply I 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.729
 had known for a long time actually 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.080
 I had for all in all my 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.300
 shops are veronese chandeliers 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.840
 traditional classic so I 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.430
 knew well and they offered me 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.050
 that's all they asked me for 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.070
 eagles designer's days if I wanted 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.380
 to draw a collection 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.700
 I first thought about it 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.729
 drawings and then after I went on 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.350
 up to venice how fashion moves 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.500
 in design I think that when we have 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.030
 ideas and we have a style we have 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.619
 yet many things 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.270
 and what is the design that 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.409
 we eat the design it's 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:52.259
 invent new things 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:54.750
 with contemporary codes the design 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.920
 it's also luxury anyway because 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.530
 most of the time they are 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.030
 Outstanding materials it's a way 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.830
 exceptional was often done by 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.190
 artisans 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.319
 so it's the creation 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.989
 thank you so I'm in the company of 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.150
 constant slip in front of one of his 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.250
 scenography she realized for 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.390
 galleries lafayette whose title and say 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.150
 me ten showcases 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.560
 so good I sleep consistently what are 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.319
 the objects you wanted to put in 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.610
 value through his scenographies then 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.740
 so here 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.780
 there are objects that are part of the 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.030
 collection of galleries lafayette 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.440
 it was something important for 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.840
 we make a selection among 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.340
 really the brands of the galleries of 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.390
 see a little bit through my eye of 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.950
 designers the objects they could 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.360
 find interesting that to make them come 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.310
 in the shop windows have selected two 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.110
 by showcase so that they answer each other and 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.550
 present them and for you what is 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.740
 designer's interest 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.940
 so I was at first delighted 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.580
 to be invited by the galleries lafayette 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.250

 Scenographies shows objects 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.080
 it's a bit like a discount 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.580
 as a design upgrade and 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.870
 I found that really 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.000
 extraordinary to do the showcases 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.680

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.880
 that I had I said right before 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.500
 even to know what was the command 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.180

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.959

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.239

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.000
 etc. 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.800
 the window the framing I'm interested 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.180

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.100
 tenth piano created height that was 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.959

 is called parallel this piano 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.330
 for us 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.500
 symbolizes something important 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.389
 who and some important 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.190
 that today the piano come back in 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.690
 the interiors are the approach that 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.190
 we had compared to the instrument 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.970
 we realized that 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.410
 for many decades 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.729
 unfortunately there was nothing 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.889
 very new in piano it's always 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.750
 something black lacquered very 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.910
 massive you have five cubic meters that 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.410
 looks like something I will go 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.259
 funeral you participate 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.860
 today this design event 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:50.630
 style because we are part of 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.970
 houses that think that know-how 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.699
 does not want existed on creation and 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.710
 we have always considered that 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.780
 was extremely important to integrate 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.780
 the approach that reigns design approach 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.780
 from creation to our at our job
