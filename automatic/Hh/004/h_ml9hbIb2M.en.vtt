00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:42.689 
passing and she all of a sudden is an

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.050 
passing and she all of a sudden is an
old<00:04:43.110> lady<00:04:43.439> with<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.800> cane<00:04:44.069> and<00:04:44.430> she<00:04:44.759> lives<00:04:44.909> to<00:04:44.969> be
