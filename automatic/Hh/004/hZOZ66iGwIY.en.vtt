00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello today there is again a tube 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.770
 alarm video 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.020
 I'm feeling a bit like that again 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.880
 researched what is there for tubes 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.650
 and I have some of it now 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.269
 taken but not really 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.380
 looked at that I'm doing now 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.360
 together with you 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.980
 if that's really good cubes 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.510
 are and the first I think 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.550
 very much interested in that is namely 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.100
 a reddish eyeshadow that is that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.570
 cranberry from mac with that I had yes 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.949
 already a tutorial make-up that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.260
 I also like to link here again 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.330
 can you look like me 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.840
 that's what they interpreted for autumn 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.300
 an autumn megaflop tutorial and for that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.890
 There are very few tubes in the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.510
 drogerie so really reddish 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.430
 eyeshadow though the cranberry, too 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.739
 not so roundish but rather into 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.930
 pink goes in and also a lot 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.120
 bad part in there has we have 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.730
 All told of nyx there is 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.800
 a tube namely the passenger and there 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.410
 of course I have to start running right away and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.239
 me this color hollow and I think 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.199
 really that the two are very 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.079
 resemble 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.270
 although the one of most still tick one 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.880
 more warmth than a little bit more 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.680
 is more reddish and the mc but rather 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.850
 in that pinkl is really only 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.600
 very easy and if you are very accurate 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.130
 hinschaut 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.960
 otherwise this is really a whole 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.640
 great team so if you really like one 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.619
 reddish eyeshadow looks so yes 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.180
 bit condom moderate to the mac is then 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.860
 can i recommend you from nyx there 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.170
 in fact, it also has this float in it 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.030
 which reflects very nicely 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.619
 of course less pigmented though 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.450
 Nevertheless, as I said, I would one 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.579
 good you can look at you me 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.470
 believe of kiko it should also 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.210
 give me such a tube but there I come 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.979
 not easy now and run the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.810
 Most of it is easier to luxe 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.090
 we will continue with one 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.240
 gel eyeliner namely this new from 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.610
 benefit from this the real push up leiner 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.970
 and that is very special in 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.890
 But this pen with money in it and 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.939
 This lace is also gummelt out 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.380
 So I had a video before 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.009
 made that I also link once 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.899
 below 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.299
 and this is just a tip 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.530
 namely medellÃ­n and this one 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.880
 lesting drama 36 hours gel one and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.710
 I have to say about the packaging 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.320
 they are already extremely similar 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.690
 So both in this pen form below 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.140
 again to turn and above just this 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.600
 Cover also for turning 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.370
 rises and this one has just this 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.300
 rubber tip but that's a bit 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.760
 shaped differently than that of benefit of 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.010
 from berlin is a bit smaller 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.510
 and not so weird and that 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.950
 Go is definitely different 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.360
 Also of consistency, then 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.160
 then when I saw the will of the tape 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.240
 first time I had worn was like that 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.650
 a bit surprised because he is 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.230
 it's very dry for a gel, so to speak 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.110
 it is really difficult for him to master 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.940
 express and now in retrospect 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.130
 I appreciate that since then 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.980
 I have the family that is like that 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.720
 a little bit softer and I think so 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.150
 actually not so good for such a gel 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.400
 an appeal i find that from the ebeling 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.500
 is not really consistent color 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.510
 So if I have one now 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.850
 draw by draw then it is at the beginning 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.530
 much color afterwards in the middle so little 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.459
 And last but not least, maybe this is one 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.400
 a little bit more again 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.989
 and that makes the whole thing on wear 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.790
 very difficult and complicated and you 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.680
 annoys constantly because that's just not 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.630
 looks so good right on the eye then 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.000
 I next three alleged dukes 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.880
 from wedding choice to mac lipsticks 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.380
 located and the first is what 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.720
 I already wear it on my lips 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.850
 that is the color queen cup that is 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.930
 creaming and yes, as you can see 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.489
 a very bright pink and pink I know 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.500
 that many think that suits me 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.269
 pink tones not as good on the lips 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.150
 but I like it anyway I wear it 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.670
 anyway and that should be done by if 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.010
 dubai the color just be pc and me 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.750
 find so at first glance you see 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.420
 not really that similar 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.720
 this here is the mac and that is yes 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.709
 somehow brighter and the justy 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.570
 add a little more 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.730
 cheesy in what I now but 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.709
 I 've been mistaken 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.870
 taken in such a baby lips and the 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.480
 Let's talk about this just budget from Betty 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.090
 given white and I think yes 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.730
 you might think it would be 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.680
 a little more a tube than the wild wings 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.730
 founders are generally of the finish 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.250
 so a little bit of semeta so rather 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.870
 dull and yes but so general I have to 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.820
 say so I find it completely 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.169
 one due until the next lipstick is 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.910
 the fan fair 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.610
 there should be a job and me 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.520
 thought he is my god what 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.409
 what is it important and then have 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.110
 I read the name namely rosebud 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:32.550
 from both wild and then I thought to myself 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.379
 So somehow that does not quite fit 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.990
 because I have both colors at home 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.219
 and I think so I could do it 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.990
 remember that the two actually 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.550
 are totally different and therefore have 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.219
 I rausgekramt the two times and the 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.819
 rosebud yes as I said from the Finnish 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:49.530
 metal in the founder just rather mat and 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.960
 That's why the two see each other next to each other 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.280
 synonymous for now so somehow 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.689
 different but that is just 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.360
 At the end the fan fair is just as nice 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:02.069
 creamy and therefore the one of renault 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.960
 just was not so suitable but I think 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.000
 actually, the color of the yes yes 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.830
 but quite the same reason I have 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.990
 this time also applied this trick 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.460
 and taken with the baby lips and 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.439
 once given and I think 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.939
 then they are more like each other 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.289
 If you look very carefully you can see 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.849
 maybe another difference 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.439
 if you put that on your lips 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.300
 it will probably happen then 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.550
 not be so clear anymore 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.129
 that's why I think so that's one 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.960
 very good tube so once the traffic 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.759
 by merck one of my favorite mac 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.919
 by the way, this lip color pencils 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.139
 is really great and once the rosebud 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.250
 also one of my favorite with wild 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.800
 honking donor now I know why 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.750
 yes because the colors totally want it yes 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.029
 just my prey scheme and the last 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.870
 alleged middle forest eube is too mac 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:48.810
 no sexy for matt that's a dull one 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.680
 lipstick and that is once up here 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.750
 I think the color is just like that 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.659
 that's the trend color 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.909
 a bit brownish but still 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:01.889
 Pietsch in it so that's this 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.300
 dull brownish Picchu is somehow so 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.669
 Now in the fall, I just think 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.669
 pretty trendy and the tube is supposed to 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:11.370
 the berthold of being wild at the and 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.169
 yes so now I have to compare 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.360
 say pattern think two eyes 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.349
 press it with the way as a tube 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.779
 go through 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:20.460
 At the beginning I thought so of the 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.560
 Finnish look very much the same 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.330
 because of mac just this match 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.990
 finish and thus they are alike 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.610
 very good 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.139
 I think of it from the color 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.659
 a bit difficult so they are already 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.819
 similar but not really one 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:35.680
 tube of barry is great but rather 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:37.360
 even more brownish and that of 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.030
 away is just a bit pee 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.440
 they 're in there, but generally they go 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.180
 In any case, even in this autumnal 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.490
 direction so if you have such an autumn 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.470
 brownish tone for the lips are you looking for 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.669
 so a little matter is then become 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.199
 the two colors in any case 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.270
 interesting for you and then I have 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.430
 another cube that is not decorative 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.470
 It is cosmetic but something to cleanse 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.330
 I had my favorites here 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.729
 namely called from da vinci this 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.070
 cleaning soap for cosmetics brush and 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:05.440
 He has some spectators under this 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.000
 video written that it indeed a 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.880
 tube is namely the normal 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.530
 Kernseife and yes there I was very 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.410
 Surprised was nuclear soap her general 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.789
 very cheap and there I have 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.009
 Of course I got it right away and me 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:19.620
 have to say so I am so excited 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:22.750
 it has the cleaning effect 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.370
 really well kept so I think 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.650
 she really has that brush too 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.449
 get well clean and she is 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.919
 of course much cheaper 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:31.479
 thank you all for giving me this 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:33.250
 Great tip I have given 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:34.599
 I would have loved him here, of course 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.120
 still use it because he is so gorgeous 

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:38.530
 smells and yes because I have him 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.699
 but otherwise I will 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.620
 probably really on nuclear soap 

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:44.139
 So change the tip too 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.520
 all a good cleaning product 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:47.800
 look for your brush look at you 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.270
 simply nuclear soap on normally and that 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.650
 it was already I hope it was like that 

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.360
 a little something interesting for you 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.860
 maybe you do not have that yet 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.599
 I knew, I hope, at least 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.190
 and yes write me a little bit if 

00:07:55.599 --> 00:07:59.919
 you maybe either the original or 

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.690
 is somehow hurry and what you have 

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:03.639
 I would be very interested in that 

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.560
 and then I link below again 

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:08.940
 my last two videos and us 

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.940
 See you next time again
