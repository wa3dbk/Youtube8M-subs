magazine release lever the trigger were

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.480 
magazine release lever the trigger were
not<00:03:01.480> question<00:03:01.930> actually<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.410> metal<00:03:02.710> at

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
not question actually it is metal at

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.160 
not question actually it is metal at
first<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:04.240> thought<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.420> was<00:03:04.480> plastic<00:03:04.900> but<00:03:05.050> then

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
first we thought it was plastic but then

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.900 
first we thought it was plastic but then
we<00:03:05.290> scraped<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.650> little<00:03:05.890> bit<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.580> paint<00:03:06.790> off

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
we scraped a little bit of the paint off

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.450 
we scraped a little bit of the paint off
and<00:03:07.120> discovered<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.630> was<00:03:08.010> metal<00:03:09.010> but<00:03:09.340> the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
and discovered it was metal but the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.180 
and discovered it was metal but the
frame<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.180> actually<00:03:11.110> plastic<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:11.800> this<00:03:11.950> area

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
frame is actually plastic so this area

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.850

enthusiasts<00:04:58.750> will<00:04:58.960> recognize<00:04:59.560> is<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.610> fact

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
enthusiasts will recognize is the fact

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.629 
enthusiasts will recognize is the fact
that<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:01.539> top<00:05:01.719> receiver<00:05:02.080> is<00:05:02.259> removable<00:05:02.639> flip

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
that the top receiver is removable flip

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.510 
that the top receiver is removable flip
this<00:05:03.789> here<00:05:03.969> so<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.120> can<00:05:04.210> get<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.330> better<00:05:04.479> view

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.100 

it's<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.610> fairly<00:05:09.909> straightforward<00:05:10.150> matter<00:05:10.780> of

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
it's a fairly straightforward matter of

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.189 
it's a fairly straightforward matter of
pushing<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.949> button<00:05:12.219> and<00:05:14.129> popping<00:05:15.129> it<00:05:15.460> off

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
pushing the button and popping it off

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.879 
pushing the button and popping it off
now<00:05:17.400> this<00:05:19.139> according<00:05:20.139> to<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.319> instructions

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
now this according to the instructions

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.249 
now this according to the instructions
is<00:05:21.069> simply<00:05:21.669> a<00:05:21.909> weight<00:05:22.599> a<00:05:22.629> place<00:05:23.020> holder

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
is simply a weight a place holder

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.249 
is simply a weight a place holder
basically<00:05:23.860> if<00:05:24.280> you<00:05:24.729> happen<00:05:25.180> to<00:05:25.210> get<00:05:25.389> an<00:05:25.539> ak-47

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
basically if you happen to get an ak-47

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
model that has the folding stock you'll

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.240 
model that has the folding stock you'll
be<00:05:28.990> forced<00:05:29.229> to<00:05:29.409> use<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.740> stick<00:05:29.949> type<00:05:30.219> battery

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
be forced to use the stick type battery

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.059 
be forced to use the stick type battery
which<00:05:31.030> would<00:05:31.240> be<00:05:31.330> placed<00:05:31.599> here<00:05:34.860> putting<00:05:35.860> this

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
which would be placed here putting this

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.309 
which would be placed here putting this
receiver<00:05:36.639> portion<00:05:37.120> back<00:05:37.360> on<00:05:37.750> is<00:05:38.050> a<00:05:38.110> little

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 
receiver portion back on is a little

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.309 
receiver portion back on is a little
tricky<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:39.099> shouldn't<00:05:39.699> be<00:05:39.819> but<00:05:40.060> it<00:05:40.210> is<00:05:40.780> until

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
tricky it shouldn't be but it is until

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.189 
tricky it shouldn't be but it is until
you've<00:05:41.440> done<00:05:41.650> it<00:05:41.770> a<00:05:41.860> couple<00:05:41.889> of<00:05:42.159> times<00:05:43.199> you'll

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
you've done it a couple of times you'll

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.200 
you've done it a couple of times you'll
get<00:05:44.349> the<00:05:44.469> hang<00:05:44.620> of<00:05:44.710> it<00:05:44.800> quickly<00:05:45.009> enough<00:05:45.310> from

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
get the hang of it quickly enough from

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.570 
get the hang of it quickly enough from
this<00:05:46.419> angle<00:05:46.740> you<00:05:47.740> should<00:05:47.979> be<00:05:48.099> able<00:05:48.190> to<00:05:48.310> see

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
this angle you should be able to see

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.080 
this angle you should be able to see
generally<00:05:49.210> the<00:05:49.599> fairly<00:05:49.990> crude<00:05:50.520> sight<00:05:51.520> system

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
generally the fairly crude sight system

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.469 
generally the fairly crude sight system
it<00:05:52.240> differs<00:05:52.750> from<00:05:52.919> the<00:05:53.919> standard<00:05:54.360> ak-47<00:05:55.360> in

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
it differs from the standard ak-47 in

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.439 
it differs from the standard ak-47 in
that<00:05:56.080> there<00:05:56.289> is<00:05:56.439> no<00:05:56.759> adjustment<00:05:57.759> it's<00:05:58.029> it's

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
that there is no adjustment it's it's

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.379 
that there is no adjustment it's it's
completely<00:05:58.990> fixed<00:05:59.740> you<00:06:00.610> just<00:06:00.819> got<00:06:00.969> the<00:06:01.090> front

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
completely fixed you just got the front

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.180 
completely fixed you just got the front
little<00:06:01.629> blade<00:06:01.840> sight<00:06:02.199> there<00:06:02.469> and<00:06:02.710> this

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
little blade sight there and this

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.279 
little blade sight there and this
although<00:06:03.550> this<00:06:03.729> little<00:06:04.060> guy<00:06:04.150> does<00:06:04.539> turn<00:06:05.080> at

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
although this little guy does turn at

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.320 
although this little guy does turn at
first<00:06:05.469> we<00:06:05.650> thought<00:06:05.830> that<00:06:06.099> actually<00:06:06.639> you<00:06:07.240> know

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
first we thought that actually you know

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.279 
first we thought that actually you know
moved<00:06:07.599> the<00:06:07.930> front<00:06:08.589> sight<00:06:09.419> aperture<00:06:10.419> up<00:06:10.930> and

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
moved the front sight aperture up and

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.999 
moved the front sight aperture up and
down<00:06:12.000> we've<00:06:13.000> turned<00:06:13.330> it<00:06:13.539> dozens<00:06:14.379> of<00:06:14.500> times<00:06:14.740> and

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
down we've turned it dozens of times and

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.469 
down we've turned it dozens of times and
have<00:06:15.219> found<00:06:15.370> that<00:06:15.520> really<00:06:15.789> it's<00:06:16.029> just<00:06:16.089> turning

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
have found that really it's just turning

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.499 
have found that really it's just turning
in<00:06:16.599> place<00:06:16.719> doing<00:06:17.050> nothing<00:06:17.550> that<00:06:18.550> is<00:06:18.759> one<00:06:19.029> part

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509

of<00:06:19.629> this<00:06:19.810> gun<00:06:20.020> we<00:06:20.169> don't<00:06:20.379> like<00:06:20.589> because<00:06:21.430> the

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
of this gun we don't like because the

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.850 
of this gun we don't like because the
bb's<00:06:21.969> are<00:06:22.210> actually<00:06:22.659> off<00:06:22.810> a<00:06:22.839> little<00:06:23.229> bit<00:06:23.440> from

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
bb's are actually off a little bit from
