00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
to get to know the boat a bit better

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.400 
to get to know the boat a bit better
let's<00:00:09.790> take<00:00:10.090> a<00:00:10.120> look<00:00:10.300> at<00:00:10.420> some<00:00:10.630> basic<00:00:10.660> turning

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
let's take a look at some basic turning

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.049 
let's take a look at some basic turning
and<00:00:11.559> handling<00:00:12.010> maneuvers<00:00:12.400> we're<00:00:12.610> likely<00:00:12.849> to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
and handling maneuvers we're likely to

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.700 
and handling maneuvers we're likely to
be<00:00:13.180> carrying<00:00:13.420> out<00:00:13.750> during<00:00:14.200> the<00:00:14.290> journey

now we select forward and apply a burst

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.660 
now we select forward and apply a burst
of<00:00:35.540> power<00:00:35.600> for<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.110> few<00:00:36.170> seconds<00:00:36.829> as<00:00:36.950> we<00:00:37.489> get

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
of power for a few seconds as we get

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.490 
of power for a few seconds as we get
close<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.149> opposite<00:00:38.600> bank<00:00:38.840> select

close to the opposite bank select

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.470 
close to the opposite bank select
reverse<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.190> use<00:00:40.340> another<00:00:40.730> burst<00:00:41.000> of<00:00:41.210> power

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
reverse and use another burst of power

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.720 
reverse and use another burst of power
leave<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.320> steering<00:00:42.590> on<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:42.890> full<00:00:43.190> left<00:00:43.430> lock

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
leave the steering on a full left lock

leave the steering on a full left lock
there's<00:00:44.239> no<00:00:44.540> flow<00:00:44.780> of<00:00:44.809> water<00:00:45.110> over<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.559> rudder

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
there's no flow of water over the rudder

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.799 
there's no flow of water over the rudder
in<00:00:45.980> Reverse<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:46.790> it<00:00:47.090> will<00:00:47.239> have<00:00:47.420> little<00:00:47.570> effect

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
in Reverse so it will have little effect

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.799 
in Reverse so it will have little effect
at<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.320> moment<00:00:48.680> in<00:00:49.120> Reverse<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.449> propeller

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
at the moment in Reverse the propeller

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.930 
at the moment in Reverse the propeller
causes<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.440> stern<00:00:51.739> of<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:51.949> boat<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.430> swing<00:00:52.760> to

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
causes the stern of the boat to swing to

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.530 
causes the stern of the boat to swing to
the<00:00:52.970> right

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
the right

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.750 
the right
this<00:00:53.809> helps<00:00:54.140> us<00:00:54.320> by<00:00:54.589> swinging<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.129> bow<00:00:55.400> to<00:00:55.460> the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
this helps us by swinging the bow to the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.030 
this helps us by swinging the bow to the
left<00:00:56.000> that<00:00:56.329> is<00:00:56.600> why<00:00:56.750> we<00:00:56.960> always<00:00:57.409> turn<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:57.739> the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
left that is why we always turn to the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.970 
left that is why we always turn to the
left<00:00:58.250> as<00:00:58.839> the<00:00:59.839> stern<00:01:00.230> gets<00:01:00.470> closer<00:01:00.769> to<00:01:00.890> the

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
left as the stern gets closer to the

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.700 
left as the stern gets closer to the
bank<00:01:01.250> engage<00:01:01.850> ahead<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:02.540> use<00:01:03.050> another<00:01:03.079> short

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
bank engage ahead and use another short

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.780 
bank engage ahead and use another short
burst<00:01:04.009> of<00:01:04.220> power

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
burst of power

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.730 
burst of power
lower<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.390> revs<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.840> center<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.320> steering

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
lower the revs and center the steering

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.270 
lower the revs and center the steering
as<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.100> boat<00:01:07.280> completes<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:07.940> turn<00:01:09.220> okay<00:01:10.220> so

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
as the boat completes the turn okay so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.400 
as the boat completes the turn okay so
for<00:01:10.580> our<00:01:10.670> next<00:01:10.820> maneuver<00:01:11.450> we're<00:01:12.080> going<00:01:12.289> to

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
for our next maneuver we're going to

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.730 
for our next maneuver we're going to
turn<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.710> boat<00:01:12.860> round<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.399> confined<00:01:13.789> space

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
turn the boat round in a confined space

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.310 
turn the boat round in a confined space
180<00:01:15.740> degrees<00:01:16.300> so<00:01:17.300> into<00:01:17.690> neutral

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
180 degrees so into neutral

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.680 
180 degrees so into neutral
turn<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:18.950> wheel<00:01:19.130> full<00:01:19.490> up<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.060> left<00:01:20.300> and

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
turn the wheel full up to the left and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.730 
turn the wheel full up to the left and
then<00:01:21.530> apply<00:01:21.890> your<00:01:22.100> throttle<00:01:22.630> gradually

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
then apply your throttle gradually

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.719 
then apply your throttle gradually
little<00:01:24.740> bit<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:24.950> throttle<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.310> just<00:01:25.520> kick

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
little bit of throttle and just kick

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.210 
little bit of throttle and just kick
your<00:01:25.880> staring<00:01:26.360> rounds<00:01:26.800> try<00:01:27.800> and<00:01:27.950> take<00:01:28.070> your

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
your staring rounds try and take your

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.300 
your staring rounds try and take your
vine<00:01:28.399> as<00:01:28.850> far<00:01:29.179> as<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.479> can<00:01:29.660> go

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.060 

then<00:01:33.880> into<00:01:34.210> neutral<00:01:34.810> now<00:01:35.350> we<00:01:35.409> don't<00:01:35.619> turn<00:01:35.920> the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
then into neutral now we don't turn the

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.070 
then into neutral now we don't turn the
wheel<00:01:36.220> in<00:01:36.430> opposite<00:01:36.940> direction<00:01:37.330> because<00:01:37.659> with

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
wheel in opposite direction because with

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.100 
wheel in opposite direction because with
the<00:01:38.229> prop<00:01:38.440> wash<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:39.520> will<00:01:39.790> have<00:01:39.940> no<00:01:40.119> effect<00:01:40.150> so

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
the prop wash it will have no effect so

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.990 
the prop wash it will have no effect so
we<00:01:41.260> gradually<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:42.009> little<00:01:42.549> bit<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.759> throttle

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
we gradually a little bit of throttle

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.700 
we gradually a little bit of throttle
not<00:01:43.479> too<00:01:43.690> much<00:01:43.900> that's<00:01:44.440> good<00:01:44.710> looking<00:01:45.640> behind

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
not too much that's good looking behind

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.320 
not too much that's good looking behind
taking<00:01:47.710> us<00:01:47.920> close<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.460> bank<00:01:48.700> as<00:01:48.909> we<00:01:49.060> can

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.440

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
and to neutral forward gradually put on

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.230 
and to neutral forward gradually put on
the<00:01:55.570> throttle<00:01:56.340> trying<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.460> get<00:01:57.610> your<00:01:57.759> biro<00:01:58.180> in

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
the throttle trying to get your biro in

as far as you can

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.040 
as far as you can
and<00:02:02.000> once<00:02:02.210> we're<00:02:02.390> heading<00:02:02.690> in<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.840> direction

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.680 
and once we're heading in the direction
we<00:02:03.470> want<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.710> go<00:02:03.830> then<00:02:04.670> we<00:02:04.940> can<00:02:05.120> build<00:02:05.360> up<00:02:05.540> our

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
we want to go then we can build up our

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.320 
we want to go then we can build up our
speed<00:02:05.930> gradually

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.550 

that's<00:02:09.930> it<00:02:10.080> well<00:02:10.380> done<00:02:14.930> next<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.110> reversing

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
that's it well done next to reversing

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.630 
that's it well done next to reversing
which<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.800> always<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> little<00:02:17.160> tricky<00:02:17.340> because

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
which is always a little tricky because

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.160 
which is always a little tricky because
there's<00:02:17.910> no<00:02:17.970> water<00:02:18.210> flow<00:02:18.510> over<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.840> rudder<00:02:19.020> to

our steering is straight then gently
engage<00:03:31.890> forward<00:03:32.489> gear<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:33.030> slow<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.420> boat<00:03:33.570> to

a stop for steering to be effective we

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.660 
a stop for steering to be effective we
need<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.380> flow<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.709> water<00:03:38.010> over<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.550> rudder
