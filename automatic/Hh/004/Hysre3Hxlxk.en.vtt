00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.670 
and then we use machined aluminum
hardware<00:02:18.270> all<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.570> way<00:02:18.660> through<00:02:19.020> which

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
hardware all the way through which

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.580 
hardware all the way through which
requires<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.630> allen<00:02:21.630> wrench<00:02:21.840> that's<00:02:22.080> provided

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
requires a allen wrench that's provided

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.870 
requires a allen wrench that's provided
with<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.790> adjust<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.130> basically<00:02:26.130> a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
with it to adjust so this is basically a

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.600 
with it to adjust so this is basically a
block<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.630> aluminum<00:02:28.400> block<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.520> aluminum

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
block of aluminum block of aluminum

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.570 
block of aluminum block of aluminum
that's<00:02:30.150> come<00:02:30.510> down<00:02:30.540> into<00:02:31.080> little<00:02:31.860> pieces<00:02:32.190> and

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
that's come down into little pieces and

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.350 
that's come down into little pieces and
then<00:02:32.880> we<00:02:33.210> machine<00:02:34.040> our<00:02:35.040> own<00:02:35.520> hardware<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.180> of

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
then we machine our own hardware out of

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.700 
then we machine our own hardware out of
it<00:02:36.530> again<00:02:37.530> quarter<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.070> way<00:02:39.680> also<00:02:40.680> a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
it again quarter of the way also a

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.030 
it again quarter of the way also a
carbon-fiber<00:02:41.930> gas<00:02:42.930> pedal<00:02:43.320> right<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
carbon-fiber gas pedal right in the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.610 
carbon-fiber gas pedal right in the
middle<00:02:44.220> here<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:45.600> provides<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.290> really

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
middle here and that provides a really

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.280 
middle here and that provides a really
good<00:02:46.800> energy<00:02:47.010> transmission<00:02:47.970> from<00:02:48.270> Kota<00:02:49.020> heal

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
good energy transmission from Kota heal

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.280 
good energy transmission from Kota heal
that's<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.920> really<00:02:50.190> responsible<00:02:50.640> body

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
that's a really responsible body

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.630 
that's a really responsible body
