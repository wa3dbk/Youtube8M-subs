00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:28.860 

but<00:00:20.140> slower

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:28.870 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.610 

you

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.790 

so<00:00:35.620> we<00:00:35.920> start<00:00:36.250> with<00:00:36.520> an<00:00:37.059> a<00:00:37.210> chord<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:37.809> we<00:00:38.559> use

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
so we start with an a chord and we use

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.940 
so we start with an a chord and we use
the<00:00:38.980> thumb<00:00:39.250> on<00:00:39.520> the<00:00:39.699> a<00:00:39.730> string

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.480 

and<00:00:42.040> then<00:00:42.490> we<00:00:42.640> go<00:00:42.820> thumb<00:00:43.480> on<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.780> d-string

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
and then we go thumb on the d-string

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.990 
and then we go thumb on the d-string
cheese<00:00:46.210> string<00:00:46.570> first<00:00:46.840> finger<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:48.610> string

and<00:01:01.340> g<00:01:02.300> string<00:01:02.600> first<00:01:02.900> finger<00:01:04.480> first<00:01:05.480> start

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
and g string first finger first start

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.030 
and g string first finger first start
with<00:01:05.960> again<00:01:06.970> first<00:01:07.970> thumb<00:01:08.420> on<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.750> a<00:01:08.780> string

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.370 

and<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.000> next<00:01:12.240> three<00:01:12.660> strings<00:01:12.990> go<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and then the next three strings go a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
and then the next three strings go a
little<00:01:13.590> faster<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:18.470> D<00:01:19.470> G<00:01:19.800> B<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:21.000> then

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
little faster like it a D G B and then

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:33.610 
little faster like it a D G B and then
high<00:01:21.920> B<00:01:23.360> G<00:01:24.590> D<00:01:25.940> G

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:50.020 

is<00:01:33.740> lower

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.920 

second<00:01:51.030> measure<00:01:51.210> ye<00:01:51.900> Court<00:01:53.690> everything<00:01:54.690> is

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
second measure ye Court everything is

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.560 
second measure ye Court everything is
the<00:01:55.230> same<00:01:55.260> except<00:01:56.010> you<00:01:56.100> start<00:01:56.550> on<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.390> low<00:01:57.540> E

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the same except you start on the low E

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:25.940 
the same except you start on the low E
string<00:01:58.670> instead<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.730> the<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.000> string

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.920 

and<00:02:26.160> back<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> course

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.259 

okay<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.379> can<00:02:35.590> play<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.519> a<00:02:36.670> slow<00:02:36.970> tempo

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
okay so you can play it in a slow tempo

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.430 
okay so you can play it in a slow tempo
it<00:02:37.629> sounds<00:02:37.989> nice<00:02:38.280> faster<00:02:39.280> sounds<00:02:40.200> maybe<00:02:41.200> you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
it sounds nice faster sounds maybe you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:03:01.470 
it sounds nice faster sounds maybe you
bury<00:02:41.709> it

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:10.490 

but<00:03:02.480> faster

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.059 

the

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.559 

faster

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.580 

you

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:36.790 

you

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.860
