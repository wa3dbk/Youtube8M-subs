00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.480 

but<00:00:01.970> I<00:00:02.000> really<00:00:02.360> need<00:00:02.540> this<00:00:02.800> bass<00:00:03.800> in<00:00:04.100> here<00:00:04.370> I

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.490 
but I really need this bass in here I

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.290 
but I really need this bass in here I
think<00:00:04.609> because<00:00:05.059> it<00:00:05.539> adds<00:00:05.809> such<00:00:06.410> a<00:00:06.439> wonderful

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:07.300 
think because it adds such a wonderful

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.740 
think because it adds such a wonderful
subtle<00:00:08.590> foundation<00:00:09.590> to<00:00:10.340> the<00:00:10.370> darker<00:00:10.940> pencils

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.970 

as<00:00:14.750> many<00:00:14.990> of<00:00:15.140> you<00:00:15.230> know<00:00:15.410> you<00:00:15.680> know<00:00:15.769> when<00:00:15.920> you

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
as many of you know you know when you

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.349 
as many of you know you know when you
get<00:00:16.070> to<00:00:16.129> those<00:00:16.279> darker<00:00:16.640> pencils<00:00:16.999> that's<00:00:17.119> what

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
get to those darker pencils that's what

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.499 
get to those darker pencils that's what
the<00:00:17.449> patch<00:00:17.630> exercise<00:00:18.169> let<00:00:18.829> you<00:00:18.980> know<00:00:19.509> the

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
the patch exercise let you know the

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.419 
the patch exercise let you know the
texture<00:00:20.960> becomes<00:00:21.380> much<00:00:21.769> more<00:00:22.009> evident

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:22.429 
texture becomes much more evident

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.130 
texture becomes much more evident
because<00:00:22.699> of<00:00:22.820> the<00:00:22.909> softness<00:00:23.359> of<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.689> lead<00:00:23.929> and

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
because of the softness of the lead and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.569 
because of the softness of the lead and
the<00:00:24.829> dark<00:00:25.099> contrast<00:00:25.759> between<00:00:25.909> that<00:00:26.269> the<00:00:26.419> paper

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
the dark contrast between that the paper

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.970 
the dark contrast between that the paper
and<00:00:28.720> then<00:00:29.720> if<00:00:29.869> you<00:00:29.960> go<00:00:30.169> ahead<00:00:30.319> and<00:00:30.589> say<00:00:30.739> well<00:00:30.949> I

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
and then if you go ahead and say well I

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.190 
and then if you go ahead and say well I
can<00:00:31.460> I<00:00:31.669> can<00:00:31.849> smooth<00:00:32.119> it<00:00:32.270> out<00:00:32.360> afterwards

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
can I can smooth it out afterwards

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.330 
can I can smooth it out afterwards
you're<00:00:33.440> still<00:00:33.680> going<00:00:33.830> to<00:00:33.890> come<00:00:33.980> up<00:00:34.160> with<00:00:34.250> a

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
you're still going to come up with a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.460 
you're still going to come up with a
little<00:00:34.520> bit<00:00:34.640> different<00:00:34.970> texture<00:00:35.300> than<00:00:36.290> you

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
little bit different texture than you

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.840 
little bit different texture than you
would<00:00:36.680> if<00:00:36.860> you<00:00:36.950> build<00:00:37.160> it<00:00:37.280> up<00:00:37.340> from<00:00:37.400> the<00:00:37.700> base

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
would if you build it up from the base

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.890 
would if you build it up from the base
with<00:00:38.360> a<00:00:38.390> 4h<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.910> then<00:00:40.910> that<00:00:41.120> gives<00:00:41.690> me<00:00:41.810> the

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
with a 4h and then that gives me the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.570 
with a 4h and then that gives me the
opportunity<00:00:42.020> to<00:00:42.320> come<00:00:42.470> into<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.830> 4-h<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.460> do

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
opportunity to come into the 4-h and do

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.770 
opportunity to come into the 4-h and do
what<00:00:43.730> I'm<00:00:43.820> doing<00:00:44.180> mold<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.320> just<00:00:45.650> fine-tune

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
what I'm doing mold and just fine-tune

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:55.360 
what I'm doing mold and just fine-tune
the<00:00:47.780> contours<00:00:51.940> no<00:00:53.830> I'm<00:00:54.830> going<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.100> go<00:00:55.220> ahead

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
the contours no I'm going to go ahead

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.250 
the contours no I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:55.610> get<00:00:56.060> a<00:00:56.090> little<00:00:56.240> more<00:00:56.450> value<00:00:56.870> in<00:00:56.990> here

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
and get a little more value in here

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.950 
and get a little more value in here
because<00:00:57.530> I'm<00:00:57.920> I've<00:00:58.910> come<00:00:59.240> to<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.450> limit<00:00:59.750> of<00:00:59.840> my

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
because I'm I've come to the limit of my

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.460 
because I'm I've come to the limit of my
4-h<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:03.800> remember<00:01:04.280> because<00:01:04.810> this<00:01:05.810> right<00:01:06.170> here

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
4-h and remember because this right here

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.399 
4-h and remember because this right here
it<00:01:06.590> goes<00:01:07.070> up<00:01:07.280> into<00:01:07.550> a<00:01:07.580> contour<00:01:08.180> if<00:01:09.050> you're<00:01:09.260> not

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
it goes up into a contour if you're not

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.280 
it goes up into a contour if you're not
careful<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:10.190> can<00:01:10.370> make<00:01:10.580> a<00:01:10.720> clean<00:01:11.720> line<00:01:12.020> all

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
careful you can make a clean line all

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.230 
careful you can make a clean line all
the<00:01:12.409> way<00:01:12.440> up<00:01:12.680> here<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:13.040> isn't<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:14.000> is<00:01:14.210> a

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
the way up here it isn't this is a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.530 
the way up here it isn't this is a
contour<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.409> and<00:01:15.680> out<00:01:15.800> and<00:01:16.190> down<00:01:16.250> deep<00:01:16.970> but

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
contour in and out and down deep but

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.510 
contour in and out and down deep but
right<00:01:17.870> here<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:18.500> nose<00:01:18.770> is<00:01:18.800> flared<00:01:19.310> out

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
right here this nose is flared out

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.700 
right here this nose is flared out
enough<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:20.570> start<00:01:20.840> having<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.260> clean<00:01:21.500> edge

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
enough that we start having a clean edge

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.560 
enough that we start having a clean edge
that<00:01:22.610> is<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.120> only<00:01:23.240> place<00:01:23.690> that<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.260> as<00:01:25.420> we<00:01:26.420> go

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
that is the only place that is as we go

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.190 
that is the only place that is as we go
towards<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.140> upper<00:01:27.409> part<00:01:27.620> of<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.770> nose<00:01:27.950> and

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
towards the upper part of the nose and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.930 
towards the upper part of the nose and
then<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:30.560> want<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.010> have<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.190> contrast<00:01:31.820> between

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
then I want to have a contrast between

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.160 
then I want to have a contrast between
this<00:01:32.479> clean<00:01:32.900> edge<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:35.540> shadow<00:01:35.930> that's

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
this clean edge and the shadow that's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.350 
this clean edge and the shadow that's
being<00:01:36.440> cast<00:01:36.799> it<00:01:37.370> can<00:01:37.549> be<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.700> very<00:01:37.909> defined

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
being cast it can be a very defined

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.600 
being cast it can be a very defined
shadow<00:01:38.720> but<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.350> just<00:01:39.620> want<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:39.920> knock<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.490> edge

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
shadow but I just want to knock the edge

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:50.800 
shadow but I just want to knock the edge
off<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.210> there's<00:01:41.659> no<00:01:41.810> confusion

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.359 

remember<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:51.990> fear<00:01:52.320> exercise<00:01:52.890> all<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
remember that's fear exercise all the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.520 
remember that's fear exercise all the
way<00:01:53.610> through<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.030> process<00:01:54.150> because<00:01:54.840> there

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
way through this process because there

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.560 
way through this process because there
are<00:01:55.740> subtly<00:01:56.720> deeper<00:01:57.720> darker<00:01:58.680> places<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.570> that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
are subtly deeper darker places and that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.990 
are subtly deeper darker places and that
sphere<00:02:01.140> gives<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.680> opportunity<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.340> see

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
sphere gives you that opportunity to see

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.130 
sphere gives you that opportunity to see
and<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.789> express<00:02:05.789> that<00:02:06.149> where<00:02:06.899> there's

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
and and and express that where there's

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.360 
and and and express that where there's
no<00:02:07.860> edge<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.209> contour<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:11.160> gives

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
no edge it's just a contour and it gives

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
no edge it's just a contour and it gives
you<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:12.140> part<00:02:13.140> that's<00:02:14.000> farthest<00:02:15.000> between

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
you that part that's farthest between

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:27.740 
you that part that's farthest between
the<00:02:15.540> two<00:02:15.690> light<00:02:15.870> sources<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:27.120> know<00:02:27.299> where<00:02:27.569> in

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the two light sources you know where in

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.370 
the two light sources you know where in
the<00:02:27.870> world

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
the world

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.350 
the world
I<00:02:28.410> can<00:02:28.680> always<00:02:28.980> line<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.310> things<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.030> want<00:02:30.299> to

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
I can always line up things I want to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.850 
I can always line up things I want to
know<00:02:30.480> where<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.780> little<00:02:30.989> value<00:02:31.470> comes<00:02:31.680> up

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
know where this little value comes up

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.400 
know where this little value comes up
here<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.819> maybe<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.720> need<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.019> move<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.350> over

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
here so maybe I need to move that over

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.520 
here so maybe I need to move that over
just<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:35.310> little<00:02:35.340> bit<00:02:39.170> always<00:02:40.170> something<00:02:40.500> to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
just a little bit always something to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.600 
just a little bit always something to
line<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.769> up<00:02:40.950> with<00:02:41.010> vertically<00:02:41.790> horizontally

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
line it up with vertically horizontally

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.650 
line it up with vertically horizontally
you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.640> use<00:02:44.910> your<00:02:45.060> reference<00:02:45.480> with<00:02:45.630> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you can use your reference with the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.210 
you can use your reference with the
straightedge<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.620> use<00:02:46.709> your<00:02:46.860> divider

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
straightedge you can use your divider

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.640 
straightedge you can use your divider
you<00:02:48.030> know<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> decide<00:02:48.600> how<00:02:48.810> far<00:02:48.840> over<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.470> goes

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
you know to decide how far over it goes

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.259 
you know to decide how far over it goes
I<00:02:50.870> like<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.049> use<00:02:52.200> them<00:02:52.350> all<00:02:55.609> so<00:02:56.609> if<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.940> didn't

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
I like to use them all so if I didn't

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.710 
I like to use them all so if I didn't
make<00:02:57.450> some<00:02:58.049> major<00:02:58.290> mistake<00:02:59.390> you<00:03:00.390> know<00:03:00.510> with

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
make some major mistake you know with

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.650 
make some major mistake you know with
one<00:03:01.049> other<00:03:01.560> procedures<00:03:02.130> then<00:03:02.579> I<00:03:02.910> can<00:03:03.120> catch<00:03:03.450> it

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
one other procedures then I can catch it

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.400 
one other procedures then I can catch it
with<00:03:03.780> something<00:03:04.019> else<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:06.019> guess<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.079> didn't<00:03:07.290> say

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
with something else I guess I didn't say

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.460 
with something else I guess I didn't say
that<00:03:07.620> right<00:03:07.650> if<00:03:08.549> I<00:03:08.730> make<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.359> little<00:03:09.840> bit<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.320> a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
that right if I make a little bit of a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.199 
that right if I make a little bit of a
slip<00:03:10.799> or<00:03:10.980> something<00:03:11.190> with<00:03:11.459> one<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.970> things

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
slip or something with one of the things

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.110 
slip or something with one of the things
I<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.660> always<00:03:12.900> be<00:03:13.380> looking<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:14.489> see<00:03:14.730> how<00:03:14.910> it

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
I can always be looking to see how it

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.910 
I can always be looking to see how it
measures<00:03:15.480> up<00:03:15.690> with<00:03:16.200> all<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.590> other<00:03:16.769> things

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
measures up with all the other things

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.660 
measures up with all the other things
visually<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.200> gives<00:03:19.739> me<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:19.859> great<00:03:20.160> clue<00:03:20.400> well

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
visually so I gives me a great clue well

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.819 
visually so I gives me a great clue well
I<00:03:20.700> must<00:03:21.120> have<00:03:21.239> had<00:03:21.420> something<00:03:21.720> slip<00:03:22.079> here<00:03:22.320> this

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
I must have had something slip here this

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.710 
I must have had something slip here this
angle<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.340> wrong<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.850> must<00:03:24.180> have<00:03:24.359> had<00:03:24.450> something

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
angle is wrong I must have had something

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:39.460 
angle is wrong I must have had something
slip<00:03:25.079> here<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.769> doesn't<00:03:26.130> line<00:03:26.280> up

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.400 

and<00:03:40.130> again<00:03:40.430> some<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:40.940> these<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:42.020> know<00:03:42.140> there's

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
and again some of these you know there's

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.730 
and again some of these you know there's
I<00:03:42.650> see<00:03:42.920> little<00:03:43.190> little<00:03:44.440> recessions<00:03:45.440> or

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
I see little little recessions or

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.050 
I see little little recessions or
whatever<00:03:46.240> indentations<00:03:47.240> here<00:03:47.600> as<00:03:48.440> we<00:03:48.590> go

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
whatever indentations here as we go

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.360 
whatever indentations here as we go
along<00:03:50.060> here<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:51.650> don't<00:03:51.710> want<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.010> make<00:03:52.190> too

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
along here and I don't want to make too

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.620 
along here and I don't want to make too
much<00:03:52.520> out<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:52.790> them<00:03:53.000> but<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.240> am<00:03:53.390> going<00:03:53.570> to

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
much out of them but I am going to

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.350 
much out of them but I am going to
document<00:03:54.200> them<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:54.440> try<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.160> see<00:03:55.640> the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
document them and try to see the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.190 
document them and try to see the
direction<00:03:57.350> of<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.040> curve<00:03:58.810> because<00:03:59.810> there<00:03:59.990> is

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
direction of the curve because there is

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.490 
direction of the curve because there is
a<00:04:00.730> compliment<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.270> contour<00:04:02.870> of<00:04:02.990> his

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
a compliment to the contour of his

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:25.820 
a compliment to the contour of his
features

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.260 

so<00:04:26.830> it's<00:04:26.980> kind<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.310> like<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.640> barrel<00:04:28.060> you

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
so it's kind of like the barrel you

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.910 
so it's kind of like the barrel you
could<00:04:28.750> take<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.050> barrel<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:29.500> wrap<00:04:29.710> the

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
could take the barrel and wrap the

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.300 
could take the barrel and wrap the
stripes<00:04:30.370> around<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.850> it's<00:04:31.000> kind<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.270> like<00:04:31.420> that

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
stripes around it it's kind of like that

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.380 
stripes around it it's kind of like that
except<00:04:33.310> with<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.580> barrel<00:04:33.850> we<00:04:34.000> really<00:04:34.270> don't

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
except with the barrel we really don't

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.390 
except with the barrel we really don't
see<00:04:34.750> what<00:04:34.960> it<00:04:35.080> would<00:04:35.170> be<00:04:35.320> like<00:04:35.350> if<00:04:35.830> we<00:04:36.010> were<00:04:36.040> to

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
see what it would be like if we were to

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.890 
see what it would be like if we were to
be<00:04:36.550> looking<00:04:36.730> at<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.150> from<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.420> three-quarter

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
be looking at it from a three-quarter

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.480 
be looking at it from a three-quarter
angle<00:04:38.230> or<00:04:38.350> something<00:04:38.500> where<00:04:38.860> you'd<00:04:39.040> see<00:04:39.070> those

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
angle or something where you'd see those

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.470 
angle or something where you'd see those
stripes<00:04:40.050> really<00:04:41.050> change<00:04:41.410> in<00:04:41.680> direction<00:04:41.860> and

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
stripes really change in direction and

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:50.850 
stripes really change in direction and
width<00:04:43.480> and<00:04:43.750> thickness<00:04:49.230> and<00:04:50.230> for<00:04:50.500> some<00:04:50.680> of<00:04:50.770> you

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
width and thickness and for some of you

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.080 
width and thickness and for some of you
to<00:04:50.950> don't<00:04:51.160> know<00:04:51.220> what<00:04:51.430> I'm<00:04:51.520> talking<00:04:51.760> about<00:04:51.820> the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
to don't know what I'm talking about the

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.230 
to don't know what I'm talking about the
barrel<00:04:52.450> is<00:04:52.630> the<00:04:52.840> one<00:04:53.380> of<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:55.030> light

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
barrel is the one of the the light

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.150 
barrel is the one of the the light
exercises<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:58.630> see<00:04:58.900> if<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.170> can<00:05:00.360> just

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
exercises to see if you can just

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.070 
exercises to see if you can just
understand<00:05:03.160> how<00:05:03.520> everything<00:05:03.850> gets<00:05:04.180> lighter

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
understand how everything gets lighter

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.630 
understand how everything gets lighter
when<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.410> comes<00:05:05.590> towards<00:05:05.920> the<00:05:06.160> light<00:05:06.310> and

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
when it comes towards the light and

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.830 
when it comes towards the light and
everything<00:05:06.910> gets<00:05:07.090> darker<00:05:07.480> when<00:05:07.600> it<00:05:07.690> goes

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
everything gets darker when it goes

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.700 
everything gets darker when it goes
towards<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.560> where<00:05:09.280> there's<00:05:09.490> less<00:05:09.670> light
