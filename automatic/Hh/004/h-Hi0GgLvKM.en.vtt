of<00:01:30.540> new<00:01:30.720> ones<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:31.020> since<00:01:31.740> I've<00:01:31.890> done<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> lot<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
of new ones now since I've done a lot of

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.789 
of new ones now since I've done a lot of
subscribers<00:01:32.659> since<00:01:33.659> I've<00:01:34.170> put<00:01:34.409> out<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.650> one

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
subscribers since I've put out this one

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.620 
subscribers since I've put out this one
I<00:01:34.829> think<00:01:34.950> that's<00:01:35.250> about<00:01:35.310> 1,000<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.150> one<00:01:36.329> know

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
I think that's about 1,000 is one know

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.140 
I think that's about 1,000 is one know
about<00:01:36.740> 2,100<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.009> should<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.790> getting<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> lot

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
about 2,100 so should be getting a lot

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.899 
about 2,100 so should be getting a lot
