hello and welcome to Professor
pincushion<00:00:07.740> in<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.430> tutorial<00:00:08.610> I'm<00:00:09.030> going<00:00:09.240> to

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
pincushion in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.570 
pincushion in this tutorial I'm going to
be<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.630> over<00:00:09.960> hand<00:00:10.470> needles<00:00:10.830> even<00:00:11.430> though

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
be going over hand needles even though

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.520 
be going over hand needles even though
we<00:00:11.880> may<00:00:12.090> be<00:00:12.120> sewing<00:00:12.570> most<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.990> our<00:00:13.110> step<00:00:13.350> by

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
we may be sewing most of our step by

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.350 
we may be sewing most of our step by
Machine<00:00:14.010> there<00:00:14.670> are<00:00:14.820> going<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.000> be<00:00:15.090> cases

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
Machine there are going to be cases

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.330 
Machine there are going to be cases
where<00:00:15.930> you<00:00:16.080> are<00:00:16.110> going<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.770> need<00:00:16.860> to<00:00:17.010> do<00:00:17.130> some

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
where you are going to need to do some

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.370 
where you are going to need to do some
hand<00:00:17.610> sewing<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.660> maybe<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.140> first

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
hand sewing so maybe when you first

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.560 
hand sewing so maybe when you first
started<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.740> learn<00:00:19.950> how<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.220> sew<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:21.150> purchase

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
started to learn how to sew you purchase

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.000 
started to learn how to sew you purchase
something<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.930> looked<00:00:22.200> like<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.350> which<00:00:22.830> is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
something that looked like this which is

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
something that looked like this which is
just<00:00:23.040> an<00:00:23.430> assortment<00:00:23.700> of<00:00:23.940> needles<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
just an assortment of needles the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.660 
just an assortment of needles the
problem<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.980> they<00:00:26.220> don't<00:00:26.340> exactly

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
problem with this is they don't exactly

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.790 
problem with this is they don't exactly
tell<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.570> these<00:00:27.720> needles<00:00:28.110> are<00:00:28.260> for<00:00:28.530> or

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
tell you what these needles are for or

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.830 
tell you what these needles are for or
what<00:00:29.040> they<00:00:29.190> even<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.360> I'm<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.690> go

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
what they even are so I'm going to go

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.269 
what they even are so I'm going to go
over<00:00:30.870> some<00:00:31.200> of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.350> basic<00:00:31.680> needles<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.129> may

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
over some of the basic needles you may

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.190 
over some of the basic needles you may
find<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.329> type<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.570> projects<00:00:34.079> you're

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
find and what type of projects you're

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.549 
find and what type of projects you're
going<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> use<00:00:34.680> them<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:36.050> if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.230> look<00:00:37.379> at<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
going to use them for if you look at a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.259 
going to use them for if you look at a
package<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.339> sort<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.699> needle<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.120> can

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
package of a sort of needle so you can

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.180 
package of a sort of needle so you can
clearly<00:00:39.539> see<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.140> needles<00:00:40.649> are<00:00:40.769> coming<00:00:41.070> in

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
clearly see that needles are coming in

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.319 
clearly see that needles are coming in
different<00:00:41.609> lengths<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.059> different

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
different lengths and different

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.810 
different lengths and different
thicknesses<00:00:43.050> hand<00:00:43.800> needles<00:00:44.159> actually<00:00:44.609> come

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
thicknesses hand needles actually come

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.369 
thicknesses hand needles actually come
in<00:00:45.120> their<00:00:45.329> own<00:00:45.359> sizes

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
in their own sizes

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.470 
in their own sizes
so<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.070> important<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.519> you<00:00:47.609> use<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.239> right

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
so it's important that you use the right

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270 
so it's important that you use the right
needle<00:00:48.749> because<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.800> want<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> make<00:00:50.249> sure

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
needle because you want to make sure

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.099 
needle because you want to make sure
that<00:00:50.699> you<00:00:50.819> don't<00:00:50.999> use<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> needle<00:00:51.510> that's<00:00:51.809> too

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
that you don't use a needle that's too

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.139 
that you don't use a needle that's too
big<00:00:52.409> for<00:00:52.890> something<00:00:53.249> very<00:00:53.370> delicate<00:00:53.670> like

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
big for something very delicate like

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029 
big for something very delicate like
chiffon<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:54.989> you're<00:00:55.140> poking<00:00:55.530> big<00:00:55.739> holes

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
chiffon and then you're poking big holes

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.459 
chiffon and then you're poking big holes
through<00:00:56.429> it<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.300> same<00:00:57.510> time<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.379> don't

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
through it at the same time you don't

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.989 
through it at the same time you don't
want<00:00:58.589> to<00:00:58.769> use<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> needle<00:00:59.159> that's<00:00:59.429> too<00:00:59.789> small

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999 
want to use a needle that's too small

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.360 
want to use a needle that's too small
and<00:01:00.329> delicate<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:01.350> something<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.920> denim

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
and delicate for something like denim

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.950 
and delicate for something like denim
and<00:01:02.609> then<00:01:02.819> you<00:01:02.940> end<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.300> bending<00:01:03.780> or<00:01:03.929> breaking

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and then you end up bending or breaking

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.450 
and then you end up bending or breaking
your<00:01:04.470> needles<00:01:04.800> so<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.159> why<00:01:05.309> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
your needles so that's why it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.950 
your needles so that's why it's
important<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> pick<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.120> right<00:01:06.420> needle<00:01:06.690> for

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
important to pick the right needle for

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.429 
important to pick the right needle for
your<00:01:06.990> project<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.770> far<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:08.850> sizing<00:01:09.479> what<00:01:10.320> you

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
your project as far as sizing what you

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.950 
your project as far as sizing what you
need<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.770> remember<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.969> smaller<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
need to remember is the smaller the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.490 
need to remember is the smaller the
number<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.890> size<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:15.719> longer<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
number for the size the longer and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
number for the size the longer and
thicker<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.310> needle<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.240> so

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
thicker the needle is going to be so

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.170 
thicker the needle is going to be so
more<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.020> heavy-duty<00:01:19.350> job<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.460> larger<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
more of a heavy-duty job the larger the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.080 
more of a heavy-duty job the larger the
number<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.799> finer<00:01:23.219> and<00:01:23.579> thinner<00:01:23.670> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
number is the finer and thinner and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.029 
number is the finer and thinner and
smaller<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.869> needle<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.289> going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.799> so

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
smaller the needle is going to be so

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.279 
smaller the needle is going to be so
these<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.430> both<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.969> same<00:01:27.240> types<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.899> needle

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
these are both the same types of needle

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.730 
these are both the same types of needle
this<00:01:29.219> one<00:01:29.520> may<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:29.969> a<00:01:30.270> size<00:01:30.570> 8<00:01:30.899> and<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.619> is

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
this one may be a size 8 and this is

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010 
this one may be a size 8 and this is
going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> size<00:01:32.490> 4<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.539> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.750> clearly

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
going to be a size 4 so you can clearly

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.370 
going to be a size 4 so you can clearly
see<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.880> longer<00:01:36.299> than<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.780> needle<00:01:37.109> over

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
see this is longer than this needle over

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.620 
see this is longer than this needle over
here<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.700> working<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.299> something

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
here so if I'm working with something

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.810 
here so if I'm working with something
delicate<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.109> chiffon<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.670> want

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
delicate like chiffon I'm going to want

be<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:52.859> over<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.369> different<00:01:53.729> types<00:01:53.939> of

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
be going over the different types of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.700 
be going over the different types of
needles<00:01:54.299> now<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.600> first<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.020> here<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.500> is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
needles now the first one here this is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.039 
needles now the first one here this is
called<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.189> sharp<00:01:56.579> needle<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.600> comes<00:01:57.840> in

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
called a sharp needle and it comes in

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.889 
called a sharp needle and it comes in
different<00:01:58.289> sizes<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:59.100> well<00:01:59.520> now<00:02:00.179> the<00:02:00.240> sharp

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
different sizes as well now the sharp

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.810 
different sizes as well now the sharp
needle<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.920> most<00:02:02.070> common<00:02:02.219> and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
needle I think is the most common and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.120 
needle I think is the most common and
probably<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> workhorse<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.499> the<00:02:04.890> sewing

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
probably the workhorse of the sewing

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.859 
probably the workhorse of the sewing
needles<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.479> pretty<00:02:06.659> much<00:02:06.749> use

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
needles because you can pretty much use

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.749 
needles because you can pretty much use
it<00:02:07.170> with<00:02:07.289> many<00:02:07.619> different<00:02:07.890> types<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.399> sewing

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
it with many different types of sewing

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.550 
it with many different types of sewing
projects<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:10.020> what<00:02:10.200> type<00:02:10.410> of

needle<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.890> use<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.250> would<00:02:11.610> use<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.970> sharp<00:02:12.240> now

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
needle to use I would use the sharp now

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.970

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
not ideal to just go straight down and

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:28.880 
not ideal to just go straight down and
up<00:04:27.300> instead<00:04:27.990> maybe<00:04:28.229> you're<00:04:28.440> sewing<00:04:28.770> on<00:04:28.860> a

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890

needle down in a curve
right<00:04:31.939> back<00:04:32.150> up<00:04:32.360> which<00:04:32.689> makes<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.139> lot

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
right back up which makes it a lot

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.010 
right back up which makes it a lot
easier<00:04:33.710> to<00:04:33.860> use<00:04:34.129> there<00:04:34.939> are<00:04:34.969> other<00:04:35.509> types<00:04:35.870> of

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
easier to use there are other types of

easier to use there are other types of
needles<00:04:36.229> which<00:04:36.589> I<00:04:36.740> haven't<00:04:37.249> covered<00:04:37.430> but

going to come across the most often
hopefully<00:04:42.499> by<00:04:42.620> using<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.069> correct<00:04:43.370> needle

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729
