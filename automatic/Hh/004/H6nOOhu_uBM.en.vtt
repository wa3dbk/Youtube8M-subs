00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.440
 Speak, people, beauty, I'm bringing 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.400
 on here 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.280
 the galaxy pocket so let's see what 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.370
 it really comes in the device box because 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.690
 many say they do not see chargers 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.990
 say they do not see a micro sd card 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.560
 But probably not even this comes 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:30.410
 micro SD card because this device 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.270
 What was missing on the galaxy and on it? 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:39.950
 generously and then internal memory and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:44.370
 three gigabytes and in y is only 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.129
 150 mb links that stay so far 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.020
 little 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:01:02.399
 so let's see what you really have 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:01:04.830
 in the box that is who is remembering that there 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.659
 Do you have any doubts about this? 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.479
 leave the commentary in the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.369
 comments that I will make 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.369
 some videos about it 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:30.090
 not only the one like the galaxy and me too 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:34.790
 I came here in a box well who's good 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.790
 a small box 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:46.110
 it is a smaller device than it is davi 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:54.360
 y her fabric that is just 2.8 inches 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:02:00.990
 and a y is 3 inches is not here 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.670
 The device came later. I'll be there. 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.460
 making a video about their 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.460
 features size and functionality 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:23.210
 since then a headset in white color 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.150
 is good 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:37.090
 entrance here and 2 very good entrance 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:45.640
 At least I think there the USB cable 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:48.770
 and here's the recharger, that's good, right? 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:54.800
 separately it has a coming 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:57.770
 to be inserted the USB cable 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.600
 but this file separately 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.600
 entry is the same 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:16.310
 here the entrance came capped so 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:19.519
 I had the battery to battery that is the 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.420

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.640

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.180
 really want if anyone knows can 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.450
 leave us comment I say that the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.140
 capacity here is only 1,200 mm 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.140
 H 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:48.459
 How do you always come there and if it 's all right? 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:48.459
 here is the service address 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.890
 telephone 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:59.799
 the user guide the guide accuses the user 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:04.579
 Do not even come and flirt. 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.739
 registering the appliance left the air in 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.269
 a certain amount for this 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.269
 institution here 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.850
 I always do this, I have it here too. 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.940
 app tracking is fine 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:28.530
 practically all come from this line 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:29.400
 galaxy that is android is ok then it is 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.690
 there 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:37.050
 This is what they see in it I think 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.370
 did not really come 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.370
 the micro sd 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:56.210
 so let's open it here to see if it 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:59.550
 It came here. It did not come. It's good. 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.700
 here the micro sd input 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:08.420

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:11.610
 Internal memory is 3gb 3 gigas 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.940

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.860

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.940

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.980
