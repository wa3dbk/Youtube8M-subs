00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.210
 hello friends I'm 301 dan and 2 and this is my 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.889
 first video of the year as well says the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.320
 title I'll talk about the topic more 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.060
 controversial and controversial of the bubi and are 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.539
 the new rules with which it will come 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.070
 accompanied the new junior series and 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.740
 First of all, I thank you all 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.660
 those who have supported me my almost 600 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.369
 daniil and see if the youtube people that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.619
 see me at least just to consult 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.250
 some things about the bug and now without 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.870
 more preambles let's start a few months ago 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.870
 the news spread that a new 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.120
 July- series would be launched in 2014 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.950
 and just a few weeks ago it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.500
 they released some articles that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.300
 they revealed information supposedly 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.399
 confirmed about the game 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.949
 the most famous latin pages of yuyo 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.480
 yukio professional and I and Spanish 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.370
 have kept up with such 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.800
 information and so you see the change 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.519
 of the game will not be absolute but it will be very 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.350
 remarkable 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.570
 there are three very appreciable changes that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.640
 could cause a total alteration of the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.950
 game since for a little more than 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.369
 ten years had not changed those rules 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.290
 basic so to speak the first change 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.450
 it is at the beginning of the duel this 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.580
 will consist of the player who starts 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.100
 the duel will not steal letter this will leave 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.900
 with your 5 start cards only to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.330
 my point of view is a drastic change 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.520
 since being first gives you a little more 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.200
 of advantage not only because you can do 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.240
 several plays without fear that your 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.940
 opponent kill you the play with some 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.190
 trap go fuck now it will be risky 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.890
 use working as a mask 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.110
 effects and crows of jean-luc see between 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.780
 others this for fear of stealing those in the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.610
 first hand when you start the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.920
 next change is with the letters 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.780
 field spells this will consist of that 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.850
 both players can control a 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.190
 field spell at the same time by 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.259
 example if my opponent has a stamp of 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.450
 ory calcos activated it active a micro 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.430
 valley both fields will remain active 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.560
 what I'm not sure is if only 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.840
 will affect their respective side of the field or 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.050
 will completely affect the field if 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.640
 you know that leave it in the comments 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.739
 referring to the observation that 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.510
 made my friend lobito the seal of ory 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.910
 calcos will have a new way of 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.980
 Fuck us if in case you spend letters to 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.260
 the asshole to kill a single letter is 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.540
 risky now it will be riskier 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.760
 why not 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.190
 replacing the field spell now 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.470
 As always happens new series new 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.599
 letters the new series will lead to a 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.940
 new type of cards called monsters 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.160
 pendulum these letters will be a mix 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.350
 strange of monsters with magic cards 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.390
 they will have orange border of half towards 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.510
 up and half down will have 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.520
 green edge the field will have a not so 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.709
 slight change since it will be added a 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.110
 new area to play these new 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.239
 monsters will be added one in the middle of the 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.860
 cemetery and the tec area and the other 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.019
 in the middle of the extra of ki the zone of 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.239
 letters spell field area scale 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.310
 blue pendulum made a pendulum scale 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.620
 red the new monsters handle 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.239
 blue and red pendulum scales to this is 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.880
 should these new zones be added 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.760
 to the field but it's not all they will also have 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.010
 your own rules of invocation to the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.900
 look like these monsters will be included 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.670
 on the main deck but when it 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.010
 die instead of sending them to 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.569
 cemetery should be placed in the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.430
 face-up extra zone 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.170
 normally the extra c's is placed 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.150
 upside down so that the sissy of your 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.250
 opponent does not see them since you can use 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.840
 that information to earn you 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.940
 after having put the monster 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.860
 pendulum on your extra deck there will stay 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.720
 I do not know why but I think that konami 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.730
 will launch some letters that can 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.680
 apply its effects fulfilling as 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.750
 activation condition that you have a 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.120
 certain amount of pendulum monsters in 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.100
 your extra deck the next thing you have to 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.230
 know about these confusing monsters 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.300
 homosexuals that work like letters 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.550
 magical is that when you have monsters 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.530
 pendulum in its zones of pendulum scales 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.300
 you can invoke any amount of 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.340
 monsters from your hand or monsters 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.200
 pendulum that are in your extra than that 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.730
 have levels that are in the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.500
 interval of the scales of the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.440
 pendulum monsters that you have in your 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.590
 zones that explanation was somewhat confusing 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.780
 now goes the example before the example 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.150
 I want to tell you something that I deduced but not 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.489
 I'm sure if it's this way what 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.380
 I deduced was that in the red pendulum zone 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.540
 must meet the monster with the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.940
 pendulum scale greater than that color and in 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.130
 the blue zone the monster with the scale 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.500
 minor of that color I hope you understand 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.290
 a little the red zone is for the elderly 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.440
 and the blue for the minors according to me 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.930
 here's the example if you have a monster 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.910
 pendulum in your blue zone with scale 1 and 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.170
 another pendulum monster in your red zone 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.000
 with scale 8 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.740
 you can invoke any amount of 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.810
 legal monsters from your hand or 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.520
 any amount of pendulum monsters 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.440
 that are in your extra that 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.060
 have 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 stars since they are 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.060
 the numbers that are in the 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.650
 interval from 1 to 8 when saying monsters 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.050
 legal I mean they can be 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.330
 invoked in any way monsters 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.660
 illegals would be dark armed dragon 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.520
 dragon of the final judgment among others 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.890
 there are cats that I still do not know but they have 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.840
 patience as soon as I have the information 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.690
 necessary for a demonstration of the 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.700
 new rules I will upload a new video the 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.100
 new series will be launched between March and 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.440
 April of this year and the axis will begin with 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.780
 the new rules in that same month that 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.640
 is what some news is speculated 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.710
 what I have about 'el juli' is that konami 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.870
 will launch a structured deck of heroes 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.180
 elementary expect what 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.740
 I will soon upload my predictions for the 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.080
 band list of April and if I have time 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.170
