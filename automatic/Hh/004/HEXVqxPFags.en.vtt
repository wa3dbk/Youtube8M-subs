see one two three are overlapped all the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.499 
see one two three are overlapped all the
way<00:01:43.560> down<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> point<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.270> very

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
way down to the point this is very

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.569 
way down to the point this is very
important<00:01:46.229> because<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:47.159> helps

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
important because this is what helps

when you're working with it the icing

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.910 
when you're working with it the icing

does not break through the side if I had

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.149 
does not break through the side if I had
not<00:01:55.920> pulled<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> together<00:02:00.560> by<00:02:01.560> gotten<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.979> nice

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
not pulled it together by gotten a nice

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.539 
not pulled it together by gotten a nice
tight<00:02:02.549> point<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> didn't<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.369> it

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
tight point but I didn't have it

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.479 
tight point but I didn't have it
overlapped<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.420> way<00:02:06.509> along<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:08.340> can

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
overlapped all the way along you can

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.850 
overlapped all the way along you can
possibly<00:02:09.000> see<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.539> shadow<00:02:09.959> or<00:02:10.379> see<00:02:10.619> right

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
possibly see a shadow or see right

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.540 
possibly see a shadow or see right
through<00:02:11.129> here<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.670> not<00:02:11.940> over

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
through here it's not over

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.670 
through here it's not over
out<00:02:12.670> right<00:02:13.480> there<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.900> would<00:02:14.020> be<00:02:14.140> very<00:02:14.380> easy

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
out right there it would be very easy

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.890 
out right there it would be very easy
for<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:15.190> bag<00:02:15.460> to<00:02:15.760> break<00:02:16.090> because<00:02:16.330> it's<00:02:16.660> only

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
for that bag to break because it's only

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.310 
for that bag to break because it's only
one<00:02:17.200> layer<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.800> parchment<00:02:18.370> instead<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.910> three

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
one layer of parchment instead of three

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.730 
one layer of parchment instead of three
so<00:02:20.320> make<00:02:20.530> sure<00:02:20.560> when<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.130> do<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:23.320> tighten

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
so make sure when you do it to tighten

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.780 
so make sure when you do it to tighten
it<00:02:23.830> nicely<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.170> have<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.440> cone<00:02:26.790> now

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
it nicely so that you have a cone now

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.240 
it nicely so that you have a cone now
I'd<00:02:28.090> like<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.360> fold<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:28.990> cone<00:02:29.290> down<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:30.100> that

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
I'd like to fold this cone down so that

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.400 
I'd like to fold this cone down so that
I<00:02:30.310> can<00:02:30.610> use<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:31.060> when<00:02:31.240> I<00:02:31.750> first<00:02:32.080> started

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
I can use it when I first started

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.900 
I can use it when I first started
decorating<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.190> would<00:02:33.370> take<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.610> piece<00:02:33.880> of

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
decorating I would take a piece of

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.030 
decorating I would take a piece of
scotch<00:02:34.300> tape<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.930> tape<00:02:35.230> right<00:02:35.530> along<00:02:35.590> the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
scotch tape and tape right along the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.430 
scotch tape and tape right along the
seam<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:36.580> let<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.300> hold<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:37.870> place<00:02:37.930> and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
seam and let that hold it in place and

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.750 
seam and let that hold it in place and
you<00:02:38.590> could<00:02:38.770> do<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.070> if<00:02:39.220> that's<00:02:39.400> what<00:02:39.610> makes

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
you could do that if that's what makes

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.530 
you could do that if that's what makes
you<00:02:39.940> comfortable

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
you comfortable

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.830 
you comfortable
I<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.340> take<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.940> fold<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.540> three

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
I like to take and fold the three

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.610 
I like to take and fold the three
corners<00:02:44.290> down<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:46.390> just<00:02:46.750> run<00:02:47.440> my

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
corners down and I just run my

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.500 
corners down and I just run my
thumbnails<00:02:48.040> across<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.850> keep<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.270> fold

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
thumbnails across it to keep that fold

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.140 
thumbnails across it to keep that fold
nice<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.050> tight<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.680> make<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.370> little<00:02:51.820> tear<00:02:52.120> in

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
nice and tight I make a little tear in

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.410 
nice and tight I make a little tear in
the<00:02:52.630> middle<00:02:52.990> of<00:02:53.200> all<00:02:53.410> three<00:02:53.710> layers<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.790> then

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
the middle of all three layers and then

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.990 
the middle of all three layers and then
I<00:02:55.450> fold<00:02:55.690> one<00:02:55.990> piece<00:02:56.290> forward<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:56.980> one<00:02:57.640> piece

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
I fold one piece forward and one piece

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.600 
I fold one piece forward and one piece
outward<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.170> there<00:02:59.830> we<00:02:59.980> go<00:03:00.100> we<00:03:00.430> have<00:03:00.580> a

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
outward and there we go we have a

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.390 
outward and there we go we have a
parchment<00:03:01.180> cone<00:03:01.360> ready<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.380> use<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.920> fill
