00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
loss so how you do this is simply trying

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.390 
loss so how you do this is simply trying
to<00:04:05.300> get

those three results should be there as I

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.770 
those three results should be there as I
think<00:04:54.290> some<00:04:55.010> of<00:04:55.100> them<00:04:55.280> I<00:04:55.400> use<00:04:55.639> to<00:04:55.820> confirm<00:04:56.300> the

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
think some of them I use to confirm the

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.440 
think some of them I use to confirm the
coin<00:04:57.050> count<00:04:57.320> or<00:04:57.530> whatever<00:04:57.970> so<00:04:58.970> make<00:04:59.270> sure

there<00:04:59.630> are<00:05:00.190> three<00:05:01.190> values<00:05:01.820> there<00:05:02.270> or<00:05:02.479> it<00:05:02.690> might

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
there are three values there or it might

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.110 
there are three values there or it might
not<00:05:03.020> work<00:05:03.050> on<00:05:03.410> Marshall<00:05:03.830> it<00:05:04.550> may<00:05:04.729> be<00:05:04.790> different

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
not work on Marshall it may be different

but for the current version of senseless

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.580 
but for the current version of senseless
zombies<00:05:08.090> I<00:05:08.300> believe<00:05:08.810> there<00:05:09.020> should<00:05:09.050> be<00:05:09.229> three

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
zombies I believe there should be three

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.860 
zombies I believe there should be three
values<00:05:09.940> keeping<00:05:10.940> record<00:05:11.210> of<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.419> coin<00:05:11.630> count

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.530 
values keeping record of the coin count
so<00:05:12.380> simply<00:05:13.010> go<00:05:13.040> into<00:05:13.520> each<00:05:13.729> of<00:05:13.940> these<00:05:14.060> values

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
so simply go into each of these values

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.740 
so simply go into each of these values
now<00:05:14.780> you'll<00:05:15.740> have<00:05:15.919> to<00:05:16.070> wait<00:05:16.250> a<00:05:16.550> few<00:05:17.300> seconds

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
now you'll have to wait a few seconds

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.930 
now you'll have to wait a few seconds
for<00:05:18.040> this<00:05:19.040> to<00:05:19.280> be<00:05:19.400> available<00:05:19.870> three<00:05:20.870> two<00:05:21.350> one

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
for this to be available three two one

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.190 
for this to be available three two one
so<00:05:22.940> let's<00:05:23.120> change<00:05:23.300> it<00:05:23.450> to<00:05:23.510> a<00:05:23.660> nice<00:05:23.870> number

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
so let's change it to a nice number

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.780 
so let's change it to a nice number
let's<00:05:24.620> say<00:05:26.380> seven<00:05:27.380> nine<00:05:27.770> seven<00:05:28.010> digits<00:05:28.639> of

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
let's say seven nine seven digits of

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.659 
let's say seven nine seven digits of
nine<00:05:29.030> no<00:05:29.389> two<00:05:29.810> three<00:05:30.229> four<00:05:30.590> five<00:05:30.889> six<00:05:31.220> seven

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
nine no two three four five six seven

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.219 
nine no two three four five six seven
so<00:05:32.150> you<00:05:32.210> have<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.479> make<00:05:32.600> sure<00:05:32.720> all<00:05:32.930> of<00:05:32.990> these

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
so you have to make sure all of these

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.400 
so you have to make sure all of these
are<00:05:33.470> at<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.800> same<00:05:34.310> otherwise<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.390> will<00:05:36.350> not

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
are at the same otherwise it will not

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:45.310 
are at the same otherwise it will not
work<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:41.450> one<00:05:42.940> and<00:05:43.940> then<00:05:44.090> we'll<00:05:44.270> go<00:05:44.450> one<00:05:45.050> two

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
work to one and then we'll go one two

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:57.230 
work to one and then we'll go one two
three<00:05:45.590> four<00:05:45.860> five<00:05:46.130> six<00:05:46.430> seven

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.760 

and<00:05:57.780> one<00:05:58.680> two<00:05:59.039> three<00:05:59.069> four<00:05:59.669> five<00:05:59.970> six<00:06:00.210> seven<00:06:00.770> so

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
and one two three four five six seven so

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.710 
and one two three four five six seven so
now<00:06:01.949> you'll<00:06:02.160> find<00:06:02.370> that<00:06:02.460> all<00:06:02.520> these<00:06:02.940> values

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
now you'll find that all these values

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.860 
now you'll find that all these values
have<00:06:03.930> been<00:06:03.990> changed<00:06:04.229> successfully<00:06:05.870> don't

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
have been changed successfully don't

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.320 
have been changed successfully don't
worry<00:06:06.990> about<00:06:07.110> this<00:06:07.699> section<00:06:08.699> that<00:06:08.970> begins

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
worry about this section that begins

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.749 
worry about this section that begins
section<00:06:09.690> that<00:06:09.930> will<00:06:10.080> be<00:06:10.199> different<00:06:10.620> for<00:06:10.889> every

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
section that will be different for every

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.360 
section that will be different for every
round<00:06:12.000> you<00:06:12.270> play<00:06:12.479> I'm<00:06:12.780> pretty<00:06:13.080> sure<00:06:13.259> so<00:06:13.560> you

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
round you play I'm pretty sure so you

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.700 
round you play I'm pretty sure so you
you<00:06:14.759> won't<00:06:14.970> be<00:06:15.060> able<00:06:15.150> to<00:06:15.270> use<00:06:15.449> that<00:06:15.660> to<00:06:16.319> find

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
you won't be able to use that to find

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.990 
you won't be able to use that to find
the<00:06:17.240> values<00:06:18.240> so<00:06:18.810> once<00:06:18.990> you've<00:06:19.139> changed<00:06:19.410> them

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
the values so once you've changed them

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.430 
the values so once you've changed them
you<00:06:21.000> can<00:06:21.150> go<00:06:21.300> back<00:06:21.539> to<00:06:21.569> plants<00:06:21.960> vs.<00:06:22.199> zombies

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
you can go back to plants vs. zombies

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.730 
you can go back to plants vs. zombies
too<00:06:22.620> and<00:06:23.389> you'll<00:06:24.389> find<00:06:24.690> that<00:06:24.810> your<00:06:25.110> coin<00:06:25.440> count

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
too and you'll find that your coin count

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.900 
too and you'll find that your coin count
has<00:06:26.009> now<00:06:26.340> been<00:06:27.199> increased<00:06:28.199> by<00:06:28.470> the<00:06:28.729> amount<00:06:29.729> you

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
has now been increased by the amount you

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.360 
has now been increased by the amount you
increase<00:06:30.360> it<00:06:30.570> so<00:06:30.780> this<00:06:31.410> will<00:06:31.680> now<00:06:31.860> give<00:06:31.919> you

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
increase it so this will now give you

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.279 
increase it so this will now give you
now<00:06:33.300> you'll<00:06:33.449> be<00:06:33.479> able<00:06:33.690> to<00:06:33.780> have<00:06:33.900> unlimited

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
now you'll be able to have unlimited

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.589 
now you'll be able to have unlimited
leaves<00:06:34.889> and<00:06:36.979> unlimited<00:06:37.979> Sun<00:06:38.460> because<00:06:38.970> you<00:06:39.449> can

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
leaves and unlimited Sun because you can

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:44.260 
leaves and unlimited Sun because you can
use<00:06:39.750> leaves<00:06:40.050> on<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:40.919> Sun<00:06:41.160> and<00:06:41.610> you<00:06:42.360> can<00:06:42.389> also

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
use leaves on the Sun and you can also

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.550 
use leaves on the Sun and you can also
use<00:06:45.270> them<00:06:45.419> on<00:06:45.539> power-ups<00:06:45.990> but<00:06:46.080> I<00:06:46.229> haven't

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
use them on power-ups but I haven't

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.730 
use them on power-ups but I haven't
unlocked<00:06:46.949> them<00:06:47.160> yet<00:06:47.340> so<00:06:48.259> but<00:06:49.259> when<00:06:49.440> when<00:06:49.650> you

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
unlocked them yet so but when when you

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.990 
unlocked them yet so but when when you
unlock<00:06:50.009> power-ups<00:06:50.430> you'll<00:06:50.550> be<00:06:50.610> able<00:06:50.699> to<00:06:50.849> use

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
unlock power-ups you'll be able to use

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.010 
unlock power-ups you'll be able to use
them<00:06:51.150> on<00:06:51.270> there<00:06:51.419> too<00:06:51.630> now<00:06:53.120> that's<00:06:54.120> simply<00:06:54.930> the

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
them on there too now that's simply the

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.469 
them on there too now that's simply the
hack<00:06:55.169> done<00:06:55.380> I<00:06:55.590> believe<00:06:56.130> this<00:06:56.729> will<00:06:56.970> also<00:06:57.210> work

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
hack done I believe this will also work

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.649 
hack done I believe this will also work
for<00:06:57.740> keys<00:06:58.740> and<00:06:58.770> stars<00:06:59.520> and<00:06:59.909> whatnot

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:00.659 
for keys and stars and whatnot

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:03.200 
for keys and stars and whatnot
but<00:07:01.110> of<00:07:01.409> course<00:07:02.130> it'll<00:07:02.460> be<00:07:02.520> high<00:07:02.729> it'll<00:07:03.030> be

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210 
but of course it'll be high it'll be

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.120 
but of course it'll be high it'll be
harder<00:07:03.509> to<00:07:03.539> find<00:07:03.659> the<00:07:03.960> actual<00:07:04.320> value<00:07:04.770> because

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
harder to find the actual value because

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.249 
harder to find the actual value because
you<00:07:05.729> have<00:07:05.940> to<00:07:06.150> find<00:07:06.360> out<00:07:06.539> when<00:07:06.750> they<00:07:06.930> change

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 
you have to find out when they change

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.980 
you have to find out when they change
and<00:07:07.620> the<00:07:08.430> values<00:07:08.729> are<00:07:08.849> just<00:07:08.940> a<00:07:09.090> lot<00:07:09.270> smaller<00:07:09.599> so

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
and the values are just a lot smaller so

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.980 
and the values are just a lot smaller so
if<00:07:10.949> anyone<00:07:11.340> has<00:07:11.370> success<00:07:12.060> with<00:07:12.270> the<00:07:12.389> Stars<00:07:12.690> or

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 
if anyone has success with the Stars or

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.320 
if anyone has success with the Stars or
the<00:07:13.080> keys<00:07:13.320> please<00:07:14.130> let<00:07:14.400> me<00:07:14.490> know<00:07:14.610> but<00:07:14.880> the

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
the keys please let me know but the

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.939 
the keys please let me know but the
coins<00:07:15.630> were<00:07:15.810> just<00:07:15.990> right<00:07:16.139> now<00:07:16.289> one<00:07:16.770> of<00:07:16.860> the

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:16.949 
coins were just right now one of the

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:19.760 
coins were just right now one of the
easiest<00:07:17.250> to<00:07:17.550> hack<00:07:17.909> so<00:07:18.719> thanks<00:07:19.349> for<00:07:19.469> watching

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
easiest to hack so thanks for watching

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.050 
easiest to hack so thanks for watching
and<00:07:20.180> I'll<00:07:21.180> see<00:07:21.210> you<00:07:21.719> next<00:07:21.780> time
