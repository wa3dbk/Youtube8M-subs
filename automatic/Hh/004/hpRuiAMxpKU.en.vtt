00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.260 
alright and they both have the flat tip
and<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:36.320> will<00:00:36.470> change<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.890> chips<00:00:37.160> like<00:00:38.060> in<00:00:38.210> the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
and I will change the chips like in the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.729 
and I will change the chips like in the
middle<00:00:38.450> of<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:38.600> battle<00:00:38.899> so<00:00:39.470> here<00:00:39.560> we<00:00:39.620> go

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
middle of the battle so here we go

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:56.460 
middle of the battle so here we go
around<00:00:39.829> 1

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.819 

you

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:30.840 

so<00:01:03.829> hybrid<00:01:04.250> blade<00:01:04.430> wins<00:01:05.089> round<00:01:05.330> one

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:56.310 

Piper<00:01:31.850> blades<00:01:32.240> wins<00:01:32.660> round<00:01:32.990> 2<00:01:33.350> round<00:01:34.360> 3

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.560 

I<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.920> Hydra<00:02:03.310> blade<00:02:03.490> wand<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.090> one<00:02:04.300> again

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
I think Hydra blade wand that one again

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.150 
I think Hydra blade wand that one again
so<00:02:04.780> we're<00:02:05.230> now<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.590> think<00:02:05.710> I'm<00:02:05.920> just<00:02:05.950> gonna

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
so we're now I think I'm just gonna

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.890 
so we're now I think I'm just gonna
switch<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.850> modes<00:02:07.060> just<00:02:07.360> because<00:02:07.660> I'm<00:02:07.870> not

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
switch the modes just because I'm not

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.590 
switch the modes just because I'm not
really<00:02:08.290> hitting<00:02:08.560> each<00:02:08.740> other<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.970> they<00:02:10.390> both

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
really hitting each other so they both

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.170 
really hitting each other so they both
have<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.200> sharp<00:02:11.590> mode<00:02:11.830> right<00:02:12.130> now<00:02:12.280> let's<00:02:13.000> do

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
have the sharp mode right now let's do

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:23.510 
have the sharp mode right now let's do
two<00:02:13.420> more<00:02:13.450> battles<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:15.490> this<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.850> Round<00:02:16.150> four

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:53.990 

hyper<00:02:24.520> blade<00:02:24.880> moves<00:02:25.360> again

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.330 

and<00:02:55.000> hyper<00:02:55.330> blood<00:02:55.629> wins<00:02:55.930> all<00:02:56.200> those<00:02:56.800> battles

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
and hyper blood wins all those battles

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.699 
and hyper blood wins all those battles
so<00:02:57.610> right<00:02:58.180> now<00:02:58.299> let's<00:02:58.569> change<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.140> modes<00:02:59.349> to

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
so right now let's change the modes to

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.220 
so right now let's change the modes to
ultimate<00:03:00.280> balance<00:03:00.640> mode<00:03:00.819> now<00:03:01.599> both<00:03:01.780> beyblades

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
ultimate balance mode now both beyblades

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.500 
ultimate balance mode now both beyblades
are<00:03:02.409> in<00:03:02.680> ultimate<00:03:03.099> balance<00:03:03.250> mode<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.269> have

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
preset their tips to sharp just so they

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.809 
preset their tips to sharp just so they
have<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.769> higher<00:03:09.010> chance<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.519> hitting<00:03:09.670> each

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
have a higher chance of hitting each

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.360 
have a higher chance of hitting each
other<00:03:09.970> now<00:03:10.870> this<00:03:11.049> time<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.290> will<00:03:11.590> launch<00:03:11.799> 40

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370
