 hello everyone with you beauty ksyu i'm like 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.720
 always check all the beauty recipes in 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.519
 home conditions on yourself and sharing them with 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.200
 you today at the request of many 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.420
 subscribers want to tell how to 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.590
 shaving a bikini area with a shaving machine 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.199
 bikini area is very delicate and let's say 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.140
 with a hard-to-reach place therefore with this 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.330
 the zone needs to be very neat and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.599
 very often girls appear 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.450
 irritation especially in summer so here if 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.640
 follow all the rules here in principle 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:40.649
 problems with shaving will not be to start 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.200
 this is the most important need to choose a machine on 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.620
 the market is now represented a lot 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.660
 machine tools for both men and women 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.480
 for different zones soft hard i 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.260
 I prefer disposable machines for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.350
 the men 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.890
 they are sharper because created 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.010
 for stiffer bristles and suitable for 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.739
 shave hard to reach places if you are with 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.260
 easy to handle 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.150
 the usual female machine then change it to 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.479
 masculine is not necessary 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.909
 decide the choice of machine 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.670
 if the machine does not suit you then try 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.150
 Other options are also very 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.110
 it is important to drink 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.790
 in no case soap 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.840
 use because it is very 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.759
 dries the skin you can buy a regular gel 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.369
 or skin for sensitive skin 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.960
 because in the bikini area 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.659
 skin is really very sensitive 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.119
 You can also replace the gel or foam 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.210
 usual hair mask that is in me 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.060
 fits I already tried it on myself and 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.479
 now not genius foam I don't buy them i 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.590
 I use before shaving I put on a mask 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.540
 for hair 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.520
 the following if the bikini area is very 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.400
 long hair, and then it is desirable to 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.860
 shaving it will make it a little easier 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.260
 shave so if there is long hair 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.660

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.270

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.640

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.190
