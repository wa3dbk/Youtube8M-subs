00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 the main task was to give a uniform 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.870
 that their load between all football players 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.970
 who take part in this gathering 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.059
 who were preparing for this game that is 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.790
 This task managed pleases that dumbia 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.520
 debuted after so long a break 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.939
 Well , the point of meaning can withstand all 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.060
 same time it turned out 35 minutes but dashing 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.310
 trouble began therefore in principle working 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.590
 information is nothing especially on your 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.830
 opinion on the quality of the game the first half of 2 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.570
 very different well, perhaps even in 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.940
 the second half we played with great 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.910
 advantage but i think it is related 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.430
 so that the Nbu rga course we also had 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.530
 a large number of replacements and it is clear that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.440
 These 2 composition well has a big difference with 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.239
 the main than our team was preparing 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.890
 including the first one for this match 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.079
 week fees are already behind how to evaluate and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.280
 physical readiness of our guys all 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.899
 yet for this game is very difficult to assess 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.539
 physical readiness because we 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.160
 more controlled the ball and and our 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.240
 football players are experienced enough they 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.710
 understand that in order not to run extra 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.869
 load up is easier to control the ball 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.930
 save it and own it the lionâ€™s share 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.540
 time until from what successfully coped on 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.920
 lacked a few ending just 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.530
 so it was with the fact that maybe we 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.770
 for even sound abused movement 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.659
 ball in the middle zone that's well yet 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.259
 working information 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.320
 I can't do that to anyone 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.820
 highlight or praise also makes no sense 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.820
 sprinkle ashes 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.829
 everything is calm for young people that will affect 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.409
 Panchenko Efremov tried very hard today 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.420
 singing and awning well panchenko well 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.460
 as if we are going to look, he must try 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.250
 as well as any other Ephraim can 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.350
 congratulate with the debut of cisco if 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.270
 would score to what was twice close 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.780
 in general it would be great well anyway 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.450
 I congratulated once again congratulations on 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.810
 debut even in a friendly game on 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.119
 charges but nonetheless hope that 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.549
 it is not far off debut and in official 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.960
 matches on the composition is clear that the team 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.640
 completely different goals now 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.379
 prepare for the season but nonetheless 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.950
 some tournament tasks for it 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.290
 the competition you are putting 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.310
 Well, how would you be playing 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.629
 tournament you always want to win but 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.400
 let's say we planned that first 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.140
 two games we will play on time mother 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.810
 the miner understands that he stands alone 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.760
 because to miss the opportunity to spend 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.940
 we only qualified sparring 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.489
 it would be foolish's clear that I want 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.250
 win but again say these tasks 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.610
 not primary in this case big 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.610
 thank
