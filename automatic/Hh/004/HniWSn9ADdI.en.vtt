00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
procedures that's really our biggest

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.840 
procedures that's really our biggest
thing<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> mean<00:02:26.220> we<00:02:26.340> want<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.610> keep<00:02:26.700> our

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.290 
thing I mean we want to keep our
athletes<00:02:27.180> safe<00:02:27.420> secondary<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.950> is

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
athletes safe secondary to that it is

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.570 
athletes safe secondary to that it is
maintaining<00:02:30.350> rehab<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.680> strength<00:02:32.280> and

maintaining rehab and strength and
preventative<00:02:33.450> medicine<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.860> is

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
preventative medicine and so that is

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.430 
preventative medicine and so that is
where<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.670> big<00:02:35.850> responsibility<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.230> think

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
where the big responsibility is I think

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.380
