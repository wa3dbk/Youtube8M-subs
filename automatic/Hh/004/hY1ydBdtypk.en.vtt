00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.839
 information so we started during the 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.640
 event the atmosphere was very good 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.920
 various places where you could enjoy 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.899
 playing either victim of eight against 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.030

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.289
 Pretty flashy and sexy ornaments of 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.879
 universe of halo give students from another 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.710
 look at the campaign this time with the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.239
 level triforce tree and the shot almost 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.399
 completely equal to the one we climbed 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.960
 previously discourage by gerber this 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.190
 Once he gives us to know several aspects of 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.050
 the update of hair titles 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.059
 beach in this video mentions that in 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.890
 said magnum title update 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.180
 original halo if it will be included in 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.640
 multiplayer 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.110
 Good news gives us the same 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.180
 mention that if you have a television 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.580
 3d halo anniversary will be completely 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.330
 compatible with it so you'll still enjoy 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.800
 more than cited this wonderful game by 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.510
 another part about updating 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.430
 titles are mentioned several things like 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.810
 I said previously the modification of the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.160
 magnum that we had previously in 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.130
 highlights that will feel like the 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.000
 old and cool weapon that went in halo 1 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.740
 obviously what many noticed the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.660
 grid expansion of various weapons 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.220
 was removed and the armor lock was 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.369
 it will deteriorate as more damage 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.960
 you get to use it chad amstrong mentions 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.970
 that the changes made in gelowicz 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.710
 with this new update they went to a 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.360
 level of game type what he wants 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.030
 say that we can modify if we want 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.590
 expansion in the grid in the dmr or if 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.970
 we want the armor lock as it was 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.440
 before with just modifying the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.360
 properties in the configuration of 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.950
 game so do not scream for the new 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.960
 changes that will have the opportunity to 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.580
 modify the type of game and decide what 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.160
 things of the new update use and 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.840
 which subsequently they gave no 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.000
 know a big map bonche the ones that 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.860
 we were having yale orbitz at 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.149
 purchase anniversary many of which 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.820
 they had been previously announced 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.170
 discovered by the same community without 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.849
 But this time we had support 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.770
 to play and see several of them 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.599
 finally concluding that I was forster and 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.180
 does much better work on maps at 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.430
 give them more detail atmosphere and do the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.730
 much more dynamic environment processing 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.769
 the game style intact 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.720
 videos of the new hello terminals 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.610

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.810

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.490

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.510
 first time artificial intelligence 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.580
 allied in shooting what does not change much 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.830
 the dynamics but it gives much more help than 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.930

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.150
