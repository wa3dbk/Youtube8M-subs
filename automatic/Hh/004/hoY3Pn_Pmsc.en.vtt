 and we are in a new news 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.190
 again he has spoken envy and it is that he has 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.529
 compared the technical capacity of 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.020
 playstation 4 with the one of a range PC 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.029
 average low you know that during 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.700
 last days those responsible for nvidia 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.140
 They are occurring nearby or near 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.260
 the technical specifications of 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.950
 playstation 4 that remember 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:35.830
 equals a designed apu inside 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.180
 and developed by ahmed and remember that 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.940
 also that the graphic chip of 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.910
 playstation3 was made by envy 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.520
 this time it was again tony 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.210
 thomas and senior vice president of the 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.830
 nvidia company who has sentenced 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.160
 what I will comment in an interview 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.780
 recently published compared to 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.300
 the fish games 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.540
 Playstation 4 specifications are 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.360
 close to a low-end cpu and a 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.940
 low midrange gpu without the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.900
 PlayStation 4 is released in December as 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.740
 it is speculated they are only offer the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:19.360
 half performance of a gtx 680 gpu 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:23.830
 which was launched in March 2012 a year 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.650
 and a half before said this Mr. Thomas 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.990
 and also wanted to unveil the disadvantages 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.750
 of the consoles in front of the pc to be 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.100
 closed and non-updatable platforms 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.299
 the truth is that 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.280
 yes he also said that the technical capacity 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:45.049
 of the market not better said about 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.940
 playstation 4 like to the xbox 720 said 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.430
 what is the story predicts the future 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.710
 then these next consoles 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.690
 generation although they will be more powerful 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.940
 than the current logically but 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.149
 they will quickly stay in an order of 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.729
 greatest magnitude behind the pc so 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.020
 both the pc will always go forward so 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.180
 nothing these are the statements of 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.909
 nvidia who said said again to emphasize 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.910
 that the technical capacity of playstation 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.610
 4 the day of your departure is compared with the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.700
 of a mid-low-range PC there are 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.530
 these statements comment and draw 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.630
 your own conclusions you already know
