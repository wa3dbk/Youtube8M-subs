00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.360
 genius good evening before the good room is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.250
 emotional interview with Gregory Ivanov 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.189
 President of the Urals and the main ones 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.020
 his message was to you with the question who 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.820
 This football player is the Urals and probably we do not have 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.310
 rights to demand from you specifically 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.650
 the name of this player here in brief 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.510
 where did the information come from? 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.850
 days ago 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.610
 Well, firstly this is what we have in 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.309
 Grigorievich Ivanov much in common here 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.200
 first i was he was on vacation i am now in 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.110
 leave for this reason here refused 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.710
 to several of your colleagues she does there 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.899
 1 and 2 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.120
 that's exactly what it's just guys 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.149
 I'm sorry I songs in Russia so on here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.280
 but when we are warming up touched 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.530
 Anderson him on three law warden 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.809
 the second is the general that we do not have me to him 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.180
 must have a good attitude like this that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.040
 thanks for the thief and floating in parts 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.950
 Concerning now to the point I will start first 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.470
 the cell itself was none and staged in 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.439
 able not know the name of the players 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.090
 urala then allow me not reported 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.670
 but think about it on the wording as 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.070
 right say let's do it i can 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.020
 say what I know exactly what the players are 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:35.040
 urala constantly from mother 200,000 is 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.430
 the first one is but add by 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.950
 information second second point mean I 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.979
 conveyed the information of this 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.560
 and another piece of information that is not 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.810
 published here she is she she 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.689
 riding the name of the office I handed 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.020
 one of the representatives of the commission at 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.759
 President of the Russian Federation to combat data 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.799
 appearances taste of coffee now if this 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.350
 representatives whether the commission will want something 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.420
 she has the right to find out 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.550
 office by official service 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.860
 presidents security director i'm not 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.330
 know who and request information about 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.440
 whose bet is made by a football player 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.450
 but I think that the probability heard the name 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.460
 both at me and at the commission 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:29.000
 thought jumped why bookmakers didn't 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.270
 are eager to advertise themselves and their 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.610
 elders that they act first 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.440
 their turn is interested in the possibility of not 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.530
 pay winnings after a strange start 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.450
 for this you need to match was recognized 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.880
 call the countries as you wish 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.100
 either on the football level or on the right 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.590
 store there what is the probability that 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.780
 any match in Russia officially 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.360
 recognize equal either treacherous but she 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.880
 also about 0 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.830
 so the maker has nothing but 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.400
 headache they don't hide their 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.200
 the elders 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.850
 some here muzzle 15 near the heap I was 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.000
 when they did it no 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.240
 no evidence was collected here 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.560
 the answer to their aspirations so let's say they are 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.100
 after all, too, the string agreement 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.440
 find out but they need someone to 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.959
 helped to also collected we collected 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.760
 sorted out like that 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.520
 doesn’t happen but why should your bookmaker 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:34.280
 mind to yourself and provide and 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:37.790
 potential outflow for the rest but 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.660
 I do not know if it means Viktor Goncharenko 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.980
 leaving cube if the coefficients 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.239
 skewed for this match as well as 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.959
 on the first mike for the match 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:51.260
 mean last season and if the president 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.489
 Urala here exactly in the bottom about the coach 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.070
 the club why did he leave 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.700
 it's just cut a chain of wild 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.209
 countries 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:03.410
 here's a weird oddity not to investigate this 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.840
 all I do not know why from talking legs 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.340
 ca n't disappoint i don't know not 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.040
 wants to be more likely to take out 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.860
 why doesn’t it want to rasterize me 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.190
 not very clear and by the way here I give 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.919
 the first step we are looking for players 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.239
 this can be put at risk as a team 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.919
 there they see their eyes so on 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.170
 but there spending Victor chop 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.180
 conference 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.770
 if we want to develop something 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.860
 develop someone in the map start 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.450
 development with him in the frame why they left 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.680
 viktor further Maidan began to speak 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.200
 saying goodbye and much further we will begin again 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.940
 talk about probability 99 and 9 russian 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.350
 hop will become health on this 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.690
 finish must somehow be 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.580
 life we won't ask you about 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.650
 the match itself because so to speak 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.090
 we understand that you are on vacation and the game is not 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.400
 saw up funny truth like me and my friend 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.470
 television say they say gregory ivanov was in 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.060
 vacation you went on vacation matches no 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.670
 I think that's 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.470
 but okay with victor party i talked 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.180
 Tuesday, when only went here this 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.660
 information was leaving he said that 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.730
 all comments will be given after 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.910
 how will the ural tel match take place because 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.730
 the noise is coming and no influence whatsoever 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:23.080
 he doesn't want to play this game 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:25.450
 mess with this noise now too 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.370
 what should happen in your opinion 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.660
 our carry sports community 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.180
 match result 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.920
 not the one that bookmakers thought 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.240
 exposing coefficients is not the one about which 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.970
 wrote on the internet and in newspapers 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.310
 It is quite possible to understand and coaches who 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:45.280
 after the match they came and said they were ashamed 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.610
 skeptics there lamb thoughts bronislav 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.170
 in general, what next the match played he will leave 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.290
 into history literally there in a week 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.550
 two of it, no one will remember 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.810
 how events should develop there 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:01.660
 next few days yes no yes no 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.930

 and and came Polish taps and where 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.270
 do not investigate our plan 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.130
 because we do not have such opportunities 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:20.740
 and and the people favor following as peace 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:23.830
