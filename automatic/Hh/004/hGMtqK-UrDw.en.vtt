stretchy bind-off I've not seen any
videos<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.279> done<00:00:26.580> yet<00:00:26.850> so<00:00:27.380> hopefully

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
yarn you need to measure it I mean

before you cut your working yarn you
need<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.460> measure<00:00:41.699> it<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.570> length<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.020> your

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
need to measure it to the length of your

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.399 
need to measure it to the length of your
last<00:00:43.500> peg<00:00:44.629> 3<00:00:45.629> times<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.350> length<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:48.409> the

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
last peg 3 times the length of the

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.070 
last peg 3 times the length of the
number<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.739> pegs<00:00:50.040> on<00:00:50.370> your<00:00:50.550> loom<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.960> always

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
number of pegs on your loom and I always

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.130 
number of pegs on your loom and I always
like<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.500> add<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.650> little<00:00:52.860> bit<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.220> extra<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.760> you

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
like to add a little bit of extra to you

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.039 
like to add a little bit of extra to you
just<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.260> case<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.690> you'll<00:00:57.870> need<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
just in case and then you'll need to

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:02.479 
just in case and then you'll need to
thread<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:59.430> yarn<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.269> a<00:01:00.299> needle<00:01:00.979> I<00:01:01.979> really

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
thread your yarn on a needle I really

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.170 
thread your yarn on a needle I really
like<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:02.970> metal<00:01:03.390> bet<00:01:04.199> tip<00:01:04.640> needles<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.850> think

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
like these metal bet tip needles I think

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.730 
like these metal bet tip needles I think
they're<00:01:06.330> smoother<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.080> they<00:01:07.200> go<00:01:07.380> through

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
they're smoother and they go through

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.359 
they're smoother and they go through
your<00:01:09.200> your<00:01:10.200> yarn<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:10.830> project<00:01:11.250> too

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
your your yarn and your project too

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.270 
your your yarn and your project too
easily<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:13.260> first<00:01:13.500> thing<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.070> want

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
easily so the first thing that you want

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.880 
easily so the first thing that you want
to<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:15.380> is<00:01:16.380> I'm<00:01:16.710> using<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.220> kiss<00:01:17.880> loom<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.890> for

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
to do is I'm using a kiss loom and for

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
to do is I'm using a kiss loom and for
the<00:01:19.950> kiss<00:01:20.160> loom<00:01:20.430> what<00:01:20.850> makes<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.240> special<00:01:21.690> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the kiss loom what makes it special is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.300 
the kiss loom what makes it special is
that<00:01:21.870> it<00:01:22.290> has<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.860> set<00:01:23.160> of<00:01:23.400> pins<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.870> back

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
that it has this set of pins in the back

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.370 
that it has this set of pins in the back
which<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.460> actually<00:01:26.910> will<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.720> using<00:01:28.020> for

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
which you actually will not be using for

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.040 
which you actually will not be using for
the<00:01:28.470> super<00:01:28.770> stretchy<00:01:29.040> bind-off<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.630> do<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
the super stretchy bind-off if you do it

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.890 
the super stretchy bind-off if you do it
will<00:01:31.200> add<00:01:31.260> extra<00:01:32.040> length<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:33.210> between<00:01:33.390> each

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
will add extra length in between each

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.100 
will add extra length in between each
stitch<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:35.090> you'll<00:01:36.090> end<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.510> having<00:01:36.690> to<00:01:36.870> kind

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
stitch and you'll end up having to kind

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.170 
stitch and you'll end up having to kind
of<00:01:37.200> tighten<00:01:37.410> that<00:01:37.620> up<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.220> kind<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
of tighten that up and it's kind of a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.840 
of tighten that up and it's kind of a
pain<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.370> everything<00:01:41.370> that<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.520> do

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
pain to do so everything that you do

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.230 
pain to do so everything that you do
will<00:01:42.120> be<00:01:42.240> done<00:01:42.480> in<00:01:42.690> front<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.490> pegs<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
will be done in front of the pegs and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.470 
will be done in front of the pegs and
you<00:01:45.330> will<00:01:45.900> not<00:01:46.050> go<00:01:46.290> behind<00:01:46.620> the<00:01:46.710> pins<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.190> this

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
you will not go behind the pins for this

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.180 
you will not go behind the pins for this
so<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.780> first<00:01:49.020> thing<00:01:49.230> that<00:01:49.260> you<00:01:49.650> need<00:01:49.800> to<00:01:50.010> do

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you need to go up under the loop on the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.899 
you need to go up under the loop on the
second<00:01:58.470> peg<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.970> pull<00:02:00.300> that<00:02:00.480> through<00:02:01.909> this

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
second peg and pull that through this

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.560 
second peg and pull that through this
will<00:02:03.180> leave<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.810> strand<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.620> yarn<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.909> front

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
will leave a strand of yarn to the front

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
through your first peg behind both loops

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.949 
through your first peg behind both loops
the<00:02:17.970> one<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.269> was<00:02:18.360> already<00:02:18.540> there<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.870> the

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:19.819 
if you can see both of them together

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.119 
if you can see both of them together
here<00:06:20.269> but<00:06:20.449> this<00:06:20.569> is<00:06:20.749> my<00:06:20.930> cast<00:06:21.229> on<00:06:21.499> edge<00:06:21.709> of

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:22.129 
here but this is my cast on edge of

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:25.629 
here but this is my cast on edge of
double<00:06:22.579> e<00:06:22.759> wrap<00:06:23.289> it<00:06:24.289> looks<00:06:24.529> pretty<00:06:24.919> similar<00:06:25.249> to

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
double e wrap it looks pretty similar to

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.350 
double e wrap it looks pretty similar to
that<00:06:25.759> actually<00:06:26.449> so<00:06:26.809> they're<00:06:27.349> a<00:06:27.379> good<00:06:28.360> good

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
that actually so they're a good good

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:36.249 
that actually so they're a good good
pairing<00:06:30.969> bind<00:06:31.969> off<00:06:32.240> and<00:06:32.869> cast<00:06:33.529> on<00:06:34.719> and<00:06:35.719> again

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259 
pairing bind off and cast on and again

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.420 
pairing bind off and cast on and again
if<00:06:36.469> you<00:06:36.619> get<00:06:36.889> this<00:06:37.039> stretch<00:06:37.490> there<00:06:37.789> as<00:06:38.029> well<00:06:38.329> so

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
if you get this stretch there as well so

if you get this stretch there as well so
I<00:06:40.430> hope<00:06:40.849> that<00:06:40.909> helps<00:06:41.599> you<00:06:41.719> be<00:06:42.379> able<00:06:42.529> to<00:06:42.829> work
