until<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.360> are<00:02:07.509> happy<00:02:07.750> with<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:09.100> I<00:02:09.700> guess<00:02:10.000> and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
until you are happy with it I guess and

until you are happy with it I guess and
now<00:02:11.050> for<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.530> more<00:02:11.920> hard<00:02:12.460> petal<00:02:12.910> like<00:02:13.210> the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
now for the more hard petal like the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.510 
now for the more hard petal like the
different<00:02:13.780> one<00:02:13.930> you're<00:02:14.620> gonna<00:02:14.800> take<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.220> bigger

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
different one you're gonna take a bigger

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.910 
different one you're gonna take a bigger
petal<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.150> kind<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.510> put<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.810> aside<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.530> pinch

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
petal and kind of put it aside and pinch

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.699 
petal and kind of put it aside and pinch
it<00:02:18.220> just<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:19.090> little<00:02:19.510> bit<00:02:19.660> so<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.020> can<00:02:20.050> see<00:02:20.500> the

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
it just a little bit so you can see the

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.860 
it just a little bit so you can see the
flaps<00:02:21.010> going<00:02:21.459> down<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.240> looks<00:02:22.420> like<00:02:22.569> a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
flaps going down and it looks like a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.910 
flaps going down and it looks like a
triangle<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.590> more

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
triangle so this is like the more

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.250 
triangle so this is like the more
complicated<00:02:27.430> petal<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.480> after<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:29.020> finish

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
complicated petal so after you finish

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.840 
complicated petal so after you finish
the<00:02:29.470> simple<00:02:29.830> petals<00:02:30.160> you're<00:02:30.370> gonna<00:02:30.459> do<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
the simple petals you're gonna do the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.850 
the simple petals you're gonna do the
complicated<00:02:31.450> petals<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.020> just<00:02:32.530> do<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> few

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
complicated petals and just do a few

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.680 
complicated petals and just do a few
more<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.220> them<00:02:33.459> until<00:02:33.880> you're<00:02:34.030> happy<00:02:34.450> with<00:02:34.630> how

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
more of them until you're happy with how

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.370 
more of them until you're happy with how
it<00:02:35.020> looks<00:02:35.050> like<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.680> basically<00:02:36.640> simple<00:02:37.030> rose

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
it looks like so basically simple rose

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.320 
it looks like so basically simple rose
simple<00:02:38.380> petals<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:38.950> complicated<00:02:39.670> petals<00:02:40.060> so

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
simple petals and complicated petals so

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.390 
simple petals and complicated petals so
tree<00:02:40.600> simple<00:02:40.930> steps<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.380> make<00:02:41.560> your<00:02:41.950> pretty

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
tree simple steps to make your pretty

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.760 
tree simple steps to make your pretty
rose<00:02:42.640> okay<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.330> now<00:02:43.900> I'm<00:02:44.050> just<00:02:44.200> gonna<00:02:44.319> take<00:02:44.620> a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
rose okay so now I'm just gonna take a

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.120 
rose okay so now I'm just gonna take a
bent<00:02:45.160> wire<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.030> stick<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.480> inside<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:47.260> when

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
bent wire and stick it inside so when

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.830 
bent wire and stick it inside so when
you<00:02:48.250> make<00:02:48.400> this<00:02:48.520> step<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.970> will<00:02:49.120> fall<00:02:49.450> off<00:02:49.599> so

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
you make this step it will fall off so

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.930 
you make this step it will fall off so
easily<00:02:50.140> so<00:02:50.920> you're<00:02:51.099> gonna<00:02:51.220> bake<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.700> rose

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
easily so you're gonna bake the rose

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.220 
easily so you're gonna bake the rose
first<00:02:52.270> so

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
first so

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.780 
first so
a<00:02:53.260> little<00:02:53.530> bit<00:02:53.620> hard<00:02:53.890> I<00:02:54.040> picked<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.400> for<00:02:54.580> about

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
a little bit hard I picked it for about

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.110 
a little bit hard I picked it for about
ten<00:02:55.030> minutes<00:02:55.420> with<00:02:56.379> my<00:02:56.650> baking<00:02:57.610> instruction

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
ten minutes with my baking instruction

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.559 
ten minutes with my baking instruction
and<00:02:58.330> now<00:02:58.510> takes<00:02:58.840> some<00:02:59.110> my<00:02:59.799> my<00:03:00.310> green<00:03:00.970> clay<00:03:01.330> and

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
and now takes some my my green clay and

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.160 
and now takes some my my green clay and
shape<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.989> into<00:03:02.250> leaves<00:03:03.250> so<00:03:04.180> like<00:03:04.599> I<00:03:04.629> did<00:03:04.930> here

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
shape it into leaves so like I did here

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.500 
shape it into leaves so like I did here
and<00:03:05.319> take<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.799> pokey<00:03:06.310> tool<00:03:06.549> or<00:03:06.819> a<00:03:06.849> needle<00:03:07.180> tool

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
and take a pokey tool or a needle tool

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.820 
and take a pokey tool or a needle tool
and<00:03:07.659> kind<00:03:08.379> of<00:03:08.530> just<00:03:09.299> like<00:03:10.299> make<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:10.930> veins

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
and kind of just like make the veins

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.940 
and kind of just like make the veins
vines<00:03:12.790> shape<00:03:13.510> on<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.260> leaves<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.620> don't<00:03:14.799> know<00:03:14.920> I

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
vines shape on the leaves I don't know I

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.920 
vines shape on the leaves I don't know I
don't<00:03:15.129> know<00:03:15.340> what<00:03:15.489> they're<00:03:15.670> called<00:03:15.910> but<00:03:16.209> just

little<00:03:32.590> droplets<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.280> TLS<00:03:33.670> or<00:03:33.970> just

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
little droplets of TLS or just

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.509 
little droplets of TLS or just
translucent<00:03:34.750> liquid<00:03:34.900> sculpey<00:03:35.370> basically<00:03:36.370> the

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
translucent liquid sculpey basically the

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.089 
translucent liquid sculpey basically the
liquid<00:03:36.879> form<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.299> polymer<00:03:37.690> clay<00:03:37.870> for<00:03:38.200> sticking

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
liquid form of polymer clay for sticking

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.860 
liquid form of polymer clay for sticking
stuff<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:39.790> you're<00:03:40.239> just<00:03:40.359> gonna<00:03:40.540> take<00:03:40.810> your

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
stuff so you're just gonna take your

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.309 
stuff so you're just gonna take your
leaves<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.650> kind<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.390> softly<00:03:43.390> put<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.840> on<00:03:43.989> so

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
leaves and kind of softly put it on so

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.069 
leaves and kind of softly put it on so
that<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.709> does<00:03:44.859> not<00:03:45.010> lose<00:03:45.310> its<00:03:45.690> lines<00:03:46.690> and

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
that it does not lose its lines and

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.339 
that it does not lose its lines and
texture<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.709> stuff<00:03:48.010> so<00:03:48.510> yeah<00:03:49.510> just<00:03:49.930> kind<00:03:50.260> of

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
texture and stuff so yeah just kind of

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.789 
texture and stuff so yeah just kind of
put<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:50.650> on<00:03:50.890> there<00:03:55.319> now<00:03:56.319> you're<00:03:56.470> gonna<00:03:56.560> take

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
put it on there now you're gonna take

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.620 
put it on there now you're gonna take
the<00:03:57.010> wire<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.519> you<00:03:57.609> put<00:03:57.819> in<00:03:57.910> just<00:03:58.150> now<00:03:58.299> and

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
the wire that you put in just now and

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.589 
the wire that you put in just now and
take<00:03:58.870> some<00:03:59.169> more<00:03:59.380> TLS<00:04:00.069> and<00:04:00.370> stick<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.150> into<00:04:01.329> the

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
take some more TLS and stick it into the

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.000 
take some more TLS and stick it into the
hole<00:04:01.750> again<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.099> you<00:04:03.370> can<00:04:03.549> give<00:04:03.819> more

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
hole again so that you can give more

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.319 
hole again so that you can give more
security<00:04:06.010> or<00:04:06.250> something<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.760> then<00:04:06.880> now<00:04:07.090> take

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
security or something and then now take

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.030 
security or something and then now take
some<00:04:07.359> more<00:04:07.599> green<00:04:07.870> clay<00:04:08.109> for<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.410> stem<00:04:08.799> and

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
some more green clay for the stem and

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.030 
some more green clay for the stem and
just<00:04:09.099> stick<00:04:09.819> it<00:04:09.940> into<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.269> wire<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:11.040> smooth

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
just stick it into the wire and smooth
