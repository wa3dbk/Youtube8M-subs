00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
we've tested it kind of in a backyard

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.230 
we've tested it kind of in a backyard
situation<00:00:19.890> about<00:00:20.100> your<00:00:20.310> situation<00:00:20.490> but<00:00:21.210> now

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
we're going to see how it does in the on

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.290 
we're going to see how it does in the on
the<00:00:23.189> jumps<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.609> bumps<00:00:23.880> over<00:00:24.000> here<00:00:24.240> at

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
the jumps and the bumps over here at

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:41.780 
the jumps and the bumps over here at
this<00:00:24.449> uh<00:00:24.480> indoor<00:00:25.170> track

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.840 

I<00:00:42.470> saw<00:00:43.470> the<00:00:43.530> new<00:00:43.770> splash<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.310> there<00:00:44.520> how'd<00:00:44.730> it

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
I saw the new splash out there how'd it

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.610 
I saw the new splash out there how'd it
look<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.270> think<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:46.020> impressive<00:00:46.320> when

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
look I think it's really impressive when

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.320 
look I think it's really impressive when
you<00:00:46.650> definitely<00:00:47.430> tell<00:00:47.580> its<00:00:47.730> form<00:00:47.970> of<00:00:48.090> drive

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
you definitely tell its form of drive

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.000 
you definitely tell its form of drive
and<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.750> traction<00:00:49.200> makes<00:00:49.290> it<00:00:49.470> much<00:00:49.620> easier<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and the traction makes it much easier to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.880 
and the traction makes it much easier to
drive<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.490> other<00:00:50.700> /<00:00:51.000> trucks<00:00:51.410> they<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.560> take

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
drive to the other / trucks they go take

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.740 
drive to the other / trucks they go take
off<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> new<00:00:53.550> class<00:00:53.790> this<00:00:54.030> year<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.420> think

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
off as a new class this year I think

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
off as a new class this year I think
it's<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.080> definitely<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> biggest

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
it's going to be definitely the biggest

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's going to be definitely the biggest
racing<00:00:56.250> classes<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:57.240> seeds<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
racing classes of seeds of the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.560 
racing classes of seeds of the
