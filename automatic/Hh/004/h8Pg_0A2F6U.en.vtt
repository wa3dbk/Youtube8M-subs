with<00:00:10.350> an<00:00:10.470> oli<00:00:10.590> loin<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.040> basically<00:00:11.280> have

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
with an oli loin you basically have

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.430 
with an oli loin you basically have
three<00:00:11.490> parts<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.360> have<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.750> belly<00:00:12.990> portion

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
three parts you have the belly portion

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.430 
three parts you have the belly portion
right<00:00:13.740> here<00:00:13.880> you<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.480> blood<00:00:15.959> line<00:00:16.200> and

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
right here you have the blood line and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.190 
right here you have the blood line and
then<00:00:17.280> the<00:00:17.820> eye<00:00:17.850> or<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> actual<00:00:18.660> one<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.140> you

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
then the eye or the actual one that you

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.840 
then the eye or the actual one that you
going<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.380> serve<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:20.250> want<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.490> start<00:00:20.730> by

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
going to serve you want to start by

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.930 
going to serve you want to start by
separating<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.630> belly<00:00:21.949> from<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.250> eye<00:00:23.280> itself

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
separating the belly from the eye itself

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.100 
separating the belly from the eye itself
and<00:00:24.090> you're<00:00:24.180> going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.360> run<00:00:24.570> down<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.930> piece

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
and you're going to run down that piece

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.530 
and you're going to run down that piece
of<00:00:25.290> sinew<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.860> basically<00:00:26.580> roll<00:00:26.940> the<00:00:27.300> loin

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
of sinew and basically roll the loin

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.350 
of sinew and basically roll the loin
back<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.260> you're<00:00:29.160> flexing<00:00:29.640> towards<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> skin

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
back as you're flexing towards the skin

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.380 
back as you're flexing towards the skin
on<00:00:30.540> the<00:00:30.630> lower<00:00:30.780> half<00:00:31.790> now<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> next<00:00:33.180> step<00:00:33.300> is

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
on the lower half now the next step is

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.549 
on the lower half now the next step is
remove<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.809> blood<00:00:34.050> line<00:00:34.230> which<00:00:34.379> is<00:00:34.500> this

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
remove this blood line which is this

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.920 
remove this blood line which is this
black<00:00:34.800> piece<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.879> that<00:00:36.719> is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
black piece right here and that is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.840 
black piece right here and that is
literally<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> blood<00:00:38.039> line<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.430> runs<00:00:38.610> down

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
literally the blood line that runs down

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.700 
literally the blood line that runs down
the<00:00:38.910> length<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.450> fish<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.050> it's

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the length of the fish and it's

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.220 
the length of the fish and it's
extremely<00:00:41.160> fishy<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.840> want<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> make

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
extremely fishy of so you want to make

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.080 
extremely fishy of so you want to make
sure<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.470> you're<00:00:43.560> always<00:00:43.970> removing<00:00:44.970> that

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
sure that you're always removing that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.090 
sure that you're always removing that
completely<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:45.630> you<00:00:45.690> never<00:00:45.870> serve<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.410> see

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
completely and you never serve it see

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.280 
completely and you never serve it see
how<00:00:47.280> I'm<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.520> making<00:00:47.970> long<00:00:48.300> shallow<00:00:48.840> strokes

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
how I'm just making long shallow strokes

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.260 
how I'm just making long shallow strokes
and<00:00:49.560> I'm<00:00:49.650> slowly<00:00:50.070> rolling<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> blood<00:00:51.060> line

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and I'm slowly rolling the blood line

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.450 
and I'm slowly rolling the blood line
back<00:00:51.510> now<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.350> long<00:00:52.620> shallow<00:00:52.920> strokes<00:00:53.220> are

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
back now the long shallow strokes are

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.950 
back now the long shallow strokes are
going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> make<00:00:53.790> it<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.060> you<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.329> realign<00:00:54.840> your

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
going to make it so you can realign your

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.960 
going to make it so you can realign your
cuts<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.380> necessary<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.700> to<00:00:56.760> give

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
cuts if necessary and it's going to give

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.030 
cuts if necessary and it's going to give
you<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> much<00:00:57.450> better<00:00:57.690> yield<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.890> not

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
you a much better yield and it's not

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.190 
you a much better yield and it's not
going<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.280> give<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> uneven<00:01:00.270> hacksaw

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
going to give you the uneven hacksaw

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.530 
going to give you the uneven hacksaw
look<00:01:01.530> now<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.399> was<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.700> cut<00:01:02.880> steaks<00:01:03.239> I

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
look now if I was going to cut steaks I

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.179 
look now if I was going to cut steaks I
would<00:01:03.930> start<00:01:04.140> about<00:01:04.320> right<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.739> thickness

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
would start about right this thickness

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
would start about right this thickness
and<00:01:05.399> I<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.670> cut<00:01:05.850> straight<00:01:06.090> down<00:01:06.149> and<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:07.079> be

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
and I just cut straight down and not be

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.170 
and I just cut straight down and not be
serving<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.680> non<00:01:07.860> he<00:01:08.040> stay<00:01:08.369> cut<00:01:08.670> straight<00:01:09.000> from

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
serving a non he stay cut straight from

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.179 
serving a non he stay cut straight from
the<00:01:09.299> loin<00:01:09.740> instead<00:01:10.740> though<00:01:10.860> we're<00:01:11.009> going<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the loin instead though we're going to

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
the loin instead though we're going to
be<00:01:11.280> cutting<00:01:11.460> Saku<00:01:12.090> block<00:01:12.150> which<00:01:12.690> is<00:01:12.720> what<00:01:12.990> you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
be cutting Saku block which is what you

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.190 
be cutting Saku block which is what you
use<00:01:13.140> for<00:01:13.350> sashimi<00:01:14.270> now<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.900> thing<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.170> want

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
use for sashimi now one thing you want

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.560 
use for sashimi now one thing you want
to<00:01:16.380> notice<00:01:16.620> is<00:01:16.950> obviously<00:01:17.760> this<00:01:17.940> loin<00:01:18.240> shape

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
to notice is obviously this loin shape

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.219 
to notice is obviously this loin shape
is<00:01:18.780> more<00:01:19.290> triangular<00:01:19.890> than<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.549> square<00:01:21.229> so

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
is more triangular than it is square so

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.170 
is more triangular than it is square so
my<00:01:22.470> next<00:01:22.650> step<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.280> cut<00:01:23.549> off<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.729> outer

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
my next step is to cut off that outer

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.469 
my next step is to cut off that outer
edge<00:01:24.770> yielding<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.979> nice<00:01:26.220> rectangular<00:01:27.060> piece

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
edge yielding a nice rectangular piece

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.270 
edge yielding a nice rectangular piece
and<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.140> outer<00:01:28.320> edge<00:01:28.440> will<00:01:28.799> still<00:01:29.010> be<00:01:29.100> used

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and that outer edge will still be used

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
and that outer edge will still be used
for<00:01:29.460> sashimi<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.570> not<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.080> as

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
for sashimi it's just not going to be as

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.590 
for sashimi it's just not going to be as
nice<00:01:31.380> looking<00:01:31.580> simply<00:01:32.580> cut<00:01:32.820> down<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.299> middle

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
nice looking simply cut down the middle

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.539 
nice looking simply cut down the middle
and<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.530> going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> give<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.979> two<00:01:35.190> large

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
and it's going to give you two large

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.880 
and it's going to give you two large
sake<00:01:36.090> blocks<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.500> want<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> go<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
sake blocks and then if you want to go a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.170 
sake blocks and then if you want to go a
little<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.189> smaller<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.850> then<00:01:38.970> take

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
little bit smaller you can then take

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.870 
little bit smaller you can then take
those<00:01:39.360> individual<00:01:40.080> long<00:01:40.920> rectangles<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.760> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
those individual long rectangles and you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.820 
those individual long rectangles and you
can<00:01:41.970> kind<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.150> munch<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.510> once<00:01:42.780> again<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.320> as

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
can kind of munch it once again and as

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.320 
can kind of munch it once again and as
you<00:01:43.979> cross<00:01:44.250> cut<00:01:44.640> those<00:01:44.760> it's<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> give

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
you cross cut those it's going to give

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.199 
correctly and the way you want to do
that<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.799> by<00:03:55.950> wrapping<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.549> nice<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:56.820> tight

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
that is by wrapping it nice and tight

that is by wrapping it nice and tight
and<00:03:57.359> plastic<00:03:57.750> wrap<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:57.930> see<00:03:58.170> how<00:03:58.260> when<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.500> fold

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
and plastic wrap and see how when I fold

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.740 
and plastic wrap and see how when I fold
it<00:03:58.920> over<00:03:59.070> here<00:03:59.489> I'm<00:03:59.820> making<00:04:00.180> sure<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.570> the

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
it over here I'm making sure that the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.410 
it over here I'm making sure that the
plastic<00:04:01.230> wrap<00:04:01.410> is<00:04:01.620> completely<00:04:02.340> in<00:04:02.519> contact

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
plastic wrap is completely in contact

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.530 
plastic wrap is completely in contact
with<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.380> surface<00:04:04.829> of<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.220> fish<00:04:05.609> because

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
with the surface of the fish because

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.990 
with the surface of the fish because
what<00:04:06.720> happens<00:04:07.200> is<00:04:07.410> when<00:04:07.709> oxygen<00:04:08.519> comes<00:04:08.819> into

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
what happens is when oxygen comes into

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.610 
what happens is when oxygen comes into
contact<00:04:09.239> with<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.720> flesh<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.170> fish<00:04:10.380> for<00:04:10.560> a

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
contact with the flesh of the fish for a

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.590 
contact with the flesh of the fish for a
prolonged<00:04:11.100> period<00:04:11.519> of<00:04:11.579> time<00:04:11.670> it's<00:04:12.150> going<00:04:12.480> to

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
prolonged period of time it's going to

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.470 
prolonged period of time it's going to
turn<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.900> gray<00:04:13.109> not<00:04:13.500> too<00:04:13.709> good<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:14.760> make<00:04:15.450> a

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
turn it gray not too good so I make a

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.199 
turn it gray not too good so I make a
little<00:04:15.660> cut<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.200> fold<00:04:16.650> in<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.919> ends<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.639> this

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
little cut I fold in the ends and this

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.390 
little cut I fold in the ends and this
is<00:04:18.329> going<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.539> allow<00:04:18.810> me<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:19.289> have<00:04:19.979> a<00:04:20.010> nice
