anything like that any unboxing which is

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.820 
anything like that any unboxing which is
not<00:00:12.150> have<00:00:12.300> 21<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.230> thought<00:00:13.469> I'd<00:00:13.590> show<00:00:13.799> you

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
not have 21 so I thought I'd show you

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.359 
not have 21 so I thought I'd show you
what<00:00:14.519> I've<00:00:14.700> done<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:14.969> far<00:00:15.980> now<00:00:16.980> going<00:00:17.279> off

the back this is the box here all the
electronics<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:32.030> what<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> siren<00:00:33.480> just

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
electronics in it what the siren just

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.340 
electronics in it what the siren just
they're<00:00:33.899> stuck<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.739> there<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.570> then<00:00:36.570> now<00:00:36.750> what

one yellow wire to the left position

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.650 
one yellow wire to the left position
feed<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.550> one<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> right<00:00:45.300> position

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
feed and the one on the right position

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.470 
feed and the one on the right position
feed<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.649> indicators<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:48.390> I've

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
feed for the indicators now what I've

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420 
feed for the indicators now what I've
done<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.719> obviously<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> warrant<00:00:49.559> indicator

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
done is obviously the warrant indicator

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.700 
done is obviously the warrant indicator
loom<00:00:50.610> comes<00:00:50.910> along<00:00:51.210> into<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> back<00:00:52.050> side<00:00:52.620> is

basically<00:00:59.760> you've<00:00:59.940> got<00:00:59.969> your<00:01:00.180> red<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.510> your

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
basically you've got your red and your

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.060 
basically you've got your red and your
black<00:01:00.960> wire<00:01:02.539> then<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.629> go<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.949> you've

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
black wire then you go and what you've

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.820 
black wire then you go and what you've
got<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> do<00:01:05.570> is<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.780> these<00:01:07.049> two<00:01:07.290> wires<00:01:07.530> from

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
got to do is that these two wires from

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.929 
got to do is that these two wires from
my<00:01:08.280> indicators<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.979> solid<00:01:11.310> black<00:01:11.460> one<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:11.820> me

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
my indicators the solid black one for me

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.380 
my indicators the solid black one for me
is<00:01:12.090> positive<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:13.049> I've<00:01:13.170> done<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.650> I've

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
is positive so what I've done is I've

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.270 
is positive so what I've done is I've
soldered<00:01:15.390> all<00:01:15.540> my<00:01:15.689> joints<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.200> well<00:01:16.229> but<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
soldered all my joints as well but the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
soldered all my joints as well but the
yellow<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.299> positive<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
yellow and the positive for the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.570 
yellow and the positive for the
indicator<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> positive<00:01:20.310> from<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
indicator on to the positive from the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.690 
indicator on to the positive from the
wiring<00:01:20.790> loom<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:22.200> black<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
wiring loom and the black on it so the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.550 
wiring loom and the black on it so the
earth<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.360> goes<00:01:24.570> onto<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.049> indicator

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
earth one just goes onto the indicator

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.210 
earth one just goes onto the indicator
and<00:01:25.710> that's<00:01:25.830> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and that's it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.649 
and that's it
I've<00:01:26.460> done<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.820> both<00:01:26.880> sides<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.479> other

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
I've done that on both sides but other

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.510 
I've done that on both sides but other
ones<00:01:27.720> tuck<00:01:28.020> tight<00:01:28.200> down<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:28.500> somewhere<00:01:29.100> so

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
ones tuck tight down there somewhere so

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.940 
ones tuck tight down there somewhere so
you<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.240> that's<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.780> done<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.200> these

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you know that's that one done and these

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.460 
you know that's that one done and these
yellow<00:01:32.159> wires<00:01:32.460> follow<00:01:32.909> right<00:01:33.119> way<00:01:33.299> down<00:01:33.540> into

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
yellow wires follow right way down into

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.499 
yellow wires follow right way down into
like<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> wiring<00:01:35.040> loom<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.700> yet<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> arm

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
like a wiring loom for yet for the arm

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.480 
like a wiring loom for yet for the arm
down<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.500> where<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> battery<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
down here to where the battery is and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.600 
down here to where the battery is and
then<00:01:39.119> I've<00:01:39.240> got<00:01:39.479> my<00:01:39.509> black<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.439> white<00:01:40.610> black

goes on to the first class piece of piss
to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.610> honest<00:02:05.840> then<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.930> becomes<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.290> bit<00:02:07.409> more

that<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:38.459> bit<00:03:38.669> there<00:03:39.139> where<00:03:40.139> my<00:03:40.379> ignition

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
that that bit there where my ignition

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.879 
that that bit there where my ignition
fuse<00:03:40.919> is<00:03:41.900> one<00:03:42.900> side<00:03:43.109> obviously<00:03:43.470> live<00:03:43.650> which

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
fuse is one side obviously live which

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.400 
fuse is one side obviously live which
was<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.250> right<00:03:44.579> hand<00:03:44.760> side<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.239> one<00:03:45.959> side<00:03:46.169> was

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
was the right hand side and one side was

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.319 
was the right hand side and one side was
was<00:03:46.889> dead<00:03:47.129> and<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.639> looked<00:03:47.819> underneath<00:03:48.090> to

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
was dead and I looked underneath to

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.610 
was dead and I looked underneath to
where<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.569> war<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:49.079> connects<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.530> the

where the war is that connects to the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.710 
where the war is that connects to the
fuses<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.190> there's<00:03:50.569> nothing<00:03:51.569> on<00:03:51.660> the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
fuses and there's nothing on the

fuses and there's nothing on the
left-hand<00:03:52.139> side<00:03:52.230> but<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.739> there's<00:03:53.160> wise<00:03:53.400> on

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
left-hand side but this there's wise on

left-hand side but this there's wise on
the<00:03:53.639> right-hand<00:03:54.000> side<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.690> what<00:03:54.840> they

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
the right-hand side so what they

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.559 
the right-hand side so what they
actually<00:03:54.959> are<00:03:55.410> trying<00:03:55.889> to<00:03:55.949> tell<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:57.030> it

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
actually are trying to tell you is it

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.210 
actually are trying to tell you is it

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
the side of the fuse box so what I've

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.059 
the side of the fuse box so what I've
done<00:04:12.299> basically<00:04:12.720> is<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.989> grey<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.889> come

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
done basically is the grey that come

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.219 
done basically is the grey that come
from<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.370> wiring<00:04:14.609> loom<00:04:14.729> from<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.209> from<00:04:16.109> the

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
from the wiring loom from the from the

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.439 
from the wiring loom from the from the
alarm<00:04:16.560> which<00:04:17.159> turned<00:04:17.400> into<00:04:17.549> red<00:04:17.820> I've<00:04:18.090> plugged

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
alarm which turned into red I've plugged

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.099 
alarm which turned into red I've plugged
on<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.659> top<00:04:18.959> sort<00:04:19.199> of<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.380> fuse<00:04:19.620> out<00:04:19.829> put<00:04:20.519> it<00:04:20.669> a

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
on the top sort of a fuse out put it a

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.379 
on the top sort of a fuse out put it a
little<00:04:22.109> connector<00:04:22.979> on<00:04:23.099> there<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.490> put<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.270> on

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
little connector on there and put it on

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.330 
little connector on there and put it on
on<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.659> right<00:04:25.349> hand<00:04:25.620> side<00:04:25.710> which<00:04:26.099> is<00:04:26.130> where

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
on the right hand side which is where

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.540 
on the right hand side which is where
the<00:04:26.460> Y<00:04:26.610> comes<00:04:27.030> out

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
the Y comes out

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:35.969 
the Y comes out
from<00:04:28.360> underneath<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:29.050> then<00:04:29.949> underneath<00:04:34.979> what

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
from underneath and then underneath what

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.800 
from underneath and then underneath what
I've<00:04:36.129> done<00:04:36.340> is<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:38.710> two<00:04:38.919> black<00:04:39.159> ones<00:04:39.810> are

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
I've done is the the two black ones are

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.680 
I've done is the the two black ones are
put<00:04:41.020> into<00:04:41.139> a<00:04:41.229> connector<00:04:41.740> block<00:04:41.949> just<00:04:42.159> there

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
put into a connector block just there

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.960 
put into a connector block just there
which<00:04:43.690> make<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:43.960> into<00:04:44.229> a<00:04:44.259> single<00:04:44.740> wire<00:04:44.970> which

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
which make it into a single wire which

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.279 
which make it into a single wire which
they've<00:04:46.150> gone<00:04:46.389> all<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:47.169> way<00:04:47.199> around

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
they've gone all the way around

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.140 
they've gone all the way around
underneath<00:04:47.979> to<00:04:48.370> do<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.819> the<00:04:48.940> live<00:04:49.120> wire

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
underneath to do it to the live wire

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.749 
underneath to do it to the live wire
that<00:04:49.539> comes<00:04:49.750> under<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.530> fuse<00:04:50.770> box<00:04:51.039> to<00:04:51.669> the

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
that comes under the fuse box to the

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.089 
that comes under the fuse box to the
right-hand<00:04:52.180> side<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.810> I've<00:04:53.500> put<00:04:53.949> another

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
right-hand side and I've put another

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.680 
right-hand side and I've put another
connector<00:04:54.610> in<00:04:54.759> there<00:04:54.940> and<00:04:55.120> connected<00:04:55.509> that<00:04:55.629> to

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
connector in there and connected that to

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.920 
connector in there and connected that to
that<00:04:55.930> wire<00:04:56.909> so<00:04:57.909> you've<00:04:58.060> got<00:04:58.180> basically<00:04:59.729> the

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
that wire so you've got basically the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.460 
that wire so you've got basically the
pink<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.139> brown<00:05:03.090> underneath<00:05:04.169> to<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.289> wire

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
pink and brown underneath to the wire

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.550 
pink and brown underneath to the wire
that's<00:05:05.710> coming<00:05:06.009> straight<00:05:06.190> out<00:05:06.370> and<00:05:07.440> then<00:05:08.440> I've

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
that's coming straight out and then I've

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.700 
that's coming straight out and then I've
taken<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:08.949> few<00:05:09.220> out<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.900> put<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.169> gray<00:05:11.409> which

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
taken a few out and put the gray which

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.999 
taken a few out and put the gray which
turned<00:05:12.069> into<00:05:12.130> red<00:05:12.520> on<00:05:13.349> the<00:05:14.349> right-hand<00:05:14.919> side

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
turned into red on the right-hand side

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.879 
turned into red on the right-hand side
of<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:16.000> fuse<00:05:16.270> which<00:05:16.479> is<00:05:16.599> where<00:05:16.870> which<00:05:17.740> is

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
of the fuse which is where which is

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.830 
of the fuse which is where which is
where<00:05:18.039> the<00:05:18.159> wire<00:05:18.610> from<00:05:18.819> underneath<00:05:19.030> goes<00:05:19.539> to

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
where the wire from underneath goes to

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.330 
where the wire from underneath goes to
so<00:05:20.199> there's<00:05:20.349> nothing<00:05:20.560> on<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.889> left-hand<00:05:21.250> side

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
so there's nothing on the left-hand side

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.890 
so there's nothing on the left-hand side
it's<00:05:21.729> just<00:05:21.880> like<00:05:21.969> a<00:05:22.000> blank<00:05:22.330> so<00:05:22.569> I'm<00:05:22.659> assuming

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
it's just like a blank so I'm assuming

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.490 
it's just like a blank so I'm assuming
that's<00:05:23.259> where<00:05:23.469> the<00:05:24.340> fuse<00:05:24.990> makes<00:05:25.990> a<00:05:26.080> bridge<00:05:26.349> or

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
that's where the fuse makes a bridge or

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.909 
that's where the fuse makes a bridge or
whatever<00:05:26.770> for<00:05:27.069> it<00:05:27.129> to<00:05:27.250> work<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:28.780> think<00:05:29.440> that's<00:05:29.860> a

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
whatever for it to work I think that's a

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.200 
whatever for it to work I think that's a
better<00:05:30.069> option<00:05:30.159> rather<00:05:30.669> than<00:05:30.819> cutting<00:05:31.060> it

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
better option rather than cutting it

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.540 
better option rather than cutting it
because<00:05:31.419> if<00:05:31.509> you<00:05:31.599> go<00:05:31.750> wrong<00:05:31.960> then<00:05:32.440> well<00:05:33.280> your

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
because if you go wrong then well your

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.649 
because if you go wrong then well your
 really<00:05:35.729> and<00:05:36.729> after<00:05:37.060> that<00:05:37.210> you've<00:05:37.539> got

were<00:07:46.220> evenly<00:07:46.520> leave<00:07:46.730> the<00:07:46.940> fuse<00:07:47.180> out<00:07:47.390> which

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 
were evenly leave the fuse out which

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.510 
were evenly leave the fuse out which
place<00:07:48.560> it<00:07:48.710> to<00:07:48.800> me<00:07:48.890> it<00:07:48.950> was<00:07:49.070> quite<00:07:49.220> common

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 
place it to me it was quite common

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.130 
place it to me it was quite common
mistake<00:07:49.820> because<00:07:49.970> I<00:07:50.060> left<00:07:50.210> it<00:07:50.360> in<00:07:50.450> and<00:07:50.690> the

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:51.140 
mistake because I left it in and the

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.630 
mistake because I left it in and the
immobilizer<00:07:51.620> part<00:07:51.920> of<00:07:51.980> it<00:07:52.070> wasn't<00:07:52.190> working

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:52.640 
immobilizer part of it wasn't working

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.510 
immobilizer part of it wasn't working
and<00:07:53.080> but<00:07:54.080> that's<00:07:54.230> about<00:07:54.410> it<00:07:54.470> I<00:07:54.620> mean<00:07:54.860> it's

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 
and but that's about it I mean it's

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.980 
and but that's about it I mean it's
pretty<00:07:55.670> basic<00:07:55.880> what<00:07:56.240> I've<00:07:56.300> shown<00:07:56.510> you<00:07:56.540> but

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:56.990 
pretty basic what I've shown you but

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.090 
pretty basic what I've shown you but
that's<00:07:57.170> as<00:07:57.350> far<00:07:57.380> as<00:07:57.560> I<00:07:57.680> got

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:58.100 
that's as far as I got

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.590 
that's as far as I got
I<00:07:58.130> was<00:07:58.430> gonna<00:07:58.550> do<00:07:58.670> a<00:07:58.700> video<00:07:58.850> while<00:07:59.210> I<00:07:59.240> was<00:07:59.360> doing

00:07:59.590 --> 00:07:59.600 
I was gonna do a video while I was doing

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.110 
I was gonna do a video while I was doing
it<00:07:59.810> but<00:07:59.960> I<00:08:00.200> couldn't<00:08:00.890> be<00:08:01.040> bothered<00:08:01.130> it<00:08:01.490> pretty

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.120 
it but I couldn't be bothered it pretty

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.430 
it but I couldn't be bothered it pretty
stressed<00:08:02.390> me<00:08:02.510> out<00:08:02.540> start<00:08:03.020> off<00:08:03.080> with<00:08:03.230> to<00:08:03.350> be

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 
stressed me out start off with to be

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.170 
stressed me out start off with to be
honest<00:08:03.620> but<00:08:03.920> it<00:08:04.010> took<00:08:04.160> me<00:08:04.310> about<00:08:04.550> an<00:08:04.730> hour<00:08:04.850> to

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.180 
honest but it took me about an hour to

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.830 
honest but it took me about an hour to
fit<00:08:05.480> a<00:08:05.660> little<00:08:05.990> I<00:08:06.200> think<00:08:06.920> and<00:08:07.130> once<00:08:07.430> I<00:08:07.580> get<00:08:07.840> my

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:08.840 
fit a little I think and once I get my

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.360 
fit a little I think and once I get my
resistors<00:08:09.290> and<00:08:09.440> stuff<00:08:09.650> for<00:08:09.980> you<00:08:10.040> then<00:08:10.250> I'm

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:10.370 
resistors and stuff for you then I'm

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.390 
resistors and stuff for you then I'm
going<00:08:10.640> to<00:08:10.700> be<00:08:10.790> doing<00:08:11.200> the<00:08:12.200> touch<00:08:12.770> side<00:08:12.980> of<00:08:13.070> it

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:13.400 
going to be doing the touch side of it

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.850 
going to be doing the touch side of it
Cheers
