00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
greatest because they are going to be

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.729 
greatest because they are going to be
pretty<00:00:59.100> small<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.760> board<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.989> anyway<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
pretty small on the board but anyway the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.380 
pretty small on the board but anyway the
Karen<00:01:02.070> chroma<00:01:02.430> does<00:01:02.579> look<00:01:02.760> pretty<00:01:02.940> cool<00:01:03.180> I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
definitely like the armor the back is

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
definitely like the armor the back is
completely<00:01:05.670> armored<00:01:06.570> out<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.930> back<00:01:07.080> window

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
completely armored out the back window

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.350 
completely armored out the back window
is<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:07.680> least<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.100> even<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> side<00:01:08.970> windows

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
only have a small area i'm wondering if

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.789 
only have a small area i'm wondering if
we<00:01:11.340> will<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.460> able<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> shoot<00:01:12.030> out<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.510> car

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
we will be able to shoot out of that car

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.630 
we will be able to shoot out of that car
definitely<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.040> interested<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
definitely going to be interested in to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.630 
definitely going to be interested in to
see<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.750> next<00:01:15.900> picture<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.130> plane

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
see the next picture is of a plane

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.010 
see the next picture is of a plane
that's<00:01:17.790> already<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> game<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.600> vellum

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that's already in the game the vellum

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020 
that's already in the game the vellum
but<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.560> actually<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.979> new<00:01:20.310> version<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.909> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
but it's actually a new version of it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
but it's actually a new version of it
apparently<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.630> could<00:01:21.990> not<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.470> an<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.920> black

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
apparently we could not get an all black

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.859 
apparently we could not get an all black
version<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:23.970> i<00:01:24.000> guess<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.420> kind<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.689> cool

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
version so i guess that's kind of cool

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.350 
version so i guess that's kind of cool
here<00:01:25.500> are<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> picture<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.520> new<00:01:26.640> bike<00:01:26.880> can't

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
here are a picture of the new bike can't

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.480 
here are a picture of the new bike can't
tell<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:27.840> these<00:01:28.020> are<00:01:28.200> all<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> same<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:29.130> if

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
tell if these are all the same or if

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.550 
tell if these are all the same or if
they<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.729> different<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:31.259> is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
they are different but that is

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.050 
they are different but that is
definitely<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.369> bike<00:01:32.520> does<00:01:32.729> look<00:01:32.909> pretty

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
definitely the bike does look pretty

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.390 
definitely the bike does look pretty
cool<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:34.200> next<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.860> my<00:01:35.100> favorite

the<00:02:19.319> second<00:02:19.770> team<00:02:19.920> here<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.490> obviously

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
the second team here this one obviously

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.850 
the second team here this one obviously
makes<00:02:21.270> more<00:02:21.510> sense<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.959> one<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.470> drilled

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
makes more sense this one is the drilled

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.470 
makes more sense this one is the drilled
that<00:02:23.069> we<00:02:23.220> would<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.670> use<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.940> get<00:02:24.090> inside

team gear we have a thermite bomb on the
bottom<00:02:45.510> left<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.989> then<00:02:46.620> obviously<00:02:46.950> we<00:02:47.280> have

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
some more guns some masks so maybe we'll

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.229 
some more guns some masks so maybe we'll
have<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.709> go<00:02:49.830> undercover<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.520> then<00:02:51.060> obviously

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
have to go undercover and then obviously

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.390 
have to go undercover and then obviously

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
like the laptop probably signifying like

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400 
like the laptop probably signifying like
hacking<00:02:53.850> or<00:02:53.970> something<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.810> again<00:02:55.110> I'm<00:02:55.260> not
