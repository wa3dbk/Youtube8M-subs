00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
solutions and so many books out there

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.450 
solutions and so many books out there
that<00:00:42.839> it<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.320> get<00:00:43.530> overwhelming<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
that it can get overwhelming and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.630 
that it can get overwhelming and
confusing<00:00:44.999> what<00:00:45.600> makes<00:00:45.809> your<00:00:45.960> book<00:00:46.140> different

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
confusing what makes your book different

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.910 
confusing what makes your book different
what<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.789> teach<00:00:47.850> people<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.839> a<00:00:49.289> realistic

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
what I teach people is a realistic

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.279 
what I teach people is a realistic
approach<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:51.059> not<00:00:51.359> only<00:00:51.539> losing<00:00:52.079> weight

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
approach to not only losing weight

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.619 
approach to not only losing weight
keeping<00:00:53.249> that<00:00:53.370> weight<00:00:53.579> off<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.820> staying

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
keeping that weight off and staying

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.200 
keeping that weight off and staying
healthy<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.499> I<00:00:55.980> say<00:00:56.219> realistic<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
healthy and I say realistic because a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.849 
healthy and I say realistic because a
lot<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.719> diets<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.260> out<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.469> are

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
lot of the diets that are out there are

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.970 
lot of the diets that are out there are
not<00:00:59.190> realistic<00:00:59.579> long-term<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.710> you've

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
not realistic long-term so as you've

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.770 
not realistic long-term so as you've
probably<00:01:02.129> seen<00:01:02.670> before<00:01:03.059> people<00:01:03.569> lose<00:01:03.749> weight

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
probably seen before people lose weight

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.410 
probably seen before people lose weight
but<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.470> they<00:01:04.650> can't<00:01:04.949> stick<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.700> whatever<00:01:06.120> it

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
but then they can't stick to whatever it

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.940 
but then they can't stick to whatever it
is<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.870> particular<00:01:07.050> diet<00:01:07.650> was

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
is that that particular diet was

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.830 
is that that particular diet was
teaching<00:01:08.400> them<00:01:08.550> or<00:01:08.730> telling<00:01:09.060> them<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.240> eat<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
teaching them or telling them to eat and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.270 
teaching them or telling them to eat and
then<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.440> gained<00:01:10.620> the<00:01:10.740> weight<00:01:10.770> right<00:01:10.920> back

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
then they gained the weight right back

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.060 
then they gained the weight right back
and<00:01:11.550> it<00:01:11.970> ends<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.360> being<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.750> yo-yo<00:01:13.050> cycle<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and it ends up being a yo-yo cycle and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.610 
and it ends up being a yo-yo cycle and
they<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.580> frustrated<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.540> they<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.140> give

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
they get frustrated and they just give

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.990 
they get frustrated and they just give
up<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> diet<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> give<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.760> on<00:01:17.910> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
up on the diet and give up on the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.040 
up on the diet and give up on the
healthy<00:01:18.270> eating<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.660> you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.870> what<00:01:18.960> i've

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
healthy eating and you know what i've

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.450

been<00:01:19.080> there<00:01:19.380> i<00:01:19.440> have<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.770> admit<00:01:19.830> i've<00:01:20.130> been<00:01:20.310> one

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
been there i have to admit i've been one

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.040 
been there i have to admit i've been one
of<00:01:20.580> those<00:01:20.670> people<00:01:20.730> where<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.300> try<00:01:21.510> a<00:01:21.540> diet<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
of those people where you try a diet and

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.050 
of those people where you try a diet and
it<00:01:22.140> works<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> short<00:01:22.890> term<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.460> then

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it works for the short term but then

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.420 
it works for the short term but then
because<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> doesn't<00:01:24.870> continue<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.530> work<00:01:25.980> you

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
because it doesn't continue to work you

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.950 
because it doesn't continue to work you
just<00:01:26.640> completely<00:01:27.000> give<00:01:27.300> up<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.660> then<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> go

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
just completely give up and then you go

do we know the diet solution really is a

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.710 
do we know the diet solution really is a
solution<00:03:45.610> because<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.060> know<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.239> say<00:03:46.510> it's

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
solution because I know you say it's

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.270 
solution because I know you say it's
different<00:03:47.200> but<00:03:47.320> why<00:03:47.500> not<00:03:47.680> just<00:03:47.860> go<00:03:48.010> with<00:03:48.190> the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
different but why not just go with the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.979 
different but why not just go with the
mainstream<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:49.480> know<00:03:49.510> Danielle

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
mainstream you know Danielle

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.870 
mainstream you know Danielle
unfortunately<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.769> mainstream<00:03:51.310> it's<00:03:51.610> not

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
unfortunately the mainstream it's not

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.680 
unfortunately the mainstream it's not
working<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:52.810> we<00:03:53.050> see<00:03:53.320> that<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.890> our

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
working and we see that in our

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.060 
working and we see that in our
communities<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:55.720> our<00:03:56.019> population<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.980> know

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
communities and our population you know

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.610 
communities and our population you know
our<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.550> obesity<00:03:57.820> epidemic<00:03:58.050> is<00:03:59.050> just<00:03:59.380> getting

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
our the obesity epidemic is just getting

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.670 
our the obesity epidemic is just getting
worse<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.070> worse<00:04:00.610> so<00:04:01.360> if<00:04:01.780> we<00:04:01.840> continue<00:04:02.500> to

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
worse and worse so if we continue to

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.440 
worse and worse so if we continue to
follow<00:04:02.860> what's<00:04:03.250> mainstream<00:04:03.850> it's<00:04:04.180> it's

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
follow what's mainstream it's it's

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.990 
follow what's mainstream it's it's
clearly<00:04:04.810> not<00:04:04.989> working<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:06.100> when<00:04:06.459> people<00:04:06.610> say

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
clearly not working so when people say

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.460 
clearly not working so when people say
to<00:04:07.060> me<00:04:07.180> your<00:04:07.510> approach<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.959> different<00:04:07.989> and

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
to me your approach is different and

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.690 
to me your approach is different and
your<00:04:08.620> approach<00:04:09.040> maybe<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.489> little

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
your approach maybe a little

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.090 
your approach maybe a little
unconventional<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.870> say<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.110> them<00:04:11.290> we<00:04:11.769> need<00:04:11.950> to

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
unconventional I say to them we need to

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.800 
unconventional I say to them we need to
try<00:04:12.280> something<00:04:12.550> different<00:04:12.700> because<00:04:13.239> what

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
try something different because what

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.900 
try something different because what
people<00:04:14.110> are<00:04:14.230> doing<00:04:14.350> now<00:04:14.650> is<00:04:14.920> is<00:04:15.100> not<00:04:15.430> working

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
people are doing now is is not working

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.750 
people are doing now is is not working
so<00:04:16.840> give<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.140> a<00:04:17.290> shot<00:04:17.500> try<00:04:18.070> something<00:04:18.519> that<00:04:18.669> you

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
so give it a shot try something that you

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.370 
so give it a shot try something that you
haven't<00:04:18.970> tried<00:04:19.269> before<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:19.900> very<00:04:20.080> quickly<00:04:20.109> I

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
haven't tried before and very quickly I

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.360
