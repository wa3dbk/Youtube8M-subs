what you see happening on the screen is

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.260 
what you see happening on the screen is
actually<00:02:02.350> pretty<00:02:02.710> pretty<00:02:03.430> fast<00:02:03.730> pretty<00:02:04.060> close

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
actually pretty pretty fast pretty close

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.580 
actually pretty pretty fast pretty close
to<00:02:04.390> what's<00:02:04.570> happening<00:02:04.690> on<00:02:05.020> me<00:02:05.170> on<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.440> phone

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
to what's happening on me on the phone

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.710 
to what's happening on me on the phone
screen<00:02:05.980> so<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:06.850> is<00:02:06.880> photographs<00:02:07.480> but<00:02:07.630> you

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
screen so this is photographs but you

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.660 
screen so this is photographs but you
can<00:02:07.870> also<00:02:08.020> show<00:02:08.410> movies<00:02:10.620> so<00:02:11.620> for<00:02:12.460> example<00:02:12.550> I

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
can also show movies so for example I

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.710 
can also show movies so for example I
can<00:02:15.670> do<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:18.670> actually<00:02:19.150> cannot<00:02:19.540> hear

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
can do this and you actually cannot hear

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.640 
can do this and you actually cannot hear
it<00:02:19.840> very<00:02:19.990> well<00:02:20.140> because<00:02:20.260> it's<00:02:20.500> also

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
it very well because it's also

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.900 
it very well because it's also
background<00:02:20.950> noise<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:21.460> if<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.610> get<00:02:21.730> close

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
background noise but if you get close

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.340 
background noise but if you get close
you<00:02:22.030> can<00:02:22.390> hear<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.690> audio<00:02:23.020> so<00:02:23.230> we're

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
you can hear the audio so we're

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.100 
you can hear the audio so we're
streaming<00:02:23.590> audio<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.640> video<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.530> TV

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.430 

nice<00:02:32.040> really<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.420> big<00:02:33.660> advantage<00:02:34.260> of

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
nice really that the big advantage of

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.200 
nice really that the big advantage of
this<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.100> does<00:02:35.250> not<00:02:35.430> require<00:02:35.610> an

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
this is that it does not require an

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.630 
this is that it does not require an
infrastructure<00:02:36.960> you<00:02:37.080> could<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:38.250> could<00:02:38.400> take

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
infrastructure you could you could take

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.790 
infrastructure you could you could take
this<00:02:38.790> phone<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:40.080> dongle<00:02:40.500> with<00:02:40.650> you

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
this phone and the dongle with you

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.010 
this phone and the dongle with you
anywhere<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.310> go<00:02:41.490> even<00:02:42.240> an<00:02:42.480> environment<00:02:42.990> that

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
anywhere you go even an environment that

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.040 
anywhere you go even an environment that
has<00:02:43.230> no<00:02:43.560> Wi-Fi<00:02:44.010> usually<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.180> connect<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
has no Wi-Fi usually you can connect the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.440 
has no Wi-Fi usually you can connect the
dongle<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.740> TV<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.970> can<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.270> this

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
dongle to the TV and you can do this

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.910 
dongle to the TV and you can do this
through<00:02:48.510> Wi-Fi<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.170> doesn't<00:02:49.590> require<00:02:49.770> an

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
through Wi-Fi it doesn't require an

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.620 
through Wi-Fi it doesn't require an
access<00:02:50.250> point<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.880> what<00:02:51.030> we've<00:02:51.180> essentially

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
access point so what we've essentially

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.990 
access point so what we've essentially
got<00:02:51.870> here<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.130> good<00:02:53.400> old<00:02:53.550> fashioned

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
got here is like a good old fashioned

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.870 
got here is like a good old fashioned
crossover<00:02:54.750> cable<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.560> wireless<00:02:56.130> just<00:02:56.640> plug

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
crossover cable but wireless just plug

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.480 
crossover cable but wireless just plug
one<00:02:57.209> device<00:02:57.510> into<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.900> other<00:02:58.110> but<00:02:58.830> Wi-Fi

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
one device into the other but Wi-Fi

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.330 
one device into the other but Wi-Fi
direct<00:02:59.820> straight<00:03:00.390> on<00:03:00.570> with<00:03:00.840> wireless<00:03:01.340> yes

direct straight on with wireless yes
pretty<00:03:02.640> much<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:03.030> mean<00:03:03.060> you're<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.990> could<00:03:04.200> do

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
pretty much I mean you're you could do

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.780 
pretty much I mean you're you could do
the<00:03:04.440> same<00:03:04.620> thing<00:03:04.890> by<00:03:05.040> connecting<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.610> cable

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
the same thing by connecting the cable

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.550 
the same thing by connecting the cable
from<00:03:06.630> your<00:03:06.690> phone<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:08.340> TV<00:03:08.640> right<00:03:09.030> but<00:03:09.600> it's

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
from your phone to the TV right but it's

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.620 
from your phone to the TV right but it's
kind<00:03:10.770> of<00:03:10.830> cumbersome<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.150> advantage<00:03:12.360> of

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
kind of cumbersome so the advantage of

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.870 
kind of cumbersome so the advantage of
this<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.810> just<00:03:13.020> Wi-Fi<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.520> can<00:03:14.670> walk

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
this is just Wi-Fi you can you can walk

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.699 
this is just Wi-Fi you can you can walk
into<00:03:15.090> your<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.810> friends<00:03:16.140> house<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.320> do<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
into your you friends house and do the

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.860 
into your you friends house and do the
same<00:03:17.010> thing<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.550> connect<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.450> dongle

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
same thing you just connect the dongle

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.110 
same thing you just connect the dongle
up<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.470> they<00:03:19.620> move<00:03:19.830> around<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.400> show<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
up and they move around and show the

that<00:04:25.990> gets<00:04:26.169> done<00:04:26.410> so<00:04:27.370> all<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.729> participants

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
that gets done so all the participants

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.360 
that gets done so all the participants
all<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.780> members<00:04:29.139> go<00:04:29.410> and<00:04:29.590> they<00:04:29.710> do<00:04:29.770> there<00:04:30.100> you

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
all the members go and they do there you

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.990 
all the members go and they do there you
know<00:04:30.850> testing<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.630> make<00:04:31.660> sure<00:04:31.810> that<00:04:32.080> all<00:04:32.110> the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
know testing to make sure that all the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.760 
know testing to make sure that all the
PTP<00:04:34.000> s<00:04:34.180> work<00:04:34.539> together<00:04:34.990> that's<00:04:35.440> that's<00:04:35.650> the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
PTP s work together that's that's the

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.770 
PTP s work together that's that's the
point<00:04:35.919> so<00:04:36.220> this<00:04:36.639> is<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:36.910> key<00:04:37.090> advantage<00:04:37.210> of<00:04:37.690> this

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
point so this is a key advantage of this

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.200 
point so this is a key advantage of this
technology's<00:04:38.440> all<00:04:38.650> standards-based<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.669> mean

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
technology's all standards-based I mean

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.310 
technology's all standards-based I mean
you<00:04:40.330> can<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:41.830> can<00:04:41.979> achieve<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.460> same<00:04:42.699> result

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
you can you can achieve the same result

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.550 
you can you can achieve the same result
you<00:04:44.320> know<00:04:44.850> by<00:04:45.900> developing<00:04:46.900> special<00:04:47.320> software

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
you know by developing special software

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.439 
you know by developing special software
but<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.100> key<00:04:48.340> point<00:04:48.580> here<00:04:48.760> is<00:04:49.000> this<00:04:49.120> is<00:04:49.270> all

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
but the key point here is this is all

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.140 
but the key point here is this is all
standards-based<00:04:50.020> so<00:04:50.669> that's<00:04:51.669> what<00:04:51.880> allows

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
standards-based so that's what allows

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.839 
standards-based so that's what allows
things<00:04:53.110> to<00:04:53.260> take<00:04:53.470> off<00:04:53.680> oh<00:04:53.950> the<00:04:54.220> adoption<00:04:54.669> rate

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
things to take off oh the adoption rate

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.600 
things to take off oh the adoption rate
to<00:04:54.970> take<00:04:55.150> off<00:04:55.360> in<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.960> big<00:04:55.990> way<00:04:56.169> because<00:04:57.039> it's

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
to take off in a big way because it's

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.480 
to take off in a big way because it's
Wi-Fi<00:04:58.570> direct<00:04:58.960> standards-based<00:04:59.500> Wi-Fi

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
Wi-Fi direct standards-based Wi-Fi

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.640 
Wi-Fi direct standards-based Wi-Fi
display<00:05:00.669> itself<00:05:01.180> is<00:05:01.479> standard<00:05:01.840> base<00:05:02.020> so<00:05:02.380> in

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
display itself is standard base so in

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.040 
display itself is standard base so in
the<00:05:02.800> end<00:05:02.979> you<00:05:03.400> know<00:05:03.520> once<00:05:03.760> this<00:05:03.970> gets<00:05:04.660> adopted

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
the end you know once this gets adopted

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.219 
the end you know once this gets adopted
in<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.470> big<00:05:05.650> way<00:05:05.889> any<00:05:06.280> phone<00:05:07.120> that's<00:05:07.660> Wi-Fi
