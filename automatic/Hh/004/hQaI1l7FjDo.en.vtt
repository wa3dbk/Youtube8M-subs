00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.790
 especially for the work 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.110
 SLR cameras to hold the SZR cameras 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.980
 are the lightest and Marco Grimaldi Bance designed 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.209
 unlike those normal supports used easily 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:00.780
 for video cameras 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900
 You can not be very important here 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.800
 there is a whole system all the euroraums » 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.530
 Euro to the specially adapted for the size of each camera 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.750
 many small screw you can perhaps protective of the high-altitude flight 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.330
 but also on the side 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.660
 to move to the Baastad 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.020
 only so it is possible that different Kammerer and is in different 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.170
 sizes 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.330
 to be adapted to the easy and thus the compendium has the 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.689
 MacBooks and the Polo Focus reports can be reported 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.460
 at the example, a five d mark 2he in the example I have one 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.420
 other distance 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.220
 to the ears as for example with a transporter of the IV 8 or with a 1 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.400
 the marked 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.580
 is much higher here 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.870
 This shooter does not go to this slightly fourth sentence Kant 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.970
 Accordingly, the tubes read correctly to read the size Dr learn 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.440
 the pipes are fixed here over their simple green screws that is 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.740
 very nice and very easy 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.340
 the black tide the young ones themselves took care of that all of them 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.459
 inconspicuous, no trend change can occur 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.389
 on the bottom we see the critical lead the winds one 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:16.519
 deepened very important because we want a few skating-skis with this devotion 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.779
 Abroad can but quite by the tripod 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:24.109
 This is possible here by simply placing my respective tripod plate on the bottom 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.749
 mountain 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.589
 also the Volkswagen brand - are the specially developed for the thesis 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.209
 she is small and light she is not made of a robust traffic 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.859
 footage 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.319
 It not only serves as a deterrent to Dr Sun Beach from above on the lens 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.680
 it is mainly a recording for Federer 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:50.839
 especially in the film sector filters are very often used here for example 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:54.899
 Part on fields anew with a soft transition to minute 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:59.059
 that means I can not be right down here in the height 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.069
 very important 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.439
 I've clarified two shooting possibilities for four by four 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.390
 the idea behind the grandstand is 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.390
 for example for the use of Polaris Nations League enl 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:15.399
 all around the very well made 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.399
 and all at a very attractive price 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:24.559
 have passed the most important fields apart from any 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.009
 which can be used means count already in a send 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:32.359
 Fab temperature or timetables do not even play to find them yes 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.649
 Target is of course gray filter 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:39.049
 in the jargon in the Filder for Neutral because here are so for one 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.559
 neutral gray 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:41.679
 designated 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:45.209
 these filters are nothing more than the adolescent of the incident 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.599
 To reduce light 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.369
 seven different strengths different levels most 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:56.429
 Think of those with a strength of Procom a3 newcomer 6 or newcomer 9 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.249
 shopping performed 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:01.499
 that means I have upstairs 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:05.059
 Neutra gray area of ​​here with a smooth course 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.419
 down transparency expires 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.719
 He loves this type of filter is best 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:16.279
 About such a filter holder to realize the compendium 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.319
 silence 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:22.119
 I've got the whole thing in one on Krefelder for a percent photo profit 

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:24.770
 the club before winning the title 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.460
 the situation does not vary 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.490
 and here I have the opportunity 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.029
 say my horizons a bit to sell this course
