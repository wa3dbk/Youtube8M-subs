00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.230 
all over the place and different venues
and<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.859> the<00:01:56.070> vaulting<00:01:56.399> weren't<00:01:56.579> segregated

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and in the vaulting weren't segregated

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.690 
and in the vaulting weren't segregated
so<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.409> an<00:01:58.500> interesting<00:01:58.740> concept

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
so and it's it's an interesting concept

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.050 
so and it's it's an interesting concept
but<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.539> saying<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:02.820> exchange

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
but what I'm saying is the the exchange

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.969 
but what I'm saying is the the exchange
is<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> fractional<00:02:04.049> reserve<00:02:04.320> exchange<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
is a fractional reserve exchange and

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.340 
is a fractional reserve exchange and
they<00:02:05.039> think<00:02:05.280> price<00:02:05.490> will<00:02:05.700> solve<00:02:05.909> everything

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
they think price will solve everything

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.290 
they think price will solve everything
so<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:08.220> was<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> decision<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:08.970> actually<00:02:09.240> an

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so that was a decision it's actually an

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.380 
so that was a decision it's actually an
easy<00:02:09.420> decision<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:09.990> your<00:02:10.170> fiduciary
