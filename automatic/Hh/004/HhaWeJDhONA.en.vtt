00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
inside a nice plastic wrapping the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.429 
inside a nice plastic wrapping the
tripod<00:01:45.110> it's<00:01:45.740> metal<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:46.820> that's<00:01:47.030> good<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:47.539> if

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
tripod it's metal so that's good and if

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.960 
tripod it's metal so that's good and if
you<00:01:48.560> play<00:01:48.770> with<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.009> legs<00:01:49.250> it's<00:01:49.579> actually

pretty<00:01:50.119> sturdy<00:01:51.189> so<00:01:52.189> that<00:01:52.369> means<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.899> will<00:01:53.990> be

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
pretty sturdy so that means it will be

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.789 
pretty sturdy so that means it will be
pretty<00:01:54.289> good<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:56.210> Clipper<00:01:56.479> thing<00:01:56.810> is<00:01:57.409> also

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
metal although this part is plastic the

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.350 
metal although this part is plastic the
microphone<00:02:02.869> itself<00:02:03.049> I<00:02:06.069> think<00:02:07.069> it's<00:02:07.189> metal<00:02:08.060> and

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
microphone itself I think it's metal and

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.339 
microphone itself I think it's metal and
plastic<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.229> over<00:02:10.220> here<00:02:10.489> you<00:02:10.989> can<00:02:11.989> see<00:02:12.170> how

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
there's that sort of but looking sign

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.070 
there's that sort of but looking sign
that<00:02:15.080> means<00:02:15.290> cardioid<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.190> that's<00:02:17.019> showing<00:02:18.019> a

that means cardioid and that's showing a
how<00:02:18.260> long<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:19.549> pattern<00:02:19.970> for<00:02:20.269> this<00:02:20.390> microphone

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
how long the pattern for this microphone

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.199 
how long the pattern for this microphone
you<00:02:21.680> have<00:02:21.799> to<00:02:21.920> talk<00:02:22.069> through<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.459> front<00:02:22.700> if

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
you have to talk through the front if

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.740 
you have to talk through the front if
it's<00:02:23.420> from<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.690> back<00:02:23.900> it'll<00:02:24.410> be<00:02:24.500> fuzzy<00:02:25.750> here's

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
it's from the back it'll be fuzzy here's

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.539 
it's from the back it'll be fuzzy here's
the<00:02:26.900> patch<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.410> put<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.709> microphone<00:02:27.890> in<00:02:30.549> it

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
the patch to put the microphone in it

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.220 
the patch to put the microphone in it
actually<00:02:31.849> smells<00:02:31.970> like<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.239> new<00:02:32.450> color<00:02:32.720> perhaps

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
actually smells like a new color perhaps

actually smells like a new color perhaps
a<00:02:33.590> Camry<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:35.510> that's<00:02:36.049> pretty<00:02:36.890> good<00:02:37.069> sign

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
inside here we have a USB cord and of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.340 
inside here we have a USB cord and of
course<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:46.400> can't<00:02:46.670> forget<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.120> snacks

now<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.410> microphone<00:02:52.070> is<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.280> little<00:02:52.670> bit<00:02:52.820> heavy

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
now the microphone is a little bit heavy

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.120 
now the microphone is a little bit heavy
compared<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.690> tripod<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:54.620> let's<00:02:54.830> put<00:02:55.040> it

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
compared to the tripod but let's put it

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.850 
compared to the tripod but let's put it
on<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.490> see<00:02:55.670> how<00:02:55.700> everything<00:02:56.300> goes<00:02:56.590> now<00:02:57.590> for

let's<00:03:22.490> scare<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:22.850> sting<00:03:23.180> on<00:03:32.980> now<00:03:33.980> we<00:03:34.040> can<00:03:34.310> lock

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
let's scare the sting on now we can lock

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.640 
let's scare the sting on now we can lock
this<00:03:34.670> part<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.210> see<00:03:35.450> what<00:03:35.600> happens<00:03:38.560> so<00:03:39.560> you

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
this part and see what happens so you

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.560 
this part and see what happens so you
can<00:03:39.830> see<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.670> microphone<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.150> actually

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
can see the microphone is actually

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.800 
can see the microphone is actually
pretty<00:03:42.190> heavy<00:03:43.190> but<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.000> tripod<00:03:44.450> is<00:03:44.570> sturdy

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
pretty heavy but the tripod is sturdy

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.080 
pretty heavy but the tripod is sturdy
enough<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.140> hold<00:03:45.320> it<00:03:45.620> now<00:03:46.220> because<00:03:46.670> this<00:03:46.910> is<00:03:47.060> a

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
enough to hold it now because this is a

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.780 
enough to hold it now because this is a
USB<00:03:47.630> microphone<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.650> would<00:03:48.830> be<00:03:48.950> very<00:03:48.980> easy<00:03:49.310> to

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
USB microphone it would be very easy to

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.010 
USB microphone it would be very easy to
install<00:03:51.040> first<00:03:52.040> we<00:03:52.190> have<00:03:52.340> our<00:03:52.520> USB<00:03:52.910> cord<00:03:53.390> which
