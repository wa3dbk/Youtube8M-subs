00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hi for my last back the school 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.020
 video I would like a shower there myself 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.670
 to do 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.899
 I know how difficult planning can be like 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.639
 you're in school and that's why I have 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.860
 today a door itself 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.990
 planning board for you that you can hang on 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.599
 your room it's super simple and looks 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.250
 very nice out so let's go 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.710
 The things you need are one 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.670
 colored papers you can buy in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.109
 the store but you can also just 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 print as I did 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.019
 then you still have a lot 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.039
 craft supplies need span stickers 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.039
 pens 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.219
 you can make it as crazy as you want 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.090
 a sticky marker and scissors are also 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.980
 handy then you need a list where 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.850
 you are going to make it my 40 is with 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.410
 50 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.950
 but you can do big or smaller what you do 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.079
 want optional but I still ruler and and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.780
 Paper cutter used which became something 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.309
 more precise than scissors and of course 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.300
 may we have a nice snack and 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.300
 and do not take advantage of forgiveness 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.690
 first you need something you 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.700
 can lay the foundation of the list 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.040
 So something to the same size is your chance 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.350
 use cardboard but I just have something 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.480
 A4 stuck together so it was fine 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.250
 I wanted to divide my list by 6 5 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.300
 for every weekday and one 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.800
 for the weekend 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.380
 I just measured how that was and 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.700
 how exactly it should stick 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.460
 and then I went to see the color 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.590
 what nice order was our order 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.000
 to insert 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.130
 here I am so going all papers 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.130
 so she said that it completely fitted 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.550
 if only a piece was left then you could 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.680
 who could just beat around the edge and that 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.030
 also done with all of them until i got it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.030
 whole paper filled 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.100
 again not much explanation 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.100
 humble all speaks for itself 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.189
 so the all were over I still have 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.000
 some tape made a separation between the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.000
 days as it were 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.130
 do you look a little clearer and 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.520
 it looked very cool with 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.520
 asterisks 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.800
 briefly in the list to see if 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.800
 everything is right 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.400
 yes so now you can continue making 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.870
 the days 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.000
 I just did this with a marker 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.710
 nice thick clear letters 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.710
 since it is pretty busy paper 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.670
 And of course there should be no box for it 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.189
 wk the lack of pie fixed too 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.420
 fun things to do 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.609
 here you can go wild with 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.549
 stickers you can also leave them where i am 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.319
 am just a very hard sticker fan 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.030
 and this is the square is actually 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.219
 completely ready that go back the 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.650
 in the list and now the thing comes that way 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.930
 nice about your ports 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.549
 you are going to load up in boardmarkers 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.739
 Please turn the moment you do not 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.840
 permanent marcus really needs it 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.670
 are board markers that you can use 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.439
 writing on smooth surfaces but 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.180
 which you therefore just go against again 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.560
 this means you can change every week 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.040
 what's on your plate because you're on it 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.040
 glass disk 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.680
 you can simply dot the dot with a dry cloth 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.719
 super easy to remove 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.340
 and you have this and the planning board 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.349
 very useful for school and also 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.640
 once very nice state room you can do it 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.170
 of course also about others 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.579
 things she could use 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.840
 I liked it very much 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.939
 thanks for watching this was my 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.409
 last woke score video super much 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:55.030
