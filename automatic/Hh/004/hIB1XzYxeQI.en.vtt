starting to show out here so making a
late<00:02:49.550> like<00:02:49.819> that<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.239> y'all<00:02:50.420> saw<00:02:50.660> on<00:02:50.870> tape

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
late like that that y'all saw on tape

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.780 
late like that that y'all saw on tape
from<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.470> beginning<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.980> season<00:02:52.160> then<00:02:52.519> i'm

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
from the beginning the season then i'm

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.550 
from the beginning the season then i'm
guessing<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.180> goal<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:53.660> make<00:02:53.930> try<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.410> make

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
guessing the goal is to make try to make

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.710 
guessing the goal is to make try to make
some<00:02:54.860> relief<00:02:55.190> in<00:02:55.370> all<00:02:55.519> we're<00:02:56.450> trying<00:02:56.540> to

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
some relief in all we're trying to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.110 
some relief in all we're trying to
double<00:02:57.049> that<00:02:57.080> make<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.350> double<00:02:57.890> leak<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.970> get

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
double that make a double leak to to get

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.240 
double that make a double leak to to get
even<00:02:59.239> better<00:02:59.450> than<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.959> last<00:03:00.140> year<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.769> i

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
even better than the last year and i

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.559 
even better than the last year and i
think<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:01.549> would<00:03:01.640> be<00:03:01.760> very<00:03:01.790> special<00:03:02.299> defense

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
think it would be very special defense

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:03.490 
think it would be very special defense
we<00:03:02.720> could<00:03:02.840> be<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.989> top<00:03:03.140> ten<00:03:03.319> in<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.440> country

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
we could be the top ten in the country

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.460 
we could be the top ten in the country
if<00:03:03.920> not<00:03:04.010> number<00:03:04.280> one<00:03:04.519> that's<00:03:04.819> our<00:03:04.970> goal<00:03:05.120> and

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
if not number one that's our goal and

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.440 
if not number one that's our goal and
when<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.530> strive<00:03:06.799> for<00:03:06.950> anything<00:03:07.100> else<00:03:07.340> less<00:03:07.549> do

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
when I strive for anything else less do

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.520 
when I strive for anything else less do
