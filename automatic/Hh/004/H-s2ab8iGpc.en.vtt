00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
is working but the monitor adjustment is

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.639 
is working but the monitor adjustment is
not<00:01:07.509> so<00:01:07.690> hot<00:01:09.360> unfortunately<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:11.200> adjustment

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
not so hot unfortunately the adjustment

we<00:01:11.770> want<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.280> pin<00:01:12.880> cushion<00:01:13.360> and<00:01:14.140> I<00:01:14.799> don't<00:01:14.979> know

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
we want is pin cushion and I don't know

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.850 
we want is pin cushion and I don't know
if<00:01:15.100> you<00:01:15.159> can<00:01:15.250> see<00:01:15.720> there's<00:01:16.720> a<00:01:16.810> missing<00:01:17.319> hole<00:01:17.530> on

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
if you can see there's a missing hole on

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.380 
if you can see there's a missing hole on
the<00:01:18.550> pot<00:01:18.759> board<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.890> says<00:01:21.069> Ben<00:01:21.280> cushion<00:01:21.640> so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
the pot board that says Ben cushion so

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.630 
the pot board that says Ben cushion so
that's<00:01:22.869> not<00:01:22.990> going<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.200> happen<00:01:23.289> I<00:01:23.560> guess<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
that's not going to happen I guess the

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.309 
that's not going to happen I guess the
video<00:01:24.880> signal<00:01:25.000> for<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.420> current<00:01:25.899> monitor

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
video signal for the current monitor

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.630 
video signal for the current monitor
comes<00:01:26.590> out<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:26.950> jama<00:01:27.190> connector

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
comes out of the jama connector

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.070 
comes out of the jama connector
somewhere<00:01:28.299> here<00:01:28.990> maybe<00:01:29.409> I<00:01:30.000> don't<00:01:31.000> know<00:01:31.179> it's

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
somewhere here maybe I don't know it's

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.660 
somewhere here maybe I don't know it's
in<00:01:32.229> there<00:01:32.259> somewhere<00:01:32.530> but<00:01:33.159> it's<00:01:33.520> not<00:01:33.640> a

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
in there somewhere but it's not a

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.550 
in there somewhere but it's not a
standard<00:01:34.000> connector<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.720> I<00:01:34.780> can<00:01:35.049> see<00:01:35.259> and<00:01:35.500> I

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
standard connector that I can see and I

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.139 
standard connector that I can see and I
can't<00:01:35.799> even<00:01:35.979> find<00:01:36.190> it<00:01:36.399> right<00:01:36.729> now<00:01:36.940> without

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
can't even find it right now without

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.169 
can't even find it right now without
removing<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.750> monitor<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.729> replacement

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
removing the monitor but the replacement

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.639 
removing the monitor but the replacement
monitor<00:01:40.299> just<00:01:40.509> has<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.720> vga<00:01:41.080> connector<00:01:41.470> on<00:01:41.619> the

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
monitor just has a vga connector on the

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.999 
monitor just has a vga connector on the
back<00:01:41.799> so<00:01:42.929> this<00:01:43.929> is<00:01:43.959> configured<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:44.560> have<00:01:44.770> like

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
back so this is configured to have like

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.419 
back so this is configured to have like
a<00:01:46.409> pass-through<00:01:47.409> type<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:47.979> deal<00:01:48.099> where<00:01:48.280> the

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
a pass-through type of deal where the

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.180 
a pass-through type of deal where the
video<00:01:48.849> signal<00:01:49.030> comes<00:01:49.330> out<00:01:49.479> of<00:01:49.629> the<00:01:49.830> vga<00:01:50.830> card

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
video signal comes out of the vga card

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.999 
video signal comes out of the vga card
here<00:01:51.780> into<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.959> main<00:01:53.379> motherboard<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:53.890> then

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
here into the main motherboard and then

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.010 
here into the main motherboard and then
out<00:01:54.280> somewhere<00:01:54.580> else<00:01:54.759> so<00:01:55.450> we're<00:01:55.750> just<00:01:55.780> going

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
out somewhere else so we're just going

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.650 
out somewhere else so we're just going
to<00:01:56.190> bypass<00:01:57.190> all<00:01:57.369> that<00:01:57.580> hogar<00:01:57.879> vga<00:01:58.149> cable<00:01:58.479> right

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
to bypass all that hogar vga cable right

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.760 
to bypass all that hogar vga cable right
into<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.899> video<00:01:59.140> card

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.399 

okay<00:02:03.670> got<00:02:04.240> all<00:02:04.390> hooked<00:02:04.810> up<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.170> now<00:02:05.320> we're

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
okay got all hooked up and now we're

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.650 
okay got all hooked up and now we're
gonna<00:02:05.500> turn<00:02:05.649> on<00:02:05.679> see<00:02:05.979> what<00:02:06.100> happens

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.020 

it's<00:02:13.200> working<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.070> looks<00:02:14.280> about<00:02:14.730> a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
it's working and it looks about a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.060 
it's working and it looks about a
hundred<00:02:15.390> times<00:02:15.780> better<00:02:16.050> than<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.860> current

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
hundred times better than the current

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.150 
hundred times better than the current
monitor<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:17.730> there<00:02:18.440> probably<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.590> even<00:02:20.010> better

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
monitor in there probably go even better

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.390 
monitor in there probably go even better
with<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> little<00:02:20.880> bit<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.210> adjustment<00:02:22.190> well<00:02:23.190> it

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
with a little bit of adjustment well it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.450 
with a little bit of adjustment well it
looks<00:02:23.670> way<00:02:23.880> better<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.950> actually<00:02:26.130> won't

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
looks way better but it actually won't

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.310 
looks way better but it actually won't
go<00:02:26.670> any<00:02:26.850> wider<00:02:27.120> than<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.780> can't<00:02:28.170> get

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
go any wider than that I can't get

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.940 
go any wider than that I can't get
proper<00:02:28.710> overscan<00:02:32.960> yes<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.260> why<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.620> goes<00:02:34.770> if

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
proper overscan yes is why is it goes if

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.160 
proper overscan yes is why is it goes if
you<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.160> see<00:02:35.280> even<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.750> overscan<00:02:36.750> area<00:02:37.110> is

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
you can see even the overscan area is

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.100

into in their entire lives and they made

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:42.939 
into in their entire lives and they made
the<00:04:40.970> connector<00:04:41.360> that<00:04:41.539> is<00:04:41.750> connected<00:04:42.560> in<00:04:42.680> there

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
the connector that is connected in there

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:49.480 
the connector that is connected in there
I<00:04:43.190> can't<00:04:44.180> disconnect<00:04:47.889> all<00:04:48.889> right<00:04:49.129> I<00:04:49.159> can't

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
I can't disconnect all right I can't

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.730 
I can't disconnect all right I can't
fucking<00:04:50.000> get<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:50.389> cable<00:04:50.780> undone<00:04:51.110> it<00:04:51.289> it

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
fucking get this cable undone it it

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.559 
fucking get this cable undone it it
might<00:04:52.159> be<00:04:52.310> enough<00:04:52.490> wire<00:04:52.699> for<00:04:53.060> it<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.210> be<00:04:53.330> pulled

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
might be enough wire for it to be pulled

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:55.779 
might be enough wire for it to be pulled
out<00:04:53.770> onto<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.860> front<00:04:55.069> of<00:04:55.159> the<00:04:55.220> cabinet<00:04:55.610> and

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
out onto the front of the cabinet and

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.580 
out onto the front of the cabinet and
then<00:04:56.569> I<00:04:56.659> can<00:04:56.780> work<00:04:56.900> out<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.110> from<00:04:57.229> there<00:04:57.409> so

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
then I can work out it from there so

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.790 
then I can work out it from there so
that's<00:04:57.680> when<00:04:57.889> I<00:04:58.039> try<00:04:59.139> okay<00:05:00.139> I<00:05:00.319> don't<00:05:00.500> have<00:05:00.680> the

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
that's when I try okay I don't have the

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.680 
that's when I try okay I don't have the
physical<00:05:00.979> strength<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.759> lift<00:05:01.969> this<00:05:02.240> thing<00:05:02.300> out

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
physical strength to lift this thing out

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.020 
physical strength to lift this thing out
of<00:05:02.719> there<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.319> it<00:05:03.740> weighs<00:05:03.919> about<00:05:04.039> 95<00:05:04.550> pounds

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
of there it it weighs about 95 pounds

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.300 
of there it it weighs about 95 pounds
and<00:05:05.180> there's<00:05:05.300> no<00:05:05.449> way<00:05:05.800> you<00:05:06.800> can't<00:05:07.069> get<00:05:07.159> a<00:05:07.190> good

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
and there's no way you can't get a good

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.619 
and there's no way you can't get a good
grip<00:05:07.370> on<00:05:07.699> it<00:05:07.759> you<00:05:07.969> gotta<00:05:08.120> like<00:05:08.300> is<00:05:08.509> you

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
grip on it you gotta like is you

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.790 
grip on it you gotta like is you
basically<00:05:08.900> at<00:05:09.289> arm's<00:05:09.530> length<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.949> whole<00:05:10.129> time

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
basically at arm's length the whole time

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.260 
basically at arm's length the whole time
so<00:05:12.800> I'm<00:05:12.860> going<00:05:13.039> to<00:05:13.099> do<00:05:13.190> is<00:05:13.520> put<00:05:13.759> the<00:05:13.879> bolts<00:05:14.120> back

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
so I'm going to do is put the bolts back

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.209 
so I'm going to do is put the bolts back
in<00:05:14.509> I<00:05:14.780> might<00:05:15.259> be<00:05:15.289> able<00:05:15.379> to<00:05:15.469> do<00:05:15.560> is<00:05:15.650> put<00:05:16.190> the

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
in I might be able to do is put the

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:21.520 
in I might be able to do is put the
bolts<00:05:16.460> in<00:05:16.659> lay<00:05:17.659> the<00:05:17.690> Machine<00:05:18.110> down<00:05:18.379> and<00:05:20.530> then

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
bolts in lay the Machine down and then

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.020 
bolts in lay the Machine down and then
attempt<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:21.830> pull<00:05:22.099> the<00:05:22.219> monitor<00:05:22.370> straight<00:05:22.849> up

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
attempt to pull the monitor straight up

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.969 
attempt to pull the monitor straight up
out<00:05:23.509> of<00:05:23.569> it<00:05:23.870> and<00:05:23.930> I<00:05:24.379> can<00:05:24.560> probably<00:05:24.860> do<00:05:24.949> that

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
out of it and I can probably do that

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.100 
out of it and I can probably do that
although<00:05:25.940> that<00:05:26.090> does<00:05:26.300> mean<00:05:26.509> I<00:05:26.539> have<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:26.930> get

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
although that does mean I have to get

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.529 
although that does mean I have to get
that<00:05:27.229> fucking<00:05:27.680> connector<00:05:28.099> out<00:05:28.250> of<00:05:28.370> their

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539
