00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
unbeatable I'll see sunny so I saw the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.380 
unbeatable I'll see sunny so I saw the
ps4<00:00:31.679> demo<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.399> saw<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.610> ps4<00:00:32.940> conference

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
ps4 demo that we saw the ps4 conference

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.959 
ps4 demo that we saw the ps4 conference
but<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.540> also<00:00:33.690> saw<00:00:34.070> another<00:00:35.070> mission<00:00:35.550> which<00:00:35.790> is

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
but I also saw another mission which is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.209 
but I also saw another mission which is
the<00:00:36.059> more<00:00:36.239> sort<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.649> basically<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.010> if

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the more sort of basically if you if

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.340 
the more sort of basically if you if
you've<00:00:38.399> ever<00:00:38.550> seen<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> Far<00:00:39.390> Cry<00:00:39.510> 3<00:00:39.629> outpost

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
you've ever seen the Far Cry 3 outpost

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
you've ever seen the Far Cry 3 outpost
things<00:00:40.649> where<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.040> kind<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.250> take

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
things where you have to kind of take

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.799 
things where you have to kind of take
over<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> outpost<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.149> opens<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> map

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
over the outpost and that opens the map

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.779 
over the outpost and that opens the map
up<00:00:42.989> basically<00:00:43.710> watchdogs<00:00:44.160> works<00:00:44.340> exactly<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
up basically watchdogs works exactly the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.130 
up basically watchdogs works exactly the
same<00:00:44.910> way<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.530> sea<00:00:46.800> toss<00:00:47.070> kind<00:00:47.670> of

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
same way but the sea toss kind of

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.600 
same way but the sea toss kind of
control<00:00:49.140> system<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.950> kind<00:00:50.550> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
control system that is kind of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.250 
control system that is kind of
controlling<00:00:51.030> all<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.360> surveillance<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
controlling all the surveillance in the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.110 
controlling all the surveillance in the
city<00:00:52.530> that's<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> gain<00:00:53.550> access<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.940> you

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
city that's what you gain access to you

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.819 
city that's what you gain access to you
so<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.570> kind<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.020> close-range

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so you can do kind of like close-range

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.010 
so you can do kind of like close-range
hacks<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.430> things<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.660> don't<00:00:57.870> have

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
hacks and things if you don't have

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.540 
hacks and things if you don't have
access<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.440> outpost<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:58.980> as<00:00:59.100> soon<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.399> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
access to the outpost but as soon as you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.510 
access to the outpost but as soon as you
managed<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.449> hack<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:01.129> that<00:01:02.129> sort<00:01:02.460> of

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
managed to hack that that sort of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.969 
managed to hack that that sort of
control<00:01:03.180> center<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.140> area<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> that

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
control center then that area of that

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.679 
control center then that area of that
district<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.610> neighborhood<00:01:05.970> opens<00:01:06.510> up

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
district all that neighborhood opens up

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.450 
district all that neighborhood opens up
for<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.830> became<00:01:08.220> really

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
for you and it's what became really

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070 
for you and it's what became really
clear<00:01:08.700> actually<00:01:09.090> was<00:01:09.270> how<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.630> kind<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
clear actually was how the kind of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.510 
clear actually was how the kind of
hacking<00:01:10.350> works<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.680> an<00:01:10.799> almost<00:01:10.920> sort<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.340> line

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
hacking works on an almost sort of line

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.800 
hacking works on an almost sort of line
of<00:01:11.549> sight<00:01:11.700> thinks<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> camera<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
of sight thinks the camera is going to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.120 
of sight thinks the camera is going to
be<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.049> important<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.770> game<00:01:13.979> because

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
be really important in this game because

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.249 
be really important in this game because
you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.909> hack<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> camera<00:01:15.540> that's<00:01:15.659> pointed

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
you can hack a camera that's pointed

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.109 
you can hack a camera that's pointed
over<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.500> wall<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.700> into<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
over a wall you can then see into that

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.789 
over a wall you can then see into that
compound<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.080> maybe<00:01:19.290> hack<00:01:19.530> something

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
compound and then maybe hack something

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.070 
compound and then maybe hack something
else<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.850> kind<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.119> almost<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.840> daisy

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
else as you kind of almost like daisy

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.429 
else as you kind of almost like daisy
chain<00:01:22.470> these<00:01:22.680> things<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.220> inside<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.439> for

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
chain these things to get inside and for

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.780 
chain these things to get inside and for
the<00:01:25.500> outpost<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.009> lot<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> time<00:01:26.549> you'll<00:01:26.700> be

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the outpost a lot of the time you'll be

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.100 
the outpost a lot of the time you'll be
kind<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> profiling<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> guards<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:27.990> see

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
kind of profiling the guards you can see

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
kind of profiling the guards you can see
where<00:01:28.229> they<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.770> allows<00:01:29.009> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
where they are and then that allows you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.380 
where they are and then that allows you
to<00:01:29.189> then<00:01:29.340> go<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.729> use<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:30.030> either

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
to then go in and use your either

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.560 
to then go in and use your either

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.410 
that needs to be hacked again like this
hacking<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.790> obviously<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
hacking is going to be obviously a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.670 
hacking is going to be obviously a
massive<00:01:36.750> part<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> game<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> habit

measures<00:01:42.990> hacker<00:01:43.229> gates<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.770> opens<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> feels

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
measures hacker gates are opens it feels

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.800 
measures hacker gates are opens it feels
like<00:01:44.549> they'll<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> fast<00:01:45.540> hack

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
like they'll be kind of like a fast hack

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
like they'll be kind of like a fast hack
button<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.229> will<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.979> default<00:01:47.369> thing

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
button that will do the default thing

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.069 
button that will do the default thing
and<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:47.909> you'll<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.479> more<00:01:48.720> sort<00:01:48.990> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
and then you'll have more sort of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.679 
and then you'll have more sort of
elaborate<00:01:49.829> skills<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.149> rotation

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
elaborate skills on like on a rotation

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.630 
elaborate skills on like on a rotation
wheel<00:01:51.930> what's<00:01:52.439> really<00:01:52.799> interesting<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
wheel what's really interesting is the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.980 
wheel what's really interesting is the
multiplayer<00:01:54.030> stuff<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.420> they<00:01:54.509> showed<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
multiplayer stuff that they showed so

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.569 
multiplayer stuff that they showed so
they<00:01:55.200> teased<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.439> stuff<00:01:55.890> last<00:01:56.100> year<00:01:56.399> when<00:01:56.549> we

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
they teased that stuff last year when we

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.910 
they teased that stuff last year when we
saw<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> game<00:01:57.200> they<00:01:58.200> showed<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.619> little

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
saw the game they showed it in a little

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.950 
saw the game they showed it in a little
more<00:01:59.009> depth<00:01:59.280> now<00:01:59.759> which<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.689> really<00:02:00.840> cool

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
more depth now which is really cool

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.030 
more depth now which is really cool
because<00:02:01.079> basically<00:02:01.380> when<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.740> player

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
because basically when it player

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.310 
because basically when it player
intrudes<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.640> your<00:02:02.880> game<00:02:03.329> world<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.170> no

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
intrudes on your game world you have no

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.899 
intrudes on your game world you have no
idea<00:02:04.439> until<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:05.159> start<00:02:05.430> interfering<00:02:05.759> with

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
idea until they start interfering with

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.399 
idea until they start interfering with
you<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.450> they'll<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.810> game<00:02:06.990> world<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
you so they'll be in the game world the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.660 
you so they'll be in the game world the
game<00:02:07.560> won't<00:02:07.710> notify<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.340> someone's

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
scan them or once you scan them then you

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.710 
scan them or once you scan them then you
can<00:02:16.520> hit<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> button<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.090> start<00:02:17.360> downloading

which is great but the really cool
moment<00:03:27.980> was<00:03:28.070> then<00:03:28.340> all<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.790> lights<00:03:28.970> started

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
moment was then all the lights started

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.000 
moment was then all the lights started
to<00:03:29.330> ping<00:03:29.510> back<00:03:29.660> on<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:30.019> see<00:03:30.200> these<00:03:30.320> entire<00:03:30.739> box

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
to ping back on you see these entire box

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.759 
to ping back on you see these entire box
of<00:03:31.250> liked<00:03:31.850> our<00:03:32.000> box<00:03:32.269> light<00:03:32.870> up<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:33.320> they

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
of liked our box light up and they

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:34.990 
of liked our box light up and they
showed<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.040> bit<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.310> procedural<00:03:34.670> stuff<00:03:34.880> as

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
showed a bit of the procedural stuff as

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.220 
showed a bit of the procedural stuff as
well<00:03:35.150> which<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.300> really<00:03:35.660> really<00:03:35.810> cool<00:03:36.019> because

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
well which is really really cool because

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.680 
well which is really really cool because
they've<00:03:36.860> shown<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.519> kind<00:03:37.760> of<00:03:37.910> potential

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
they've shown the kind of potential

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.070 
they've shown the kind of potential
victim<00:03:38.989> potential<00:03:40.000> sort<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.090> criminal<00:03:41.330> system

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
victim potential sort of criminal system

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.300 
victim potential sort of criminal system
but<00:03:42.320> it's<00:03:42.440> based<00:03:42.620> around<00:03:42.769> this<00:03:42.920> kind<00:03:43.100> of<00:03:43.130> very

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
but it's based around this kind of very

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.120 
but it's based around this kind of very
Orwellian<00:03:43.810> idea<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.170> entire

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
Orwellian idea that the entire

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.710 
Orwellian idea that the entire
surveillance<00:03:46.940> system<00:03:47.420> is<00:03:47.540> actually

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
surveillance system is actually

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.810 
surveillance system is actually
predicting<00:03:48.470> crimes<00:03:48.800> as<00:03:49.130> it's<00:03:49.519> basically

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
predicting crimes as it's basically

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.940 
predicting crimes as it's basically
profiling<00:03:50.450> people<00:03:50.480> all<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.019> time<00:03:51.050> so<00:03:51.620> the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
profiling people all the time so the

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.070 
profiling people all the time so the
percentage<00:03:52.370> based<00:03:53.239> on<00:03:53.390> information<00:03:53.570> that

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
percentage based on information that

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.020 
percentage based on information that
they<00:03:54.200> know<00:03:54.380> about<00:03:54.530> people<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.220> once<00:03:55.760> you've

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
they know about people and once you've

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.759 
they know about people and once you've
unlocked<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.660> outpost<00:03:57.019> you<00:03:57.500> then<00:03:57.650> get

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
unlocked that outpost you then get

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.290 
unlocked that outpost you then get
access<00:03:58.070> to<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:58.250> data<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:58.670> those<00:03:58.820> procedural

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
access to that data and those procedural

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.970 
access to that data and those procedural
missions<00:03:59.630> affair<00:03:59.989> so<00:04:00.230> you'll<00:04:00.620> get<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.860> guy
