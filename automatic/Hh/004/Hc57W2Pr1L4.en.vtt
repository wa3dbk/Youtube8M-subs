actually<00:00:37.050> I'm<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:37.230> too<00:00:37.380> familiar<00:00:37.469> with

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710

actually I'm not too familiar with
Lucifer<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.129> think<00:00:38.280> he's<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.550> new<00:00:38.700> players

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
Lucifer I think he's one of new players

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.290 
Lucifer I think he's one of new players
to<00:00:39.780> come<00:00:39.930> out<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.290> qualify<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.120> MSL<00:00:42.120> this

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.610 
to come out and qualify for the MSL this
season<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.660> I'm<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:42.870> terribly<00:00:43.079> familiar<00:00:43.290> with

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
season so I'm not terribly familiar with

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.069 
season so I'm not terribly familiar with

the new maps it's interesting this map

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
the new maps it's interesting this map
the<00:00:56.789> statistics<00:00:57.390> don't<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.719> favor<00:00:57.960> turn

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the statistics don't really favor turn

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.869 
the statistics don't really favor turn
but<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> little<00:00:58.920> bit<00:00:59.100> early<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> tell<00:00:59.640> it's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
but it's a little bit early to tell it's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.540 
but it's a little bit early to tell it's
31<00:01:00.359> Protoss<00:01:01.050> vs<00:01:01.379> turn<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:01.890> map<00:01:02.070> thus<00:01:02.280> far

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
31 Protoss vs turn on this map thus far

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.759 
31 Protoss vs turn on this map thus far
but<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.449> said<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.780> fairly<00:01:04.140> early<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
but as I said it is fairly early in the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.950 
but as I said it is fairly early in the
day<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.640> predict<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.420> would<00:01:06.540> turn<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.780> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
day to predict what it would turn out to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.719 
day to predict what it would turn out to
be<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.260> obviously<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> lot<00:01:08.189> depends<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
be and obviously a lot depends on the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.370 
be and obviously a lot depends on the
individual<00:01:09.150> players<00:01:09.360> involved<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
individual players involved and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.899 
individual players involved and
hopefully<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.070> i<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.310> pull<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> stops

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
hopefully not i can pull out the stops

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.990 
hopefully not i can pull out the stops
and<00:01:12.210> pull<00:01:12.930> off<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> win<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.700> at<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> same

after his first pylon not starting up
supply<00:01:37.470> depot<00:01:37.770> well<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:38.729> an

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
supply depot well that was an

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.480 
supply depot well that was an
interesting<00:01:38.880> map<00:01:39.329> because<00:01:39.780> you've<00:01:39.990> got<00:01:40.170> all

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
interesting map because you've got all

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.639 
interesting map because you've got all
the<00:01:41.490> expansions<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> middle<00:01:43.259> which<00:01:43.470> are

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the expansions in the middle which are

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.499 
the expansions in the middle which are
difficult<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.280> hold<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.000> there's<00:01:45.210> lots<00:01:45.420> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
difficult to hold and there's lots of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.389 
difficult to hold and there's lots of
open<00:01:45.810> space<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> yet<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> symmetrical

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
open space and yet it's a symmetrical

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.370 
open space and yet it's a symmetrical
and<00:01:47.579> fairly<00:01:47.939> balanced<00:01:48.299> map<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.229> for

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and fairly balanced map so I think for

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.830 
and fairly balanced map so I think for
that<00:01:50.040> reason<00:01:50.490> it'll<00:01:51.060> probably<00:01:51.329> turn<00:01:51.570> out<00:01:51.689> to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
that reason it'll probably turn out to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.010 
that reason it'll probably turn out to
be<00:01:51.930> an<00:01:51.990> interesting<00:01:52.200> game<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:54.180> lot<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
be an interesting game and a lot of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.139 
be an interesting game and a lot of

Korean girls hiding their faces again

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.840 
Korean girls hiding their faces again
although<00:01:57.960> there's<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.950> couple<00:01:59.310> there<00:01:59.670> that

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
although there's a couple there that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.600 
although there's a couple there that
look<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.180> they<00:02:00.360> probably<00:02:00.719> don't<00:02:01.110> want<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
look like they probably don't want to

core<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.540> it'll<00:02:15.870> be<00:02:15.900> interesting<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.319> see<00:02:16.409> from

core so it'll be interesting to see from
here<00:02:16.980> whether<00:02:17.189> he<00:02:17.310> decides<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.700> tech<00:02:18.000> ahead<00:02:18.299> or

whether he decides to put that expansion

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.800 
whether he decides to put that expansion
down<00:02:19.950> first<00:02:20.310> personally<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.239> think<00:02:21.329> it's<00:02:21.689> a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
down first personally I think it's a

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.030 
down first personally I think it's a
good<00:02:21.959> idea<00:02:22.110> for<00:02:22.260> Protoss<00:02:22.680> players<00:02:22.860> especially

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
good idea for Protoss players especially

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.380 
good idea for Protoss players especially
where's<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.489> prolific<00:02:23.819> players<00:02:24.060> such<00:02:24.299> as

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
where's the prolific players such as

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.850 
where's the prolific players such as
nada<00:02:24.599> you<00:02:25.079> don't<00:02:25.260> want<00:02:25.409> to<00:02:25.470> leave<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.680> honey

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
nada you don't want to leave in honey

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.069 
nada you don't want to leave in honey
and<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.069> fact<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.459> Lucifer<00:02:26.970> scouting<00:02:27.450> looks

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
and the fact that Lucifer scouting looks

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.020 
and the fact that Lucifer scouting looks
like<00:02:28.230> he<00:02:28.409> might<00:02:28.530> be<00:02:28.769> hoping<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.760> apply<00:02:30.000> a

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
like he might be hoping to apply a

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.520 
like he might be hoping to apply a
little<00:02:30.150> bit<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.329> pressure<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.659> even<00:02:31.500> more

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
little bit of pressure on even more

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.410 
little bit of pressure on even more
something<00:02:31.829> early<00:02:32.220> on<00:02:32.370> because<00:02:33.060> he<00:02:33.209> said<00:02:33.360> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
something early on because he said the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.789 
something early on because he said the
second<00:02:33.750> pro<00:02:33.870> body<00:02:34.049> doesn't<00:02:34.349> wanna<00:02:34.470> get<00:02:34.590> caught

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
second pro body doesn't wanna get caught

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.440 
second pro body doesn't wanna get caught
off<00:02:35.220> guard<00:02:35.250> by<00:02:35.489> his<00:02:35.849> opponent<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.209> that's<00:02:36.359> a

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
off guard by his opponent and that's a

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.000 
off guard by his opponent and that's a
clever<00:02:36.599> ploy<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:36.959> he's<00:02:37.109> got<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.409> second

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
clever ploy but he's got that second

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.929 
clever ploy but he's got that second
probe<00:02:38.129> sitting<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.459> middle<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.730> map<00:02:38.849> and

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
probe sitting in the middle the map and

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:39.860 
probe sitting in the middle the map and
that's<00:02:39.060> an<00:02:39.150> interesting<00:02:39.450> position<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.750> have

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
that's an interesting position to have

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.089 
that's an interesting position to have
that<00:02:39.959> hopes<00:02:40.109> anybody's<00:02:40.470> now<00:02:40.590> Scott<00:02:40.829> it<00:02:40.920> not<00:02:41.010> on

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
that hopes anybody's now Scott it not on

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.800 
that hopes anybody's now Scott it not on
his<00:02:41.190> face<00:02:41.340> but<00:02:41.940> he<00:02:42.000> still<00:02:42.180> got<00:02:42.299> that<00:02:42.359> proxy<00:02:42.659> and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
his face but he still got that proxy and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.819 
his face but he still got that proxy and
so<00:02:42.900> obviously<00:02:42.959> what<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.379> gonna<00:02:43.500> try<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.769> do

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
so obviously what is gonna try and do

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.500 
so obviously what is gonna try and do
some<00:02:43.980> sort<00:02:44.159> of<00:02:44.190> proxy<00:02:44.549> both<00:02:44.700> there<00:02:44.879> he's

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
some sort of proxy both there he's

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.240 
some sort of proxy both there he's
hidden<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.139> just<00:02:46.319> in<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.470> map<00:02:46.739> nada<00:02:46.950> meanwhile

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
hidden it just in the map nada meanwhile

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.360 
hidden it just in the map nada meanwhile
I<00:02:47.280> was<00:02:47.370> scouting<00:02:47.519> with<00:02:47.760> his<00:02:47.909> SCD<00:02:48.329> in<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.680> in

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
I was scouting with his SCD in the in

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.530 
I was scouting with his SCD in the in
the<00:02:50.400> clockwise<00:02:50.760> direction<00:02:50.909> as<00:02:51.269> well<00:02:51.299> he

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
the clockwise direction as well he

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.330 
the clockwise direction as well he
scouted<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.989> face<00:02:52.889> the<00:02:53.040> bottom<00:02:53.220> right<00:02:53.310> corner

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
scouted the face the bottom right corner

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.430 
scouted the face the bottom right corner
map<00:02:53.700> has<00:02:53.879> not<00:02:53.970> found<00:02:54.120> loose<00:02:54.329> for<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.629> shortly

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
map has not found loose for you shortly

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.470 
map has not found loose for you shortly
so<00:02:56.190> far<00:02:56.400> both<00:02:56.519> there's<00:02:56.760> very<00:02:56.970> similar<00:02:57.269> bills

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
so far both there's very similar bills

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.390 
so far both there's very similar bills
it'll<00:02:57.930> be<00:02:58.019> interesting<00:02:58.200> exactly<00:02:58.920> what<00:02:59.129> filled

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
it'll be interesting exactly what filled

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.280 
it'll be interesting exactly what filled
the<00:03:00.060> Protoss<00:03:00.420> player<00:03:00.599> votes<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:00.870> he's<00:03:01.109> got

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
the Protoss player votes for he's got

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.990 
the Protoss player votes for he's got
that<00:03:01.409> one<00:03:01.470> extra<00:03:02.099> probe<00:03:02.370> hidden<00:03:02.639> out<00:03:02.730> there

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
that one extra probe hidden out there

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.610 
that one extra probe hidden out there
and<00:03:03.540> I'm<00:03:03.629> just<00:03:03.780> wondering<00:03:03.989> what<00:03:04.440> he's

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
and I'm just wondering what he's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.629 
and I'm just wondering what he's
planning<00:03:04.769> on<00:03:04.980> doing<00:03:05.159> that<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.430> feeling

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
planning on doing that I have a feeling

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.160 
planning on doing that I have a feeling
he's<00:03:05.730> gonna<00:03:05.790> try<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.569> do<00:03:06.750> some<00:03:06.959> sort<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.109> a

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
he's gonna try and do some sort of a

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.300 
he's gonna try and do some sort of a
profitable<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.680> might<00:03:07.889> see<00:03:08.040> maybe<00:03:08.220> a
