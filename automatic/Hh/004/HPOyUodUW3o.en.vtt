00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
simple all you need to do is make sure i

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.529 
simple all you need to do is make sure i
would<00:00:47.399> write<00:00:47.579> people<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.090> might<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> right

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539

people<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.320> very<00:00:49.500> simplistic

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
people and it's very simplistic

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.200 
people and it's very simplistic
afterwards<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> make<00:00:51.149> sure

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
afterwards you just have to make sure

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.689 
afterwards you just have to make sure
that<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:52.350> use<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.559> cure<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.399> times

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that you use to cure at the right times

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.150 
that you use to cure at the right times
make<00:00:54.120> sure<00:00:54.270> we're<00:00:54.539> make<00:00:54.989> sure<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.860> second

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
make sure we're make sure at the second

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.369 
make sure we're make sure at the second
run<00:00:56.280> when<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.489> butt<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.730> kill<00:00:56.969> something<00:00:57.629> for

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
run when your butt to kill something for

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
run when your butt to kill something for
certain<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.890> use<00:00:59.070> your<00:00:59.190> cue<00:00:59.430> you'll<00:00:59.699> see<00:00:59.879> what

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
certain you use your cue you'll see what

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.180 
certain you use your cue you'll see what
i<00:01:00.059> mean<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.840> now<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.739> don't<00:01:01.949> even<00:01:02.010> need

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
i mean but for now you don't even need

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:11.820 
i mean but for now you don't even need
to<00:01:02.280> worry<00:01:02.399> about<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.090> very<00:01:03.270> easy

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.040 

so<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:12.790> is<00:01:12.910> going<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.120> be<00:01:13.240> one<00:01:13.570> of<00:01:13.600> my<00:01:13.750> quick

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
so this is going to be one of my quick

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.840 
so this is going to be one of my quick
overview<00:01:14.680> so<00:01:15.070> I'm<00:01:15.160> going<00:01:15.370> to<00:01:15.430> be<00:01:15.520> skipping

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
overview so I'm going to be skipping

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.410 
overview so I'm going to be skipping
parts<00:01:16.150> here<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:16.450> there<00:01:16.980> well<00:01:17.980> y'all<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:19.150> ever

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
parts here and there well y'all you ever

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.400 
parts here and there well y'all you ever
will<00:01:20.050> be<00:01:20.170> very<00:01:20.380> simplistic<00:01:20.710> what<00:01:20.920> I'm<00:01:21.010> doing

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
will be very simplistic what I'm doing

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.590 
will be very simplistic what I'm doing
so<00:01:23.410> after<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.740> kill<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.070> Wolves<00:01:24.670> go<00:01:25.120> to<00:01:25.300> raves

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
so after you kill the Wolves go to raves

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.750 
so after you kill the Wolves go to raves
you're<00:01:25.960> going<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.230> hit<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.560> one<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.610> rad

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
you're going to hit the one of the rad

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.700 
you're going to hit the one of the rad
rift<00:01:27.970> after<00:01:28.540> your<00:01:28.810> heads<00:01:28.930> might<00:01:29.380> immediately

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
rift after your heads might immediately

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.130 
rift after your heads might immediately
level<00:01:30.490> your<00:01:30.640> e<00:01:30.820> after<00:01:31.480> you<00:01:31.570> do<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.750> next<00:01:31.930> auto

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
level your e after you do the next auto

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.170 
level your e after you do the next auto
cad<00:01:32.350> e<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:34.060> watch

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.490 

I<00:01:38.240> know<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:39.110> they're<00:01:39.740> just<00:01:39.770> moving<00:01:40.280> easy

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
I know that they're just moving easy

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.200 
I know that they're just moving easy
once<00:01:42.500> it<00:01:42.650> also<00:01:42.890> seems<00:01:43.160> how<00:01:43.250> we<00:01:43.400> are<00:01:43.520> not<00:01:43.700> loving

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
once it also seems how we are not loving

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.090 
once it also seems how we are not loving
our<00:01:44.480> what<00:01:47.470> probably<00:01:48.470> better<00:01:48.650> if<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:48.890> head<00:01:49.070> home

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
our what probably better if I head home

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.330 
our what probably better if I head home
but<00:01:49.690> cosmic<00:01:50.690> emotions
