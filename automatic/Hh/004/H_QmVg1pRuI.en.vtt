day since he bought it but that's the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.350 
day since he bought it but that's the
problem<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.070> know<00:01:23.100> he<00:01:23.580> had<00:01:23.700> bet<00:01:24.030> his<00:01:24.330> life

and so of course he was emotionally

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.100 
and so of course he was emotionally
attached<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.700> decision<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.450> he<00:01:30.960> was

behavioral<00:01:34.020> biases<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.619> we've<00:01:34.740> talked

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
behavioral biases that we've talked

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.920 
behavioral biases that we've talked
about<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.700> he<00:01:35.970> wouldn't<00:01:36.299> sell<00:01:36.540> at<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.750> loss

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
about and he wouldn't sell at a loss

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.719 
about and he wouldn't sell at a loss
because<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.409> had<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> had<00:01:38.009> been<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> profit

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
because it had it had been in the profit

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.999 
because it had it had been in the profit
in<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.329> past<00:01:39.570> he<00:01:39.750> had<00:01:39.900> doubled<00:01:40.320> his<00:01:40.439> money<00:01:40.470> in

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
in the past he had doubled his money in

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.560 
in the past he had doubled his money in
the<00:01:41.220> past<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.820> therefore<00:01:41.939> he<00:01:42.119> was<00:01:42.210> waiting

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the past and therefore he was waiting

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.569 
the past and therefore he was waiting
for<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.930> happen<00:01:43.049> again<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:44.159> dread<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
for that to happen again and I dread to

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.060 
for that to happen again and I dread to
think<00:01:44.610> how<00:01:44.909> much<00:01:45.149> money<00:01:45.360> he's<00:01:45.570> lost<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:46.070> so

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
think how much money he's lost now so

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.060 
think how much money he's lost now so
only<00:01:47.840> only<00:01:48.840> play<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.530> money<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.890> you

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
only only play with the money that you

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.700 
only only play with the money that you
can<00:01:50.460> afford<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.060> lose<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.540> straightaway

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
can afford to lose and straightaway

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.380 
can afford to lose and straightaway
you<00:01:53.040> will<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.280> much<00:01:53.549> less<00:01:53.850> emotionally

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
you will be much less emotionally

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.569 
you will be much less emotionally
attached<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.110> any<00:01:55.619> financial<00:01:55.979> decisions<00:01:56.460> you

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
attached to any financial decisions you

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.570 
attached to any financial decisions you
make

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.540 

so<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:02.110> two<00:02:02.290> things<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.770> would<00:02:02.920> be<00:02:02.950> very<00:02:03.220> wary

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
so the two things I would be very wary

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.070 
so the two things I would be very wary
of<00:02:03.730> our<00:02:04.180> emotions<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:05.440> risk<00:02:06.510> as<00:02:07.510> I<00:02:07.630> said<00:02:07.900> you

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.580 
to me and I completely agree with him is
actually<00:04:03.760> that<00:04:03.880> was<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> very<00:04:04.420> bad<00:04:04.720> lesson<00:04:05.140> for

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
actually that was a very bad lesson for

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.979 
actually that was a very bad lesson for
her<00:04:05.769> because<00:04:06.459> what<00:04:06.760> she's<00:04:07.000> learned<00:04:07.299> is<00:04:07.720> that

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
her because what she's learned is that

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.410 
her because what she's learned is that
actually<00:04:08.620> she<00:04:09.310> can<00:04:09.549> hold<00:04:09.910> on<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.239> loss

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
actually she can hold on to a loss

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.970 
actually she can hold on to a loss
making<00:04:10.630> position<00:04:11.109> in<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.260> markets<00:04:11.560> can<00:04:11.709> turn

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
making position in the markets can turn

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.920 
making position in the markets can turn
and<00:04:12.310> she<00:04:12.880> can<00:04:13.030> make<00:04:13.120> a<00:04:13.180> load<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.510> money<00:04:13.600> and

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
and she can make a load of money and

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.650 
and she can make a load of money and
actually<00:04:14.769> that's<00:04:15.130> a<00:04:15.280> bad<00:04:15.310> lesson<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.450> learn

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
actually that's a bad lesson to learn

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.289 
actually that's a bad lesson to learn
because<00:04:17.289> it's<00:04:17.500> taught<00:04:17.799> her<00:04:18.100> not<00:04:18.729> to<00:04:19.090> be

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
because it's taught her not to be

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.190 
because it's taught her not to be
religious<00:04:20.229> on<00:04:20.440> cost<00:04:20.709> control<00:04:21.240> and<00:04:22.240> I<00:04:22.960> think

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
religious on cost control and I think

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.400 
religious on cost control and I think
that's<00:04:23.410> one<00:04:24.100> of<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.810> when<00:04:25.810> you're<00:04:25.960> first

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
that's one of the when you're first

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.180 
that's one of the when you're first
learning<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:27.280> trade<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:29.110> short<00:04:29.680> term<00:04:29.919> may<00:04:30.160> be

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
learning to trade that short term may be

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.860 
learning to trade that short term may be
a<00:04:30.340> great<00:04:30.729> thing<00:04:31.060> for<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:31.450> you've<00:04:31.690> got

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
a great thing for you that you've got

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.900 
a great thing for you that you've got
out<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:32.050> loss<00:04:32.320> making<00:04:32.590> position<00:04:33.160> but<00:04:33.729> if<00:04:33.820> you

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
out a loss making position but if you

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.690 
out a loss making position but if you
haven't<00:04:34.260> experienced<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.410> pain<00:04:35.740> then<00:04:36.520> you're

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
haven't experienced the pain then you're

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.029 
haven't experienced the pain then you're
not<00:04:36.940> going<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.300> learn<00:04:37.510> properly<00:04:38.260> sometimes

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
not going to learn properly sometimes

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.400 
not going to learn properly sometimes
you've<00:04:39.550> got<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:39.789> take<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.389> financial<00:04:40.960> plane

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
you've got to take the financial plane

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.310 
you've got to take the financial plane
to<00:04:42.160> really<00:04:42.669> learn<00:04:42.910> how<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.330> understand<00:04:44.050> to

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
to really learn how to understand to

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:53.320 
to really learn how to understand to
preserve<00:04:44.680> your<00:04:44.889> capital

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.389
