00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.620 

to<00:05:14.300> do<00:05:14.449> anything<00:05:16.419> find<00:05:17.419> me<00:05:17.540> some<00:05:17.720> bolts<00:05:18.080> here

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.750 

well<00:05:21.200> you<00:05:21.440> can<00:05:21.560> see<00:05:21.710> I<00:05:21.740> got<00:05:21.980> about<00:05:22.220> a<00:05:22.280> quarter

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
well you can see I got about a quarter

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.650 
well you can see I got about a quarter
of<00:05:22.790> an<00:05:22.970> inch<00:05:23.090> here<00:05:23.510> on<00:05:23.690> both<00:05:23.990> sides<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:25.660> down

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
of an inch here on both sides and down

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.280 
of an inch here on both sides and down
in<00:05:26.840> here<00:05:27.110> might<00:05:27.410> pump<00:05:27.710> us<00:05:28.600> right<00:05:29.600> against<00:05:30.140> the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
in here might pump us right against the

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:39.160 
in here might pump us right against the
thing<00:05:32.710> so<00:05:33.710> it<00:05:33.920> means<00:05:34.160> that<00:05:36.460> basically<00:05:38.170> right

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
thing so it means that basically right

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.100 
thing so it means that basically right
in<00:05:39.200> here<00:05:39.680> somewhere<00:05:40.330> I'm<00:05:41.330> going<00:05:41.630> to<00:05:41.720> just<00:05:41.930> have

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
in here somewhere I'm going to just have

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.510 
in here somewhere I'm going to just have
to<00:05:42.260> beat<00:05:42.470> this<00:05:42.650> down<00:05:42.950> with<00:05:43.190> a<00:05:43.220> hammer

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
to beat this down with a hammer

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.090 
to beat this down with a hammer
so<00:05:46.520> it'll<00:05:46.730> clear<00:05:47.030> that<00:05:47.240> water<00:05:47.540> pump<00:05:47.900> they<00:05:48.860> say

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
so it'll clear that water pump they say

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.900 
so it'll clear that water pump they say
they<00:05:49.250> won't<00:05:49.400> work<00:05:49.700> with<00:05:49.970> your<00:05:50.680> stock<00:05:51.910> fuel

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
they won't work with your stock fuel

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.740 
they won't work with your stock fuel
pump<00:05:53.180> so<00:05:53.510> I<00:05:53.540> left<00:05:53.990> I<00:05:54.820> left<00:05:55.820> the<00:05:56.030> eccentric<00:05:56.540> out

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
pump so I left I left the eccentric out

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.660 
pump so I left I left the eccentric out
of<00:05:56.900> that<00:05:57.050> I<00:05:57.080> hope<00:05:57.470> I<00:05:57.620> didn't<00:05:57.890> mess<00:05:58.040> up<00:05:58.100> on<00:05:58.520> the

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
of that I hope I didn't mess up on the

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.800 
of that I hope I didn't mess up on the
spacer<00:05:59.150> I'll<00:05:59.330> have<00:05:59.480> to<00:05:59.600> look<00:05:59.840> at<00:06:00.020> that<00:06:00.820> but<00:06:01.820> you

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
spacer I'll have to look at that but you

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.100 
spacer I'll have to look at that but you
can<00:06:02.990> see<00:06:03.020> I<00:06:03.200> got<00:06:03.500> a<00:06:03.530> beat<00:06:03.830> that<00:06:04.040> down<00:06:05.110> some

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
can see I got a beat that down some

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.380 
can see I got a beat that down some
might<00:06:06.920> be<00:06:06.950> an<00:06:07.220> easier<00:06:07.550> way<00:06:07.580> to<00:06:07.790> do<00:06:08.090> it<00:06:08.240> or<00:06:08.330> a

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
might be an easier way to do it or a

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.290 
might be an easier way to do it or a
prettier<00:06:09.050> way<00:06:09.230> to<00:06:09.290> do<00:06:09.590> it<00:06:09.710> but<00:06:10.210> it<00:06:11.210> doesn't

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
prettier way to do it but it doesn't

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.280 
prettier way to do it but it doesn't
look<00:06:11.750> like<00:06:11.780> it's<00:06:12.080> going<00:06:12.230> to<00:06:12.320> be<00:06:12.440> too<00:06:12.650> bad<00:06:14.290> I've

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
look like it's going to be too bad I've

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:21.250 
look like it's going to be too bad I've
got<00:06:15.530> a<00:06:16.090> spot<00:06:17.090> over<00:06:17.390> here<00:06:17.420> from<00:06:18.050> my<00:06:19.930> water<00:06:20.930> pump

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
got a spot over here from my water pump

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.020 
got a spot over here from my water pump
outlet<00:06:23.590> this<00:06:24.590> can<00:06:24.830> go<00:06:24.980> on<00:06:25.010> either<00:06:25.400> way<00:06:25.640> so<00:06:25.700> I'll

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
outlet this can go on either way so I'll

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.790 
outlet this can go on either way so I'll
probably<00:06:26.180> bring<00:06:26.480> my<00:06:26.660> water<00:06:26.900> pump<00:06:27.170> outlet<00:06:27.440> out

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
probably bring my water pump outlet out

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.860 
probably bring my water pump outlet out
the<00:06:27.980> top<00:06:30.520> I'll<00:06:31.520> have<00:06:31.700> to<00:06:31.880> think<00:06:32.300> about<00:06:32.450> it<00:06:32.780> I

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
the top I'll have to think about it I

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.000 
the top I'll have to think about it I
think<00:06:33.020> you<00:06:33.080> should<00:06:33.110> come<00:06:33.440> out<00:06:33.470> of<00:06:33.590> this<00:06:33.800> side

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
think you should come out of this side

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.220 
think you should come out of this side
over<00:06:34.130> here<00:06:34.250> on<00:06:34.430> the<00:06:34.520> bottom<00:06:34.730> because<00:06:35.230> that's

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
over here on the bottom because that's

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.180 
over here on the bottom because that's
where<00:06:36.380> my<00:06:36.560> radiator<00:06:37.010> is<00:06:38.560> so<00:06:39.560> that's<00:06:39.920> probably

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
where my radiator is so that's probably

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.890 
where my radiator is so that's probably
the<00:06:40.400> way<00:06:40.520> it<00:06:40.550> goes<00:06:40.760> on<00:06:41.000> I<00:06:41.060> just<00:06:41.360> have<00:06:41.540> to<00:06:41.660> put<00:06:41.870> a

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
the way it goes on I just have to put a

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.450 
the way it goes on I just have to put a
plug<00:06:42.200> on<00:06:42.380> the<00:06:42.530> other<00:06:42.560> side<00:06:42.980> and<00:06:43.220> move<00:06:43.340> it

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
plug on the other side and move it

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.240 
plug on the other side and move it
around<00:06:43.930> I'll<00:06:44.930> pull<00:06:45.170> it<00:06:45.200> off<00:06:45.440> now<00:06:45.710> and<00:06:45.920> massage

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
around I'll pull it off now and massage

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.950 
around I'll pull it off now and massage
it<00:06:46.460> a<00:06:46.520> bit<00:06:46.700> with<00:06:46.880> a<00:06:46.910> hammer<00:06:47.120> and<00:06:47.300> see<00:06:47.750> what<00:06:47.870> it

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
it a bit with a hammer and see what it

00:06:47.960 --> 00:07:06.220 
it a bit with a hammer and see what it
looks<00:06:48.140> like

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.230 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.790 

yep

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.710 

like<00:07:10.370> we're<00:07:10.580> clearing<00:07:11.060> all<00:07:11.210> the<00:07:11.240> way<00:07:11.419> around

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 
like we're clearing all the way around

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.300 
like we're clearing all the way around
the<00:07:11.930> corn<00:07:12.319> itch<00:07:13.330> well<00:07:14.330> it<00:07:14.419> looks<00:07:14.569> pretty<00:07:14.660> good

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:26.569 
really didn't have to bang on it as much

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:30.879 
really didn't have to bang on it as much
as<00:07:26.750> I<00:07:26.870> did<00:07:27.940> and<00:07:28.940> it<00:07:29.270> looks<00:07:29.509> like<00:07:29.599> I'm<00:07:29.960> not
