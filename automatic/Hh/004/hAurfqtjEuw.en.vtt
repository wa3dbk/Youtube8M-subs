that seem to show the developers packed

that seem to show the developers packed
as<00:01:09.780> much<00:01:09.990> punch<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.920> could<00:01:11.189> into<00:01:11.549> every

but thanks to their simplistic design

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
but thanks to their simplistic design
they<00:01:21.509> lend<00:01:21.720> themselves<00:01:21.780> quite<00:01:22.350> nicely<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.920> the

they lend themselves quite nicely to the
idea<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.460> 2d<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.420> 3d<00:01:24.479> games<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
idea that 2d and 3d games are going to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.359 
idea that 2d and 3d games are going to
be<00:01:26.100> around<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.700> long<00:01:26.790> time<00:01:27.979> overall<00:01:28.979> for

be around for a long time overall for
the<00:01:29.400> genre<00:01:30.000> I'd<00:01:30.540> say<00:01:30.960> nearly<00:01:31.290> universally

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
the genre I'd say nearly universally

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
the genre I'd say nearly universally
roguelike<00:01:33.450> games<00:01:33.780> employ<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.710> classic<00:01:35.220> art

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.670 
style of games hailing from the 16-bit
era<00:01:38.159> which<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.210> believe<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.840> be<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.079> strongest

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
era which I believe to be the strongest

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.620 
era which I believe to be the strongest
video<00:01:41.009> game<00:01:41.250> era<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.909> comes<00:01:42.150> to

video game era when it comes to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.280

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
graphical beauty of course there is more

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.770 
graphical beauty of course there is more
to<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> game<00:01:46.799> than<00:01:47.070> simply<00:01:47.340> its<00:01:47.520> looks<00:01:47.790> gameplay

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.109 
to a game than simply its looks gameplay
is<00:01:48.840> incredibly<00:01:49.320> important<00:01:49.890> as<00:01:50.009> well<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.549> once

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
is incredibly important as well and once

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.850 
is incredibly important as well and once
