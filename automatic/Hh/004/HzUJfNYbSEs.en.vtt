00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello, I do not know which of my videos 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.460
 reviewer 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.690
 but I'm here in a personal ask questions 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.849
 so you have to answer and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.970
 today's video will be 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:20.180
 a review of my recent purchase of it 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:25.769
 cordless saw and 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.539
 rechargeable Bulgarian traube policy 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.679
 this company implies 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:36.930
 separate sale of the instrument itself 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:39.809
 batteries and chargers when 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.620
 such a scheme can be purchased two three 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.600
 battery purchase tool and 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.879
 have some kind of your own small park 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.670
 overpaying for extra charges for extra 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:00.420
 batteries let's say it's pretty convenient 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.799
 as well as in living conditions and for 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.110
 some types of professional work 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.560
 all batteries in this line are 18 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.560
 volt 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 I bought two batteries one I took 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.119
 at 2 and 6 ampere hours 2 which went to 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.970
 bundled with charging 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.770
 for a half ampere hour and this 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.770
 battery there is such a nice option 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.060
 as a charge indicator that allows 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.060
 control residual capacity 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.850
 because lithium batteries are 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.290
 allow you to produce up charge at any 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.720
 time that is figuratively speaking one 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.320
 battery you work 2 stands on 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.840
 charging 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:52.909
 and then you swap them and now I 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.909
 I will talk in more detail about drank myself 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:06.540
 beer here is 150 millimeters propyl 45 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.849
 depth adjustment are made by here 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.950
 such a graded ruler here is 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.830
 window joked that allows you to accurately 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:19.849
 set the depth there is a pipe under 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.410
 vacuum cleaner there is a standard tilt function 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:27.300
 saws 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:32.940
 and there is even a screw for 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:36.150
 fine angle adjustment 90 degrees saw 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.709
 relative to the platform such a function 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.400
 not even provided at all 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:45.180
 professional beer is parallel 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.430
 ruler ruler graduated except 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.459
 the divisions are applied on the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.700
 platform screw clamping ruler has 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:58.430
 spring that is, if you removed the line to 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.159
 vent won't turn away from vibration 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.659
 still there is a laser guide 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.450
 have you and 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:09.540
 which indicates the entry position of the disk 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.640
 moreover, this laser has an adjustment 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.680
 the screw allowing to adjust precisely 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.580
 beam position 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.909
 regarding the disk everything is done like a 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.099
 solid professional tool 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.090
 Lazar turns on when you press a button 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.900
 security 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.030
 the button is double-sided 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.329
 which is convenient both for right-handers and for 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.750
 left-handers and now I will first show 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:38.760
 cut along then show cut 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.489
 across the pine board and chipboard 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.760
 it means I was dragged 30 millimeters pine 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.359
 very resinous heavy and now i'm 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.510
 I will show how this saw to cope with such 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.510
 by material 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:15.400
 and will enter very easily given the power 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.780
 where there is clearly no resistance 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.150
 Now I will cut across from me 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.780
 such a self-made guide which 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.110
 Allows you to first of all this edge 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.370
 see exactly where rest plus happens 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:48.050
 stand strictly 90 degrees google so 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:50.290
 drove it was doses now chipboard 18 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.290
 millimeters 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:03.629
 and the last I have is a bar 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.650
 here about 50 two millimeters 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.650
 have a beer go all the way down 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:27.370
 You can clearly see I 'm cutting beer pretty 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:32.640
 easily comfortable in the hand by weight not very 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:36.130
 hard and now I will see how much 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.690
 my battery was spent on these 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.590
 a few cuts here right now I 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:44.170
 Show 3 divisions saw costs 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.890
 pretty seriously battery power 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:53.770
 but thanks to two batteries you can 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:06:00.960
 work nonstop on this opel and 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:03.490
 Thank you all for your attention and 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.420
 continuation will be in the next series to us 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.420
 I will talk about the Bulgarians
