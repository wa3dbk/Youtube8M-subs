00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
impressed me was the amount of space

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.660 
impressed me was the amount of space
inside<00:01:33.319> particularly<00:01:34.319> in<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> boot<00:01:35.159> area

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
inside particularly in the boot area

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.190 
inside particularly in the boot area
because<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.030> thought<00:01:36.240> oh<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.719> a<00:01:36.810> rear-engine

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
because I thought oh it's a rear-engine

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.319 
because I thought oh it's a rear-engine
car<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:38.340> going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.579> really<00:01:38.819> compromise

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
car that's going to really compromise

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
car that's going to really compromise
the<00:01:39.630> boot<00:01:39.960> space<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.249> the<00:01:41.369> case

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the boot space but that's not the case

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.789 
the boot space but that's not the case
at<00:01:41.819> all<00:01:41.969> I<00:01:42.299> think<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.960> got<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.109> lot<00:01:43.289> more<00:01:43.319> space

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
at all I think it's got a lot more space

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.760 
at all I think it's got a lot more space
and<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.219> lot<00:01:44.609> of<00:01:44.640> other<00:01:45.259> kind<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.289> similar

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and a lot of other kind of similar

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.249 
and a lot of other kind of similar
competitors<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.179> that<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.479> really<00:01:48.869> impressed

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259

me plus female mid passenger space as
well<00:01:51.960> which<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:52.950> you've<00:01:53.069> really<00:01:53.249> kind<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
well which I think you've really kind of

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.399 
well which I think you've really kind of
adds<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.389> fact<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.659> you've<00:01:54.869> got<00:01:55.020> four

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
adds to the fact that you've got four

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.429 
adds to the fact that you've got four
doors<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.069> the<00:01:56.939> amount<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.359> space<00:01:57.630> inside<00:01:57.899> is

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
doors and the amount of space inside is

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.309 
doors and the amount of space inside is
you<00:01:59.369> know<00:01:59.490> isn't<00:01:59.729> adequate<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:01.170> four

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
you know isn't adequate for for four

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.279 
you know isn't adequate for for four
people<00:02:01.709> I<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.340> possibly<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.299> only<00:02:03.719> thing

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
people I think possibly the only thing

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.800 
people I think possibly the only thing
would<00:02:05.249> be<00:02:05.369> traveling<00:02:05.819> in<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.389> the<00:02:06.600> back

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
would be traveling in the in the back

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.870 
would be traveling in the in the back
and<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.829> could<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.100> just<00:02:08.369> feeling<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.850> little

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
and it could be just feeling a little

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.360 
and it could be just feeling a little
bit<00:02:09.240> claustrophobic<00:02:09.800> but<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.860> guess<00:02:11.130> with<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
bit claustrophobic but I guess with a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.160 
bit claustrophobic but I guess with a
car<00:02:11.640> like<00:02:11.850> this<00:02:12.120> you're<00:02:12.720> not<00:02:12.870> going<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.080> be

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
car like this you're not going to be

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.030 
car like this you're not going to be
going

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040

going
huge<00:02:14.489> long<00:02:14.760> journeys<00:02:15.599> so<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.140> know<00:02:16.260> around

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
huge long journeys so you know around

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.979 
huge long journeys so you know around

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
fiddly to get to and I'm not sure how

fiddly to get to and I'm not sure how
that<00:03:07.200> will<00:03:07.349> affect<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.769> handling<00:03:09.650> most<00:03:10.650> of

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
that will affect the handling most of

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.140 
that will affect the handling most of
the<00:03:10.890> time<00:03:11.069> sure<00:03:11.310> it'd<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.549> fine<00:03:11.700> but<00:03:12.030> for

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
the time sure it'd be fine but for

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.460 
the time sure it'd be fine but for
instance<00:03:12.269> if<00:03:12.569> we<00:03:12.690> are<00:03:12.720> on<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.959> rare<00:03:13.109> occasions

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
instance if we are on the rare occasions

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.949 
instance if we are on the rare occasions
we<00:03:13.530> get<00:03:13.680> snow<00:03:14.450> what's<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.629> going<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:15.870> like

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
we get snow what's it going to be like

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.319 
we get snow what's it going to be like
to<00:03:16.290> drive<00:03:16.409> then<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:17.010> do<00:03:17.250> actually<00:03:17.609> prefer<00:03:18.150> the

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
to drive then I do actually prefer the

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.940 
to drive then I do actually prefer the
three-door<00:03:18.750> especially<00:03:19.169> small<00:03:19.440> cars<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.919> think

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
three-door especially small cars I think

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.220 
three-door especially small cars I think
they<00:03:20.220> look<00:03:20.370> better<00:03:20.549> with<00:03:20.819> three<00:03:21.060> doors<00:03:21.329> small

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
they look better with three doors small

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.229 
they look better with three doors small
five-door<00:03:22.769> cars<00:03:22.980> they<00:03:23.130> can<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.669> look<00:03:24.000> like

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
five-door cars they can it look like

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.610 
five-door cars they can it look like
you've<00:03:24.450> got<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.599> lot<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.840> small<00:03:25.139> doors<00:03:25.440> and

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
you've got a lot of small doors and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.650 
you've got a lot of small doors and
there's<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> bit<00:03:25.980> too<00:03:26.220> much<00:03:26.430> going<00:03:26.849> on<00:03:26.940> however

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
there's a bit too much going on however

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.520 
there's a bit too much going on however
as<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.079> one<00:03:28.290> has<00:03:28.380> got<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.650> hidden<00:03:29.519> style

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
as this one has got the hidden style

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.960 
as this one has got the hidden style
back<00:03:31.530> doors<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:32.010> wouldn't<00:03:32.280> put<00:03:32.459> me<00:03:32.639> off<00:03:32.760> as

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
back doors that wouldn't put me off as

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.610 
back doors that wouldn't put me off as
much<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.780> would<00:03:34.530> certainly<00:03:34.709> consider<00:03:35.129> one<00:03:36.620> like
