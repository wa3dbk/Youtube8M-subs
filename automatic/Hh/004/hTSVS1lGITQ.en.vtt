00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
see why that was the case so here we go

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.310 
see why that was the case so here we go
2008<00:00:35.550> different<00:00:36.540> wine<00:00:36.630> all<00:00:36.780> together<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
2008 different wine all together it's a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.540 
2008 different wine all together it's a
different<00:00:37.590> vintage<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.950> course<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.280> should<00:00:38.399> be

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
different vintage of course it should be

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.610 
different vintage of course it should be
now<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> went<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> website<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> rufino's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
now I went to the website the rufino's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.830 
now I went to the website the rufino's
website<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> exact<00:00:42.420> Royal

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
website I do not know the exact Royal

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.110 
website I do not know the exact Royal
breakdown<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.469> has<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.860> about<00:00:44.040> 25<00:00:44.460> %<00:00:44.789> g<00:00:45.030> of

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
breakdown it has to be about 25 % g of

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.840 
breakdown it has to be about 25 % g of
AC<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.170> other<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.730> mixture<00:00:47.730> of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
AC and the other can be a mixture of

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.389 
AC and the other can be a mixture of
Merlot<00:00:48.629> Cabernet<00:00:48.870> Sauvignon<00:00:49.200> Syrah

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399

Merlot Cabernet Sauvignon Syrah
Kenny<00:00:50.910> Yolo<00:00:51.210> etc<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:52.379> I'm<00:00:52.710> guessing

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
Kenny Yolo etc now I'm guessing

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
Kenny Yolo etc now I'm guessing
definitely<00:00:53.610> 80%<00:00:54.329> because<00:00:54.570> that's<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
definitely 80% because that's what the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.470 
definitely 80% because that's what the
past<00:00:55.230> orphanages<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.070> been<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.879> maybe<00:00:57.300> it's

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
past orphanages have been so maybe it's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.139 
past orphanages have been so maybe it's
80<00:00:57.690> %<00:00:58.260> g<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.559> AC<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.370> has<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.059> know

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
80 % g of AC and it has to be you know

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.340 
80 % g of AC and it has to be you know
three<00:01:00.359> quarters<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.809> at<00:01:01.050> least

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
three quarters of that at least

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.560 
three quarters of that at least
and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.609> remains<00:01:02.910> around<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.270> guessing

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and then the remains around I'm guessing

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.450 
and then the remains around I'm guessing
is<00:01:03.719> probably<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> was<00:01:04.979> last<00:01:05.159> year

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
is probably as it was last year

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.670 
is probably as it was last year
just<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> guess<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.479> I'm<00:01:06.600> gonna<00:01:06.689> keep<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.500> link

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
just a guess now I'm gonna keep the link

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.679 
just a guess now I'm gonna keep the link
