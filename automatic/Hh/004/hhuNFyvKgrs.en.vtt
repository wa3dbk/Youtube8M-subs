00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
important to remember that the rear axle

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.900 
important to remember that the rear axle
is<00:05:04.720> out<00:05:04.900> there<00:05:05.140> and<00:05:05.470> you<00:05:06.310> pick<00:05:06.490> up<00:05:06.610> too<00:05:06.790> much

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
is out there and you pick up too much

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:15.300 
is out there and you pick up too much
speed<00:05:07.210> too<00:05:07.420> quickly

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:14.029 

well<00:07:12.479> it's<00:07:12.629> been<00:07:12.749> an<00:07:12.839> incredibly<00:07:13.259> fun<00:07:13.589> day<00:07:13.830> and

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 
well it's been an incredibly fun day and

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:15.409 
well it's been an incredibly fun day and
if<00:07:14.129> there<00:07:14.279> is<00:07:14.369> one<00:07:14.639> thing<00:07:14.879> that<00:07:14.909> I'm<00:07:15.119> taking

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:15.419 
if there is one thing that I'm taking

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:16.999 
if there is one thing that I'm taking
away<00:07:15.509> from<00:07:15.629> this<00:07:16.050> experience<00:07:16.409> is<00:07:16.679> that

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:17.009 
away from this experience is that

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:19.489 
away from this experience is that
appearances<00:07:17.699> can<00:07:17.939> be<00:07:17.999> very<00:07:18.449> deceptive<00:07:18.839> when

00:07:19.489 --> 00:07:19.499 
appearances can be very deceptive when

00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:21.230 
appearances can be very deceptive when
we<00:07:19.619> first<00:07:19.860> got<00:07:20.069> here<00:07:20.309> this<00:07:20.669> course<00:07:20.969> looked

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
we first got here this course looked

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.969 
we first got here this course looked
incredibly<00:07:21.959> simple<00:07:22.349> but<00:07:22.529> as<00:07:22.619> I<00:07:22.770> soon

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 
incredibly simple but as I soon

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:25.369 
incredibly simple but as I soon
discovered<00:07:23.009> it's<00:07:23.669> anything<00:07:24.119> but<00:07:24.479> simple<00:07:24.839> the

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:25.379 
discovered it's anything but simple the

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:27.169 
discovered it's anything but simple the
same<00:07:25.589> goes<00:07:25.830> for<00:07:25.860> the<00:07:26.219> Tuareg<00:07:26.580> when<00:07:26.939> you<00:07:27.029> look

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:27.179 
same goes for the Tuareg when you look

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:28.549 
same goes for the Tuareg when you look
