00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
what we could do a suppose actually is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.429 
what we could do a suppose actually is
actually<00:01:42.180> open<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> application<00:01:42.780> and

recovery so I'm going to and so and

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.320 
recovery so I'm going to and so and
there<00:03:49.830> it<00:03:49.920> goes<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.250> just<00:03:50.430> booted<00:03:50.760> my<00:03:50.880> device

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
there it goes it just booted my device

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.210 
there it goes it just booted my device
into<00:03:51.750> fastboot<00:03:52.260> mode<00:03:52.380> as<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.770> can<00:03:52.890> see<00:03:53.040> there

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
into fastboot mode as you can see there

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.699 
into fastboot mode as you can see there
and<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.270> should<00:03:54.510> start<00:03:54.750> installing<00:03:55.050> clutter

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
and it should start installing clutter

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.410 
and it should start installing clutter
cover<00:03:55.980> it's<00:03:56.160> even<00:03:56.370> writing<00:03:56.580> doing<00:03:57.240> all<00:03:57.330> this

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
cover it's even writing doing all this

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.300 
cover it's even writing doing all this
stuff<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:57.990> looks<00:03:58.200> like<00:03:58.310> recovery

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
stuff so it looks like recovery

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.550 
stuff so it looks like recovery
considering<00:04:00.120> it's<00:04:00.240> flashing<00:04:00.570> right<00:04:01.050> now

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
considering it's flashing right now

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.030 
considering it's flashing right now
there<00:04:02.160> we<00:04:02.220> go<00:04:02.310> check<00:04:02.520> that<00:04:02.670> out<00:04:03.090> neat<00:04:03.890> so<00:04:04.890> it's

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
there we go check that out neat so it's

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.860 
there we go check that out neat so it's
obviously<00:04:05.370> installing<00:04:05.850> I'm<00:04:06.240> going<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.630> assume

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
obviously installing I'm going to assume

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.110 
obviously installing I'm going to assume
clockworkmod<00:04:07.530> recovery<00:04:07.560> just<00:04:08.040> because<00:04:08.340> Koosh

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
clockworkmod recovery just because Koosh

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.270 
clockworkmod recovery just because Koosh
is<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.140> developer<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.560> clockworkmod<00:04:11.130> he's

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
is the developer of clockworkmod he's

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.670 
is the developer of clockworkmod he's
also<00:04:11.459> one<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.940> view<00:04:12.090> main<00:04:12.420> team<00:04:12.959> members

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
also one of the view main team members

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.680 
also one of the view main team members
and<00:04:14.250> developers<00:04:14.730> over<00:04:14.940> at<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.300> signage

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
and developers over at the signage

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.900 
and developers over at the signage
montine<00:04:16.140> so<00:04:16.980> I'm<00:04:17.190> going<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.580> assume<00:04:17.850> that

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
montine so I'm going to assume that

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.849 
montine so I'm going to assume that
we've<00:04:18.150> finished<00:04:18.390> installing<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:19.170> recovery

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
we've finished installing the recovery

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:20.960 
we've finished installing the recovery
because<00:04:20.130> now<00:04:20.340> it's<00:04:20.549> actually<00:04:20.820> saying

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
because now it's actually saying

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.780 
because now it's actually saying
installing<00:04:21.479> operating<00:04:22.290> system<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.460> we'll<00:04:23.669> go

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
installing operating system so we'll go

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.490 
installing operating system so we'll go
ahead<00:04:23.820> and

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
ahead and

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.600 
ahead and
I'm<00:04:24.620> gonna<00:04:24.740> cut<00:04:24.920> the<00:04:25.010> video<00:04:25.220> now<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.460> we'll<00:04:25.550> be

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
I'm gonna cut the video now and we'll be

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.000 
I'm gonna cut the video now and we'll be
right<00:04:25.850> back<00:04:26.030> as<00:04:26.240> soon<00:04:26.270> as<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.780> screen<00:04:27.620> changes

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.430 
installing system applications so I'm
going<00:04:51.560> to<00:04:51.800> assume<00:04:52.220> that<00:04:53.060> includes<00:04:53.420> G<00:04:53.900> apps<00:04:54.110> and

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
going to assume that includes G apps and

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.570 
going to assume that includes G apps and
everything<00:04:54.500> but<00:04:54.980> I<00:04:55.040> guess<00:04:55.160> we'll<00:04:55.310> find<00:04:55.520> that

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
everything but I guess we'll find that

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.190 
everything but I guess we'll find that
out<00:04:55.730> in<00:04:55.790> just<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.970> moment<00:04:56.180> because<00:04:56.240> again<00:04:56.570> I've

what's cool about this is if you have a

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.990 
what's cool about this is if you have a
device<00:06:00.169> that<00:06:00.530> doesn't<00:06:00.710> have<00:06:00.919> an<00:06:01.040> unlocked

bootloader<00:06:02.419> it<00:06:02.660> isn't<00:06:03.020> rooted<00:06:04.150> you<00:06:05.150> can<00:06:05.300> go

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
bootloader it isn't rooted you can go

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.030 
bootloader it isn't rooted you can go
ahead<00:06:05.510> and<00:06:05.780> do<00:06:06.050> this<00:06:06.200> process<00:06:06.770> and<00:06:06.919> it<00:06:07.010> does

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
ahead and do this process and it does

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.530 
ahead and do this process and it does
everything<00:06:07.370> for<00:06:07.880> you<00:06:08.000> it<00:06:08.120> unlock<00:06:08.390> the

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
bootloader it routes your device and it

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.110 
bootloader it routes your device and it
installs<00:06:11.419> CyanogenMod<00:06:12.050> so<00:06:12.530> at<00:06:12.860> this<00:06:13.070> point<00:06:13.460> I

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
installs CyanogenMod so at this point I

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.909 
installs CyanogenMod so at this point I
could<00:06:14.630> in<00:06:14.750> fact<00:06:14.780> even<00:06:15.169> just<00:06:15.470> go<00:06:15.650> ahead<00:06:15.740> and

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
could in fact even just go ahead and

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.310 
could in fact even just go ahead and
click<00:06:16.070> on<00:06:16.160> the<00:06:16.280> exit<00:06:16.640> button<00:06:16.850> and<00:06:17.210> then<00:06:18.080> I<00:06:18.110> can

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
click on the exit button and then I can

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.590 
click on the exit button and then I can
even<00:06:18.470> go<00:06:18.650> ahead<00:06:18.860> and<00:06:19.070> unplug<00:06:19.490> my<00:06:19.700> device<00:06:20.000> now

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
even go ahead and unplug my device now
