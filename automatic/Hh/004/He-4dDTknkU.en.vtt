first rayman games back in the day and i

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
you're a fan of Rayman I think this game

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.050 
you're a fan of Rayman I think this game
does<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> justice<00:01:55.229> but<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.890> course<00:01:56.159> $60<00:01:56.880> is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
does do it justice but of course $60 is

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.450 
does do it justice but of course $60 is
quite<00:01:57.270> expensive<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:58.049> 2d<00:01:58.409> platformer<00:01:59.009> if

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
quite expensive for a 2d platformer if

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.980 
quite expensive for a 2d platformer if
you<00:01:59.579> really<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.969> Rayman<00:02:00.390> go<00:02:00.600> ahead<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.869> buy

part as you can see it is a Ubisoft game

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.430 
part as you can see it is a Ubisoft game
Ubisoft<00:02:28.890> tends<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.459> drop<00:02:29.610> its<00:02:29.850> titles<00:02:30.440> prices

Ubisoft tends to drop its titles prices

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.940 
Ubisoft tends to drop its titles prices
quite<00:02:32.100> drastically<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.030> fast<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.200> if<00:02:34.470> there's

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
quite drastically and fast so if there's

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.410 
quite drastically and fast so if there's
not<00:02:35.069> if<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.580> not<00:02:35.790> high<00:02:36.030> on<00:02:36.150> your<00:02:36.239> priority

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
not if this is not high on your priority

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.630 
not if this is not high on your priority
list<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:37.080> suggest<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.530> wait<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:38.430> if

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640

it's probably not gonna sell it that
well<00:02:45.450> but<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:46.709> think<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.010> true<00:02:47.160> fans<00:02:47.400> are<00:02:47.580> gonna

well but I think the true fans are gonna
let<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.930> know<00:02:48.959> keep<00:02:49.230> its<00:02:49.410> head<00:02:49.530> held<00:02:49.709> high
