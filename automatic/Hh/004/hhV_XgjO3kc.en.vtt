00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
heading to the master bedroom I really

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.580 
heading to the master bedroom I really
had<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.220> hard<00:02:56.459> time<00:02:56.579> come<00:02:57.090> up<00:02:57.120> with<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.590> color

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
had a hard time come up with a color

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.759 
had a hard time come up with a color
theme<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.340> one<00:02:59.579> so<00:03:00.419> I<00:03:00.810> went<00:03:01.139> with<00:03:01.349> my<00:03:01.380> old

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
theme for this one so I went with my old

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.699 
theme for this one so I went with my old
standard<00:03:02.280> blue<00:03:02.609> and<00:03:02.940> yes<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> favorite

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
standard blue and yes that is a favorite

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.180 
standard blue and yes that is a favorite
color<00:03:04.919> of<00:03:05.069> mine<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:06.319> I<00:03:07.319> think<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:07.919> turned<00:03:08.099> out

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
color of mine and I think it turned out

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.930 
color of mine and I think it turned out
okay<00:03:08.599> so<00:03:09.919> next<00:03:10.919> we'll<00:03:11.099> be<00:03:11.160> heading<00:03:11.250> into<00:03:11.639> the
