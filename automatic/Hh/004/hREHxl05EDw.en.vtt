00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 and getting married in itself is not something very 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.519
 rational but there are cultures that make 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.320
 this ceremony something more bizarre and weird 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.030
 today in the break pm we will teach you the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.379
 Craziest wedding rituals 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.330
 many women cry at the altar 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.400
 normally because they realize the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.140
 foolishness that they will do but in the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.900
 Tuya village in China there is a ritual 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.140
 that forces brides to cry 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.080
 how 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.040

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.040
 days before the wedding 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.760

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.610
 after 10 days of crying alone joins 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.280

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.210
 Grandmother will surely be watching 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.210
 under the same star 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.410
 for them, tears do not mean 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.910
 sadness but joy for the wedding like this 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.840

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.739
