Subarus as well I have owned three or
four<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.120> them<00:02:18.209> they<00:02:18.480> were<00:02:18.540> all<00:02:18.720> really

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
four of them they were all really

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.020 
four of them they were all really
awesome<00:02:19.170> cars<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.310> don't<00:02:20.520> know<00:02:20.580> if<00:02:20.670> that's<00:02:20.820> a

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
awesome cars so I don't know if that's a

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.180 
awesome cars so I don't know if that's a
coincidence<00:02:21.660> or<00:02:22.200> what<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:24.350> medians<00:02:25.350> are<00:02:25.650> not

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
coincidence or what the medians are not

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.750 
coincidence or what the medians are not
third<00:02:26.700> dimensional<00:02:27.920> entities<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.459> would<00:02:29.610> not

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
third dimensional entities you would not

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.790 
third dimensional entities you would not
from<00:02:30.330> what<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.480> understand<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.020> would<00:02:31.170> not<00:02:31.350> run

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
from what I understand you would not run

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.850 
from what I understand you would not run
into<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> Pleiadian<00:02:32.900> in<00:02:33.900> physical<00:02:34.380> form<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
into a Pleiadian in physical form and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.620 
into a Pleiadian in physical form and
walk<00:02:34.980> up<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.280> them<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.489> shake<00:02:35.820> their<00:02:35.970> hand<00:02:36.239> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
walk up to them and shake their hand the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.890 
walk up to them and shake their hand the
Pleiadians<00:02:36.870> are<00:02:37.320> fifth<00:02:37.650> dimensional<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.900> so

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
Pleiadians are fifth dimensional and so

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.190 
Pleiadians are fifth dimensional and so
they<00:02:40.140> are<00:02:40.760> broadcasting<00:02:41.760> their<00:02:41.970> message<00:02:42.390> from
