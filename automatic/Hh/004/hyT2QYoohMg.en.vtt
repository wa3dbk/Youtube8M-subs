that would be very very uncomfortable
for<00:02:38.250> me<00:02:38.540> sitting<00:02:39.540> here<00:02:39.870> with<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.290> with<00:02:40.590> the

things you can do you can either just

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.809 
things you can do you can either just
fish<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.110> one<00:02:49.260> rod<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.920> one<00:02:50.310> side<00:02:50.549> of<00:02:50.580> the

fish the one rod on one side of the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.619 
fish the one rod on one side of the
kayak<00:02:52.190> that's<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.370> site<00:02:53.580> going<00:02:54.120> going<00:02:54.480> with

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
kayak that's the site going going with

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.970 
kayak that's the site going going with
the<00:02:54.720> direction<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.260> tide<00:02:56.569> or<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.860> other

the direction of the tide or the other

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.460 
the direction of the tide or the other
thing<00:02:59.129> you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.430> do<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.879> you<00:03:00.330> can<00:03:00.510> fish<00:03:00.930> I've

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
thing you can do is you can fish I've

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.860 
thing you can do is you can fish I've
got<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> second<00:03:02.069> rod<00:03:02.670> hold<00:03:02.909> it<00:03:03.060> here<00:03:03.299> what<00:03:03.840> I

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
got a second rod hold it here what I

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.149 
got a second rod hold it here what I
could<00:03:04.170> do<00:03:04.409> like<00:03:05.129> it<00:03:05.569> fish<00:03:06.569> two<00:03:07.200> rods<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.769> one

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
could do like it fish two rods on one

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.259 
could do like it fish two rods on one
side<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.640> kayak<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:10.400> both<00:03:11.400> lines<00:03:11.760> will<00:03:12.150> be

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
side of the kayak and both lines will be

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.809 
side of the kayak and both lines will be
going<00:03:12.450> with<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.870> direction<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.440> tide<00:03:13.819> but

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
going with the direction the tide but

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.729 
going with the direction the tide but
that's<00:03:15.209> fine<00:03:15.540> from<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.079> fishing<00:03:16.260> port<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.650> it

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
that's fine from a fishing port of it

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.800 
that's fine from a fishing port of it
but<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:16.950> doesn't<00:03:17.129> count<00:03:17.910> rate<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.359> problem

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
but it doesn't count rate the problem

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.920 
but it doesn't count rate the problem
that<00:03:18.989> if<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:19.920> was<00:03:20.099> a<00:03:20.160> bit<00:03:20.370> more<00:03:20.609> choppy<00:03:20.970> how

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
that if this was a bit more choppy how

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.599 
that if this was a bit more choppy how
uncomfortable<00:03:22.319> that<00:03:22.590> would<00:03:22.859> be<00:03:23.010> for<00:03:23.280> me<00:03:23.310> would

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
uncomfortable that would be for me would

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.119 
uncomfortable that would be for me would
it<00:03:23.730> were<00:03:23.879> there<00:03:24.420> with<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.500> swell<00:03:25.769> hitting

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
it were there with the the swell hitting

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.369 
it were there with the the swell hitting
me<00:03:26.280> from<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.609> side<00:03:26.819> so<00:03:27.209> what<00:03:28.079> I'm<00:03:28.200> gonna

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
me from the side so what I'm gonna

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.460 
me from the side so what I'm gonna
demonstrate<00:03:28.920> is<00:03:29.629> the<00:03:30.629> effectiveness<00:03:31.109> of

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
demonstrate is the effectiveness of

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.520 
demonstrate is the effectiveness of
using<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.159> drogue<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.390> drift<00:03:33.659> chute<00:03:33.930> to

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
using the the drogue the drift chute to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.229 
using the the drogue the drift chute to
try<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:34.859> counteract<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.549> wind<00:03:35.730> over<00:03:35.909> tides

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
try and counteract the wind over tides

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.080 
try and counteract the wind over tides
situation<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:38.340> I've<00:03:38.430> got<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.730> anchor

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
situation so I've got the anchor

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.089 
situation so I've got the anchor
deployed<00:03:39.450> at<00:03:39.629> the<00:03:39.659> stern<00:03:40.019> are<00:03:40.409> on<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:40.920> main

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
deployed at the stern are on the main

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.039 
deployed at the stern are on the main
anchor<00:03:41.430> trolley<00:03:41.700> which<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.329> located<00:03:42.690> on<00:03:42.900> the

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
anchor trolley which is located on the

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.899 
anchor trolley which is located on the
right<00:03:43.230> hand<00:03:43.260> side<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.890> kayak<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.760> what

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
right hand side of the kayak and what

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.399 
right hand side of the kayak and what
I've<00:03:45.000> got<00:03:45.180> I've<00:03:45.269> got<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.480> half<00:03:45.750> anchor<00:03:46.140> trolley

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
I've got I've got a half anchor trolley

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.569 
I've got I've got a half anchor trolley
on<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:48.390> other<00:03:48.420> side<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.959> kayak<00:03:49.579> so

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
on the the other side of the kayak so

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.240 
on the the other side of the kayak so
what<00:03:50.700> I'm<00:03:50.790> going<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:50.970> do<00:03:51.150> I'm<00:03:51.930> gonna<00:03:52.250> deploy

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
what I'm going to do I'm gonna deploy

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.180 
what I'm going to do I'm gonna deploy
the<00:03:53.780> drift<00:03:54.780> chute<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.169> drogue<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.769> maneuver

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
the drift chute the drogue and maneuver

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.589 
the drift chute the drogue and maneuver
that<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.569> bow<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.989> kayak<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:59.510> what<00:04:00.510> it

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
that to the bow of the kayak and what it

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.409 
that to the bow of the kayak and what it
will<00:04:00.720> do<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.709> will<00:04:01.859> pick<00:04:02.129> up<00:04:02.280> it'll<00:04:03.120> pick<00:04:03.299> up

will do it will pick up it'll pick up

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.059 
will do it will pick up it'll pick up
the<00:04:03.569> tide<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.230> hopefully<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.950> will

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
the tide and hopefully that will

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.030 
the tide and hopefully that will
demonstrate<00:04:06.079> it<00:04:07.079> pulling<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.620> starting<00:04:07.980> to

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
demonstrate it pulling the starting to

demonstrate it pulling the starting to
pull<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.459> will<00:04:08.549> pull<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.879> bow<00:04:09.470> of<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.620> kayak

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
pull it will pull the bow of the kayak

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.860 
pull it will pull the bow of the kayak
around<00:04:11.280> more<00:04:11.669> into<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.239> direction<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
starting to pick up the tide now and it

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:50.220 
starting to pick up the tide now and it
will<00:04:26.099> slowly<00:04:26.370> start<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.910> open

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.070 

okay<00:04:50.920> it's<00:04:51.130> opening<00:04:51.490> up<00:04:51.640> now<00:04:51.940> it's<00:04:52.750> starting

starting to pull the bow of the kayak
I'm<00:04:59.830> hoping<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:00.400> can<00:05:00.460> see<00:05:00.760> that<00:05:01.470> it'll<00:05:02.470> slowly

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
I'm hoping you can see that it'll slowly

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.030 
I'm hoping you can see that it'll slowly
pull<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.310> around<00:05:04.230> more<00:05:05.230> into<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.770> direction

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
pull it around more into the direction

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:17.350 
pull it around more into the direction
of<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.430> tide<00:05:07.800> swinging<00:05:08.800> round<00:05:08.980> now

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.780 

okay<00:05:18.360> brilliant<00:05:18.570> so<00:05:19.320> now<00:05:19.560> what<00:05:19.830> I've<00:05:19.950> got<00:05:20.190> with

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
okay brilliant so now what I've got with

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.280 
okay brilliant so now what I've got with
the<00:05:20.910> drift<00:05:21.150> shoe<00:05:21.420> the<00:05:21.630> anchor<00:05:21.930> I've<00:05:22.020> got<00:05:22.170> the

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
the drift shoe the anchor I've got the

anchor<00:05:22.710> now<00:05:24.620> let<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.740> stern<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:28.080> I've<00:05:28.290> got

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
anchor now let the stern and I've got

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.760 
anchor now let the stern and I've got
the<00:05:28.710> drift<00:05:29.370> shoot<00:05:29.670> at<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:30.630> bow<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:31.590> what

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
the drift shoot at the bow and what

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.430 
the drift shoot at the bow and what
that's<00:05:32.010> that's<00:05:32.460> done<00:05:32.790> it's<00:05:32.970> now<00:05:33.090> pulled<00:05:33.480> my

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
that's that's done it's now pulled my

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.370 
that's that's done it's now pulled my
bow<00:05:34.940> in<00:05:35.940> in<00:05:37.040> in<00:05:38.040> the<00:05:38.250> same<00:05:38.760> direction<00:05:38.940> as<00:05:39.330> the

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
bow in in in the same direction as the

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.700 
bow in in in the same direction as the
tide<00:05:40.380> and<00:05:41.060> into<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.210> into<00:05:42.870> the<00:05:42.960> breeze<00:05:43.290> into

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
tide and into the into the breeze into

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.490 
tide and into the into the breeze into
the<00:05:43.800> swell<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:44.880> means<00:05:45.210> that<00:05:45.570> is<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:46.140> can

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
the swell and that means that is I can

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.800 
the swell and that means that is I can
much<00:05:46.980> much<00:05:47.190> more<00:05:47.370> comfortable<00:05:47.850> for<00:05:48.090> me<00:05:48.150> to

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
much much more comfortable for me to

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.290 
much much more comfortable for me to
fish<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.800> two<00:05:50.040> rods<00:05:50.340> one<00:05:50.700> each<00:05:50.820> side<00:05:51.060> of<00:05:51.210> the

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
fish the two rods one each side of the

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.990 
fish the two rods one each side of the
kayak<00:05:51.570> and<00:05:52.230> both<00:05:52.500> lines<00:05:52.830> will<00:05:53.220> go<00:05:53.430> down<00:05:53.760> down

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
kayak and both lines will go down down

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.790 
kayak and both lines will go down down
tied<00:05:54.800> down<00:05:55.800> tie<00:05:56.040> beautifully<00:05:57.680> there's<00:05:58.680> only

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
tied down tie beautifully there's only

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.530 
tied down tie beautifully there's only
one<00:05:59.010> thing<00:05:59.280> I<00:05:59.460> will<00:05:59.910> say<00:05:59.940> you've<00:06:00.330> got<00:06:00.420> to<00:06:00.510> be

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
one thing I will say you've got to be

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.430 
one thing I will say you've got to be
slightly<00:06:00.780> careful<00:06:00.960> of<00:06:01.530> if<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.730> if<00:06:03.660> the<00:06:03.810> drift

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
slightly careful of if the if the drift

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.680 
slightly careful of if the if the drift
chute<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:04.950> diameter<00:06:05.730> of<00:06:05.760> the<00:06:05.940> drogue<00:06:06.480> the

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
chute the diameter of the drogue the

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.970 
chute the diameter of the drogue the
drift<00:06:06.930> chute<00:06:07.610> is<00:06:08.610> quite<00:06:09.180> wide<00:06:09.930> what<00:06:10.650> can

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
drift chute is quite wide what can

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.570 
drift chute is quite wide what can
happen<00:06:11.930> it<00:06:12.930> can<00:06:13.350> depend<00:06:13.800> on<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.220> strength<00:06:14.400> of

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
happen it can depend on the strength of

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.290 
happen it can depend on the strength of
the<00:06:14.640> tide<00:06:14.910> it<00:06:15.570> can<00:06:15.930> start<00:06:16.290> pulling<00:06:16.530> the<00:06:16.770> anchor

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
the tide it can start pulling the anchor

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.870 
the tide it can start pulling the anchor
so<00:06:18.300> what<00:06:18.480> I<00:06:18.510> do<00:06:18.630> I<00:06:18.840> carry<00:06:19.320> your<00:06:19.620> to<00:06:19.860> drogues<00:06:20.640> to

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
so what I do I carry your to drogues to

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.480 
so what I do I carry your to drogues to
drift<00:06:21.150> shoes<00:06:21.360> one<00:06:22.140> with<00:06:22.410> a<00:06:22.440> with<00:06:23.070> a<00:06:23.100> much<00:06:23.310> much

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
drift shoes one with a with a much much

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.400 
drift shoes one with a with a much much
smaller<00:06:23.670> diameter<00:06:24.480> so<00:06:24.960> I<00:06:24.990> forget<00:06:25.260> that

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
smaller diameter so I forget that

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.120 
smaller diameter so I forget that
situation<00:06:26.190> I<00:06:26.520> can<00:06:26.940> deploy<00:06:27.240> that<00:06:27.270> I<00:06:27.870> have<00:06:28.860> less

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
situation I can deploy that I have less

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.620 
situation I can deploy that I have less
pull<00:06:29.460> but<00:06:29.700> it<00:06:29.790> would<00:06:29.880> be<00:06:29.940> enough<00:06:30.150> pull<00:06:30.420> to<00:06:30.450> pull

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
pull but it would be enough pull to pull

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.040 
pull but it would be enough pull to pull
the<00:06:31.440> bow<00:06:31.650> or<00:06:31.830> the<00:06:31.860> kayak<00:06:32.630> into<00:06:33.630> the<00:06:33.870> direction

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
the bow or the kayak into the direction

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.670 
the bow or the kayak into the direction
of<00:06:34.320> tide<00:06:34.560> without<00:06:35.190> tripping<00:06:35.700> the<00:06:35.730> anchor<00:06:36.680> okay

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
of tide without tripping the anchor okay

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.370 
of tide without tripping the anchor okay
so<00:06:37.860> that's<00:06:38.160> just<00:06:39.030> a<00:06:39.240> demonstration<00:06:39.600> there<00:06:40.260> of

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
so that's just a demonstration there of

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.470 
so that's just a demonstration there of
a<00:06:40.470> wind<00:06:40.650> over<00:06:40.770> tie<00:06:41.070> situation<00:06:41.370> and<00:06:42.090> the

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
a wind over tie situation and the

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.880 
a wind over tie situation and the
difference<00:06:42.780> things<00:06:43.020> you<00:06:43.200> can<00:06:43.350> do<00:06:43.530> to<00:06:43.680> try<00:06:43.830> and

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
difference things you can do to try and

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.670 
difference things you can do to try and
counteract<00:06:44.430> that<00:06:44.750> as<00:06:45.750> I<00:06:45.870> say<00:06:46.080> now

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
counteract that as I say now

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.320 
counteract that as I say now
rather<00:06:47.040> than<00:06:47.280> me<00:06:48.030> being<00:06:48.270> uncomfortable<00:06:49.080> with

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
rather than me being uncomfortable with

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.720 
rather than me being uncomfortable with
the<00:06:51.330> swell<00:06:51.870> hit<00:06:52.110> me<00:06:52.260> broadside<00:06:52.770> I've<00:06:53.370> got<00:06:53.580> my

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.730 
the swell hit me broadside I've got my

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.230 
the swell hit me broadside I've got my
bow

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
bow

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.020 
bow
pulled<00:06:54.840> nicely<00:06:55.350> in<00:06:55.500> into<00:06:55.950> that<00:06:55.980> now<00:06:56.310> and<00:06:56.880> it's

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
pulled nicely in into that now and it's

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.000 
pulled nicely in into that now and it's
much<00:06:57.180> more<00:06:57.210> comfortable<00:06:57.420> to<00:06:57.930> fish<00:06:58.500> a<00:06:58.530> more<00:06:58.830> cut

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
much more comfortable to fish a more cut

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.880 
much more comfortable to fish a more cut
more<00:06:59.220> easy<00:06:59.430> to<00:06:59.580> fish<00:06:59.730> two<00:06:59.970> rods<00:07:00.320> so<00:07:01.320> thanks<00:07:01.800> for

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:01.890 
more easy to fish two rods so thanks for

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.300 
more easy to fish two rods so thanks for
watching<00:07:02.250> and<00:07:02.430> hope<00:07:02.640> you<00:07:02.760> found<00:07:02.910> that<00:07:03.060> useful
