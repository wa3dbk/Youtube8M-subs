00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
here we kind of lucky out there's

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.810 
here we kind of lucky out there's
another<00:02:06.150> kind<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.690> player<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.740> my<00:02:08.340> tune<00:02:08.580> that's

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
another kind of player to my tune that's

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.010 
another kind of player to my tune that's
somewhat<00:02:09.810> decent<00:02:10.700> but<00:02:11.720> pretty<00:02:12.720> much<00:02:12.840> if

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
somewhat decent but pretty much if

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.230 
somewhat decent but pretty much if
you're<00:02:13.170> running<00:02:13.350> solo<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.940> know<00:02:15.060> your

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
you're running solo and you know your

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.460 
you're running solo and you know your
other<00:02:15.420> teammates<00:02:15.720> aren't<00:02:16.140> at<00:02:16.320> least

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
other teammates aren't at least

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.470 
other teammates aren't at least
experienced<00:02:17.010> with<00:02:17.160> mics<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.700> you're<00:02:18.180> against

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
experienced with mics and you're against

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.810 
experienced with mics and you're against
a<00:02:18.510> team<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:19.020> arranged<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.730> I'm

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
a team that's arranged you know I'm

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.760 
a team that's arranged you know I'm
flying<00:02:21.270> together<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:22.140> will<00:02:22.260> most<00:02:22.530> likely

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
flying together you will most likely

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.760 
flying together you will most likely
lose<00:02:23.100> almost<00:02:23.670> every<00:02:24.300> single<00:02:24.600> time<00:02:24.810> just

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
lose almost every single time just

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.620 
lose almost every single time just
because<00:02:26.070> if<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.940> know<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.270> lot<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.480> your

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
because if you know a lot of your

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.750 
because if you know a lot of your
teammates<00:02:27.840> run<00:02:28.200> solo<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.100> share<00:02:29.400> team

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
teammates run solo and you share team

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.580 
teammates run solo and you share team
lives<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.540> you're<00:02:30.660> not<00:02:30.750> working<00:02:31.050> with<00:02:31.440> each

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
lives so if you're not working with each

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.770 
lives so if you're not working with each
other<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:31.980> communicating<00:02:32.670> there's<00:02:33.510> always

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
other and communicating there's always

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.420 
other and communicating there's always
one<00:02:33.959> or<00:02:34.110> two<00:02:34.230> people<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.860> takes<00:02:35.130> like

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
one or two people that just takes like

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.270 
one or two people that just takes like
half<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.060> key<00:02:36.330> deaths<00:02:36.660> away<00:02:36.989> which<00:02:37.980> really

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
half of the key deaths away which really

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.820 
half of the key deaths away which really
sucks<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.959> know<00:02:40.080> if<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.410> other<00:02:40.440> teams

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
sucks and you know if the other teams

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.460 
sucks and you know if the other teams
you<00:02:41.640> know<00:02:41.670> getting<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.600> right<00:02:42.780> angles<00:02:43.290> and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
you know getting the right angles and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.080 
you know getting the right angles and
flanking<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.250> sticking<00:02:44.580> together<00:02:44.700> it's

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
flanking you and sticking together it's

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.970 
flanking you and sticking together it's
very<00:02:45.330> hard<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.630> counter<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.140> when<00:02:46.680> it's<00:02:46.830> like

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
very hard to counter that when it's like

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.630 
very hard to counter that when it's like
just<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.610> trying<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.300> like<00:02:48.480> get<00:02:48.780> out<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.110> that

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
just you trying to like get out of that

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.970 
just you trying to like get out of that
so<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.540> really<00:02:52.080> recommend<00:02:52.110> playing<00:02:52.800> this

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
so so I really recommend playing this

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.470 
so so I really recommend playing this
with<00:02:53.100> friends<00:02:53.580> or<00:02:53.670> at<00:02:53.790> least<00:02:53.940> trying<00:02:54.239> to

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
with friends or at least trying to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.199 
with friends or at least trying to
arrange<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.080> team<00:02:55.320> once<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.190> get<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.550> good<00:02:56.760> just

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
arrange a team once you get in good just

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.720 
arrange a team once you get in good just
so<00:02:57.360> just<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.590> have<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.739> better<00:02:58.920> chance<00:02:59.010> that

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
so just so you have a better chance that

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.940 
so just so you have a better chance that
that<00:02:59.910> would<00:03:00.030> be<00:03:00.060> my<00:03:00.300> advice<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.870> mean<00:03:01.560> obviously

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
that would be my advice I mean obviously

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.199 
that would be my advice I mean obviously
you<00:03:02.100> know<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:02.310> you're<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> good<00:03:02.640> player<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:03.090> can

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
you know if you're a good player you can

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.970 
you know if you're a good player you can
still<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:03.870> still<00:03:04.080> kick<00:03:04.290> some<00:03:04.440> ass<00:03:04.590> but

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
still you can still kick some ass but

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.520 
still you can still kick some ass but
it's<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:06.060> little<00:03:06.300> more<00:03:06.420> tricky<00:03:06.690> than<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.200> Call

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
it's a little more tricky than like Call

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.190 
it's a little more tricky than like Call
of<00:03:07.560> Duty<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.700> know<00:03:09.030> with<00:03:09.570> kill<00:03:09.810> streaks<00:03:10.080> and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.390 
time around the first two games i joined
was<00:03:45.030> like<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.360> middle<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.780> match<00:03:45.959> and

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
was like in the middle of the match and

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.979 
was like in the middle of the match and
we<00:03:47.400> were<00:03:47.519> getting<00:03:47.760> spawn<00:03:48.090> camps<00:03:48.540> from<00:03:48.810> like

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
we were getting spawn camps from like

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.690 
we were getting spawn camps from like
right<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.410> beginning<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:50.010> pretty<00:03:50.579> much

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
right in the beginning so pretty much

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.789 
right in the beginning so pretty much
you<00:03:50.910> would<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.180> spawn<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.870> die<00:03:51.930> within<00:03:52.530> like

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
you would just spawn and die within like

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.610 
you would just spawn and die within like
two<00:03:53.070> seconds<00:03:53.549> in<00:03:54.390> this<00:03:54.630> game<00:03:54.810> there's<00:03:55.380> only

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
two seconds in this game there's only

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.759 
two seconds in this game there's only
two<00:03:56.040> spots<00:03:56.700> on<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.600> map<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:58.260> your<00:03:58.500> team

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
two spots on the map that your team

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.199 
two spots on the map that your team
spawns<00:03:59.190> at<00:03:59.459> they're<00:03:59.670> both<00:03:59.790> kind<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.060> like

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
spawns at they're both kind of like

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.509 
spawns at they're both kind of like
opposite<00:04:00.750> sides<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.380> then<00:04:01.829> for<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.220> enemy

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
opposite sides and then for the enemy

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.009 
opposite sides and then for the enemy
team<00:04:02.670> they're<00:04:03.000> like<00:04:03.150> at<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.420> other<00:04:03.540> corners

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
team they're like at the other corners

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.699 
team they're like at the other corners

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
so if you're against an arranged team

that<00:05:05.750> they<00:05:05.870> do<00:05:06.250> otherwise<00:05:07.250> that<00:05:07.759> could<00:05:07.880> be

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
that they do otherwise that could be

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.060 
that they do otherwise that could be
that<00:05:08.270> could<00:05:08.599> really<00:05:08.810> suck<00:05:08.930> for<00:05:09.410> death<00:05:09.830> match

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
that could really suck for death match

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.040 
that could really suck for death match
although<00:05:10.759> I<00:05:10.789> do<00:05:10.910> like<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:11.210> death<00:05:11.509> match<00:05:11.720> style

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050
