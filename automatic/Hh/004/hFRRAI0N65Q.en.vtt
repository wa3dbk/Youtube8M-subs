 the manager did not see anything for about five years 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.950
 after plants 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.470
 the last hour there they gather everyone hugged so it's a tiny little shoot 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.590
 the match that took you looking for 5 years 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.430
 all the growth of the game this month 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.000
 this freedom 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.190
 invisible to our homes 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.570
 others plus the reform did not watch the tape prose structure 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.829
 was most viewed 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.360
 which extended from this total we prioritize increases by land 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.510
 and below it is being built in question 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.180
 I want a point 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.330
 at the end of the fifth year the Chinese bamboo added until reaching heights 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.630

 and a lot when you look at the academic reception babble 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.490
 there are many things nothing 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.590
 personal and professional life and are already equal to this new team 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.590
 ps if those who dress well harmonize this effort 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.230
 - everything goes doing everything there would not grow - your son of yours 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.810
 life 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.860
 and maybe 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.330
 but you do not see anything a week 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.680
 merits 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.929
 years seeing those things 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.929
 the latter and more receive patients if I continue to work 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:14.729

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.459
 patience 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.530
 because everyone deserves to reach their dreams 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.530
 but it takes a lot of fiber to reach the heights 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.590
 and at the same time 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.249
 a lot of flexibility, huh? 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:19.309
 to be able to withstand the storms that happen 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.189

 I have locations. 

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:03.829
 the craft has lines
