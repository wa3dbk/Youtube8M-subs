percent<00:01:53.070> damage<00:01:53.430> reduction<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.360> is

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
percent damage reduction and it is

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.800 
percent damage reduction and it is
actually<00:01:54.860> reflected<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.509> shoot<00:01:57.509> damage

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
reduction here is kind of like this you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.560 
reduction here is kind of like this you
can<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.640> plus<00:01:59.969> fifty<00:02:00.360> four

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
can see like this plus fifty four

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.200 
can see like this plus fifty four
percent<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.590> reason<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.860> say<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.790> reason<00:02:02.909> says

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
percent the reason I say the reason says

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.700 
percent the reason I say the reason says
plus<00:02:03.450> fifty<00:02:03.689> four<00:02:03.869> percent<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:04.590> i'm

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
plus fifty four percent is because i'm

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.960 
plus fifty four percent is because i'm
also<00:02:04.979> using<00:02:05.159> from<00:02:05.579> fortitude

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
also using from fortitude

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.960 
also using from fortitude
in<00:02:07.600> this<00:02:07.720> case<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:09.100> they<00:02:09.399> are<00:02:09.550> all<00:02:09.670> kind<00:02:09.940> of

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
in this case and they are all kind of

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.640 
in this case and they are all kind of
multiplicative<00:02:10.450> with<00:02:10.810> each<00:02:10.930> other<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.230> it's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
multiplicative with each other so it's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.180 
multiplicative with each other so it's
not<00:02:11.830> like<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:13.150> know<00:02:13.240> 83<00:02:13.780> +<00:02:14.050> 47<00:02:14.680> now<00:02:15.660> and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
not like you know 83 + 47 now and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.590 
not like you know 83 + 47 now and
because<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.250> said<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.550> put<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.880> above<00:02:19.000> 100<00:02:19.480> now

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
because I said I put you above 100 now

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.030 
because I said I put you above 100 now
it's<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:19.870> forty<00:02:20.200> seven<00:02:20.470> percent<00:02:20.500> of

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
it's like forty seven percent of

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.800 
it's like forty seven percent of
whatever<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.400> left<00:02:21.640> over<00:02:21.760> from<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.180> 83<00:02:22.600> that's

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
whatever is left over from the 83 that's

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.440 
whatever is left over from the 83 that's
kind<00:02:22.990> of<00:02:23.020> how<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.260> works<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:25.060> six<00:02:25.270> piece

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
kind of how that works and the six piece

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.970 
kind of how that works and the six piece
bonus<00:02:25.690> is<00:02:25.930> what's<00:02:26.110> really<00:02:26.410> good<00:02:26.590> it's<00:02:26.800> what

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
bonus is what's really good it's what

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.350 
bonus is what's really good it's what
makes<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.310> strong<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:27.670> enemies<00:02:27.940> hit<00:02:28.090> by<00:02:28.210> your

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
makes it strong so enemies hit by your

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.110 
makes it strong so enemies hit by your
mana<00:02:28.510> spenders<00:02:28.990> take<00:02:29.710> 275<00:02:30.430> percent<00:02:30.940> more

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
mana spenders take 275 percent more

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.910 
mana spenders take 275 percent more
damage<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.690> it's<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:32.580> 3.75<00:02:33.580> times<00:02:33.970> multiplier

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
damage so it's a 3.75 times multiplier

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.560 
damage so it's a 3.75 times multiplier
from<00:02:35.920> your<00:02:36.040> pets<00:02:36.250> for<00:02:36.460> four<00:02:36.670> seconds<00:02:37.180> which

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
from your pets for four seconds which

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.090 
from your pets for four seconds which
means<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:37.930> kind<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.140> have<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.290> spam<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.650> spender

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
means you kind of have to spam a spender

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.560 
means you kind of have to spam a spender
and<00:02:39.310> there<00:02:39.730> are<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.060> lot<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.450> different

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
and there are a lot of different

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.540 
and there are a lot of different
opinions<00:02:41.110> on<00:02:41.200> what<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.500> should<00:02:41.650> use<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:42.190> prefer

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
make sure that as many targets as

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.650 
make sure that as many targets as
possible<00:02:55.080> are<00:02:56.080> taking<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.770> damage<00:02:57.190> and

not hitting the maximum amount of
targets<00:05:12.190> so<00:05:12.340> what<00:05:12.520> you<00:05:12.610> want<00:05:12.760> to<00:05:12.820> make<00:05:12.910> sure

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
targets so what you want to make sure

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.790 
targets so what you want to make sure
that<00:05:13.120> you<00:05:13.300> do<00:05:13.510> is<00:05:13.780> that<00:05:13.960> your<00:05:14.050> final<00:05:14.290> targets

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
that you do is that your final targets

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.520 
that you do is that your final targets
and<00:05:14.920> best<00:05:15.070> way<00:05:15.190> to<00:05:15.220> do<00:05:15.370> that<00:05:15.400> is<00:05:15.550> in<00:05:16.230> those<00:05:17.230> maps

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
and best way to do that is in those maps

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.520 
and best way to do that is in those maps
that<00:05:17.740> are<00:05:17.800> crappy<00:05:18.250> for<00:05:19.050> other<00:05:20.050> class<00:05:20.320> and

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530

that are crappy for other class and
other<00:05:20.650> specs<00:05:21.040> which<00:05:21.220> are<00:05:21.370> those<00:05:21.460> like<00:05:21.640> narrow

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
other specs which are those like narrow

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.870
