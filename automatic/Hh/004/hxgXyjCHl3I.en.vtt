00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
grenades and they really weren't that

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.979 
grenades and they really weren't that
great<00:01:02.190> at<00:01:02.579> healing<00:01:03.300> since<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> took<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:03.960> long

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
great at healing since it took so long

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
basically just life leeching enemies to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.470 
basically just life leeching enemies to
death<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.820> don't<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.300> really

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
death that you don't have to really

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.440 
death that you don't have to really
worry<00:02:55.200> too<00:02:55.320> much<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.180> then<00:02:57.180> there's<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
worry too much and then there's the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.420 
worry too much and then there's the
other<00:02:57.480> side<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:57.959> say<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.740> know<00:02:58.860> well<00:02:59.190> I

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
other side that say you know well I

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.699

don't like using life leech but the

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.190 
don't like using life leech but the
damage<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.190> too<00:03:02.459> high<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:03.030> can't<00:03:03.690> deal<00:03:03.990> with<00:03:04.020> it

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
damage is too high I can't deal with it

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.470 
damage is too high I can't deal with it
I<00:03:04.500> mean<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.950> there<00:03:05.610> are<00:03:05.640> those<00:03:05.880> who<00:03:06.030> say<00:03:06.209> well

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
I mean and there are those who say well

without any life leech and that that is

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.900 
without any life leech and that that is
true<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.510> possible<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.769> go<00:03:14.130> through<00:03:14.160> say

doing it without likely to just makes it

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.620 
doing it without likely to just makes it

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
less frustrating to do it with life

less frustrating to do it with life
leech<00:03:39.900> rather<00:03:40.290> than<00:03:40.500> without<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.130> if<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:41.850> had

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
leech rather than without and if I had

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.900 
leech rather than without and if I had
just<00:03:42.299> been<00:03:42.900> alive<00:03:43.440> for<00:03:43.680> just<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.950> second<00:03:44.430> longer

just been alive for just a second longer
the<00:03:45.390> nomads<00:03:45.750> hit<00:03:46.019> right<00:03:46.230> there<00:03:46.260> would<00:03:46.950> not

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
the nomads hit right there would not

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.979 
the nomads hit right there would not
have<00:03:47.400> down<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.790> me<00:03:47.850> because<00:03:48.180> life<00:03:48.420> leech<00:03:48.690> would

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
have down to me because life leech would

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.800 
have down to me because life leech would
have<00:03:49.230> healed<00:03:50.040> me<00:03:50.220> enough<00:03:50.459> from<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.360> damage

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
have healed me enough from the damage

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.920 
have healed me enough from the damage
over<00:03:52.110> time<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:53.060> this<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.209> another<00:03:54.480> reason

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
over time and this is another reason

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.500 
over time and this is another reason
that<00:03:54.959> I<00:03:55.230> like<00:03:55.739> life<00:03:56.190> leech<00:03:56.519> is<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.360> gives

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
that I like life leech is that it gives

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.060 
that I like life leech is that it gives
damage<00:03:58.080> over<00:03:58.380> time<00:03:58.590> in<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.860> harder

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
damage over time in the harder

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.280 
damage over time in the harder

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
burn enemies up in you know a couple of

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.490 
burn enemies up in you know a couple of
seconds<00:04:26.420> because<00:04:26.630> he<00:04:26.720> has<00:04:26.840> such<00:04:27.080> high<00:04:27.290> dot

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
seconds because he has such high dot

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.710 
seconds because he has such high dot
damage<00:04:27.920> and<00:04:28.160> because<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.970> dot<00:04:29.150> damage<00:04:29.450> is<00:04:29.570> so

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
damage and because the dot damage is so

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.530 
damage and because the dot damage is so
high<00:04:29.930> naturally<00:04:30.620> he<00:04:30.800> gets<00:04:31.130> near<00:04:31.880> infinite

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
high naturally he gets near infinite

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.090 
high naturally he gets near infinite
healing<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.350> these<00:04:33.500> are<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.710> built<00:04:33.890> that<00:04:34.010> I'm

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
healing and these are the built that I'm

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.620 
healing and these are the built that I'm
talking<00:04:34.190> about<00:04:34.310> that<00:04:34.520> center<00:04:35.210> around<00:04:35.240> those

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
talking about that center around those

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.080 
talking about that center around those
dots<00:04:35.900> so<00:04:37.060> yeah<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.680> would<00:04:39.680> like<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:40.100> see<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.700> would

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
dots so yeah I would like to see I would

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.440 
dots so yeah I would like to see I would
like<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.420> see<00:04:41.830> these<00:04:43.000> these<00:04:44.000> light<00:04:44.240> fleet

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
like to see these these light fleet

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.850 
like to see these these light fleet
weapons<00:04:44.810> make<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:44.990> return<00:04:45.320> in<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.470> pre-sequel

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
weapons make a return in the pre-sequel

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.520 
weapons make a return in the pre-sequel
I<00:04:46.280> think<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.480> they<00:04:47.660> would<00:04:47.870> be<00:04:48.050> better<00:04:48.200> though

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
I think that they would be better though

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.610 
I think that they would be better though
if<00:04:48.560> it<00:04:48.920> if<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:50.060> damage<00:04:50.480> was<00:04:50.660> toned<00:04:50.990> down<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.290> bit

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
if it if the damage was toned down a bit

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.880 
if it if the damage was toned down a bit
and<00:04:51.860> make<00:04:52.490> it<00:04:52.520> less<00:04:52.970> bursty<00:04:53.630> as<00:04:53.870> well<00:04:54.710> as

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
and make it less bursty as well as

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.680 
and make it less bursty as well as
making<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.310> life<00:04:55.490> leech<00:04:55.730> guns<00:04:56.030> only<00:04:56.300> come

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
making the life leech guns only come

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.590 
making the life leech guns only come
from<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:56.900> gun<00:04:57.170> itself<00:04:57.620> rather<00:04:58.490> than<00:04:58.820> you<00:04:59.510> know

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
from the gun itself rather than you know

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.420 
from the gun itself rather than you know
what<00:04:59.780> we<00:04:59.900> have<00:05:00.050> right<00:05:00.290> now<00:05:00.320> which<00:05:00.710> is<00:05:00.740> grog

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
what we have right now which is grog

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.640 
what we have right now which is grog
nozzle<00:05:01.460> plus<00:05:02.120> any<00:05:02.420> sort<00:05:02.780> of<00:05:02.840> grenade<00:05:03.140> equals

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
nozzle plus any sort of grenade equals

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.070 
nozzle plus any sort of grenade equals
full<00:05:03.890> heal<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.450> feel<00:05:05.450> like<00:05:05.540> it'd<00:05:05.600> be<00:05:05.750> a<00:05:05.780> lot<00:05:06.020> more

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
full heal I feel like it'd be a lot more

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.960 
full heal I feel like it'd be a lot more
balanced<00:05:06.650> that<00:05:06.830> way<00:05:07.040> and<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.520> would<00:05:07.580> be<00:05:07.700> a<00:05:07.730> lot

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
balanced that way and it would be a lot

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.720 
balanced that way and it would be a lot
more<00:05:08.150> enjoyable<00:05:08.600> to<00:05:09.020> have<00:05:09.410> a<00:05:10.010> good<00:05:10.280> gun<00:05:10.490> with<00:05:10.700> a

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
more enjoyable to have a good gun with a

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.890 
more enjoyable to have a good gun with a
gimmick<00:05:11.030> here<00:05:11.450> rather<00:05:12.380> than<00:05:13.150> yeah<00:05:14.150> cuz<00:05:14.780> that

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
gimmick here rather than yeah cuz that

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.120 
gimmick here rather than yeah cuz that
as<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.050> see<00:05:15.200> right<00:05:15.230> there<00:05:15.350> switch<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:15.860> my<00:05:15.920> grog

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.630 
a full heal in just a couple seconds
even<00:05:21.500> though<00:05:21.650> I<00:05:21.740> wasn't<00:05:22.100> even<00:05:22.190> shooting<00:05:22.550> him

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640

even though I wasn't even shooting him
that<00:05:22.760> was<00:05:22.880> just<00:05:23.030> all<00:05:23.210> dots<00:05:23.650> so<00:05:24.650> any<00:05:24.800> how<00:05:25.010> do<00:05:25.070> you

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
that was just all dots so any how do you

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.010 
that was just all dots so any how do you
feel<00:05:25.310> about<00:05:25.340> this<00:05:25.670> should<00:05:25.910> life<00:05:26.090> leech<00:05:26.330> should

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
feel about this should life leech should

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.200 
feel about this should life leech should
live<00:05:27.170> the<00:05:27.320> life<00:05:27.620> leech<00:05:27.860> make<00:05:28.070> a<00:05:28.100> return<00:05:28.460> should

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
live the life leech make a return should

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.740 
live the life leech make a return should
it<00:05:29.300> stay<00:05:29.540> to<00:05:29.600> just<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.080> gun<00:05:30.290> should<00:05:31.220> it's<00:05:31.940> what

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
it stay to just the gun should it's what

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.900 
it stay to just the gun should it's what
what<00:05:33.110> do<00:05:33.170> you<00:05:33.260> think<00:05:33.440> it<00:05:33.560> should<00:05:33.650> do<00:05:33.830> I<00:05:34.100> think

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
what do you think it should do I think

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.020 
what do you think it should do I think
it<00:05:35.270> go<00:05:35.510> over<00:05:35.870> a<00:05:35.900> couple<00:05:36.140> more<00:05:36.470> changes<00:05:36.740> and<00:05:37.190> so

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
it go over a couple more changes and so

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.740 
it go over a couple more changes and so
that<00:05:38.240> way<00:05:38.390> it<00:05:38.600> became<00:05:39.080> more<00:05:40.070> of<00:05:40.750> something

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
that way it became more of something

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.870
