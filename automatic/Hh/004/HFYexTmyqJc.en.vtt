00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 millions are waiting for them to dream 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.220
 flagship models are the best there is of the world 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.139
 smartphones and i confess you feel 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.070
 pride because in my hands right away 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.070
 4 bottles 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.090
 hi this is digital etc. 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:27.050
 my name is hope zakharov and here they are 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.859
 our heroes iphone 5s samsung galaxy s4 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.930
 look for Zion and sony xperia z of course 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.660
 surely many of you already have your 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.480
 brand preferences and some will choose 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.150
 for example iphone for status second 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.269
 samsung for advanced technology 3 sony 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.820
 for reliability 4 htc and for loyalty 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.710
 traditions but try in more detail 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.289
 today sort out these smartphones and 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.390
 compare their size and design 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.090
 the whole smartphone and gradually becomes 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.680
 big all for the sake of increasing the screen but 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.230
 while manufacturers are trying to do 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.120
 they are thinner and lighter and that's what eventually 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.440
 happened 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.860
 uniquely the lightest compact 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.550
 iphone in second place samsung on 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.190
 The third htc and sony is the largest and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.619
 weighty developers samsung a in 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.119
 still quite faceless and appearance 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.759
 devices made no changes by 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.380
 compared with previous models but 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.460
 body has become more durable 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.100
 polycarbonate iphone stretched up 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.130
 but essentially the design also remained the same 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.479
 someone already podnadoevshem and corps 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.759
 made as always from quality 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.430
 materials from aluminum with inserts from 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.180
 glass or glass ceramics 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.130
 htc is also made of 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.310
 not metal body 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.960
 svyazad can add a plus sign looks 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.670
 the smartphone is interesting and fresh 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.020
 but a sony is made of tempered glass and 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.610
 attracts with its ultimate appearance 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.320
 with strict edges and sharp corners 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.330
 iphone performance of course its 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.580
 ios operating system 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.010
 RAM 1 gigabyte 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.880
 the rest of the gadgets on android volume 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.890
 RAM 2 gigabyte sony screen and 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.870
 samsung biggest diagonal displays 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.060
 5 inches in htc 47 in iphone 4 inches 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.980
 certainly nicer to look at big 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.100
 screens but to use 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.930
 especially one hand is not always comfortable 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.459
 screen characteristics like 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.140
 resolution pixel density 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.330
 iphone is actually already lagging behind 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.140
 other flagships although by eye it's not 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.610
 visible almost the screen is very bright and 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.330
 has these beautiful peak 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.510
 properties 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.260
 eat 7 screen is impressive maximum 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.390
 viewing angles a good margin of screen brightness 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.750
 samsung can be called the best 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.040
 super amoled color flexibility 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.110
 muffled admitted to bright and saturated 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.959
 sony screen is also good but compared to 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.920
 in others it seems a little more faded and 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.920
 the slope of the paint is already losing their nation 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.530
 sony xperia z camera and 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.770
 samsung 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.610
 with 4 cameras have 13 megapixels iphone 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.140
 5 8 megapixels and htc m4 megapixels 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.160
 which is rather unexpected for 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.090
 flagship of 2013 however the case is not 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.640
 only in pixels 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.790
 appreciated the quality of photos from 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.500
 extra widgets samsung galaxy 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.920
 s4 allows you to shoot directly into two cameras 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.290
 main and frontal htc one has 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.090
 a variety of tools for shooting and 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.940
 photo processing 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.090
 and sony and he has a mode and and dear also 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.340
 as well as utter sik become features 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.950
 flagship smartphones have their own chips 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.200
 so for example sony xperia z is available 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.519
 sealed waterproof case 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.250

 you can turn the pages not 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.470
 touching the screen the video is put 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.890
 pause as soon as you turn away 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.540
 practical use 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.600
 at least the less you touch 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.700
 screen the more often it will deduct the accent 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.100
 on the sounds of the front speakers give a very 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.290
 powerful pure surround sound 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.390

 manufacturer of the most purchased on
