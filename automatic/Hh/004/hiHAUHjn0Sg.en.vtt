00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.549
 in conditions when the global economy 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.720
 going through hard times 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.929
 trust falls not only to valuable 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.139
 papers but also to the money in principle however 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.240
 what is money in the digital age more often 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.279
 itâ€™s just an electronic signal 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.230
 inside the rack payment system 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.109
 wonder what the internet sometimes brings 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.939
 very strange creatures 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.779
 cryptocurrencies such as altcoin 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.029
 and and ripley 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.090
 but the main cryptocurrency is 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.850
 certainly bitcoin 4 years ago 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.760
 this system was launched by the network nobody satoshi 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.110
 nakamoto true to meet him so up 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.430
 so far no one managed 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.950
 most likely under this pseudonym 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.510
 hiding a group of developers from 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.239
 bitcoins there is no single emission 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.000
 center bitcoins are not tied to any 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.680
 from real currencies and not secured 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.930
 nonetheless more people 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.180
 they prefer it and they are dollar and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.100
 euros and rubles maybe because all 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.920
 Bitcoin operations are carried out 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.020
 anonymously if last year volume 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.809
 deals with bitcoins in the world did not exceed 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.820
 10 thousand now he has grown a few 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.310
 times and how to hope a member of this 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 alternative currency market will 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.500
 grow and further than what trades for 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.930
 bitcoins and who is the main 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 member of this payment system on 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.920
 There are many opinions on this score. 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.670
 Some experts are confident that the ball 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.799
 it is ruled by crime most often 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.049
 cryptocurrency used by intruders 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.329
 terrorists are people who sell 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.009
 drugs over the internet so if you 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.460
 read enjoy cryptocurrency you 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.409
 accordingly do not associate with people 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.990
 Well , something must hide therefore for 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.340
 ordinary citizens I would be at the channel 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.990
 used by classic line banking 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.880
 other experts are no less confident 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.439
 I predict the bitcoin of payment system 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.010
 great future speaking 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.620
 macroeconomic 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.430
 bitcoin gives you a chance to create new 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.640
 world reserve currency because it 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.560
 very correct and it is very logical 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.840
 have a currency with a predictable mission for 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.490
 ordinary users of course so far 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.649
 so bitcoin really jumps 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.800
 because there is in this market 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.240
 a large number of speculators 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.040
 electronic wallet with bitcoins now 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.650
 mandatory attribute of all computer 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.660
 geeks how to get bitcoins and what's on them 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.160
 can buy ordinary buyer of course 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.300
 have nothing to do with the drug lords 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.670
 Alexey Gusakov will tell the easiest 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.200
 way to get bitcoins buy them for 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.630
 There are several of these 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.510
 exchange sites and exchanges current rate 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.670
 about 120 dollars for 1 bitcoin 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.370
 hard way to get this cryptocurrency 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.680
 make it most truly get for so 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.040
 called mining mining virtual 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.420
 of coins 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.459
 resources are used central 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.650
 processor or video card 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.330
 they are in any computer we find in 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.580
 online client program 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.800
 we press start and we watch replenishment 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.930
 bills true for cost effective 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.209
 mining power of our editorial 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.440
 computers are clearly not enough here 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.510
 actually say it looks like 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.100
 miner program which are mined 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.220
 bitcoins download it can be worn 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.950
 absolutely free bath 180 approximately 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.950
 please tell me an hour how much we are for it 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.070
 time to earn well in an hour we earned 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.380
 just one millionth of bitcoin 1 and 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.480
 actually it is a couple of kopecks as 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.340
 say experienced miners profit 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.320
 miner alone not using 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.989
 additional power is unlikely to exceed 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.590
 10 dollars a month even on the internet can 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.720
 not enough 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.730
 so bitcoins are usually mined 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.190
 grouping users together 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.350
 getters called pool the larger the floor 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.600
 the greater the total power and so 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.370
 more chances to earn burst from 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.560
 overproduction of coins the system cannot 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.290
 she is set up so for the day in the world 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.420
 only 3,600 cryptomonet can be mined 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.550
 the creators of the system have programmed and 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.650
 in such a way that more than twenty one 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.780
 a million bitcoins can not be imitated 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.840
 In principle, exactly as many coins will accumulate 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.670
 in the system by 2033 however 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.709
 advantage of collective mining 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.750
 carry risks for the whole currency in 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.850
 In general, some pools scored so 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.310
 a lot of weight in the community have become a 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.800
 paso 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.870
 for the emergence of local monopolists if 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.730
 more than half of the bitcoin network will enter into 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.010
 collusion will be able to pay 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.570
 one coin twice because the system does not have 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.160
 single settlement center 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.799
 no one can validate 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.080
 transactions but experts are convinced before this 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.120
 so far away must be very big 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.000
 time and a lot has to change 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.070
 so that all people who mine 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.500
 and who use it and measures which 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.180
 up agree to take it as 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.070
 I will be able to give money to my shops 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.720
 unite at the construction site this year 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.280
 mostly right now all the same conspiracy account all 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.680
 miners and pools against a 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.479
 centralized currency and let's say america 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.669
 but to fight dollars 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.380
 you first need to spend their computer with 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.360
 two video cards capable of providing 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.610
 acceptable bitcoin mining 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.770
 will cost at least US $ 600 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.590
 here it is worth adding a lot 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.870
 overhead costs i.e. increases in 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.630
 first and foremost costs 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:09.060
 electricity respectively all of this 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.900
 iron which considers our tasks 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.310
 consumes a lot of electricity 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.680
 produces a lot of heat 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.160
 respectively, the cost of cooling 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.220
 then 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.140
 fire brigade and so on while spending 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.740
 honestly earned crypton coins 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.840
 not everywhere 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.330
 most loyal to bitcoins are those who 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.870
 involved in their production 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.370
 hosting providers and vendors 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.410
 software 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.419
 but now for crypto coins on the Internet 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.520
 You can buy for example cosmetics 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.650
 clothes and musical instruments 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.169
 one of the Canadians agreed 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.940
 sell for bitcoins the whole house is worth 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.220
 remember that cryptocurrency hard 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.289
 interested and hackers if you have stolen 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.240
 Bitcoin e- wallet back 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.520
 they probably will not work all 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.960
 operations in the bitcoin system anonymous 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.960
 for anonymity you have to pay
