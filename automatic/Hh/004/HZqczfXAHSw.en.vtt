00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.740
 Hello everyone 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.619
 today I find you in a 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.909
 new tutorial this will be the tutorial of 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.369
 apple fritters 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:20.230
 if this tutorial interests you stay 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.970
 with me the whole list of material 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.400
 you need to be in a bar 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.929
 information we start right away 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:33.089
 with the donuts so you need 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.089
 of white paws, transmissible and ocher 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.760
 you will create a sausage and you will 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.560
 create three shots that rolls so well 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.700
 sure after all the big battles and 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.350
 of the quantity you want once 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.540
 that I created and put three small 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.140
 balls I'm going to come crush them 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.140
 slightly 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 helpful will gently give them 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.879
 form beyond the environments that are 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.799
 donuts with applesauce from the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.770
 jam the chocolate what you 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.470
 want inside once I 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.380
 do that I just create a feature at 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.840
 middle so that's actually afterwards for 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.549
 decry the clearest part of the 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.110
 Benin and finally you will proceed 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.240
 exactly the same way as the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.179
 cheeseburger I made you they 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.190
 were monday 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.140
 so I'm going to take masking tape 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.710
 you can take scotch it works 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:40.270
 also and I'm going to come cut a little 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:43.530
 tape that I'm going to put everywhere on the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.530
 trait that I have just traced 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:51.369
 then we will go to coloring 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:54.190
 so we're going to take some dry pastel 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.539
 ocher color and the other brown so 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.880
 do some pastels that I bought at 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.719
 cultura so you have to buy some 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.920
 it's still extremely long 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.450
 so then I put a little bit of 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.700
 brown to put a little bit of 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.700
 cooking then I remove my death coach 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.290
 after I'm going to blur the little 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.450
 dream for it to be a little bit more 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.840
 realistic let's say so I have 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.549
 previously wiped my brush and I 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.489
 then go to the compote of 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:31.010
 apples so for the compote I took from 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.450
 the translucent apa of the tender and 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.000
 I added a little pasta 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.650
 chocolate inside it must be 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.959
 take if the caramel wave I do not know 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.940
 but that's what wanted raspberry 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.870
 chocolate 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.579
 so I added a little bit 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.299
 others to my mix because I 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.640
 thought it was a little bland 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.069
 so for the tutorial for whipped cream 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.299
 and the coolies all that will come on 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.680
 my channel do not worry about 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.750
 waiting for you have the recipe bar 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.650
 info 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.769
 then I take a donut that I 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.239
 come cut in half and I come textures 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.950
 and all the interior so to create 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:10.390
 really this effect of blessed airy have for 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.390
 that I took my scalpel 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.380
 and then I come to fancy 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.610
 pointed it by creating air holes 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.610
 more or less big 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.880
 we 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.170
 then with my game scalpel comes 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.780
 cut a small piece inside 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:42.720
 Macon buddy before you can make the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.280
 following and then so I texture is 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.990
 a little bit of donuts so there I 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.450
 used the back of a brush I'm 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.520
 sorry it did not finish class forget 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.020
 then and his button and I come next 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.570
 continued to texture and with my needle 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.480
 here's really having this besnancy effect 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.520
 who is not flat but who see there 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.870
 that a little more realistic 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:06.180
 then julien put my compote to 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:13.590
 inside of my win and I put that 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:14.070
 baked 30 minutes at 110 degrees once 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.720
 it's cooked 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.090
 I come to take white paint 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.790
 a toothbrush and I just created my 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.900
 fake sugar so for that use a 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.900
 toothbrush and a brush 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.409
 so that's done until you 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.469
 have the result you want next 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.719

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:39.479
