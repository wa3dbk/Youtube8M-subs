00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
it shows you like this layout before you

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.610 
it shows you like this layout before you
do<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.630> then<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.810> disappears<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.560> you

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
do it and then it disappears and you

do it and then it disappears and you
have<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.980> do<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.190> off<00:03:23.280> memory<00:03:23.550> but<00:03:23.850> it's

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
have to do it off memory but it's

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.750 
have to do it off memory but it's
actually<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.420> lot<00:03:24.540> easier<00:03:24.600> than<00:03:24.960> that<00:03:25.110> sounds

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.130 
actually a lot easier than that sounds
yeah<00:03:26.760> i<00:03:26.790> think<00:03:27.000> this<00:03:27.330> one's<00:03:27.510> actually<00:03:27.660> easier

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
yeah i think this one's actually easier

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.780 
yeah i think this one's actually easier
to<00:03:28.170> than<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.650> autograph<00:03:29.010> one<00:03:29.220> because<00:03:29.580> it

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
to than the autograph one because it

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.230 
to than the autograph one because it
doesn't<00:03:30.090> take<00:03:30.240> you<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:31.470> know<00:03:31.590> as<00:03:31.980> long<00:03:32.520> in

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
doesn't take you you know as long in

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.400 
doesn't take you you know as long in
some<00:03:33.450> cases<00:03:33.720> but<00:03:34.100> it's<00:03:35.100> really<00:03:35.280> easy<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:36.410> this

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
some cases but it's really easy and this

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.720 
some cases but it's really easy and this
is<00:03:37.530> probably<00:03:37.710> the<00:03:37.830> one<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.130> i<00:03:38.190> do<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.460> most

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
is probably the one that i do the most

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.040 
is probably the one that i do the most
actually<00:03:39.510> today<00:03:39.750> um<00:03:40.580> but<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.660> rules<00:03:42.870> are

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
actually today um but you the rules are

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.160 
actually today um but you the rules are
you<00:03:43.260> have<00:03:43.560> five<00:03:44.220> tries<00:03:44.700> like<00:03:45.120> if<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.870> mess<00:03:46.020> up

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
you have five tries like if you mess up

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.600 
you have five tries like if you mess up
you<00:03:46.380> have<00:03:46.470> five<00:03:46.620> times<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.950> mess<00:03:47.100> up<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.460> what

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
you have five times the mess up is what

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.660 
you have five times the mess up is what
I'm<00:03:47.700> saying<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.740> there's<00:03:49.740> three<00:03:49.980> courses<00:03:50.280> and

if you mess up five times before you get
the<00:03:53.460> three<00:03:53.640> courses<00:03:53.880> done<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.330> don't<00:03:54.450> get

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
the three courses done you don't get

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.280 
the three courses done you don't get
anything<00:03:55.560> but<00:03:55.980> if<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.660> get<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.750> right<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.170> you

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
but for me at least this is the easiest

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.520 
but for me at least this is the easiest
one<00:04:12.990> so<00:04:13.730> yeah<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:15.450> recommend<00:04:16.049> doing<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:16.290> it's

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
daily limit reach but that would say

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.720 
daily limit reach but that would say
you<00:04:27.960> know<00:04:28.050> 50v<00:04:28.470> see<00:04:28.800> if<00:04:29.040> you<00:04:29.220> get<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.580> done

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
1200 you know fan boost but like really

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.400 
1200 you know fan boost but like really
this<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.830> very<00:04:38.310> easy<00:04:38.460> way<00:04:38.790> to<00:04:38.970> get<00:04:39.150> VC<00:04:39.410> so

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
this is a very easy way to get VC so

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.850 
this is a very easy way to get VC so
like<00:04:40.680> let's<00:04:41.070> say<00:04:41.190> you<00:04:41.340> do<00:04:41.700> like<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.690> two<00:04:42.900> of

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
like let's say you do like the two of

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.920 
like let's say you do like the two of
like<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.850> know<00:04:44.880> when<00:04:45.180> coach<00:04:45.390> mode<00:04:45.690> like<00:04:45.870> you

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
like you know when coach mode like you

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.990 
like you know when coach mode like you
do<00:04:46.050> two<00:04:46.260> games<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.580> then<00:04:47.790> you<00:04:47.880> do

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
do two games of that and then you do

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.200 
do two games of that and then you do
this<00:04:48.210> that's<00:04:48.810> 20<00:04:49.200> 200<00:04:49.620> VC<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.160> day<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.760> if

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
this that's 20 200 VC in a day and if

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.910 
this that's 20 200 VC in a day and if
you<00:04:51.360> have<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:51.720> lot<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.020> spare<00:04:52.320> time<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:52.860> you

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
you have a lot of spare time and you

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.740 
you have a lot of spare time and you
want<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.250> delete<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.150> app<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.300> keep<00:04:54.630> doing

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
want to delete the app and keep doing

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.990 
want to delete the app and keep doing
that<00:04:54.930> then<00:04:55.500> you<00:04:55.800> can<00:04:55.830> get<00:04:56.160> probably<00:04:56.520> like<00:04:56.730> five

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
that then you can get probably like five

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.050 
that then you can get probably like five
thousand<00:04:57.480> in<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.600> day<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.880> makes<00:04:59.880> it<00:04:59.970> a

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
thousand in a day and that makes it a

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.570 
thousand in a day and that makes it a
lot<00:05:00.210> better<00:05:00.270> than<00:05:00.660> buying<00:05:00.870> it<00:05:01.170> and<00:05:01.770> i<00:05:02.160> boosted

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
lot better than buying it and i boosted

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.710 
lot better than buying it and i boosted
my<00:05:02.880> guy<00:05:03.410> up<00:05:04.410> for<00:05:04.770> today<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:06.270> know<00:05:06.360> just<00:05:06.540> by
