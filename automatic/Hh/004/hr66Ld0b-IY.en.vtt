00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 yesterday at the presentation of the rally dakar 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.940
 2015 a Chilean presenter 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.240
 Big magda made a very serious mistake 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.670
 she came up with the idea that ceviche 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.240
 it was a Chilean dish she later tried 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.609
 of rectifying in the networks made a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.189
 twitter that says for those who do not know 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.320
 listen to the ceviche is very common food 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.990
 in chile or native of Peru but 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.800
 well what I had said was said 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.050
 and then the error that he committed and for 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.770
 talk more about this dish but I'm not going 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.780
 to understand why he is a native of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.280
 country because we are with javier vargas he 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.590
 is president of the association of 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.770
 marine restaurants and related to Peru and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.739
 also with chef mario kawakami who 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.719
 will explain a little about all 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.850
 the ingredients and how this is prepared 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.980
 delicious dish 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.100
 javier good why so much controversy 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.020
 always with chile de los el cebiche and el 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.880
 pisco of the different meals because 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.130
 this is given 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.860
 Well this is not new in the year 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.830
 2007 the Chilean president michelle 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.350
 bachelet tried to spread the ceviche of 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.850
 Chilean croaker in various events 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.820
 international gastronomy as its 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.760
 flag dish in ceviche 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.030
 theme that by many Chilean chefs 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.630
 our colleagues sharing the idea is not 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.640
 shared I know that many friends of 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.200
 Chile has not liked them either 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.930
 news because they the Chilean kitchen 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.330
 have their marshal's authenticity 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.830
 his country the navy and we never 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.550
 we have copied larios on everything there is 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.080
 have respect like that then is this one 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.080
 loses identity of this type d 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.480
 of affirmation of the magda journalist 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.390
 great not and I think it's a more 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.640
 media which has used an event 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.100
 real and dakar that turns the world to 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.500
 spread or hang on the image of 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.390
 our flag dish the ceviche in 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.490
 reality the ceviche is reason for union 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.500
 of integration although it is true it ends 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.750
 says the Chilean there is Ecuadorian 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.970
 there are mexican we have to say 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.220
 that our cebiche is different clear 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.860
 it's not different because we have fish 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.070
 of costa sierra and jungle this is how 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.370
 We are seeing here in our kitchen if 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.750
 the camera helps me to focus 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.340
 those types of ceviches that we are 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.560
 watching tell us a little bit 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.630
 mario what was it that prepared us today 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.120
 we have that I love my favorite is 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.430
 the one that the best known is is made with 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.160
 corvina this our plate low flag 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.740
 the Peruvian dish that is corvina sole 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.460
 coordinates then we have without letting it is 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.610
 the mario leave 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.930
 and the next I leave it to you javier 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.480
 these are some dishes would be pisces 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.140
 ceviche in glasses shots the ceviche of 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.930
 Javier highlights at this time we are going to 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.600
 prepare a ceviche itself in less than 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.570
 two minutes fresh fish lemon salt 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.070
 and here Javier and what is it that everyone 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.400
 it is clear to us that ceviche is 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.860
 Peruvian but already leaving us in detail what 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.560
 is what makes ceviche can only 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.990
 be done in Peru as well as we 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.450
 We eat rich here 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.700
 the truth our diversity our 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.430
 diversity because not only do I go back to 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.260
 reiterate we have shore fish 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.260
 sierra and jungle but also we have the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.020
 aji limo el ají mochero el rocoto el ají 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.880
 yellow finally I have also 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.980
 understood that the lemon plays a role 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.129
 very important and is that according to 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.650
 I've heard the lemon that is produced or that 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.989
 there is here in Peru is different is 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.970
 You can truly have this lemon 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.080
 characteristic there in Chile they say the 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.700
 spicy lemon 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.260
 the Peruvian lemon that is already arriving 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.870
 there and good all this variety of peppers 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.180
 of fish inputs make us 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.220
 different and unique and only tell them 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.319
 to Chilean friends who will not be able to 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.709
 copy us because we have here the spoon 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.709
 Ceviche 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:18.070
 and you have a spoon 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.360
 to see that is almost ready in less than 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.699
 two minutes then there was lemon salt 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.460
 go there is ajinomoto is also cast 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.800
 actually I do not use it here in 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.130
 motorcycle but it is optional for many 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.500
 people who usually use it but this one 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.470
 It is recommended that she not use the motorbike 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.530
 if not 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.970
 just leave fresh lemon and so is not 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.740
 necessary that actually aha motivates 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.689
 consume a little more fish in the 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.330
 food diet 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:55.769
 also has a super healthy dish 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:58.349
 Well I'm already dying to try it to see 

00:04:55.769 --> 00:05:01.069
 and while here I am going to try this 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.069
 delicious dish 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.350
 I give way to mabel we have 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.350
