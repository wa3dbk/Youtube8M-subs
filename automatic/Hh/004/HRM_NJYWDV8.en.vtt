we're<00:00:08.670> going<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.849> take<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.030> look<00:00:09.179> at<00:00:09.269> using

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
we're going to take a look at using

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.259 
we're going to take a look at using
motion<00:00:09.929> tween<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.710> adobe<00:00:11.099> flash<00:00:11.340> cs4<00:00:11.969> to

motion tween in adobe flash cs4 to

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.049 
motion tween in adobe flash cs4 to
animate<00:00:12.570> 3d<00:00:12.929> objects<00:00:13.429> so<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.490> start<00:00:14.610> out<00:00:14.849> we're

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
animate 3d objects so to start out we're

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.010 
animate 3d objects so to start out we're
going<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.210> import<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.719> 3d<00:00:15.990> model<00:00:16.760> and<00:00:18.020> we're

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
going to import a 3d model and we're

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.630 
going to import a 3d model and we're
going<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.170> use<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.590> little<00:00:19.770> egg<00:00:20.010> ship<00:00:20.279> model

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
going to use this little egg ship model

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.790 
going to use this little egg ship model
here<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.300> since<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.260> import<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
here and since we have this import to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.740 
here and since we have this import to
stage<00:00:23.039> selected<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> bring<00:00:24.630> it

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
stage selected it's going to bring it

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.179 
stage selected it's going to bring it
directly<00:00:24.869> onto<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> stage<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.680> give<00:00:25.980> us<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
directly onto the stage and give us a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.859 
directly onto the stage and give us a
live<00:00:26.369> preview<00:00:26.640> you'll<00:00:27.480> see<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.720> it's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
live preview you'll see that it's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.609 
live preview you'll see that it's
created<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.380> layer<00:00:28.560> here<00:00:28.859> for<00:00:29.189> our<00:00:29.310> egg<00:00:29.490> ship<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
created a layer here for our egg ship I

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.840 
created a layer here for our egg ship I
need<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.710> scale<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.130> down<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.700> little

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
need to scale this down just a little

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.910 
need to scale this down just a little
bit<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:36.660> we're<00:00:37.350> going<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> simple

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
bit and we're going to do a simple

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.619 
bit and we're going to do a simple
animation<00:00:38.489> across<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> stream<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.540> this

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
animation across the stream for this

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.410 
animation across the stream for this
tutorial<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.410> show<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.620> how<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.760> rotate

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
tutorial just to show you how to rotate

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.709 
tutorial just to show you how to rotate
objects<00:00:43.230> using<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.129> motion<00:00:44.460> tween<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.510> I've

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
objects using the motion tween so I've

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.029 
objects using the motion tween so I've
got<00:00:45.899> my<00:00:45.930> object<00:00:46.410> here<00:00:46.559> I'm<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.920> go<00:00:47.010> ahead

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
got my object here I'm going to go ahead

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.150 
got my object here I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:47.250> make<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.640> look<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.649> about<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> fly

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and make it look like it's about to fly

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.529 
and make it look like it's about to fly
onto<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.579> screen<00:00:50.760> give<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> proper

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
onto the screen give it the proper

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.700 
onto the screen give it the proper
rotation<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.640> I<00:00:53.640> need<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.969> add<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> frame<00:00:54.710> out

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
rotation and I need to add a frame out

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.069 
rotation and I need to add a frame out
here<00:00:56.039> at<00:00:56.100> frame<00:00:56.309> 50<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.059> create<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> motion

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
here at frame 50 and create a motion

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.279 
here at frame 50 and create a motion
tween<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.940> we're<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.870> create<00:01:01.109> an

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
tween so we're just going to create an

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.110 
tween so we're just going to create an
arc<00:01:01.440> path<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> fly<00:01:02.520> off<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> top<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
arc path and have it fly off the top of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.810 
arc path and have it fly off the top of
screen<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:03.809> frame<00:01:04.049> 50<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:05.309> want<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.700> in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
screen so at frame 50 we want it up in

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.539 
screen so at frame 50 we want it up in
this<00:01:05.970> position<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.890> now<00:01:07.890> i'm<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> go

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
this position and now i'm going to go

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.899 
this position and now i'm going to go
ahead<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:10.040> create<00:01:11.040> my<00:01:11.280> path<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.820> going

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
ahead and create my path that it's going

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.850 
ahead and create my path that it's going
to<00:01:12.000> follow<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.960> I've<00:01:13.049> got<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.350> motion<00:01:13.650> tween

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
to follow and I've got my motion tween

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.609 
to follow and I've got my motion tween
set<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.930> now<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> want<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> have

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
set up now now what I want to have

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.609 
set up now now what I want to have
happen<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.130> right<00:01:17.490> about<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.880> point<00:01:18.619> we've

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
happen is right about this point we've

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.230 
happen is right about this point we've
got<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> start<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.430> arc<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.000> want<00:01:21.180> my

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
got the start of this arc and I want my

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.749 
got the start of this arc and I want my
object<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.320> start<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> rotate<00:01:23.070> along<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.520> arc

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
object to start to rotate along that arc

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.539 
object to start to rotate along that arc
and<00:01:24.020> start<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.590> roll<00:01:25.770> over<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.369> in

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and start to kind of roll over like in

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.480 
and start to kind of roll over like in
real<00:01:26.700> life<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.180> we'll<00:01:27.990> roll<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> import<00:01:29.220> 3d

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
real life so we'll roll up the import 3d

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.469 
real life so we'll roll up the import 3d
palette<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.060> choose<00:01:30.630> 3d<00:01:30.990> rotation<00:01:31.530> frames

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
palette and choose 3d rotation frames

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.300 
palette and choose 3d rotation frames
this<00:01:33.479> isn't<00:01:33.810> actually<00:01:33.869> necessary<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.979> it's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
this isn't actually necessary it's it's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.649 
this isn't actually necessary it's it's
more<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> show<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> what's<00:01:36.180> actually<00:01:36.360> going

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
more to show you what's actually going

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.069 
more to show you what's actually going
on<00:01:36.840> behind<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> scenes<00:01:38.689> but<00:01:39.689> you'll<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.990> at

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
on behind the scenes but you'll see at

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.719 
on behind the scenes but you'll see at
frame<00:01:40.320> 0<00:01:40.350> we've<00:01:40.799> got<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> certain<00:01:41.280> X<00:01:41.490> Y<00:01:41.700> Z

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729

frame 0 we've got a certain X Y Z
rotation<00:01:42.150> applied<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.930> our<00:01:42.960> object<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.649> was

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
rotation applied to our object that was

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.069 
rotation applied to our object that was
the<00:01:43.950> original<00:01:44.399> rotation<00:01:44.939> i<00:01:45.000> applied<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.960> at

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
the original rotation i applied now at

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.170 
the original rotation i applied now at
any<00:01:46.200> point<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.770> time<00:01:46.950> along<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.430> timeline<00:01:47.909> I

any point in time along this timeline I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.020 
any point in time along this timeline I
can<00:01:48.750> make<00:01:48.899> changes<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.530> object<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.250> it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
can make changes to the object and it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.440 
can make changes to the object and it
will<00:01:51.180> tween<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.320> rotation<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.520> object<00:01:53.909> so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
will tween the rotation of the object so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.209 
will tween the rotation of the object so
let's<00:01:54.659> go<00:01:54.780> ahead<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.020> apply<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.979> little

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
let's go ahead and apply just a little

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.550 
let's go ahead and apply just a little
bit<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.430> rotation<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:57.180> make<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.259> look<00:01:58.409> like

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
bit of rotation here make it look like

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.240 
bit of rotation here make it look like
our<00:01:58.740> objects<00:01:59.130> following<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> path<00:02:01.130> I'm<00:02:02.130> going

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
our objects following the path I'm going

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.399 
our objects following the path I'm going
to<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.549> again<00:02:02.610> right<00:02:03.030> here

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.609 

and<00:02:06.999> maybe<00:02:07.999> one<00:02:08.239> more<00:02:08.420> time<00:02:08.660> up<00:02:08.869> now<00:02:09.410> let's

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
and maybe one more time up now let's

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.020 
and maybe one more time up now let's
yeah<00:02:09.979> let's<00:02:10.009> go<00:02:10.280> ahead<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.459> go<00:02:10.759> all<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.000> way

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
yeah let's go ahead and go all the way

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.119 
yeah let's go ahead and go all the way
up<00:02:11.180> here<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.569> top<00:02:11.680> make<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.830> easier<00:02:13.099> on

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
up here to the top make it easier on

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.479 
up here to the top make it easier on
ourselves<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:16.250> now<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:16.760> have<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.150> option<00:02:17.510> of

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
ourselves so now we have the option of

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.830 
ourselves so now we have the option of
when<00:02:19.489> you<00:02:19.580> scrub<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:19.970> timeline<00:02:20.209> you'll<00:02:20.569> still

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
when you scrub the timeline you'll still

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.360 
when you scrub the timeline you'll still
just<00:02:21.019> see<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.260> go<00:02:21.349> along<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.650> path<00:02:21.830> if<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.160> let

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
just see it go along the path if you let

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.430 
just see it go along the path if you let
off<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:22.970> indicator<00:02:23.420> you'll<00:02:24.049> see<00:02:24.290> where

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
off of the indicator you'll see where

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.250 
off of the indicator you'll see where
the<00:02:24.560> rotation<00:02:25.099> is<00:02:25.250> an<00:02:25.510> easier<00:02:26.510> way<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.690> see

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
the rotation is an easier way to see

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.960 
the rotation is an easier way to see
your<00:02:27.470> rotation<00:02:28.099> throughout<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.640> entire

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
your rotation throughout the entire

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.910 
your rotation throughout the entire
animation<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.810> go<00:02:29.930> ahead<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.379> set<00:02:30.769> your

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
animation is to go ahead and set your

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.309 
animation is to go ahead and set your
frames<00:02:31.519> per<00:02:31.760> second<00:02:32.090> here<00:02:32.269> and<00:02:32.450> click<00:02:33.290> play

all<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:34.069> we'll<00:02:34.670> see<00:02:34.849> our<00:02:35.000> object<00:02:35.450> following

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
all and we'll see our object following

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.190 
all and we'll see our object following
the<00:02:35.930> path<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.319> you'll<00:02:36.440> get<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.590> better<00:02:36.739> idea<00:02:36.860> of

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
the path and you'll get a better idea of

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.960 
the path and you'll get a better idea of
what<00:02:39.200> your<00:02:39.319> object<00:02:39.680> looks<00:02:39.890> like<00:02:40.129> at<00:02:40.280> any<00:02:40.400> given

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
what your object looks like at any given

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.960 
what your object looks like at any given
point<00:02:41.180> in<00:02:41.299> time<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:43.250> let's<00:02:43.430> go<00:02:43.549> ahead<00:02:43.579> and<00:02:43.760> hit

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
point in time so let's go ahead and hit

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.050 
point in time so let's go ahead and hit
ctrl<00:02:44.450> enter<00:02:44.629> and<00:02:44.930> take<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.230> look<00:02:45.410> at<00:02:45.530> our<00:02:45.590> movie

ctrl enter and take a look at our movie
we'll<00:02:47.060> see<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.239> nice<00:02:47.420> fluid<00:02:47.720> movement<00:02:48.200> along

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
we'll see a nice fluid movement along

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.369 
we'll see a nice fluid movement along
this<00:02:48.500> path<00:02:52.180> there<00:02:53.180> we<00:02:53.269> go<00:02:53.390> that's<00:02:53.810> how<00:02:53.959> easy<00:02:54.019> it

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
this path there we go that's how easy it

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.300 
this path there we go that's how easy it
