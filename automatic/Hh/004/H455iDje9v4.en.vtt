notice<00:00:55.320> when<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.559> go<00:00:55.649> ahead<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.309> remove<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
notice when I go ahead and I remove the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.970 
notice when I go ahead and I remove the
water<00:00:57.149> tank<00:00:57.329> from<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.199> not<00:00:58.559> only<00:00:58.829> does<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
water tank from here not only does it

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
water tank from here not only does it
turn<00:00:59.280> red<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.030> tells<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.690> water

each<00:04:06.900> cup<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.260> gonna<00:04:07.500> go<00:04:07.620> underneath<00:04:07.800> the

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
each cup is gonna go underneath the

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.530 
each cup is gonna go underneath the
spout<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.400> each<00:04:08.489> one<00:04:08.700> will<00:04:08.760> get<00:04:08.910> six<00:04:09.180> ounces

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
spout and each one will get six ounces

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.449 
spout and each one will get six ounces
so<00:04:09.690> really<00:04:10.019> easy<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.410> make<00:04:10.560> multiple<00:04:11.070> cups<00:04:11.280> at

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
so really easy to make multiple cups at

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.520 
so really easy to make multiple cups at
the<00:04:11.580> same<00:04:11.760> time<00:04:12.030> now<00:04:12.810> this<00:04:12.989> machine<00:04:13.140> has<00:04:13.500> a

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
the same time now this machine has a

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.530 
the same time now this machine has a
bypass<00:04:14.100> doser<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.700> what<00:04:14.850> that<00:04:15.030> means<00:04:15.269> is<00:04:15.420> if

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
bypass doser and what that means is if

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.539 
bypass doser and what that means is if

anything<00:05:14.950> in<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.190> machine<00:05:15.460> you<00:05:15.610> can<00:05:15.760> just

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
anything in the machine you can just

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.780 
anything in the machine you can just
utilize<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.830> some<00:05:17.830> of<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:17.980> things<00:05:18.190> that<00:05:18.400> we<00:05:18.610> do

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
utilize it some of the things that we do

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.670 
utilize it some of the things that we do
necessarily<00:05:18.970> like<00:05:19.570> a<00:05:19.600> lot<00:05:19.870> may<00:05:20.170> be<00:05:20.230> the<00:05:20.470> water

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
necessarily like a lot may be the water

necessarily like a lot may be the water
reservoir<00:05:20.950> little<00:05:21.760> small<00:05:22.000> in<00:05:22.150> size<00:05:22.360> don't

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
reservoir little small in size don't

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.450 
reservoir little small in size don't
like<00:05:23.170> the<00:05:23.290> fact<00:05:23.470> that<00:05:23.590> there<00:05:23.830> isn't<00:05:23.980> really<00:05:24.190> a

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
like the fact that there isn't really a

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.890 
like the fact that there isn't really a
place<00:05:24.820> on<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.240> front<00:05:25.480> of<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.630> machine

anywhere that indicates how full it is
the<00:05:28.600> other<00:05:28.750> thing<00:05:29.110> too<00:05:29.470> is<00:05:29.500> that<00:05:29.830> you<00:05:30.820> can't

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
the other thing too is that you can't
