00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello everyone I'm so glad 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.359
 find today for a video that 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.639
 I was asked at length to know my 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.260
 capillary routine so in this video 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.570
 you will discover all the stages 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.400
 for my hair so shampoo 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.379
 until the loop since I also 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.580
 decided to include the way I 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.020
 realized my loops since 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.060
 obviously it's something that you 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.039
 interest so you will see everything in 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.689
 action projects use etc 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.010
 but I think you're going quickly 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.109
 realize that this is a routine that 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.369
 is very simple with little product but 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.710
 me it's something that suits me 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.360
 I do not need to have ten products 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.700
 to take care of my hair the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.380
 necessary and the bare minimum for me 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.300
 it's more than enough and you see 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.510
 that my hair is not over 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.250
 wrong 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.160
 so I leave you without delay 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.660
 discover all this in pictures 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.000
 the first step is obviously 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.210
 the washing of the hair so for that I 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 come and wet them in the shower 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.180
 then shampoo side alternates between 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.829
 the lavera and the home range 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.719
 pure timothy is the one I'm going 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.120
 use today that does not contain 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.859
 of silicone I like a lot so everything 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.570
 first I just applied the material 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.460
 in the palm of my hand the killer appliques 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.820
 my roots that I'm doing well or it's 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.680
 to take off 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.780
 to keep some sebum in my 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.130
 hair and I also apply on 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.080
 my long hours to guarantee a 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.110
 quality shampoo I come next 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.700
 rinse everything and I go to the after 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.040
 shampoo always from the same range as 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.510
 I also applies to hand-clown 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.890
 I then apply it on my long 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.840
 hours after it is a shampoo that will 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.580
 untangle my hair and make it into 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.060
 same time quite sweet and brilliant whose 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.060
 I love them a lot 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.500
 and of course I stay to finish 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.509
 then I use a small towel 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.399
 in microfiber that is great because 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.020
 that it absorbs the rest of who is 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.130
 find in my hair and given 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.789
 I will not let in at 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.729
 hair dryer 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.289
 it's a very important step for me 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.729
 Once I made up my 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.799
 horses have had the time of these series a 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.720
 little bit in the towel and I come 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.189
 now the trouble with maths 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.479
 in mouth teaser who is my ally 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.130
 for a good while now 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.689
 it's a brush that I like a lot 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.090
 because it does not break the hair 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.190
 and to accentuate this effect I start 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.140
 of course by the spikes and then I 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.810
 goes back game mails little by little for 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.370
 do not weaken my hair I take off 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.540
 then a little bit the roots for 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.799
 that my hair then dry 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.830
 naturally in better 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.830
 terms 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.410
 once my hair is dry I 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.480
 come involves a little hazel 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.459
 sweet almond oil so the magic of 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.930
 mounting to operate my hair are at 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.299
 This natural, dry 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.920
 I used this oil only 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.170
 on the lengths and spikes for the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.630
 make briand is pretty sweet enough 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.880
 place in the straightener so I use the ghd 5 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.470
 gold that I like a lot I use it 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.329
 just for my little locks two 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.670
 babies as I call them this little 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.970
 wick that curls hot a little bit on the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.470
 in front of my head 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.359
 and so that's what it gives to the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.420
 daily to the general I stop there my 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.950
 hair is neither wavy 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.950
 hillis but it suits me perfectly 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.489
 I decided to show you how I 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.140
 realized my curls so that's it 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.360
 simple I come to take a small wick 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.709
 that people are rolling in my sister bed and 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.110
 then I come to make a movement of 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.450
 outward rotation of my face 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.790
 and I slowly go down the straightener 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:19.850
 and you see that as and when 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.500
 loop is forming we must be careful 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.569
 make the loops outward and 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.160
 not the inside of your head that 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.290
 will give a result a little bit more 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.110
 pretty and also to take wicks that 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.549
 not too big or too thin 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.170
 so for the whole of my head I have 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.860
 for ten minutes it's very fast 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.269
 and the effect is rather satisfactory 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.140
 the end result is something 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.600
 that I like a lot 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.160
 to finish i just just spend my 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.290
 hand in the hair to deconstruct 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.090
 a little bit the loops and removed themselves 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.670
 Collate a little too well done if 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.660
 I can say that gives a result a 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.660
 little bit more natural 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.709
 and finally I come to fix everything with the 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.689
 lacquer elnett from l'orÃ©al that 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.310
 I appreciate because she is withdrawing from 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.819
 hair in a brush stroke and at the same 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.290
 time she perfectly sets the curls 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.489
 so that's the result you see that 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.590
 it's something that's fast 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.670
 simple I have no secret it's 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.200
 something that is really 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.209
 accessible to everyone I you 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.190
 the insured I am absolutely nil in 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.419
 hairstyle so if I get there you can 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.610
 quite do it and well here you are 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.680
 have now all about the care and 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.270
 I believe in my hair I wanted 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.710
 also clarified that I never 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.050
 made of colors it is of course my 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.820
 natural color that you see at 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.440
 every time and I think I would 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.760
 the day when really day over too 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.410
 choice and that I will have white hair 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.940
 but here it is I can really do myself 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.520
 keep my color and I think that's 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.169
 also that the secret to have also 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.160
 beautiful hair if you can avoid 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.139
 to color your hair 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.090
 do it because it will only damage 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.979
 your hair even if then you to you 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.330
 apply a whole lot of care left 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.979
 natural waters that's really the 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.169
 best advice I can give you 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.090
 avoid as much as possible any source of 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.720
 heat that it's her smooth hair 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.310
 hours etc 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.449
 I like to make my curls but 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.039
 it's really from time to time 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.289
 absolutely not something I do 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.419
 in everyday life so just leave 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.770
 live your hair and he will leave 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.780
 really much better 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.460
 on that it's time for me to you 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.780
 let me hope this video you 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.250
 will be pleased if ever this is the case 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.080
 do not hesitate to put some more 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.910
 in the air and as always until the 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.300
