00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.290
 heat recovery units can be impress at different places 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.629
 applied 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:11.969
 the heat from the shower water can easily be reused 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:15.629
 the same applies to the heat in the air 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.650
 via a VAT unit in the ventilation system of a home 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.810
 it is great to pre-heat the air supply 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.270
 in this instructional film, we follow peat engineers 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.730
 ventilation technology 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.199
 during the assembly of 3d tv jones in the new residential tower in spijkenisse 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.720
 It is important to build or check the tire drawing 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.370
 on which the ttp sport unit mounted has sufficient mass 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.030
 also check whether the location of the stop was responsible for the air supply and 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.280
 the air 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.260
 match the location of the back toe and air supply channels 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.580
 in this case it is necessary to turn the unit 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.580
 and make the necessary changes 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.800
 to 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.570
 7 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.570
 8 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.180
 8 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.840
 daughter not to be used was one of the bottom of the unit kraft 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.189
 see if in deventer where the units should be hung 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.070
 and electricity 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.370
 the connection is present in the right place check the plug of the 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.050
 unit in this case p index is of the same type as the band contact east 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.320
 The internet and the source of the plug is a separate table 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.370
 switch to the rules 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.340
 you can start the assembly 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.070
 the pole on the basis of the building plans the location of the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.910
 mounting set on the fire because earlier mounting set can be adjusted to the wall 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.120
 only afterwards is it donated headlined mounting kit 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.310
 exclusively cut to the shank 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.830
 placed a fire facility in both the bank and drain 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.459
 the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.040
 No 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.900
 because there is also a non-return valve in the connecting piece do not use screws 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.139
 and to fix the connector 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.630
 This can affect the operation of grandchildren 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.240
 that also that I have a little west direction is mounted 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.310
 mount inwards at the supply channel and outwards at the drain channel 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.220
 the flexible sawing pipe from outside air and the flexible 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.020
 drain pipes to the outside of the units the flexible drain pipes to the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.090
 shaft channels 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.720
 also function as silencers this camper are suitable for it 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.950
 transport of tours laid 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.209
 this is how the suction and discharge piping learns with thermal insulation 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.489
 and worked insulation distance and vapor barrier film layer set it 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.799
 sticker of the fire damper so that the residents can see that it is mounted 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.889
 now handle the construction of the drains 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:19.499
 and today supply channels against the ceiling and this approach closes the PVV 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.340
 has 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.120
 place between with supply and supply system of the house 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.399
 zeitung and the cup wins jones 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:32.149
 an acoustic denver suitable for the unit with a length of at least three 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:33.339
 meter 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.860
 for the proper functioning of the ventilation system in the home 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.860
 it is important to mark the connections well here too 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.379
 to prevent the intake of false air 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.129
 finally assemble the hose from the condensation drain between a long time of 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.980
 the unit and make sure that there are slim lines on the side of the appearance 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.649
 outside of the siphon bend 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:06.589
 the unit is now ready to be set up 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:11.759
 I plug in there for the perimeter plug in this time period check socket 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:15.189
 or the fans running in the different positions high 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.939
 management layers 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:21.469
 The ventilation quantity of the DVD unit is set to one as standard 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.800
 certain amount of cubic meters of air per hour 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.110
 check the manufacturer's manual for this depending on the exact one 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.069
 situation to get the desired amount of air on site 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.319
 the unit must be controlled to 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:40.389
 time before the supply grids in all rooms are opened 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.229
 then close all windows and exterior doors 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.150
 and also closes all interior doors 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.490
 set the fan to the high position 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.050
 both as a rule, it is intended that the valves are as far as possible 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.610
 being open how far they are open the less resistance to race and the lower 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.110
 the noise level 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.779
 The speed of this unit can then be set lower 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:10.629
 you control between stopping speed of the DVD now checking with a on 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:14.219
 ventilate a nice meter of the amount of air over the supply in the 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.650
 different spaces 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.650
 I determine which valve has the most resistance 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.360
 this valve remains fully open 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.430
 If the air quantity over most supply valve in no more than 5 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.270
 percent up or down from the design earth 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.840
 you can suffice with adjusting the supply valves to an optimum 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.169
 situation has been reached 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.020
 finally check the air quantity of all vents again
