00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:03.710 
okay so this is the nog blinder Road

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.980 
okay so this is the nog blinder Road
we've<00:00:04.710> got<00:00:04.859> two<00:00:05.759> front<00:00:06.120> lights<00:00:06.359> on<00:00:06.629> this<00:00:06.750> one

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
we've got two front lights on this one

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.680 
we've got two front lights on this one
it<00:00:07.649> comes<00:00:07.799> with<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.069> helmet<00:00:08.550> mounting<00:00:09.059> bracket

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.049 

the<00:00:12.690> speck<00:00:13.200> on<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> side<00:00:13.769> actually<00:00:14.519> here<00:00:14.730> we

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
the speck on the side actually here we

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.510 
the speck on the side actually here we
have<00:00:15.210> what<00:00:15.599> most<00:00:15.929> narrow<00:00:16.350> beam<00:00:16.650> high<00:00:17.160> beam

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
have what most narrow beam high beam

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.939 
have what most narrow beam high beam
dual<00:00:17.940> beam<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.480> all<00:00:18.750> they<00:00:18.869> classed<00:00:19.170> as<00:00:19.350> an<00:00:19.470> eco

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
dual beam and all they classed as an eco

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.070 
dual beam and all they classed as an eco
flash<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> instead<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.330> get<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> full<00:00:24.750> mounting

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
flash so instead you get a full mounting

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140 
flash so instead you get a full mounting
kit<00:00:25.289> helmet<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.099> your<00:00:26.519> bike<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
kit helmet and your bike it's a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.320 
kit helmet and your bike it's a
quick-release<00:00:27.599> system<00:00:28.519> it's<00:00:29.519> also<00:00:29.670> USB

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
quick-release system it's also USB

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.860 
quick-release system it's also USB
rechargeable<00:00:30.830> so<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.189> 200<00:00:32.540> lumens<00:00:33.540> on

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
rechargeable so we have 200 lumens on

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.220 
rechargeable so we have 200 lumens on
the<00:00:34.170> peak<00:00:34.440> setting<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.489> which<00:00:35.820> is

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
the peak setting for this which is

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.880 
the peak setting for this which is
incredibly<00:00:37.230> bright

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
incredibly bright

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.190

thing on enough then you've also got the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.499 
thing on enough then you've also got the
quick-release<00:01:15.930> system<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.680> which<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
quick-release system here which is

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.460 
quick-release system here which is
pretty<00:01:18.509> straightforward<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
pretty straightforward it's just a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.590 
pretty straightforward it's just a
simple<00:01:20.090> simple<00:01:21.090> wrap<00:01:21.270> round<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.259> clip<00:01:23.600> see

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
simple simple wrap round so clip see

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.850 
simple simple wrap round so clip see
there<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.049> go<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.780> like<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.470> switch<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.770> on

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
there you go so like so to switch it on

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.620 
there you go so like so to switch it on
hold<00:01:29.310> down<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.329> bump

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
hold down the the bump

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.780 
hold down the the bump
two<00:01:30.750> seconds<00:01:32.450> straightaway<00:01:33.450> see<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.290> that's

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
two seconds straightaway see that that's

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.170 
two seconds straightaway see that that's
pretty<00:01:35.790> pretty<00:01:36.360> pretty<00:01:37.110> actually

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
pretty pretty pretty actually

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.789 
pretty pretty pretty actually
so<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.049> first<00:01:40.320> setting<00:01:40.680> will<00:01:42.409> give<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.500> one

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
so that first setting will give you one

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.789 
so that first setting will give you one
one<00:01:44.250> light<00:01:44.490> initially<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:46.200> go<00:01:46.590> through

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
one light initially you go through

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.160 
one light initially you go through
settings<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> got<00:01:47.689> second<00:01:48.689> bottom<00:01:48.930> which

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
settings and you got second bottom which

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.210 
settings and you got second bottom which
will<00:01:49.439> switch<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> light<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> other<00:01:50.850> side

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
will switch the light to the other side

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.530 
will switch the light to the other side
again<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> same<00:01:53.759> brightness<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.390> mean

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
again it's the same brightness I mean

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.690 
again it's the same brightness I mean
it's<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.829> give<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.920> another<00:01:56.100> option<00:01:56.340> really

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it's just give you another option really

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.639 
it's just give you another option really
of<00:01:56.759> which<00:01:56.939> which<00:01:57.329> side<00:01:57.570> maybe<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.110> Le<00:01:58.409> deal

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
of which which side maybe one Le deal

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.300 
of which which side maybe one Le deal
don't<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.229> your<00:02:01.590> dual<00:02:02.130> beam

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
don't know you then have your dual beam

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.880 
don't know you then have your dual beam
setting<00:02:02.759> which<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.409> pretty<00:02:04.409> good

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
setting which is pretty good

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.229 
when you're in the flash mode setting
you've<00:02:21.750> also<00:02:21.870> got<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.349> high<00:02:22.799> you<00:02:23.760> see<00:02:24.000> here's

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
you've also got this high you see here's

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.449 
you've also got this high you see here's
the<00:02:24.510> high<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:24.989> low<00:02:25.110> beam<00:02:25.379> option<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.159> the<00:02:26.250> left

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
the high and low beam option on the left

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.119 
the high and low beam option on the left
so<00:02:27.360> if<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.049> go<00:02:28.140> for<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.440> one<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.980> can

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
so if you go for that one you can

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.410 
so if you go for that one you can
actually<00:02:29.220> create<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.610> solid<00:02:29.790> state<00:02:30.180> light

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
actually create a solid state light

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.539 
actually create a solid state light
whilst<00:02:30.930> your<00:02:31.110> other<00:02:31.230> one<00:02:31.409> does<00:02:32.040> continue<00:02:32.519> to

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
whilst your other one does continue to

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.430 
whilst your other one does continue to
flash<00:02:32.849> which<00:02:33.209> means<00:02:33.450> you've<00:02:33.989> always<00:02:34.140> got<00:02:34.409> that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
flash which means you've always got that

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.720 
flash which means you've always got that
solid<00:02:34.709> light<00:02:35.010> which<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.340> obvious<00:02:35.579> you're

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
solid light which is obvious you're

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.649 
solid light which is obvious you're
quiet<00:02:35.940> or<00:02:36.239> Road<00:02:36.930> use<00:02:38.150> when<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.209> go<00:02:39.329> through

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
quiet or Road use when you go through

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.110 
quiet or Road use when you go through
your<00:02:40.019> other<00:02:40.560> settings<00:02:41.069> then<00:02:41.340> again<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.940> see

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
your other settings then again you see

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.780 
your other settings then again you see
there's<00:02:43.700> high<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.849> low<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.629> you<00:02:46.290> just<00:02:46.790> switch

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
there's high and low so you just switch

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.420 
there's high and low so you just switch
between<00:02:48.000> those<00:02:48.500> it's<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.650> there's<00:02:49.829> quite<00:02:50.400> a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
between those it's a there's quite a

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.770 
between those it's a there's quite a
difference<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:51.560> second<00:02:52.560> set<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:52.950> same

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
difference and second set in the same
