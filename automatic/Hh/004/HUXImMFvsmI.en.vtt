 he 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.910
 fst 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.210
 several times a year we do it 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.550
 come home 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.330
 we lock from our room 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.410
 trying to forget everything that happened during the day 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.720
 if the memory is the most piquant 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.540
 moment who were in class 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.040
 stories we take out dusty books 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.930
 politicians of the eighteenth 19 th 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.480
 centuries 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.439
 We climb encyclopedias and then we launch new 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.880
 player paradox idea to build a base 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.230
 where it is not necessary to frantically click the mouse and 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.410
 pounding the keys here is only needed 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.460
 ready typical battle mind and this time 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520
 our brain is opposed to the project 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.600
 Victoria 2 continued one of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.780
 best global strategy on the engine 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.780
 Victory Day approx 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.830
 every year increases new 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.830
 a generation of players who are not at all 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.110
 represent what it is global 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.530
 strategy paradox 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.310
 genre on the one hand is like the one that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.070
 civilizations like a big map which 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.880
 then regions yes cities politics 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.980
 however go up to the mayor deep to he littered 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.910
 just friendly but deeply dynamic tpu 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.920
 paradox is not about any simplicity and speech 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.820
 does not go game looks or otherwise 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.420
 grin three years winking 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.770
 ask what fears that this window 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.790
 and plus we are not building states with 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.190
 zero give us countries with reality of that 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.580
 the period in which we play if you choose 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.780
 England of 1832 then we have Canada and India 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.060
 russia australia led by 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.460
 the richest country with a magnificent fleet 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.060
 Russiaâ€™s realities are completely different, and 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.380
 Zimbabwe does not seem at all 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.549
 and when the player is not passed avis happy and 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.950
 first gets on the global map this 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.219
 not just lost he starts thinking that 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:55.570
 this game is in all 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.890
 peak there is nothing here 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.180
 because to all those who played paradox 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.930
 stranger veto and the very first thing 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.310
 go to training mode he 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.180
 here is not for show and did not reveal how 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.720
 most training modes 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.119
 click yes it was a matter of moving forward 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.490
 now wait a minute one by one 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.590
 clever 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.629
 here everything is serious learning allows 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.140
 excellent concept friend and much faster neither 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.039
 get comfortable 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.959
 I recommend it even to those who played before 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.029
 only in the days of victory for the local 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:25.639
 globality is somewhat different 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.579
 pretty preface what is 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.369
 a victoria 2 as you see 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.439
 developers left only one 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.539
 a company that starts in 1830 sixth 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:35.100
 year 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.950
 I, too, could not begin before with the aim of countries 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.320
 also there is a third stage the main task 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.400
 to break the lead in countries 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.830
 smaller who can never 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.630
 beat England too task at all 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.929
 illusory you came up with yourself 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.249
 for example for china it might be a seizure 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:52.419
 all of asia for colombia submission 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.749
 south america 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.999
 lack of goals blurs a little 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.949
 gaming experience and makes gaming 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:59.459
 strange process 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.209
 Look, we really have nothing 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.559
 we are doing work and everything is great 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.959
 treasury money street and the royal family already 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.929
 Tomorrow no gold at all 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:08.779
 of problems 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.199
 all other countries are different here 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.209
 full stagnation if nothing themselves 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.349
 let's take this game will not push us to 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.909
 decisive action 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.069
 Colombia's historic way too 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.249
 calm 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.089
 because you have to be ready to entertain yourself 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:23.489
 alone here if you choose Austria 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.379
 then think how to make 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.189
 until 1914 they captured the Balkans 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.099
 how not to let russia stop you when 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.709
 speaks about the fact that she did not climb in 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.249
 continental disassembly and even the most 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:35.859
 small countries can be developed and 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.000
 move forward 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.250
 if you try, there are goals and make 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.189
 monster worse than france 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.859
 just remember to do everything 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.909
 the game itself is so entertaining 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.569
 historical events and pretty 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.869
 a lot of ban on literature country 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.119
 the case of kings and the danger of rebellion 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:54.099
 illegal shipments however what bad are they 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.650
 often repeated and already 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.699
 routine becomes every time to give 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.930
 orders again leads to an answer 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.309
 state literature will help the tenth time 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.029
 we say that those who read it are necessary to hang them 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:07.039
 the police is understood far from the first 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.919
 times and by the way the main difference 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.519
 greece victory day is that here we are 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.859
 do more economics and 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.629
 government policy and not war 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.979
 however, the developers have somewhat reduced 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.579
 our ability to direct control 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.759
 state of the plant is now building 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.000
 capitalists we ourselves often can not 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.250
 and estates that live their lives we 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.200
 do not interfere 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.850
 the country is developing and we just set the course 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.680
 we say what to do and how 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.749
 it will not end up with us 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.779
 however, new chips do not completely remove 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:36.639
 developers of flaws 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.869
 current victoria abound one of 

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:40.869
 these are constant uprisings which are not 

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:43.210
 gives rest every year more and more 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.990
 india art also sometimes shines 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.759
 absurd ideas and capitalists 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.600
 deals entirely with Venus they help 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.689
 our country is flourishing 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:52.900
 Victoria 2 is still part of a very raw 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.800
 but already quite playable in depth 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.000
 diversity and you can not say it 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.729
 here is more than enough 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.639
 fan of such strategies i am still 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.020
 would advise to wait a little 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.780
 packs a couple more packs lecture hall 2 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.780
 it will be just wonderful 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.789
 didn't blame the air forces around 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.479
 m 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.180
 Us decided to culture 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.110
 on an agreement 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.569
 foot width 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.300
 it's time to be 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.300
 but there is a note 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:51.319
 former prosecutor beat 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:57.270
 There are also enterprises 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.749
 with 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:01.749
 total design gas 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.419
 GDP in Russia 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.809
 not 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:11.809
 last weekend 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:18.039
 GDP decline 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:23.599
 ffr all other 60 questions 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:26.609
