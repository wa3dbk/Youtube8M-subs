00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.790
 hi hello again cause me glad 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.059
 very much to be with you in preparation 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.890
 to see the topic of today is 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:12.260
 transport of carbon dioxide 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.790
 transportation of co2 I recommend you to 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.620
 they've seen it in the transport video of 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.839
 oxygen first check it for 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.380
 understand this topic in a very much 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:23.089
 simplest brings to you the day 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.819
 today to explain this topic a 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.189
 very simple diagram films is this 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:31.309
 figurine that is here as in the form of 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.020
 balloon is representing the bird or 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.930
 fact is representing all the 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.810
 alveoli of our organism of those of 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.050
 the two lungs and here naturally 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.840
 the heart the pulmonary artery that carries 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.210
 blood from the venous event and 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.310
 the pulmonary veins that carry the 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.770
 blood that has been oxygen the truth 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.829
 it would just happen the capillary process 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.800
 then this would be the capillary here in the 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.460
 heart then the aortic artery goes out x 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.680
 you know all the divisions 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.350
 and finally we arrived here to a system 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.220
 capillary would almost continue to the artery 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.229
 hard and here we have a capillary system 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.509
 this part will be the capillary system this 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.509
 circuit that is here is the erythrocytes 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.880
 and here the venous return through 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:23.229
 the veins here are reaching the heart 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.110
 well then it is grateful verte 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.200
 end of the horse is the tissue 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.830
 represents the tissues that, like you, 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.429
 they know in our body the tissues 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.440
 they are constantly producing that 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:41.649
 carbon dioxide carbon dioxide 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.259
 co2 in the aerobic metabolism in the 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.220
 routes of aerobic metabolism as one 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.570
 of the waste is carbon dioxide 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.780
 so I'm talking about metabolism 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.450
 aerobic done I want to start the class 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.560
 talking and remembering a little about 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.630
 oxygen delivery how much oxygen 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.510
 we delivered remember remember we mentioned 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.400
 in the first part of the class 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.400
 who 100 milliliters of blood 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.660
 100 milliliters of blood with one 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.510
 15 gram hemoglobin 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.010
 per 100 milliliters and taking into 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:26.810
 account that one gram of hemoglobin 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:31.390
 transports around 1.34 milliliters 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.600
 of oxygen under physiological conditions 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.569
 a person has as is a sample of 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.500
 blood a person of 100 milliliters and 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:45.240
 we could suppose in this case what 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.930
 that has a hemoglobin of 15 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:53.460
 and 15 grams and we know that one gram of 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.550
 hemoglobin transporting 1.34 milliliters 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.900
 of oxygen is to say that 15 grams of 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:05.160
 hemoglobin would transport around 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.150
 20 points per milliliter 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.510
 from oxy 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:16.060
 in other words in 100 milliliters of 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.519
 blood there are 20.1 milliliters of oxygen 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.159
 we also saw that not only 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.859
 the oxygen bound to hemoglobin is the 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:26.799
 that is transported there is also oxygen 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:29.109
 dissolved in the term but it is a 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.209
 very small amount I will not have it in 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.680
 account at this time because 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.349
 I'm just going to talk about volume 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.530
 now that we saw that the blood that came out 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:42.859
 from here already oxygenated with 20 milliliters 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.700
 for every 100, he went to the 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.980
 tissues 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.769
 was going to make the tissues then 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.690
 in the tissues it came with a 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.680
 saturation of around 100 per 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.650
 cent to the tissues and left remind 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.840
 as soon as I arrived here after passing 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.410
 the capillary system and deliver the oxygen 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.660
 it came out with a saturation of 75 per 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.390
 hundred in the fact of the here by 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.819
 arrived with 100 percent around the 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.879
 100 percent and here I went with 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.160
 about 75 percent to be 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:21.760
 again oxygenated is to say that I lost 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.630
 as soon as a 25 percent zhang's 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.000
 oxygen sorry do not miss me oxy 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.449
 when I delivered 25 percent of the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.930
 oxygen that it brought and if it is and if we have 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.949
 in account that brought 20 milliliters 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.110
 do not forget do not forget in every 100 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.840
 tenths to bring 20 milliliters is 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.419
 say that he came out with only 15 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.160
 milliliters 75 percent of 20 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.980
 milliliters 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:56.590
 it is not difficult to assume that he delivered 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:05:00.130
 the tissues 5 milliliters 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.140
 nothing complex truth a brief summary the 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.420
 blood came with 20 milliliters of 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.320
 oxygen hemoglobin for every 100 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.870
 milliliters of blood a saturation of 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.930
 100% when delivered to the tissues of the 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.360
 oxygen was saturated up to 75 percent 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:21.230
 that is to say between 25 percent of the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:25.700
 oxygen that of 20 would be 5 milliliters 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:29.420
 very simple 5 milliliters of oxygen is 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.979
 delivered to tissues per 100 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.389
 milliliters of blood 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.610
 we continue a little bit with the numbers 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.740
 because I'm interested in the end of making a 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.150
 contrast all this way is for something 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.460
 very simple at the end they are going to give 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.349
 account but I want us to do that 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.970
 small contrast like to have a 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.680
 clear idea of what it is that 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.430
 constantly happening 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.430
 our organism
