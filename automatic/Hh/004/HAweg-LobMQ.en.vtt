00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
and one of the steps is talking about

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.440 
and one of the steps is talking about
how<00:02:50.940> we<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.330> life<00:02:51.570> through<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:52.080> larger<00:02:53.010> lens

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
eternal lens and when that when that

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.800 
eternal lens and when that when that
teaching<00:02:57.300> came<00:02:57.570> through<00:02:59.030> that<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.540> was

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
teaching came through that really was

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.440 
teaching came through that really was
quite<00:03:01.200> powerful<00:03:01.950> for<00:03:02.220> me<00:03:02.250> because<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.000> helped

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
quite powerful for me because it helped

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.510 
quite powerful for me because it helped
me<00:03:03.540> take<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.930> blinders<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.770> life<00:03:04.950> on<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.370> look

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
me take the blinders of life on and look

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.670 
me take the blinders of life on and look
at<00:03:05.670> things<00:03:05.970> from<00:03:06.060> almost<00:03:07.020> having<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.380> wider

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
at things from almost having a wider

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.240 
at things from almost having a wider
angle<00:03:07.890> lens<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.780> was<00:03:09.900> able<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.350> really<00:03:10.890> see

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
angle lens and I was able to really see

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.160 
angle lens and I was able to really see
things<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:11.730> life<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.090> process<00:03:12.540> them<00:03:12.720> in<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.020> in

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
things in life and process them in it in

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.690 
things in life and process them in it in
a<00:03:13.530> different<00:03:13.739> way<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.250> things<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:14.670> I

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
a different way and things that I

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.010 
a different way and things that I
probably<00:03:15.000> would<00:03:15.239> have<00:03:15.330> viewed<00:03:15.510> as<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.720> setback

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
probably would have viewed as a setback

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.199 
probably would have viewed as a setback
or<00:03:16.380> challenge<00:03:16.770> in<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.980> past<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:17.880> believe

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
or challenge in the past so I believe

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.660 
or challenge in the past so I believe
this<00:03:18.540> perspectives<00:03:19.320> gained<00:03:19.709> through<00:03:20.550> the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
this perspectives gained through the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.180 
this perspectives gained through the
careful<00:03:20.910> study<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.450> these<00:03:21.780> teachings<00:03:22.190> really

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
careful study of these teachings really

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.789
