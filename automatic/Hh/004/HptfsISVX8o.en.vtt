00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.290 
keys series okay so we're gonna talk
about<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.389> key<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.990> b-flat<00:00:16.230> real<00:00:16.710> quick<00:00:16.920> and

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
about the key of b-flat real quick and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.339 
about the key of b-flat real quick and
first<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.390> all<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:18.599> need<00:00:18.689> to<00:00:18.810> figure<00:00:19.020> out<00:00:19.110> what

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
first of all we need to figure out what

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.160 
first of all we need to figure out what
the<00:00:19.410> key<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.619> b-flat<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.000> know<00:00:21.170> let's

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the key of b-flat is so we know let's

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.290 
the key of b-flat is so we know let's
start<00:00:22.349> on<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> b-flat<00:00:22.860> on<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.610> second<00:00:24.029> string

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
start on a b-flat on the second string

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.700 
start on a b-flat on the second string
first<00:00:24.630> fret<00:00:25.550> okay<00:00:26.550> we're<00:00:27.239> an<00:00:27.300> ace<00:00:27.509> sharp<00:00:27.869> but

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.350 
first fret okay we're an ace sharp but
this<00:00:29.189> key<00:00:29.399> doesn't<00:00:29.579> work<00:00:29.700> out<00:00:29.910> too<00:00:30.059> well<00:00:30.090> in

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
this key doesn't work out too well in

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.760 
this key doesn't work out too well in
the<00:00:30.450> key<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.869> sharp<00:00:31.230> when<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.529> start

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
the key of a sharp when you start

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.910 
the key of a sharp when you start
mapping<00:00:32.369> out<00:00:32.669> all<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.000> letters<00:00:33.530> it<00:00:34.530> gets<00:00:34.680> kind

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
mapping out all the letters it gets kind

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.920 
mapping out all the letters it gets kind
of<00:00:34.980> confused<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.000> try<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.510> if<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.719> want

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
of confused you can try that if you want

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.970 
of confused you can try that if you want
to<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.170> we're<00:00:37.260> gonna<00:00:37.410> call<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.649> key<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.860> E

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980

finishing<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.329> b-flat<00:01:01.820> okay<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.210> start

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
finishing on b-flat okay or we can start

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.899 
finishing on b-flat okay or we can start
on<00:01:03.510> B<00:01:03.690> flat<00:01:03.720> on<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> sixth<00:01:05.339> fret<00:01:05.519> top<00:01:05.850> string

and play the major scale the major

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.280 
and play the major scale the major
pattern<00:01:14.030> okay<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.510> can<00:01:15.630> learn<00:01:16.050> that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
pattern okay and you can learn that

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.040 
pattern okay and you can learn that
pattern<00:01:16.620> by<00:01:16.770> looking<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:18.030> scale<00:01:18.510> videos<00:01:18.840> on

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
pattern by looking at my scale videos on

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.530 
pattern by looking at my scale videos on
the<00:01:19.110> major<00:01:19.290> scale<00:01:19.909> okay<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.240> know<00:01:21.420> what

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the major scale okay so now we know what

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.300 
the major scale okay so now we know what
notes<00:01:21.750> are<00:01:21.870> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> key<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.200> B<00:01:22.290> flat<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.040> if

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
notes are in the key of B flat so if

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.730 
notes are in the key of B flat so if
you're<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.210> you're<00:01:24.270> transposing<00:01:25.080> music<00:01:25.440> or<00:01:25.620> if
