me<00:00:00.329> and<00:00:00.480> following<00:00:00.840> this<00:00:01.079> case<00:00:01.410> has<00:00:02.220> been<00:00:02.520> the

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
me and following this case has been the

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.110 
me and following this case has been the
way<00:00:02.760> tim<00:00:03.030> has<00:00:03.240> handled<00:00:03.659> it<00:00:03.920> I<00:00:04.970> told<00:00:05.970> him

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
way tim has handled it I told him

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.760 
way tim has handled it I told him
earlier<00:00:06.210> today<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:06.930> think<00:00:07.290> if<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.470> had<00:00:07.620> been

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
earlier today that I think if I had been

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.370 
earlier today that I think if I had been
in<00:00:07.799> issues<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.429> can't<00:00:08.639> imagine<00:00:09.230> I've<00:00:10.230> been

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
in issues and I can't imagine I've been

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.009 
in issues and I can't imagine I've been
in<00:00:10.500> issues<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.040> think<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.429> would<00:00:11.610> have<00:00:11.759> just<00:00:12.030> once

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
in issues I think I would have just once

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.930 
in issues I think I would have just once
the<00:00:13.200> exoneration<00:00:13.710> finally<00:00:14.429> occurred<00:00:14.730> would

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the exoneration finally occurred would

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.400 
the exoneration finally occurred would
go<00:00:15.089> around<00:00:15.210> running<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.809> screaming<00:00:16.049> and

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
go around running and screaming and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.900 
go around running and screaming and
yelling<00:00:16.560> at<00:00:16.770> everybody<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.220> could<00:00:17.490> see<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.670> would

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
yelling at everybody I could see I would

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.189 
yelling at everybody I could see I would
take<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.210> pickup<00:00:18.510> truck<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.900> would<00:00:19.020> drive

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
take my pickup truck and I would drive

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.570 
take my pickup truck and I would drive
it<00:00:19.350> through<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> front<00:00:19.770> door<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> Justice

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
it through the front door of the Justice

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.400 
it through the front door of the Justice
Center<00:00:22.160> he<00:00:23.160> has<00:00:23.340> not<00:00:23.519> done<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.760> he<00:00:24.060> said<00:00:24.410> he

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
Center he has not done that he said he

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.000 
Center he has not done that he said he
has<00:00:25.740> handled<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:27.390> grave<00:00:28.019> injustice<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.980> we

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
has handled this grave injustice and we

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.550 
has handled this grave injustice and we
can't<00:00:29.310> imagine<00:00:29.840> greatness<00:00:30.840> extraordinarily

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
can't imagine greatness extraordinarily

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.160 
can't imagine greatness extraordinarily
well<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.910> think<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.780> would<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> good

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
well so I think it would be a good

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.709 
well so I think it would be a good
lesson<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.710> me<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.219> maybe<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.940> us<00:00:36.059> if

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
lesson for me and maybe for all of us if

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.940 
lesson for me and maybe for all of us if

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
have a reliable trial process so the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.420 
have a reliable trial process so the
question<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.509> asking<00:01:25.439> Kevin<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.920> address<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
emotional hardships in jail and how we

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560 
emotional hardships in jail and how we
maintain<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.650> strength<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.250> keep<00:01:29.570> fighting

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
maintain the strength to keep fighting

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.980 
maintain the strength to keep fighting
this<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:31.610> basically<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.700> decade<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.270> prison<00:01:33.299> I

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
this for basically a decade in prison I

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.789 
this for basically a decade in prison I
guess<00:01:35.420> on<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.689> half<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.470> completely

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
guess on the one half I just completely

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.170 
guess on the one half I just completely
shut<00:01:38.070> down<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.369> emotions<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.060> in

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
shut down my emotions when I was in

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.719 
shut down my emotions when I was in
there<00:01:39.360> because<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.770> dwelled<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> fact

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
there because if I dwelled on the fact

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.580 
there because if I dwelled on the fact
that<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:42.810> something<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.350> didn't

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that I was there for something I didn't

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.020 
that I was there for something I didn't
do<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.189> might<00:01:44.399> never<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:44.850> out
