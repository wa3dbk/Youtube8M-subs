of<00:03:59.410> set<00:03:59.709> this<00:03:59.890> beer<00:04:00.190> off<00:04:00.370> into<00:04:00.640> the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
of set this beer off into the

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.630 
of set this beer off into the
stratosphere<00:04:01.030> i<00:04:01.750> think<00:04:02.440> it's<00:04:02.980> kind<00:04:03.459> of

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
stratosphere i think it's kind of

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.680 
stratosphere i think it's kind of
muddled

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
muddled

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.240

maybe<00:04:04.990> a<00:04:05.080> little<00:04:05.470> bit<00:04:05.650> i<00:04:05.680> think<00:04:06.010> the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
maybe a little bit i think the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.950 
maybe a little bit i think the
