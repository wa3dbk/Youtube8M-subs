00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.870
 but here is the shape of a ball Carlo is here you see the Acer Aspire 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.830
 One five or his son is aiming for the target 50 with an ambitious processor 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:13.769
 it has only briefly become important to Berties and it has one 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:14.679
 location 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.199
 the graphics on board at the interest rates are meanwhile also "art i per cent 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:19.689
 not on 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:20.690
 yes the other way round 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.800
 Definitely seeing the PID end we both had Firefox open and we 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.830
 Of course I'm doing the usual test but I'm open here 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.210
 a Zagreb at the Celler in full-hd 10 80 p I'm standing and walking 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.850
 Marked death and you can recognize on the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.230
 HD 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.530
 For thousands of 80 times Ziemer 20 Despres you can see a Full HD picture here 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.990
 but still knows 10 80 p will be missing without problems and beautiful 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.490
 Quality and especially good Freising injuries climb this is a Mazen 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.000
 Because this would not be the crime in Cameron resolution I have to you 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Accordingly, I show I can even tab here again 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.200
 because Firefox New York Times were then even more than even sides 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.030
 the Bulgarian form 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.740
 Reason be on board with percent 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.000
 Schiltz wants to be the hobbit editor of a colleague 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.150
 should try to visit and 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.130
 In the background, the film plays and how can I quite cozy 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.090
 Pulse 4 liters with two fingers the victory sign 8 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.230
 his son devoted 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.840
 it works too 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.090
 I mean that also calls riots again 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.630
 but no longer afraid 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.400
 and Services Provider 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.790
 14 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.820
 Secretary Florian continues and free as much is this around to the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.830
 processor 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.330
 to close the subject then think I've seen how about 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.060
 the resolution looks like 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.430
 wonderful you can view everything and 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.090
 the colors are okay too we have had similarities though 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.240
 written under 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.290
 and yes I am with you but see 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.270
 Zerbst 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.990
 so next we admonish you let the localization 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.280
 more for 2 6 4 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.970
 that's wanted he had to like the artist as percent 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.929
 Picture dpa again 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.149
 beautiful colors does something 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.579
 maybe too bright or the same I do not know 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.059
 How do you think the case might be a little better? 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.689
 Rolf to continue showing actually owned a name here again full-hd everything 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.189
 at the two-door on the Media Player Klassik vom Cinema 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:32.139
 Some like to playfully make us federal and his plans 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.259
 and of course it also has wonderful external could synonymous via HDMI 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.309
 output 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.639
 This motivated run on the man at the mic need to worry about body 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.459
 agreed lad two minutes for number I can you ever here too 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.999
 keep it up because everything just gives up quickly for safety is now games 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.219
 I here you one more 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.219
 a series off 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.989
 and she just wants the multiplayer calm 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.399
 Saying something does not want to react anymore 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.399
 and I do not know why so how the mind would have turned off but 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.989
 where would it come from? 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.010
 Zurich receives the colors show from the left and right but the media player 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.869
 apparently have plays as plumage 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:18.959
 also the sound and yes, in fact, always the display as it looks only fair 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.349
 So from the beginning, the whole thing is going to happen to us at Daimler 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.399
 Kindness if you go a bit too high for it 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.529
 it gets brighter 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.879
 but of course it is crucial that from the side of the page could 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.129
 see 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.400
 one not particularly the will to turn 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.809
 but the picture stays that way 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:35.679
 and 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:38.229
 from one side then also correspond again long time 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:39.639
 with better shape 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.659
 the display can be right after the fourth the EBIT was through the ashes too 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.659
 show but before Konrad set ball so came at the TuS 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.009
 so 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.399
 and Sierre battery life I am playing again for example now 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.919
 Thumann short-term table in the check-in 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.109
 by five hours at 90 percent 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.759
 but we did play the videos so the 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.089
 Processes should be busy 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:05.929
 already our pictures in the amount of Euro 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.529
 if I'm the most significant of the tight no I do not 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:10.579
 no matter 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.290
 here if I go in the Annex Klöcker next LKA Macs press 5-megapixel images 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.489
 wonderfully fast 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.989
 you can see 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.639
 Above all, zooming in on the river Rhine, but unrecognized, was also pushing it around 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.819
 no problem here everything 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.740
 I use it for everything that is locked 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.710
 Dan Photoshop 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.710
 appreciated after and meaningful did not want that maybe it works now 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.620
 Nadal could then without error then I can not do anything 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.889
 and then went on quickly to the compost silent and so 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.639
 Seiser in Wörth I still bolt 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.249
 briefly look at percent 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:47.490
 No we can have will be installed 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.389
 but in itself Perth is yes I know about sporting care to start but 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.210
 the keyboard for a lot of confidence 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.319
 not too loud 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.599
 and 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.750
 one can still prescribe what we prescribe that everything except he judges 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:01.740
 Ovum and yes, we'll do it 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.389
 In addition, counter-strike more Photoshop does not want 10 55 could suitably 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.900
 burglary 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.650
 what a test wrong to give to others of me to find 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.930
 Example since eight Toshiba Randi for over 50 have already been tested with the 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.710
 she ensures 50 processor 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.120
 then we'll take a photo and play a round with the touchpad 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.439
 or we look at the address here now 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.389
 we are premium on this site 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.210
 around March factory longed for USB headphone microphones as well as from the head under 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.880
 Multi-card reader which on the belly 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.880
 more than tourism is for example the exterior and 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.310
 then we put a stop the Japanese can do that was so great 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.860
 you find 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.660
 publish YouTube 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.759
 Vodafone will 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.039
 hdmi-connection what solution shopper priest after order 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.940
 That is, of course, that after time always 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.919
 more usb connections no 2 he can in Trier only two everything 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.860
 around here that was sobering 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.999
 So yes there is the loss 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:04.289
 Percent not so loud so it's usually not on 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.789
 but was still a before and power connection 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.210
 from the outside it looks like this 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.090
 So far, there are a bit of fingerprints on it 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.180
 have complained 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.010
 and the state should have these damper www but they are to blame themselves 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.039
 This construction of the city does not really matter 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.039
 so you do not really see him playing that way now 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.219
 then we play 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.509
 Cameras also explain themselves completely 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.509
 December Heroku to the zone for a higher resolution 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.180
 to deen accordingly 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.180
 the 53 also poses 24 times 600 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.469
 had in the test 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.239
 dpa is not allowed here so Kirner is only eighth at 600 then compare 

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:47.239
 usually with the other 10-inch netbooks looks like 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.199
 and then see as well 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:01.749
 Bachmann 60 players as always 

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:05.780
 and yes because the display would be ideal because it is because he has it 

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:07.349
 the resolution has 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:11.069
 "Unfortunately, USB 3 2 0 is missing, but we only have legs so far 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:16.639
 So the 17 15 Berther looks at the processors that I may be next 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:21.219
 Week to test me buy in dealing Balls sentiment German and similar 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:22.629
 but it still takes time here 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:24.689
 maybe a few weeks 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.349
 respectively 

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:30.069
 Asus said more risky sounds are still to June 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.370
 Mourner even looks the gaming device judder-free 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:38.430
 but we do not have too much portion of image below still flowing 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.430
 I do not know it's a breeze 

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:46.050
 and I'm totally it was already Rupprecht had full 

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:50.309
 Percent, how far does Owen Walker get? 

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:52.619
 and about Bayer 

00:07:52.619 --> 00:07:55.969
 could itself was exactly how many states that he delivers what I say 

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:57.460
 think freely and 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.699
 One can, however, play the multimedia games with what they want 

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:01.740
 the WTV 

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.439
 thank you for watching 

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:06.990
 the Acer Aspire One 5 22 percent 

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.580
 Multimedia hard drive complete that of course you want to look up to 

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.660
 next time 

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.680
 and pushed three more in the world the woman on YouTube
