some egg white so just any way and
they're<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> separate<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> white<00:00:43.950> from

don't<00:00:53.200> need<00:00:53.290> you<00:00:53.380> over<00:00:53.560> there<00:00:53.710> then<00:00:53.950> which<00:00:54.340> way

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
don't need you over there then which way

don't need you over there then which way
this<00:00:54.670> car<00:00:54.910> diversity<00:00:55.390> yet<00:00:57.630> and<00:00:58.630> place<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.320> my

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
this car diversity yet and place the my

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:27.320 
this car diversity yet and place the my
in<00:00:59.829> the<00:00:59.920> mix<00:01:03.510> much

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.460 

now<00:01:28.330> you<00:01:28.420> want<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.750> show<00:01:28.900> you<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.049> little<00:01:29.290> bit

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
now you want to show you a little bit

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.690 
now you want to show you a little bit
longer<00:01:29.619> because<00:01:30.010> you<00:01:30.159> want<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.340> get<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.580> egg

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
longer because you want to get the egg

white<00:01:30.909> in<00:01:31.060> there<00:01:31.180> acts<00:01:31.390> like<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.600> emulsify<00:01:32.229> so

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
white in there acts like a emulsify so

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.390 
white in there acts like a emulsify so
it's<00:01:32.560> going<00:01:32.650> to<00:01:32.710> hold<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:32.979> whole<00:01:33.159> trip

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
it's going to hold the whole trip

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.080 
it's going to hold the whole trip
together<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:34.479> it<00:01:34.600> all<00:01:34.690> we're<00:01:34.840> going<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.020> do<00:01:35.140> is

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
together and it all we're going to do is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.760 
together and it all we're going to do is
double<00:01:37.090> strain<00:01:37.479> it<00:01:37.950> into<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.460> lot<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:40.090> food

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
double strain it into a lot of food

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.200 
double strain it into a lot of food
the<00:01:41.770> reason<00:01:41.979> we've<00:01:42.100> double<00:01:42.310> trained<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.670> is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
the reason we've double trained it is

00:01:43.210 --> 00:02:01.780 
the reason we've double trained it is
without<00:01:43.869> one<00:01:43.960> of<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.170> mix<00:01:44.320> of<00:01:44.440> shot<00:01:44.619> of<00:01:44.800> icing

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.260 

and<00:02:02.790> then<00:02:02.910> we<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.260> jitter
