setup<00:01:30.119> where<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.409> actually<00:01:31.799> pushing

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
setup where if they actually pushing

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.100 
setup where if they actually pushing
they<00:01:32.280> cannot<00:01:32.610> actually<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.630> walls<00:01:33.810> so

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
they cannot actually not on the walls so

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.840 
they cannot actually not on the walls so
that's<00:01:34.290> pretty<00:01:34.530> nice<00:01:35.009> setup<00:01:35.189> gotta<00:01:35.520> say<00:01:35.670> that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
that's pretty nice setup gotta say that

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.789 
that's pretty nice setup gotta say that
and<00:01:36.090> come<00:01:36.630> time<00:01:36.810> seems<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> be<00:01:37.200> working<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
and come time seems to be working of

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.170 
and come time seems to be working of
course<00:01:37.829> carver<00:01:38.280> state<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.030> get

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
course carver state that you have to get

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.270 
course carver state that you have to get
to<00:01:39.299> work<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.750> earn<00:01:40.020> his<00:01:40.560> trust<00:01:40.619> back<00:01:41.100> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
to work to earn his trust back and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.920 
to work to earn his trust back and
everything<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.850> epic<00:01:42.390> lemon<00:01:42.570> times<00:01:42.720> doing

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
everything and epic lemon times doing

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.080 
everything and epic lemon times doing
and<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.649> seemed<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> nice<00:01:44.369> setup<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
and it seemed to have a nice setup to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.219 
and it seemed to have a nice setup to
keep<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> walkers<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.750> because<00:01:45.990> they<00:01:46.049> can't

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
keep the walkers out because they can't

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.800 
keep the walkers out because they can't
actually<00:01:46.439> push<00:01:47.100> down<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.399> wall<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.030> moving<00:01:48.720> on

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
actually push down the wall so moving on

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.569 
actually push down the wall so moving on
here<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.320> Bonnie<00:01:49.680> asking<00:01:50.159> Clementine

then like she's like hey he's not a camp

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.899 
then like she's like hey he's not a camp
it's<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.020> prison<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.369> pretty<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.640> is

it's like prison and you pretty much is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.219 
it's like prison and you pretty much is
because<00:01:57.149> they<00:01:57.390> make<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> forcing<00:01:58.110> her<00:01:58.200> to

because they make the forcing her to
work<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.040> treating<00:01:59.399> her<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.520> crap<00:01:59.880> and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
work and the treating her like crap and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.660 
work and the treating her like crap and
everything<00:02:00.200> now<00:02:01.200> over<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.799> come<00:02:02.579> in

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
she is doing this is probably an escape

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.050 
she is doing this is probably an escape
plan<00:02:49.740> probably<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.310> steal<00:02:50.550> something<00:02:50.910> which

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
plan probably to steal something which

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.580 
plan probably to steal something which
is<00:02:51.150> pretty<00:02:51.330> interesting<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.900> see<00:02:52.080> couldn't

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
actually asking bonnie bonnie seems to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.420 
actually asking bonnie bonnie seems to
be<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.660> nice<00:02:55.080> person<00:02:55.140> she<00:02:55.680> don't<00:02:55.830> want<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.190> be

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
just like him and everything but even

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.140 
just like him and everything but even
though<00:04:23.220> he's<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.370> good<00:04:23.550> character<00:04:23.729> don't<00:04:24.000> want

and<00:04:35.219> actually<00:04:36.120> being<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.509> then<00:04:36.599> you<00:04:36.719> had<00:04:36.870> to

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
radios from Tavia you to take over there

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:43.879 
radios from Tavia you to take over there
in<00:04:42.659> the<00:04:42.719> background<00:04:42.870> not<00:04:43.529> paying<00:04:43.770> attention

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
in the background not paying attention

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.399 
in the background not paying attention
that<00:04:44.249> gives<00:04:44.400> clementine<00:04:44.879> and<00:04:45.319> opening<00:04:46.319> to

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:46.409 
that gives clementine and opening to

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:47.989 
that gives clementine and opening to
actually<00:04:46.680> store<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.889> radios<00:04:47.249> now<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.819> see

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:47.999 
actually store the radios now you see

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:49.670 
actually store the radios now you see
they<00:04:48.120> have<00:04:48.240> multiple<00:04:48.719> ones<00:04:48.900> being<00:04:49.229> charged

they have multiple ones being charged

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.170 
they have multiple ones being charged
now<00:04:49.770> they<00:04:49.860> probably<00:04:49.979> make<00:04:50.430> everyone<00:04:50.969> in<00:04:50.999> the

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
now they probably make everyone in the

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.570 
now they probably make everyone in the
camp<00:04:51.389> most<00:04:51.930> likely<00:04:52.139> everyone<00:04:52.560> probably<00:04:53.099> just

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
camp most likely everyone probably just

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.129 
camp most likely everyone probably just
a<00:04:53.669> lawyer<00:04:53.879> one<00:04:54.029> carry<00:04:54.300> around<00:04:54.389> radios<00:04:54.840> just<00:04:55.050> in

a lawyer one carry around radios just in

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.689 
a lawyer one carry around radios just in
case<00:04:55.289> they<00:04:55.499> get<00:04:55.680> have<00:04:56.159> any<00:04:56.340> trouble<00:04:56.610> or

case they get have any trouble or
anything<00:04:56.729> now<00:04:57.060> coming<00:04:57.300> times<00:04:57.419> probably<00:04:57.659> gonna

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:57.749 
anything now coming times probably gonna

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:00.019 
anything now coming times probably gonna
steal<00:04:57.990> one<00:04:58.169> just<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.800> listen<00:04:58.979> in<00:04:59.279> on<00:04:59.520> what<00:04:59.879> they

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:00.029 
steal one just to listen in on what they

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.420 
steal one just to listen in on what they
got<00:05:00.180> to<00:05:00.270> say<00:05:00.300> because<00:05:00.830> obviously<00:05:01.830> if<00:05:02.189> you<00:05:02.250> want

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
got to say because obviously if you want

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.769 
got to say because obviously if you want
to<00:05:02.490> be<00:05:02.580> stealthy<00:05:02.819> and<00:05:03.000> everything<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.419> do<00:05:03.599> not

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:03.779 
to be stealthy and everything you do not

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:06.080 
to be stealthy and everything you do not
want<00:05:04.169> to<00:05:04.439> actually<00:05:05.159> talk<00:05:05.460> on<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.669> radio<00:05:05.759> could

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
want to actually talk on the radio could

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.760 
want to actually talk on the radio could
they<00:05:06.330> will<00:05:06.539> figure<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.259> out<00:05:07.319> and<00:05:07.650> everything

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
they will figure it out and everything

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.769 
they will figure it out and everything
so<00:05:08.189> she<00:05:08.639> probably<00:05:08.789> still<00:05:09.150> want<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.389> listen<00:05:09.509> in

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
so she probably still want to listen in

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.450 
so she probably still want to listen in
probably<00:05:10.259> like<00:05:10.439> use<00:05:11.069> it<00:05:11.189> to<00:05:11.310> her<00:05:11.430> advantage

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
probably like use it to her advantage

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.909 
probably like use it to her advantage
directly<00:05:12.240> listening<00:05:12.539> on<00:05:12.689> what's<00:05:12.930> going<00:05:13.169> on<00:05:13.259> so

in a second if he has to serving on we
have<00:05:35.189> Carver<00:05:35.550> probably<00:05:35.849> mad<00:05:36.060> at<00:05:36.270> comment<00:05:36.569> time

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
but I'm guessing that it be ready

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.920 
but I'm guessing that it be ready
because<00:05:38.279> he's<00:05:38.639> looking<00:05:38.969> pretty<00:05:39.240> pissed<00:05:39.779> off

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
because he's looking pretty pissed off

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.320 
because he's looking pretty pissed off
now<00:05:40.159> nextly<00:05:41.159> we<00:05:41.310> have<00:05:41.460> Clementine<00:05:41.939> actually

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
sitting down and then moving on to the

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:45.589 
sitting down and then moving on to the
other<00:05:44.279> picture<00:05:44.639> we<00:05:45.029> had<00:05:45.180> come<00:05:45.330> in<00:05:45.449> town

hugging kidding probably something bad
happened<00:05:48.539> of<00:05:48.719> course<00:05:49.169> and<00:05:49.409> probably<00:05:50.009> it's<00:05:50.550> a

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
happened of course and probably it's a

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.909 
happened of course and probably it's a
part<00:05:50.879> where<00:05:51.000> maybe<00:05:51.750> where<00:05:52.080> he's<00:05:52.379> trying<00:05:52.800> to

I could see that actually happened where

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.339 
I could see that actually happened where
Kenny<00:05:56.430> trying<00:05:57.029> to<00:05:57.089> protect<00:05:57.389> my<00:05:57.569> time<00:05:57.779> and<00:05:58.050> no

Kenny will most likely protect him in
time<00:06:00.089> from<00:06:00.210> wherever<00:06:00.419> going<00:06:00.870> on<00:06:00.990> so<00:06:01.349> next<00:06:01.680> Lee
