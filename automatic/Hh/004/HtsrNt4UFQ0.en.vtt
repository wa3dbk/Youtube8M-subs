like<00:02:13.660> all<00:02:13.900> EFI<00:02:14.350> systems<00:02:14.770> we<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.190> have

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
like all EFI systems we have to have

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.070 
like all EFI systems we have to have
information<00:02:15.490> for<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.120> computer<00:02:16.480> on<00:02:16.630> engine

temperature and the best place to get

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.160 
temperature and the best place to get
that<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.910> engine<00:02:19.210> coolant<00:02:19.630> temperature

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
that is the engine coolant temperature

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.510 
that is the engine coolant temperature
so<00:02:20.440> we<00:02:20.560> have<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.710> sending<00:02:21.070> unit<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.400> were

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
so we have a sending unit that were

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.890 
so we have a sending unit that were
threading<00:02:21.880> into<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.270> cylinder<00:02:22.570> head<00:02:22.690> right

threading into the cylinder head right
here<00:02:23.200> we're<00:02:23.890> gonna<00:02:23.980> wire<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.280> up<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.700> we<00:02:24.820> want

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
here we're gonna wire it up and we want

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.310 
here we're gonna wire it up and we want
to<00:02:25.030> make<00:02:25.120> sure<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.480> wire<00:02:25.690> doesn't<00:02:25.960> get<00:02:26.080> into

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
to make sure the wire doesn't get into

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.720 
to make sure the wire doesn't get into

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
run two cooling fans and finally if we

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.530 
run two cooling fans and finally if we
choose<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.560> we<00:02:56.739> can<00:02:56.890> also<00:02:57.070> trigger<00:02:57.489> a<00:02:57.760> kick<00:02:58.390> up

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
choose to we can also trigger a kick up

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.060 
choose to we can also trigger a kick up
for<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.780> AC<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.470> event<00:02:59.709> that<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.950> AC

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
for the AC in the event that the AC

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.250 
for the AC in the event that the AC
turns<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:00.940> we<00:03:01.270> can<00:03:01.390> actually<00:03:01.510> compensate<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
turns on we can actually compensate the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.960 
turns on we can actually compensate the
idle<00:03:02.530> speed<00:03:02.620> for<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.400> basically<00:03:03.730> it's<00:03:03.910> an

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
idle speed for that so basically it's an

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.660 
idle speed for that so basically it's an
AC<00:03:04.150> kick<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:04.720> sensor<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:05.709> again<00:03:06.100> eight<00:03:06.370> wires

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
AC kick up sensor so again eight wires

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.479 
AC kick up sensor so again eight wires
to<00:03:06.910> get<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.150> running<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.630> couldn't<00:03:07.900> be<00:03:07.930> simpler

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
to get it running it couldn't be simpler

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.440 
to get it running it couldn't be simpler
connecting<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.580> gas<00:03:09.760> tank<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.239> fuel
