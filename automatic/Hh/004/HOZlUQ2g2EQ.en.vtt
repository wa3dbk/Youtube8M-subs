00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
hard to believe it's hard to buy it's

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.519 
hard to believe it's hard to buy it's
hard<00:00:17.460> for<00:00:17.609> me<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.820> believe<00:00:17.910> anyway<00:00:18.510> because<00:00:19.380> I

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
hard for me to believe anyway because I

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.359 
hard for me to believe anyway because I
look<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.890> back<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.250> our<00:00:20.550> past<00:00:20.850> three<00:00:21.240> years<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
look it back on our past three years and

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.800 
look it back on our past three years and
what<00:00:23.369> Congress<00:00:23.970> has<00:00:24.119> done<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.600> Fed

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
what Congress has done and what the Fed

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.740 
what Congress has done and what the Fed
has<00:00:24.990> done<00:00:25.170> we've<00:00:25.410> literally<00:00:25.710> injected<00:00:26.750> about

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
has done we've literally injected about

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.230 
has done we've literally injected about
five<00:00:28.019> point<00:00:28.349> three<00:00:28.439> trillion<00:00:28.980> dollars<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.119> I

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
five point three trillion dollars and I

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.970 
five point three trillion dollars and I
don't<00:00:30.420> think<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.720> got<00:00:30.929> very<00:00:31.140> much<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
don't think we got very much for the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.830 
don't think we got very much for the
national<00:00:32.369> debt<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.700> went<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.059> five<00:00:33.450> point<00:00:33.750> one

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
national debt it went up five point one

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.209 
national debt it went up five point one
trillion<00:00:34.620> dollars<00:00:35.100> real<00:00:35.880> gdp<00:00:36.120> grew<00:00:37.020> less<00:00:37.829> than

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
trillion dollars real gdp grew less than

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.970 
trillion dollars real gdp grew less than
one<00:00:38.879> percent<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> don't<00:00:40.559> think<00:00:40.829> we've

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
one percent so I don't think we've

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.040 
one percent so I don't think we've
gotten<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.520> whole<00:00:41.730> lot<00:00:41.780> unemployment<00:00:42.780> really

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
gotten a whole lot unemployment really

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.190 
gotten a whole lot unemployment really
hasn't<00:00:43.260> recovered<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:44.010> still<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:45.200> seven

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
hasn't recovered we still have seven

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.470 
hasn't recovered we still have seven
million<00:00:46.440> people<00:00:47.149> that<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.300> become

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
million people that have become

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.250 
million people that have become
unemployed<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:50.360> one<00:00:51.360> statistic<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:51.989> is

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
unemployed and one statistic that is

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.869 
unemployed and one statistic that is
very<00:00:52.500> glaring<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.219> look<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.550> charge

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
very glaring if you look at the charge

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.060 
very glaring if you look at the charge
is<00:00:54.120> how<00:00:54.329> long<00:00:54.510> people<00:00:54.989> are<00:00:55.230> unemployed<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
is how long people are unemployed the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.920 
is how long people are unemployed the
average<00:00:56.399> time<00:00:56.610> used<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:56.969> 17<00:00:57.449> weeks<00:00:57.690> now

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
average time used to be 17 weeks now

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.420 
average time used to be 17 weeks now
it's<00:00:58.079> nearly<00:00:58.289> 40<00:00:58.800> weeks<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.219> stay

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
it's nearly 40 weeks they stay

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.060 
it's nearly 40 weeks they stay
unemployed<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.629> nothing<00:01:01.050> there<00:01:01.199> reassures<00:01:01.890> me

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
unemployed so nothing there reassures me

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.550 
unemployed so nothing there reassures me
and<00:01:02.690> also<00:01:04.909> when<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.060> talk<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.330> prices<00:01:07.290> we're

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and also when we talk about prices we're

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.899 
and also when we talk about prices we're
always<00:01:07.740> reassured<00:01:08.310> there's<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.729> all<00:01:08.880> that

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
always reassured there's not all that

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.080 
always reassured there's not all that
much<00:01:09.150> inflation<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.040> we're<00:01:11.580> told<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
much inflation and and we're told that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.330 
much inflation and and we're told that
they<00:01:12.299> might<00:01:12.479> start<00:01:13.080> calculating<00:01:13.530> inflation

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
they might start calculating inflation

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.370 
they might start calculating inflation
differently<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> new<00:01:15.180> new<00:01:15.330> CPI<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.200> course

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
differently with a new new CPI of course

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.080 
differently with a new new CPI of course
we<00:01:16.500> changed<00:01:16.830> our<00:01:16.890> CPI<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.369> few<00:01:17.640> years<00:01:17.820> back

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
we changed our CPI a few years back

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.210 
we changed our CPI a few years back
there's<00:01:18.840> still<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> free<00:01:19.380> market<00:01:19.590> group<00:01:19.979> that

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
there's still a free market group that

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.270 
there's still a free market group that
calculates<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.939> CPI<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:22.560> old-fashioned<00:01:23.250> way

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
calculates the CPI the old-fashioned way

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.160 
calculates the CPI the old-fashioned way
and<00:01:23.640> they<00:01:23.909> come<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> figure<00:01:24.630> it's

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and they come up with a figure it's

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.410 
and they come up with a figure it's
spite<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.740> all<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.159> weak<00:01:26.400> economy<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
spite of all this weak economy the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780 
spite of all this weak economy the
prices<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.020> gone<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.369> 35-percent<00:01:29.369> nine

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
prices have gone up 35-percent nine

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.999 
prices have gone up 35-percent nine
point<00:01:30.119> four<00:01:30.329> percent<00:01:30.750> every<00:01:30.930> year<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
point four percent every year and and I

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.649 
point four percent every year and and I
think<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.880> went<00:01:33.000> out<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.180> talked<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
think if you just went out and talked to

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.240 
think if you just went out and talked to
the<00:01:33.810> average<00:01:34.200> housewife<00:01:34.590> she'd<00:01:35.070> probably

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the average housewife she'd probably

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
the average housewife she'd probably
believe<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.119> nine<00:01:36.600> percent<00:01:37.079> rather

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
believe this the nine percent rather

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.530 
believe this the nine percent rather
than<00:01:37.560> saying<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:38.070> only<00:01:38.369> only<00:01:38.939> two<00:01:39.150> percent

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
than saying it's only only two percent

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.840 
than saying it's only only two percent
so<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.140> would<00:01:40.320> say<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.740> we've<00:01:40.890> been<00:01:41.070> doing<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so I would say what we've been doing it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.020 
so I would say what we've been doing it
isn't<00:01:42.450> very<00:01:43.079> reassuring<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.759> this

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
isn't very reassuring with with all this

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.450 
isn't very reassuring with with all this
money<00:01:45.479> expenditure<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.560> my<00:01:46.710> question<00:01:46.770> is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
money expenditure but my question is

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.230 
money expenditure but my question is
related<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.479> overall<00:01:48.780> policy<00:01:50.240> spending

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
related to the overall policy spending

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.910 
related to the overall policy spending
all<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.540> money<00:01:52.880> hasn't<00:01:53.880> helped<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.920> yet

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
all this money hasn't helped and yet

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.270

the price of gold well I pay attention

global uncertainties I think people are

global uncertainties I think people are
the<00:04:47.130> reason<00:04:47.280> people<00:04:47.520> hold<00:04:47.820> gold<00:04:48.090> is<00:04:48.389> as<00:04:48.539> a

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
the reason people hold gold is as a

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.150 
the reason people hold gold is as a
protection<00:04:48.960> against<00:04:49.380> what<00:04:49.530> we<00:04:49.740> call<00:04:49.919> tail

protection against what we call tail

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.460

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
the extent that the last few years have

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.790 
the extent that the last few years have
