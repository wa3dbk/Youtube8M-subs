00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.770 
trying to get my attention driving down
the<00:02:32.780> street<00:02:33.140> or<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.800> know<00:02:34.340> in<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.910> mall<00:02:35.150> or

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
the street or you know in the mall or

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.229 
the street or you know in the mall or
whatever<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:37.010> didn't<00:02:37.310> necessarily<00:02:37.550> know

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
whatever and I didn't necessarily know

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.090 
whatever and I didn't necessarily know
what<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.569> do<00:02:38.750> with<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.050> initially<00:02:39.590> because<00:02:40.069> I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
what to do with that initially because I

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.770 
what to do with that initially because I
didn't<00:02:40.520> have<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.790> deal<00:02:41.000> with<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.360> for<00:02:41.569> so<00:02:41.750> long

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
didn't have to deal with it for so long

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.040 
didn't have to deal with it for so long
and<00:02:42.489> so<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:44.030> know<00:02:44.180> there's<00:02:44.480> some<00:02:44.780> mental

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
and so you know there's some mental

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.290 
and so you know there's some mental
shift<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.950> some<00:02:46.100> things<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.520> have<00:02:47.270> to

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
shift and some things that have to

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.449 
shift and some things that have to
happen<00:02:47.480> with<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.650> have<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.250> sort

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
happen with you and so you have to sort

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.310 
happen with you and so you have to sort
of<00:02:52.550> be<00:02:52.730> prepared<00:02:53.209> for<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:53.900> know<00:02:54.110> what

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
of be prepared for it and know what

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.990 
of be prepared for it and know what
you're<00:02:54.470> going<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:55.010> say<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.280> didn't<00:02:55.760> used<00:02:55.910> to

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
you're going to say I didn't used to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.280 
you're going to say I didn't used to
know<00:02:56.209> what<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.480> say<00:02:58.060> which<00:02:59.060> created<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.750> problem

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
know what to say which created a problem

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.040 
know what to say which created a problem
because<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:01.269> yeah<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.300> just<00:03:02.420> didn't<00:03:02.840> know<00:03:02.900> what

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
because I yeah I just didn't know what

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.020 
because I yeah I just didn't know what
to<00:03:03.170> say<00:03:03.350> now<00:03:03.650> I<00:03:04.190> do<00:03:05.680> but<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.830> know<00:03:06.980> things<00:03:07.640> are

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
to say now I do but you know things are

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.860 
to say now I do but you know things are
going<00:03:08.569> to<00:03:08.720> be<00:03:08.870> different<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:10.269> will<00:03:11.269> gain<00:03:11.630> more

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
going to be different you will gain more

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.990 
going to be different you will gain more
confidence<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.769> think<00:03:13.069> it's<00:03:13.550> just<00:03:13.819> an

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
confidence I think it's just an

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.100 
confidence I think it's just an
automatic<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:15.680> will<00:03:15.980> get<00:03:16.190> more<00:03:16.430> attention<00:03:17.110> do

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
automatic you will get more attention do

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.680 
automatic you will get more attention do
you<00:03:18.350> spend<00:03:18.680> time<00:03:18.800> with<00:03:19.519> somebody<00:03:20.090> who<00:03:20.420> you

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
you spend time with somebody who you

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.259 
you spend time with somebody who you
knew<00:03:21.190> didn't<00:03:22.190> want<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.430> give<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:22.970> time<00:03:23.209> of

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
knew didn't want to give you the time of

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.150 
knew didn't want to give you the time of
day<00:03:23.480> because<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.320> were<00:03:24.530> heavier

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
day because you were heavier

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.240 
day because you were heavier
I<00:03:25.430> wouldn't<00:03:26.420> they<00:03:27.350> would<00:03:27.620> not<00:03:27.860> get<00:03:28.070> my

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
I wouldn't they would not get my

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.650 
I wouldn't they would not get my
attention<00:03:28.370> at<00:03:29.000> all

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
attention at all

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.930
