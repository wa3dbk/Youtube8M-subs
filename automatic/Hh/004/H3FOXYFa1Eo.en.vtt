playing<00:06:14.120> right<00:06:14.300> now<00:06:14.330> for<00:06:14.660> George<00:06:15.320> Harrison

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
playing right now for George Harrison

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.090 
playing right now for George Harrison
but<00:06:16.310> John<00:06:16.580> Lennon<00:06:16.850> is<00:06:16.910> actually<00:06:17.180> playing<00:06:18.100> the

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
but John Lennon is actually playing the

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.710 
but John Lennon is actually playing the
part<00:06:19.460> right<00:06:19.550> here<00:06:19.730> so<00:06:20.060> it's<00:06:20.180> pretty<00:06:20.300> cool<00:06:20.510> so

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
part right here so it's pretty cool so

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.420 
part right here so it's pretty cool so
it<00:06:20.780> teaches<00:06:21.080> more<00:06:21.320> in-depth<00:06:21.800> of<00:06:21.920> the<00:06:22.010> song<00:06:22.220> I

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
it teaches more in-depth of the song I

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.550 
it teaches more in-depth of the song I
think<00:06:23.360> that's<00:06:23.630> the<00:06:23.720> reason<00:06:23.870> why<00:06:24.080> it<00:06:24.140> costs

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
think that's the reason why it costs

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.660 
think that's the reason why it costs
more<00:06:24.650> money<00:06:24.770> because<00:06:25.130> it<00:06:25.280> you<00:06:25.430> know<00:06:25.520> it's

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
more money because it you know it's

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.850 
more money because it you know it's
really<00:06:25.850> in-depth<00:06:26.180> so<00:06:26.840> yeah<00:06:27.680> this<00:06:27.800> is

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
really in-depth so yeah this is

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.500 
really in-depth so yeah this is
