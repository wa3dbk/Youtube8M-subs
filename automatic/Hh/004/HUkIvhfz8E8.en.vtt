Hyperion<00:00:54.840> snipers<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.559> my<00:00:55.920> opinion<00:00:56.430> are

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
Hyperion snipers in my opinion are

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.029 
Hyperion snipers in my opinion are
actually<00:00:57.300> pretty<00:00:57.539> useless<00:00:57.930> since<00:00:58.530> etek

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
actually pretty useless since etek

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.189 
actually pretty useless since etek
weapons<00:00:59.489> use<00:00:59.699> two<00:00:59.969> Abbas<00:01:00.420> per<00:01:00.690> shot<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
weapons use two Abbas per shot and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.930 
weapons use two Abbas per shot and
you're<00:01:01.590> gonna<00:01:01.859> only<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.280> able<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> get<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> few

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
you're gonna only be able to get a few

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.000 
you're gonna only be able to get a few
shots<00:01:03.000> off<00:01:03.480> before<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:04.140> accurate<00:01:04.409> you're

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
shots off before it's accurate you're

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.590 
shots off before it's accurate you're
gonna<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.339> out<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.489> ammo<00:01:05.729> by<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> time<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.510> gets

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.120 
scoping without actually using all your
ammo<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.020> another<00:01:46.259> cool<00:01:46.500> thing<00:01:46.530> about<00:01:46.860> these

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
ammo and another cool thing about these

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.490 
ammo and another cool thing about these
guns<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.759> why<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.270> scoped<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.810> it'll<00:01:49.290> tell

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
guns is why your scoped in it'll tell

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.319 
guns is why your scoped in it'll tell
you<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.770> element<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> top<00:01:51.030> right

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
you what element it is in the top right

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.120 
you what element it is in the top right
hand<00:01:51.360> corner<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.079> that's<00:01:52.530> actually<00:01:52.829> pretty

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
hand corner so that's actually pretty

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.249 
hand corner so that's actually pretty
cool<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:54.000> mostly<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.509> lot<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.930> people<00:01:55.170> are

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
cool now mostly a lot of people are

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.800 
cool now mostly a lot of people are
gonna<00:01:55.409> want<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> use<00:01:55.950> these<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.700> zero<00:01:57.149> but

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
gonna want to use these with zero but

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.630 
gonna want to use these with zero but
the<00:01:57.930> thing<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.619> since<00:01:59.070> these<00:01:59.310> shots

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
the thing is is since these shots

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.330 
the thing is is since these shots
penetrate<00:02:00.299> anyway<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.130> use

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
penetrate anyway you don't have to use

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.149 
penetrate anyway you don't have to use
zero<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.450> these<00:02:03.659> weapons<00:02:04.229> already<00:02:04.500> have

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
zero because these weapons already have

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.140 
zero because these weapons already have
a<00:02:05.189> board<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.790> effect<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.689> goes

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
a board like effect and it goes

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.600 
a board like effect and it goes
other<00:02:07.270> enemies<00:02:08.050> so<00:02:08.530> these<00:02:08.649> sniper<00:02:08.979> rifles<00:02:09.430> are

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
other enemies so these sniper rifles are

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.550 
other enemies so these sniper rifles are
pretty<00:02:09.970> powerful<00:02:10.210> they<00:02:10.869> usually<00:02:11.080> come<00:02:11.500> in

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
pretty powerful they usually come in

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.800 
pretty powerful they usually come in
anywhere<00:02:12.160> from<00:02:12.370> twenty<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:12.970> thirty<00:02:13.240> thousand

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
anywhere from twenty to thirty thousand

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.810 
anywhere from twenty to thirty thousand
damage<00:02:13.960> which<00:02:14.590> usually<00:02:14.890> when<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.460> consumes

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
damage which usually when it consumes

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.730 
damage which usually when it consumes
two<00:02:16.030> ammo<00:02:16.270> per<00:02:16.540> shot<00:02:16.840> you're<00:02:17.260> gonna<00:02:17.470> want<00:02:17.710> to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
two ammo per shot you're gonna want to

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.380 
two ammo per shot you're gonna want to
say<00:02:17.920> it's<00:02:18.070> usually<00:02:18.250> about<00:02:18.520> ten<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.970> fifteen

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
say it's usually about ten to fifteen

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.360 
say it's usually about ten to fifteen
thousand<00:02:19.900> per<00:02:20.050> damage<00:02:20.470> because<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.040> two

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
thousand per damage because it's two

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.510 
thousand per damage because it's two
shots<00:02:21.760> but<00:02:22.360> since<00:02:22.960> these<00:02:23.200> hyper<00:02:23.620> rifles<00:02:24.130> they

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
shots but since these hyper rifles they

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.330 
shots but since these hyper rifles they
penetrate<00:02:25.330> through<00:02:25.810> enemies<00:02:26.410> you're<00:02:26.920> able<00:02:27.310> to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
penetrate through enemies you're able to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.820 
penetrate through enemies you're able to
get<00:02:27.610> more<00:02:27.850> than<00:02:28.030> one<00:02:28.270> hit<00:02:28.540> on<00:02:28.900> an<00:02:29.140> enemy<00:02:29.380> per

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
get more than one hit on an enemy per

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.940 
get more than one hit on an enemy per
shot<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:30.970> actually<00:02:31.360> very<00:02:31.660> useful<00:02:32.530> to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
shot so it's actually very useful to

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.130 
shot so it's actually very useful to
have<00:02:33.130> these<00:02:33.370> laying<00:02:33.700> around<00:02:33.850> since<00:02:34.750> these<00:02:34.900> are

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
have these laying around since these are

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.430 
have these laying around since these are
all<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:35.790> elemental<00:02:36.790> weapons<00:02:36.970> they<00:02:37.900> can<00:02:37.960> take

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
all so elemental weapons they can take

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.100 
all so elemental weapons they can take
down<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:39.280> biggest<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.150> big<00:02:40.180> as<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.990> can

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
exactly how I like to use these other

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.140 
exactly how I like to use these other
than<00:02:56.680> just<00:02:56.920> light<00:02:57.160> enough<00:02:57.190> other<00:02:57.580> characters

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
than just light enough other characters

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.540 
than just light enough other characters
I<00:02:58.300> do<00:02:58.600> like<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.050> use<00:02:59.170> these<00:02:59.530> for<00:02:59.920> their<00:03:00.100> damage

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
I do like to use these for their damage

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.790 
I do like to use these for their damage
over<00:03:00.910> time<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:01.870> my<00:03:01.990> opinion<00:03:02.110> even<00:03:02.620> though

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
over time so in my opinion even though

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.340 
over time so in my opinion even though
these<00:03:03.070> weapons<00:03:03.430> use<00:03:03.640> two<00:03:04.060> ammo<00:03:04.510> per<00:03:04.750> shot<00:03:05.050> and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
these weapons use two ammo per shot and

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.949 
these weapons use two ammo per shot and
can<00:03:05.650> burn<00:03:05.920> through<00:03:06.160> ammo<00:03:06.430> very<00:03:06.940> fast<00:03:07.300> they<00:03:07.750> can

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
can burn through ammo very fast they can

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.560 
can burn through ammo very fast they can
also<00:03:08.230> burn<00:03:08.620> through<00:03:08.950> enemies<00:03:09.400> even<00:03:09.850> faster<00:03:10.540> so

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
also burn through enemies even faster so

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.050 
also burn through enemies even faster so
