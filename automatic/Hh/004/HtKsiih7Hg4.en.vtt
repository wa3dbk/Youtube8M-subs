 Does the first person 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.260
 I already got this from Mr. Koski and I think I'm thankful to you, Mr. Ski 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.920

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:11.220
 Akari-sensei often comes to the scene using parking, but I am not good at parking 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.490
 I am troubled to see or not see the part being stabbed while being injected 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.049
 At first look away 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:23.170
 In other words, I don't know at what timing the needle is stuck and I 'm worried and I've been looking at it all the time 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.830
 Looking for blood vessels and trying to force the needle, I become traumatic 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.159
 I will 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:31.539
 Which one is better for relieving pain and fear ? 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.480
 Hirakawa-san please by all means my best regards to you so there is a strong image in the medical system 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.320
 This is completely 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.400
 Does not it It's other characters 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.170
 The 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.820
 There is so great 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.170
 I am 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.020
 that 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:52.130
 I'm a person who has always been watching 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.909
 Well because no strong person who has been confirmed whether Pressed on the ship I know people who have seen much 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.090
 But 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:01.310
 As Mr. Kofsky says with that child 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:05.010
 For example , if you are looking for something like a blood vessel 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:13.490
 If you look at it you may not understand that the high hand is approaching 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:13.490
 So I'll see until the last moment I'm stabbed and close my eyes in the moment of decision 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.040
 Oh but I understand a little bit 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:25.829
 Roughly even that I 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:29.700
 Well that's right , but in my case it can be done a little earlier and it's tough 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:32.939
 In a word, I look away from the moment I start to approach my arms 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:38.220
 I know it's a big deal 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:40.030
 It 's like a shop if you think it's coming and it's a big shock attitude 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:46.120
 Yes take it 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.990
 I'm saying something like this I 'm not a woman I'm a woman and I'm worried about echoing 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.420
 think 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:55.069
 I'm stabbed, so I already 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:03:00.739
 If the tip of the sound of the needle is not scary or something like that 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:05.120
 Yoshi is up to a place called'll come'll come'll come defined here aim to watch luck after 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.360
 This is followed by turning a blind eye cormorants me where I say wrapped in here 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.440
 Yes, the end of which Shut up is said to be directly below the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.580
 I feel like I have something good 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.540
 Hey 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.830
 I think I 'm okay now 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.630
 Isn't it yourself or hard 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:26.020
 Even Mr. Coffsky said that it was good, please try hard and try hard 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.020
 Please give me
