00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.379
 the books put the wheels is the motto 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.090
 by antonio la cava primary school teacher in 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.429
 board that has found a way 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.500
 original to promote reading between 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.770
 children even where there is not one 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.990
 the library publishes the motorcycle library 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.949
 I needed a humble vehicle e 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.490
 popular to bring my proposal that 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.619
 it was articulated on the simplicity of books 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.410
 they put the wheels which is one 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.530
 traveling library with a loan 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.260
 free of books and white papers a 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.300
 traveling writing workshop 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.829
 because the two things obviously go 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.050
 together 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.789
 but it is above all the possibility for i 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.280
 our boys for the world of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.420
 childhood of telling and of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.850
 tell 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.289
 antonio does not have a register with names 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.440
 of the boys who are in charge of i 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.260
 books and everything is free and based on 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.780
 trust for years went on with the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.449
 his project almost in indifference 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.280
 but the satisfactions are not lacked for 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.150
 years went on 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.729
 I would say almost in solitude and maybe even 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.729
 in the indifference of the great ones however for 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.590
 luck there was always the enthusiasm of the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.720
 guys to welcome and this 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.750
 for me it was the right gasoline 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.240
 to do all the necessary kilometers in 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.360
 a village of the smallest village in the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.350
 province of matera olive grove lucano that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.350
 I count 450 inhabitants I go there for 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.820
 reach a child who one 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.350
 once when I passed by olive grove he told me 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.290
 fascinated, he reflected his image 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.530
 in the child's glasses and modeling he said 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.860
 maestro asked me should you come another 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.170
 time how do you not even go to 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.509
 olive grove antonio gets it for the time being 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670
 runs only for the villages of Lucania 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.590
 but who knows what his model cannot 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.700
 also be exported to small countries 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.700
 of campania
