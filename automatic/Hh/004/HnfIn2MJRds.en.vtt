00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.769
 no volunteer this armada 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.339
 I have not 1 to me in life with something 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.529
 compare 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:24.779
 Well, to be honest, yes, I donâ€™t immediately install 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.999
 gonna be great skis great skis for two 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.249
 categories of qatar chikov judge bot for ok 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.380
 hotel ychikov preferring some 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.269
 some hard freeride so shallow 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.879
 Snezhinsk freeride them soft some 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:40.460
 slopes of whether it is broken some freestyle 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:42.719
 skie things either good fast with a slope 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.199
 peppy experts say why 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.109
 something like I'm not wide at all 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.980
 geometry what bruises wide and herself 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.020
 the form 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.760
 actually ski so let's say 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.879
 smoothed ie skiing are prone to 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.400
 speed even rocker general then i would say 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:04.150
 so spedra hearts red rocker in order 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.580
 to wet just like a longitudinal 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.009
 gliding at speed yes you me 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.290
 like or not able to drip not 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.930
 deep but in such a vile heterogeneous 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.570
 well that is easy 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.759
 there is literally half an arc of good 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.440
 true born and already they went they already 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.150
 take off go and do not want 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.750
 to fall through this all 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.670
 and situations with socks do not go under the snow 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.590
 don't hit the legs unevenly 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.930
 uneven haw easy 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.759
 I don't weigh anything great 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.180
 I do not know what is called the legs in the picture to 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.340
 look at the title in the credits saw on 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.340
 I really like them I don't want to 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.289
 the suspension is not ready so wet but if you are not 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.100
 heavy raider if you are a teenager well 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.530
 let's say there is a mass of a kilogram there 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.869
 60-70 and is ready to go fast then well 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.090
 for slow consolator for newbies i 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.490
 I would not advise though I can not think 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.490
 that there will be some radical problems 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.410
 I know many likely attempts to do 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.880
 freeride not skis who will have a problem 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.450
 anymore even if you have them wrong 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.670
 pick up 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.020
 These would allow to pass the error 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.929
 in fact they will not be terrible either 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.810
 newcomers not somewhere there is something here 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.730
 In principle, everyone wants to try the detailed 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.950
 write on the site in the text but as if 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.220
 so that's all signed by the channel that everything is so 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.220
 bye everyone
