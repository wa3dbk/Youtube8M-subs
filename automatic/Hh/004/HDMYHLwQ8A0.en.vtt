00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.920
 hey people and welcome to one 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.590
 another tutorial from me 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.400
 it's about speedfan this species of mine 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.390
 audio track of nauders city ​​yes I do 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:27.550
 let's talk about the program today 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.759
 Speed ​​fan and that is because your cpu 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.800
 to regulate the fan speed and 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.899
 you can also the temperatures everything 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.250
 see possible 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:41.750
 however, that does not work 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.519
 really under windows 8 anyway yes 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.879
 It is always said that way and about the people 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.320
 do not get down to windows 8 and 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.129
 I show you now only times where the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.960
 can download 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.699
 I want you on chip.de 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.859
 recommend and you can see it 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.329
 is not really for windows 8 stands 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.129
 her but it works in any case 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.560
 for windows 8 works for me too 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.630
 now and esd version 4.4 point 9 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.750
 exactly as I just download once 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.970
 then you can do the program here 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.590
 download 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.310
 that automatically has as an administrator 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.259
 You see this work done at the top 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.140
 you see above the symbol that is 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.020
 usually an administrator symbol then 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.119
 let's say he configures us now 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.030
 here our computer looks so to speak 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.399
 all this is s.Vikkartenkpu and 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:41.420
 everything here you can see now 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:43.250
 cpu utilization here and the cores would have 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.799
 For example, already found the cpu 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.740
 the cdu is pretty high as me 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.539
 because I am here on the edge and 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.020
 that is why I have a free problem 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:56.200
 when rendering my air is pretty much 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.890
 Chancellor make loud 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.759
 One hundred percent knows I can do that 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.460
 Maybe he'll hear well, I know completely 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.240
 But in any case belongs to 65 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.050
 is that beautiful quiet the cpu 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.640
 yes temperature is at 40 is pretty 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.430
 Well 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.220
 and yes here cpu fan so who the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.090
 fan speed up to 2631 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.440
 turns per minute and that is 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.670
 actually not good but initially had 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.560
 I'm just holding out problem I could 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.870
 down here I could make her up 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.330
 nothing happened to me 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.769
 and yes have the problem many 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.110
 Underground 807 everything with me 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.190
 Anyway , it works 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.989
 configure on here 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.310
 I have it in German right now 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.989
 you can put that here under 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.480
 make options I 'll just open up 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.560
 English shows up at first is here 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:51.090
 so here is config options and then 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.840
 here german he has it in german 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.519
 in any case would have to give here 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.269
 custom or in English 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.850
 go advanced and here you have to go now 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.980
 just choose your fan 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.410
 that's the here where it usually tuned 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.430
 us-master's turn and where the pws 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.170
 stand by it 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.450
 I have him show the others there 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.489
 that's not so much off it 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.380
 There is nothing to it because there are two things in it 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.700
 and here are five more things 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.450
 But then here is just the most 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.290
 and I needed those three pwm 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.620
 mode the problem is that is otherwise 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.810
 always here so now you will get air 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.880
 example louder because I totally change 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:38.280
 and you do not have to open these pwm woods 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.620
 four smart fans set to manual 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.630
 put these all on manual clicks 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.910
 you ok here and then you can 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.359
 set your fan speeds 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.069
 yes in principle it is pretty easy 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.420
 and I have it after one 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.130
 Time to find out how it really works 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.590
 i have worked after pwm and stuff like that 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.660
 what google found it then and yes 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.720
 so works for me is then 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.480
 down there always there, there you will be there 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.490
 different temperatures are displayed and 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.200
 yes, if I say it was from this 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.870
 speedfan tutorial I hope you have it 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.160
 like 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.990
 we just see you at it because think 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.400
 I like paradise videos come first 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.709
 just a good many, I must be soon too 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.180
 pre-produce for the holidays and such and 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.700
 yes, I just say that 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.700
 let's see each other and then to date
