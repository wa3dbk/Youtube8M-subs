popping<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.260> cable<00:02:10.649> out<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.220> I'm<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.490> to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
popping the cable out so I'm going to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:33.380 
popping the cable out so I'm going to
try<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.880> that

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.550 

there's<00:02:34.390> probably<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.780> better<00:02:34.930> tool<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.320> do

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
there's probably a better tool to do

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.960 
there's probably a better tool to do
that<00:02:35.590> than<00:02:35.920> just<00:02:36.100> my<00:02:36.190> pair<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.460> pliers<00:02:36.670> but

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
that than just my pair of pliers but

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.530 
that than just my pair of pliers but
that's<00:02:37.240> it

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
that's it

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.480 
that's it
now<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.170> challenging<00:02:38.680> thing<00:02:38.890> here<00:02:39.130> for<00:02:39.340> me

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
now the challenging thing here for me

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.210 
now the challenging thing here for me
was<00:02:40.290> because<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.380> ride<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.770> much<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.100> is

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
was because I ride so much and this is

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.530 
was because I ride so much and this is
the<00:02:42.280> first<00:02:42.520> time<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.880> year<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.210> half<00:02:43.360> I've

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the first time in a year and a half I've

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.930 
the first time in a year and a half I've
actually<00:02:43.750> had<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:44.020> do<00:02:44.170> anything<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.530> this<00:02:44.590> bike

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
actually had to do anything to this bike

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.220 
actually had to do anything to this bike
this<00:02:45.940> bracket<00:02:46.630> right<00:02:46.720> here<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.020> lot<00:02:47.140> of

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
this bracket right here and a lot of

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.380 
this bracket right here and a lot of
dirt<00:02:47.440> in<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.070> couldn't<00:02:48.610> move<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.120> at<00:02:49.270> all

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
dirt in it so I couldn't move it at all

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.810 
dirt in it so I couldn't move it at all
when<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.660> was<00:02:49.690> trying<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.050> remove<00:02:50.350> my<00:02:50.530> brake<00:02:50.820> my

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
when I was trying to remove my brake my

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.430 
when I was trying to remove my brake my
wheel<00:02:52.000> but<00:02:52.270> what<00:02:52.390> actually<00:02:52.780> happened<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.260> as

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
wheel but what actually happened is as

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.280 
wheel but what actually happened is as
you<00:02:53.590> pull<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.400> wheel<00:02:54.760> up<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.840> whole

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
you pull this this wheel up this whole

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.110 
you pull this this wheel up this whole
piece<00:02:57.130> right<00:02:57.400> here<00:02:57.460> will<00:02:57.730> actually<00:02:57.850> just

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
piece right here will actually just

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.740 
piece right here will actually just
shift<00:02:58.600> up<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.760> then<00:03:01.030> you'll<00:03:01.450> have<00:03:01.600> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
shift up and then you'll have the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.080 
shift up and then you'll have the
clearance<00:03:02.260> on<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.500> other<00:03:02.650> side<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.580> pull<00:03:03.910> the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
clearance on the other side to pull the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.060 
clearance on the other side to pull the
wheel<00:03:04.300> directly<00:03:04.990> out<00:03:05.140> on<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.380> other<00:03:05.500> side<00:03:05.800> so

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
wheel directly out on the other side so

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.040 
wheel directly out on the other side so
I'm<00:03:06.580> going<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.790> try<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.060> film<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.900> do

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
I'm going to try to film this and do

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.160 
I'm going to try to film this and do
this<00:03:08.200> at<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.410> same<00:03:08.590> time<00:03:08.860> but<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.840> what<00:03:10.990> you'll

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
this at the same time but so what you'll

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.340 
this at the same time but so what you'll
see<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:13.390> won't<00:03:13.720> look<00:03:13.930> like<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:14.260> wants

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
see is that we won't look like it wants

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.860 
see is that we won't look like it wants
to<00:03:14.560> come<00:03:14.770> up<00:03:15.010> but<00:03:15.640> you'll<00:03:15.760> be<00:03:16.060> able<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.570> get<00:03:16.720> it

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
to come up but you'll be able to get it

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.250 
to come up but you'll be able to get it
out<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.890> then<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.030> whole<00:03:19.300> thing<00:03:19.570> rotates<00:03:19.810> up

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
out and then the whole thing rotates up

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.070 
out and then the whole thing rotates up
and<00:03:20.680> once<00:03:21.490> that<00:03:21.700> whole<00:03:21.910> thing<00:03:22.150> has<00:03:22.300> rotated<00:03:22.900> up

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
and once that whole thing has rotated up

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.350 
and once that whole thing has rotated up
now<00:03:23.710> you<00:03:23.770> can<00:03:24.100> just<00:03:24.220> pull<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.760> wheel<00:03:24.910> out<00:03:24.940> from

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
now you can just pull the wheel out from

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.720 
now you can just pull the wheel out from
the<00:03:25.480> left<00:03:25.630> side<00:03:26.910> take<00:03:27.910> your<00:03:28.950> take<00:03:29.950> your<00:03:29.980> your

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
the left side take your take your your

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.820 
the left side take your take your your
belt<00:03:30.970> drive<00:03:31.270> off<00:03:31.450> over<00:03:31.750> here<00:03:31.990> so<00:03:32.650> you'll<00:03:32.770> just

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
belt drive off over here so you'll just

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.940 
belt drive off over here so you'll just
want<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.190> pop<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:33.640> guy<00:03:33.880> off<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:35.560> then<00:03:35.770> you'll

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
want to pop that guy off and then you'll

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.980 
want to pop that guy off and then you'll
pull<00:03:36.460> this<00:03:36.580> whole<00:03:36.760> thing<00:03:36.820> up<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.360> because<00:03:37.870> you

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
pull this whole thing up and because you

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.930 
pull this whole thing up and because you
have<00:03:38.170> clearance<00:03:38.500> on<00:03:38.740> that<00:03:38.770> side<00:03:39.160> you<00:03:39.670> can<00:03:39.790> just

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
have clearance on that side you can just

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.730 
have clearance on that side you can just
pull<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.180> completely<00:03:40.420> out<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.080> drum<00:03:41.320> and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
pull it completely out of the drum and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.410 
pull it completely out of the drum and
now<00:03:41.980> your<00:03:42.160> wheel<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.340> free<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.940> then<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.270> put

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
now your wheel is free and then to put

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.010 
now your wheel is free and then to put
it<00:03:43.510> back<00:03:43.600> together<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:43.990> just<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:46.720> do<00:03:46.900> it

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
it back together you just just do it

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.080 
it back together you just just do it
everything<00:03:47.470> in<00:03:47.740> Reverse<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:48.370> just<00:03:48.730> remember

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
everything in Reverse and just remember

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.430 
everything in Reverse and just remember
that<00:03:49.120> when<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.480> put<00:03:49.720> your<00:03:53.820> chain<00:03:54.820> or<00:03:55.060> your

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
that when you put your chain or your

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.570 
that when you put your chain or your
shifter<00:03:56.440> cables<00:03:56.740> back<00:03:56.890> in<00:03:57.070> a<00:03:57.250> lot<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.490> these

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
shifter cables back in a lot of these

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.400 
shifter cables back in a lot of these
cables<00:03:58.000> have<00:04:00.480> straight<00:04:01.480> sides<00:04:01.720> they're<00:04:02.260> not

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
cables have straight sides they're not

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.080 
cables have straight sides they're not
all<00:04:02.560> round<00:04:02.830> so<00:04:03.430> you'll<00:04:03.550> actually<00:04:03.700> have<00:04:04.030> to

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
all round so you'll actually have to

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.140 
all round so you'll actually have to
pull<00:04:04.870> your<00:04:05.020> cable<00:04:05.440> back<00:04:06.160> up<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.670> then<00:04:06.790> kind<00:04:06.940> of

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
pull your cable back up and then kind of

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150 
pull your cable back up and then kind of
twist<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.630> pop<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:08.050> in<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.320> then<00:04:08.770> it<00:04:08.800> will<00:04:09.010> take

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
twist it pop it in and then it will take

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.740 
twist it pop it in and then it will take
all<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.430> slack<00:04:09.640> out<00:04:09.820> hopefully<00:04:10.570> that's

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
all the slack out hopefully that's

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.960 
all the slack out hopefully that's
helpful
