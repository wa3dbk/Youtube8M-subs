sort of fit all those scenes into the 2

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.110 
sort of fit all those scenes into the 2
days<00:03:41.230> schedule<00:03:41.680> but<00:03:42.099> the<00:03:42.189> actors<00:03:42.640> can<00:03:42.819> always

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
days schedule but the actors can always

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.449

clock as it were because of the

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.270 
clock as it were because of the

thinking<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.269> television<00:04:01.750> as<00:04:01.840> opposed<00:04:02.170> to

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
thinking of television as opposed to

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.920 
thinking of television as opposed to
theater<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:03.519> have<00:04:03.970> very<00:04:04.629> little

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
theater and I have very little

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.110 
theater and I have very little
experience<00:04:05.349> in<00:04:05.620> film<00:04:05.950> but<00:04:06.189> I<00:04:06.760> found<00:04:06.970> in

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
experience in film but I found in

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.629 
experience in film but I found in

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
you kind of pretty low down if you see

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.500 
you kind of pretty low down if you see

what I mean Zach says I mean not that

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.900 
what I mean Zach says I mean not that
I'm<00:04:16.720> complaining<00:04:17.019> but<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:18.130> technicality<00:04:18.880> of

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
television is so extraordinary that the

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.600 
television is so extraordinary that the

the<00:04:24.849> actors<00:04:25.210> in<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.449> end<00:04:25.599> you<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:26.380> it's<00:04:26.889> an

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
the actors in the end you and it's an

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.379 
the actors in the end you and it's an
extrordinary<00:04:27.400> technique<00:04:27.849> to<00:04:27.940> have<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.180> try

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
extrordinary technique to have to try

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.180 
extrordinary technique to have to try
and<00:04:28.539> learn<00:04:28.690> like<00:04:29.050> it's<00:04:29.440> really<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:29.770> find<00:04:30.130> it

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
and learn like it's really I find it

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.700 
and learn like it's really I find it
really<00:04:30.280> hard<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.789> actually<00:04:31.120> have<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.300> produce

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
really hard you actually have to produce

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.980 
really hard you actually have to produce
it<00:04:32.710> within<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.639> certain<00:04:33.880> number<00:04:34.449> of<00:04:34.510> seconds

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
it within a certain number of seconds

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.080 
it within a certain number of seconds
and<00:04:35.289> if<00:04:35.409> you<00:04:35.530> miss<00:04:35.770> it<00:04:36.039> there<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.520> have<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:37.000> you

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
and if you miss it there you have it you

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.520 
and if you miss it there you have it you
