00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
a lightsaber this is the long way of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969 
a lightsaber this is the long way of
doing<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.140> definitely<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.770> safest

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
doing it and it's definitely the safest

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:57.680 
doing it and it's definitely the safest
way<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.520> doing<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.800 

and<00:01:58.690> as<00:01:59.200> far<00:01:59.350> as<00:01:59.410> I<00:01:59.530> know<00:01:59.590> there's<00:01:59.860> a<00:02:00.810> rail

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
and as far as I know there's a rail

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.980 
and as far as I know there's a rail
seeker<00:02:02.410> gun<00:02:02.590> under<00:02:02.860> here<00:02:06.360> that's<00:02:07.360> not<00:02:07.570> good

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
seeker gun under here that's not good

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.080 
seeker gun under here that's not good
now<00:02:08.710> I<00:02:11.460> don't<00:02:12.460> know<00:02:12.670> if<00:02:12.700> I'm<00:02:12.790> going<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:12.970> be<00:02:13.030> able

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
now I don't know if I'm going to be able

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.440 
now I don't know if I'm going to be able
to<00:02:13.210> do<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:13.450> or<00:02:13.600> not

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.880

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.660 

at<00:02:26.890> least<00:02:27.070> these<00:02:27.160> things<00:02:27.370> were<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.490> lot<00:02:27.610> easier

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
at least these things were a lot easier

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.790 
at least these things were a lot easier
to<00:02:27.970> kill<00:02:28.060> on<00:02:28.180> this<00:02:28.330> game<00:02:28.480> than<00:02:28.600> they<00:02:28.720> are<00:02:28.750> on

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.310 

dot<00:02:32.800> forces<00:02:33.190> because<00:02:33.430> they're<00:02:33.580> actually

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
dot forces because they're actually

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:46.650 
dot forces because they're actually
really<00:02:35.320> hard<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.590> kill<00:02:35.770> on<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:35.980> game<00:02:45.660> it's

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
really hard to kill on that game it's

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.160
