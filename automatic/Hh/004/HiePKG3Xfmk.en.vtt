00:01:48.810 --> 00:02:07.670 
so I believe that's the first one so
let's<00:01:49.049> continue<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.790> else<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:06.680> so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
let's continue and see what else so so

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.809 
let's continue and see what else so so
there<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.009> go<00:02:08.190> those<00:02:08.640> are<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.849> two<00:02:10.819> supposed

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
there you go those are the two supposed

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:49.819

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.039 

so<00:02:50.829> I<00:02:51.069> believe<00:02:51.280> that's<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:52.120> mean<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.989> only
