 Hello SodrÃ© face, welcome to 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.940
 another video lesson from photoshop cs 6 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.490
 In this video lesson, we will learn to 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.439
 convert a photograph into a painting 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.180
 before beginning this work however 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.480
 I would like to give the tip that on our site 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.070
 is 360 points with you find our 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.500
 more complete courses and that our 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.300
 students have support for their doubts and 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.830
 this is a great differential of our 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.020
 service provision 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.480
 Let's start it very well, I'll open it here. 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.269
 previously the image of a good practice 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.309
 in the publishing process is to duplicate 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.280
 the image layer we are going to work on 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.190
 to practice an editing or a 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.469
 Non-destructive editing for this let's 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.450
 here is no right our menu layers 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.790
 as you can see if you could 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.879
 duplicate this layer by control shortcut 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.160
 together or simply click and drag 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.649
 up to the bottom where the 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.039
 option create new read when you drop 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:15.130
 it will already be doubled and we will 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.930
 now make a saturation of this 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.460
 image for this we go here in the menu 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.890
 spanish on option magnets 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.500
 right after the mans and 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.690
 so let's choose the option of saturei 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.030
 which is of saturation height 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.679
 the shortcut shift control like you 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.530
 view filed 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:35.110
 Notice that he gave the image 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.970
 we will duplicate this layer already 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.770
 I talked about this process 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.289
 I'll use this method here to stay 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.819
 It's easier for you to see but you 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.369
 you can use the shortcut 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.479
 Now we're going to reverse the colors. 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.000
 of this layer 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.649
 the shortcut is against the wii but the way 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.709
 would be that in this top menu in the 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.009
 next time in the 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:59.890
 settings and then let the option reverses 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.770
 reverse now notice that he 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.090
 changed and inverts and reverses the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.729
 image colors 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.550
 we now go with the top layer where 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.700
 we created this color inversion to create a 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.770
 the merge module between channels to 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.569
 This is what we are going here in this plan of Moorish 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.540
 where there is the normal option like you 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.209
 visualize here I'll click and let's go 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.490
 then choose the color dodge option 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.160
 note that at the outset 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.470
 Everything's gone but we'll fix it. 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.930
 now then we go on the Spanish menu at 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.150
 filter option, remembering that the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.070
 selected is important for 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.970
 that you visualize to be done the way 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.980
 correct 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.890
 so we're going back here after 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.200
 applied this merge of channels in the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.690
 top menu option in the right filters in 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.360
 then we go new blur and then we go 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.510
 in the option glauce a blush we will click 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.360
 about it and you already notice that 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.140
 here is the visualization of that 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.270
 Image 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.880
 you have the option also to increase or 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.520
 decrease this radius and with this option 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.780
 predicted active you will power 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.340
 preview I have been testing 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.910
 previously for that other image 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.790
 I liked that touch of 40 people with 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.550
 the number of 40 I'm going to give you an okay 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.440
 and to finish giving a final touch 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.630
 What you could do would still be in that 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.970
 top menu in the filter option by reminding 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.490
 that layer holding the layer that 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.710
 we were working after it was filtered 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.090
 we go in the option of pain and then we go 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.160
 world option 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.320
 we already work custom ray feet but 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.530
 We are going to work there and if none are there. 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.230
 you can also manipulate and if this 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.660
 touch to this boy for you 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.610
 best fit this image 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.820
 for you to have this painting of a 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.470
 The way you think it gets more 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.350
 realistically you use keyboard keys 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.150
 she can stay can be more sensitive 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.050
 for this digital numbering adjustment 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.470
 direct here 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.960
 Once this is done just click on Ok I 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.670
 I'm just applying effect 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.590
 I'm going to give it here today only found 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.630
 tonifying person to facilitate the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.660
 take the little eye for you to observe 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.670
 Look here before and see me later
