 Cinema 4d is a program for modeling 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.880
 3d texturing animation and animation 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.010
 3d rendering 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.049
 here you will learn the main 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.900
 tools and functions of this software 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.359
 both in image creation and in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.580
 animations from the overview of the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.580
 program as its interface and its 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.070
 functions up to the general creation 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.859
 of objects such as working with light 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.619
 the application of textures and the differences 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.450
 the types of cameras additionally see a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.570
 series of effects that can be 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.329
 worked to create 3d objects like 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.239
 shadows moves particles and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.730
 perspectives and can follow step by step 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.670
 the development of a project 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.640
 animation since the creation of the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.219
 positioning modeling and the animation of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.070
 objects to the animation of the cameras and 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.530
 render if you want to learn a lot 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.780
 more about creation and animation in 3d 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.469
 This course was made for you but it is not 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.480
