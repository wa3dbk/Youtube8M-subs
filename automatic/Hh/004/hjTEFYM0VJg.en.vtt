delicious<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:53.190> only<00:02:53.430> thing<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:54.240> went<00:02:55.230> wrong

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
delicious the only thing that went wrong

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.010 
delicious the only thing that went wrong
in<00:02:55.620> my<00:02:56.250> recipe<00:02:56.459> was<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.270> was<00:02:57.450> hoping<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
in my recipe was I was hoping that the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.130 
in my recipe was I was hoping that the
chocolate<00:02:58.470> chips<00:02:58.730> would<00:02:59.730> remain<00:03:00.450> chocolate

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
chocolate chips would remain chocolate

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.100 
chocolate chips would remain chocolate
chips<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.590> not<00:03:01.800> become<00:03:02.160> chocolate<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.660> that's

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
chips and not become chocolate so that's

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.380 
chips and not become chocolate so that's
the<00:03:04.350> only<00:03:04.709> bad<00:03:05.310> point<00:03:05.700> but<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.000> guess<00:03:06.180> I'd<00:03:06.360> have

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
the only bad point but I guess I'd have

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.720 
the only bad point but I guess I'd have
to<00:03:06.540> cool<00:03:06.930> down<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.470> don't<00:03:07.950> know<00:03:08.040> i'm

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
to cool down I don't know i'm

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.580 
to cool down I don't know i'm
