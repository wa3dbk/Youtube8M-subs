00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.640 
probably I saw like 1.5 mil close to
that<00:05:07.889> I<00:05:08.190> saw<00:05:08.370> some<00:05:08.580> 2<00:05:08.760> mils<00:05:08.970> from<00:05:09.270> my<00:05:09.419> hyper<00:05:09.650> so

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
that I saw some 2 mils from my hyper so

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.110 
that I saw some 2 mils from my hyper so
that's<00:05:10.889> pretty<00:05:11.070> good<00:05:11.310> we're<00:05:11.550> hitting<00:05:11.820> like

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
that's pretty good we're hitting like

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.290 
that's pretty good we're hitting like
bunch<00:05:12.540> of<00:05:12.690> mils<00:05:12.900> bunch<00:05:13.290> in<00:05:13.470> nine<00:05:13.650> hundred<00:05:14.300> one

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
bunch of mils bunch in nine hundred one

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.219 
bunch of mils bunch in nine hundred one
hundred<00:05:15.330> nine<00:05:15.600> hundred<00:05:15.800> nine<00:05:16.800> hundred<00:05:16.830> K<00:05:18.229> so

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
hundred nine hundred nine hundred K so

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.370 
hundred nine hundred nine hundred K so
that's<00:05:19.410> pretty<00:05:19.620> good<00:05:19.830> there<00:05:21.199> so<00:05:22.199> yeah<00:05:22.350> our

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
that's pretty good there so yeah our

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.740 
that's pretty good there so yeah our
damage<00:05:23.040> is<00:05:23.250> getting<00:05:23.880> there<00:05:24.030> zeroes<00:05:24.540> are

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
damage is getting there zeroes are

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.860 
damage is getting there zeroes are
really<00:05:25.050> powerful<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:27.030> if<00:05:27.210> you<00:05:27.300> don't<00:05:27.479> have<00:05:27.630> one

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
really powerful so if you don't have one

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.330 
really powerful so if you don't have one
I<00:05:28.050> suggest<00:05:28.260> making<00:05:28.620> one<00:05:28.830> right<00:05:28.950> now<00:05:29.100> because

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
I suggest making one right now because

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.659 
I suggest making one right now because
they're<00:05:29.550> limited<00:05:30.030> and<00:05:31.280> it'll<00:05:32.280> be<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.550> best

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
they're limited and it'll be the best

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.670 
they're limited and it'll be the best
thing<00:05:32.970> to<00:05:33.210> have<00:05:33.479> because<00:05:33.750> it's<00:05:34.110> like<00:05:34.320> you're

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
thing to have because it's like you're

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.120 
thing to have because it's like you're
pretty<00:05:35.010> much<00:05:35.190> set<00:05:35.580> in<00:05:35.639> stone<00:05:36.120> with<00:05:36.389> a<00:05:36.419> zero

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
pretty much set in stone with a zero

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.280 
pretty much set in stone with a zero
basically<00:05:38.130> I<00:05:38.370> if<00:05:39.270> you<00:05:39.450> guys<00:05:39.600> know<00:05:39.780> I<00:05:39.810> played

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
basically I if you guys know I played

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.020 
basically I if you guys know I played
the<00:05:40.440> dual<00:05:40.590> blade<00:05:40.770> before<00:05:41.160> and<00:05:41.460> I<00:05:41.580> sold<00:05:41.850> all<00:05:42.000> my

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
the dual blade before and I sold all my

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.620 
the dual blade before and I sold all my
equips<00:05:42.479> on<00:05:42.600> that<00:05:42.780> just<00:05:43.110> a<00:05:43.229> fun<00:05:43.470> by<00:05:43.710> zero<00:05:44.010> so

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
equips on that just a fun by zero so

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.480 
equips on that just a fun by zero so
yeah<00:05:45.630> so<00:05:45.900> they<00:05:46.380> turned<00:05:46.860> out<00:05:46.979> to<00:05:47.190> be<00:05:47.310> pretty

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
yeah so they turned out to be pretty

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.700 
yeah so they turned out to be pretty
well<00:05:47.729> and<00:05:48.060> doing<00:05:48.479> way<00:05:48.780> more<00:05:48.990> damage<00:05:49.169> and<00:05:49.590> more

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
well and doing way more damage and more

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.270 
well and doing way more damage and more
DPS<00:05:50.250> than<00:05:50.669> my<00:05:50.910> dual<00:05:51.090> blade<00:05:51.330> so<00:05:52.169> zeroes<00:05:53.010> are<00:05:53.190> the

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
DPS than my dual blade so zeroes are the

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.170 
DPS than my dual blade so zeroes are the
way<00:05:53.400> to<00:05:53.430> go<00:05:53.810> so<00:05:54.810> if<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.139> guys<00:05:55.910> if<00:05:56.910> you<00:05:57.060> guys

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
way to go so if you guys if you guys

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.210 
way to go so if you guys if you guys
want<00:05:57.449> make<00:05:57.630> that<00:05:57.780> zero<00:05:58.020> right<00:05:58.199> away<00:05:58.440> just<00:05:59.100> in

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
want make that zero right away just in

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.340 
want make that zero right away just in
time<00:05:59.430> before<00:05:59.789> they<00:06:00.090> they<00:06:00.660> stop<00:06:00.900> it<00:06:01.050> I<00:06:01.139> think

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
time before they they stop it I think

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.810 
time before they they stop it I think
they<00:06:01.440> stopped<00:06:01.710> it<00:06:01.860> like<00:06:01.950> on<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.220> fifteenth<00:06:02.700> I

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
they stopped it like on the fifteenth I

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.219 
they stopped it like on the fifteenth I
think<00:06:03.060> I'm<00:06:03.240> not<00:06:03.389> too<00:06:03.570> sure<00:06:03.750> you<00:06:03.840> just<00:06:04.020> check
