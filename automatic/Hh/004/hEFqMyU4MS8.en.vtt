00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.470
 my school hadn't seen what 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.550
 happens if I take with the fishing rod 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.580
 a dog barks a firm shark a 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.199
 shark and it takes so much bite me 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.449
 all wolves have become hostile 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.550

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.050
 fishing pole 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:43.610
 no with the acid 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:47.070
 but it seems to me the real star calame taken 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.020
 damn it this goes backstage 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.789

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.969
 dogs not domesticated and therefore 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.320
 now they all want to kill me I have 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.520
 afraid that they kill me I do not have a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.799

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:21.320
 bad you too is not the death of the uncle in the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.320
 shit board 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.960

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.070

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.640
 ha ha nice to pull the dogs to pull 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:46.380
 camera ops but I'm running out of my rod 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.660
 fishing in this way is true is true 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.280
 no because it's not settled yet no I have to 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.300
 finish fixing those issue 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.800
 channels under relaxation area register with 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.800
 the aics relax shooter 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.340
 now the dogs are going to take me I'm sure 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:16.590
 shooter you mind if you do you have it 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:21.120
 a basket in the house is the use for 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:30.600
 leave my stuff like that if I die a 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:32.910
 you pick yourself a wooden pick 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.420
 disconnect and definitely come back 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.260
 because you're leaving as I do n't know what 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.000
 I used to go to a god or not now as I do 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.440
 understand which rimini tools color i 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.010

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.190

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.110
 underneath I keep only the iron sword 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.300
 so not even those fees 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:04.250
 disgusting poor dogs but shut up 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.250
 the last of the last must die 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:12.420

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.519

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.790
 becoming night night drissi mohicani 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:21.470
 now called the reinforcements do not leave 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.380
 the open door you're stupid then who 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.570
 shooter 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:37.810
 it closes where the maligned dogs are 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:37.810
 valve god god swine god if I die 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:52.490
 wardrobe but I kill myself 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.680
 and so to all food you must die 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:01.280
 last of the last, however, is becoming 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:05.990
 I kill me that night a beautiful music 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.990
 to save shooter give me a hand a 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:12.020
 arrange the latter of the latter 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:18.350
 yes killed a dog farm and you where 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:24.190
 come out killed yes I killed them 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:28.400
 Gentlemen dogs from the gunfire killed or 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:37.970
 I'm the wolf hunter plantation pro 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:39.940
 which you are is committed so much suicide now 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.560
 I want it too 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.180
 no it's true i have 11 levels of 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.070
 experience I can't afford to 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.680
 die but what do you need 15 coming? 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.480
 a diamond to make you winning you have 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.710
 reason also on this and reason though 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.710
 when sooner or later we will have it 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:07.229
 now I'm back home after the shooter 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:09.419
 my strongest figure against dogs is 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.749
 it was stupid to actually hit them 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.879
 because we could make friends those e 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:19.490
 they will not expose others for sure 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:21.659
 beautiful base of the ces a orano 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.909
 actually I shouldn't have 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:30.750
 kill them 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:31.830
 but these are not secondary things 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.569
 I remember 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.710
 and then little heaven closed it 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:41.069
 digging a misseri hull boasts as much 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.810
 bryston football is fine for this for 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.740
 this part of the rubbish section 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:50.129
 I would say that everything wants my home 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.900
 impenetrable ugly danti who has me 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:56.370

00:05:51.900 --> 00:06:01.139
 helps I saw it with sky logs for it 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:04.500
 You bastard know the most beautiful thing 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:10.500
 of the skeletons is that time that 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:15.990
 they take you it was axor really all 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:18.899
 I knew a problem really what that 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.919
 I'm done I'm doing things 

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:21.919
 instructive to sport 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:33.240
 those who give me a hand will be around home 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:34.650
 mine because I don't need anything what 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.190
 give me a hand to dig into the house 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:42.090

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:42.360
 dig me not yet, on average, oh my 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.670

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.040
 he used the ugly iron armor for me 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.040
 thief of a skeleton 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:29.970

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:32.220
