00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
little bit of a nail to get in there it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.149 
little bit of a nail to get in there it
wasn't<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.630> easy<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.380> access<00:01:19.770> as<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
wasn't really as easy to access as the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.020 
wasn't really as easy to access as the
other<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.450> buttons<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.290> holes<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:23.030> the

other you know buttons and holes on the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.149 
other you know buttons and holes on the
phone<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.780> really<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.409> made<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> fairly

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
phone it's really it's made of fairly

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.929 
phone it's really it's made of fairly
rigid<00:01:26.340> material<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.119> not<00:01:27.270> very<00:01:27.450> flexible

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
rigid material it's not very flexible

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.569 
rigid material it's not very flexible
either<00:01:29.939> way<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:31.170> very<00:01:31.409> rigid<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.549> a

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
either way it's very rigid and it's a

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.249 
either way it's very rigid and it's a
great<00:01:32.729> quality<00:01:33.119> case<00:01:33.479> doesn't<00:01:33.869> make<00:01:34.110> much

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
great quality case doesn't make much

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.249 
great quality case doesn't make much
noise<00:01:34.640> there<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.790> any<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.900> buttons<00:01:37.140> work

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
noise there is any all the buttons work

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.749 
noise there is any all the buttons work
perfectly<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> cutouts<00:01:38.159> are<00:01:38.310> very<00:01:38.460> precise

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
perfectly the cutouts are very precise

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
perfectly the cutouts are very precise
and<00:01:39.090> without<00:01:39.780> further<00:01:40.020> ado<00:01:40.290> let's<00:01:40.500> put<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and without further ado let's put the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
and without further ado let's put the
case<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.280> those<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.119> actually<00:01:42.240> it's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
case on those really actually it's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.420 
case on those really actually it's
really<00:01:42.689> actually<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.200> um<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:44.130> actually

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
really actually it's um it's actually

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.950 
really actually it's um it's actually
very<00:01:44.460> easy<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.790> put<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.939> case<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.210> all<00:01:45.720> you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
very easy to put the case on all you

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.679 
very easy to put the case on all you
have<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.140> do<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:47.149> align<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> bottom<00:01:48.570> two

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
have to do is align the bottom two

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.899 
have to do is align the bottom two
corners<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.200> then<00:01:49.680> basically<00:01:50.250> squeeze<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
corners and then basically squeeze the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.880 
corners and then basically squeeze the
top<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.329> there<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.720> that's<00:01:52.439> how<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.649> get<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
top in there and that's how you get the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.219 
top in there and that's how you get the
case<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> little<00:01:54.000> bit<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:55.020> just

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
case on there a little bit of you just

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.300 
case on there a little bit of you just
have<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.409> adjust<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.799> case<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> little<00:01:56.219> bit

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
have to adjust the case a little bit

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.880 
have to adjust the case a little bit
because<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.640> rubber<00:01:56.850> kind<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.680> doesn't<00:01:58.680> you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
because the rubber kind of doesn't you

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.410 
because the rubber kind of doesn't you
have<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.100> make<00:01:59.280> sure<00:01:59.310> two<00:01:59.460> rubber<00:01:59.700> covers<00:02:00.119> over

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
have to make sure two rubber covers over

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.690 
have to make sure two rubber covers over
glass<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> corners<00:02:02.219> are<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> little<00:02:02.520> bit<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
glass so the corners are a little bit of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.469 
glass so the corners are a little bit of
a<00:02:02.820> problem<00:02:04.579> wait<00:02:05.579> wait<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.880> minute<00:02:06.090> while<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> get

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
a problem wait wait a minute while I get

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.580 
a problem wait wait a minute while I get
the<00:02:06.570> case<00:02:06.719> on

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the case on

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.309 
the case on
seems<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.310> case<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.670> firmly<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.869> I

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
seems like the case is firmly on the I

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.440 
seems like the case is firmly on the I
have<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.979> very<00:02:11.129> snug<00:02:11.760> fit<00:02:12.090> there<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.420> a

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
have it's very snug fit there is a

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.449 
have it's very snug fit there is a
little<00:02:12.690> bit<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.050> loose<00:02:13.230> fit<00:02:13.739> here<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:14.220> it's

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
little bit of a loose fit here but it's

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.750 
little bit of a loose fit here but it's
not<00:02:14.610> really<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.910> much<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.209> deal<00:02:16.760> overall

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
not really that much of a deal overall

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.070 
not really that much of a deal overall
it's<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.879> great<00:02:17.910> case<00:02:18.239> doesn't<00:02:18.569> distract<00:02:18.930> from

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
it's a great case doesn't distract from

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.050 
it's a great case doesn't distract from
look<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.590> still<00:02:19.920> looks<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> very<00:02:20.760> great

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060
