for you today today I'm gonna look at

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.040 
for you today today I'm gonna look at
the<00:00:20.550> rocktron<00:00:21.449> cyborg<00:00:22.439> digital<00:00:23.099> delay<00:00:23.400> pedal

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
the rocktron cyborg digital delay pedal

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.589 
the rocktron cyborg digital delay pedal
this<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.849> pedal<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.090> little<00:00:27.300> bit<00:00:27.390> more

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
this is a pedal it's a little bit more

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.320 
this is a pedal it's a little bit more
expensive<00:00:27.929> as<00:00:28.470> delay<00:00:28.859> pedals<00:00:29.279> go<00:00:29.490> new<00:00:30.029> it's

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
expensive as delay pedals go new it's

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.170 
expensive as delay pedals go new it's
around<00:00:30.599> 200<00:00:31.140> bucks<00:00:31.550> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> lot<00:00:33.150> of

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
let's go ahead and take a look at some

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.340 
let's go ahead and take a look at some
of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> features<00:00:56.630> okay<00:00:57.630> so<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.990> this<00:00:58.110> demo

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
of the features okay so for this demo

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.210 
of the features okay so for this demo
I'm<00:00:58.620> plugged<00:00:58.950> into<00:00:59.130> my<00:00:59.840> b-52<00:01:00.840> 8100<00:01:01.740> head<00:01:01.920> into

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
I'm plugged into my b-52 8100 head into

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.790 
I'm plugged into my b-52 8100 head into
a<00:01:02.250> Behringer<00:01:02.580> cab<00:01:02.910> I'm<00:01:03.300> using<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:04.320> Ibanez

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
a Behringer cab I'm using my Ibanez

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.730 
a Behringer cab I'm using my Ibanez
hardtail<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.660> I've<00:01:06.660> got<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> delay<00:01:07.320> pedal

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
hardtail and I've got the delay pedal

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.040 
hardtail and I've got the delay pedal
plugged<00:01:08.040> into<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> effects<00:01:08.910> loop<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.750> in

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
plugged into the effects loop not in

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.260 
plugged into the effects loop not in
front<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.410> the<00:01:10.530> amp<00:01:10.710> that's<00:01:11.430> pretty<00:01:11.820> important

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
front of the amp that's pretty important

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.780 
front of the amp that's pretty important
most<00:01:12.810> pretty<00:01:13.440> much<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:13.740> delay<00:01:14.070> pedals<00:01:14.490> really

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
most pretty much all delay pedals really

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.180 
most pretty much all delay pedals really
they<00:01:15.000> work<00:01:15.210> way<00:01:15.540> way<00:01:15.990> better<00:01:16.260> if<00:01:16.590> they're

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
they work way way better if they're

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.620 
they work way way better if they're
plugged<00:01:17.430> into<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.760> effects<00:01:18.120> loop<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.600> your

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
plugged into the effects loop on your

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.440 
plugged into the effects loop on your
amp<00:01:18.900> especially<00:01:19.620> if<00:01:19.890> you're<00:01:20.010> gonna<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.250> using

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
amp especially if you're gonna be using

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.080 
amp especially if you're gonna be using
distortion<00:01:21.450> tones<00:01:21.920> okay<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.190> this<00:01:23.460> pedal<00:01:23.880> has

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
distortion tones okay so this pedal has

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.140 
distortion tones okay so this pedal has
got<00:01:24.330> eight<00:01:24.630> built-in<00:01:25.530> presets<00:01:25.830> I'll<00:01:26.640> go

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
got eight built-in presets I'll go

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.030 
got eight built-in presets I'll go
through<00:01:27.360> those<00:01:27.510> presets<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.290> at<00:01:28.410> a<00:01:28.470> time<00:01:28.710> give

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
through those presets one at a time give

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
through those presets one at a time give
you<00:01:29.130> an<00:01:29.310> example<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.900> I'll

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you an example of them and then I'll

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.450 
you an example of them and then I'll
talk<00:01:31.170> about<00:01:31.440> how<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.890> change<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
talk about how you can change the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.110 
talk about how you can change the
presets

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
presets

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:48.969 
presets
okay<00:01:33.690> here's<00:01:33.930> preset<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:40.340> slap<00:01:41.340> delay

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.980 

okay<00:01:49.979> there's<00:01:50.970> some<00:01:51.090> surf<00:01:51.360> rock<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:51.810> something

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
okay there's some surf rock or something

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.690 
okay there's some surf rock or something
like<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.140> that's<00:01:52.409> cool<00:01:52.680> let's<00:01:53.400> check<00:01:53.460> out

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
like that that's cool let's check out

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:09.260 
like that that's cool let's check out
number<00:01:53.820> two<00:02:07.429> so<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.550> preset<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> little

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
number two so this preset is a little

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.730 
number two so this preset is a little
bit<00:02:09.360> more<00:02:09.570> subtle<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.959> levels<00:02:13.320> turned<00:02:13.590> down

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
bit more subtle the levels turned down

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.740 
bit more subtle the levels turned down
quite<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.070> bit<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:15.030> little<00:02:15.209> bit<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.480> an<00:02:15.600> echo

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
quite a bit just a little bit of an echo

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:41.690 
quite a bit just a little bit of an echo
effect<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.010> three<00:02:40.160> okay<00:02:41.160> that's<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.489> longer

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
effect is it three okay that's a longer

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.009 
effect is it three okay that's a longer
delay<00:02:41.940> let's<00:02:42.300> check<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.660> out<00:02:42.840> with<00:02:42.959> some

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
delay let's check that out with some

00:02:43.019 --> 00:03:10.390 
delay let's check that out with some
Distortion

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:52.880 

okay<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:13.560> let's<00:03:13.860> go<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.069> preset<00:03:14.490> for<00:03:51.890> preset

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
okay and let's go to preset for preset

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:32.749 
okay and let's go to preset for preset
five

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.860 

okay<00:04:33.759> these<00:04:33.969> are<00:04:34.090> getting<00:04:34.240> longer<00:04:34.509> longer

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
okay these are getting longer longer

00:04:34.870 --> 00:05:09.330 
okay these are getting longer longer
let's<00:04:35.740> go<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:35.889> preset<00:04:36.279> six<00:05:07.979> really<00:05:08.979> really

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
let's go to preset six really really

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:21.860 
let's go to preset six really really
long<00:05:09.580> repeats
