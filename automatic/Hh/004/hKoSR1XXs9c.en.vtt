00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.790
 hello very good kids how are we and 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.290
 today I bring you the second video of mancos 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.539
 in the class 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.240
 in this case we are seeing the village of 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:14.659
 a tipejo does not have the town hall of 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.390
 a corner is a very bad village very 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:21.169
 bad I had to say what has the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.599
 city ​​hall on a corner has a 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.699
 central area let's say with everything 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.380
 comes what is the resources the 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.970
 stores three builder candidates 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.949
 and all the collectors and mines and only 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.539
 four of good four defenses plus the 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.940
 castle inside the wall that are two 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.129
 mortars two antiaircraft and good the 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.770
 castle and then all the rest has it 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.850
 let's say here around the area 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.129
 central and so let's say that a little 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.679
 separated to to expand the area of 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.620
 respawn more more out not then 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:58.910
 This is the bad news is bad is very 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.489
 and how bad it can not be as 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.559
 it can be like it can not be better than a 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.570
 bad village you can expect attacks 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.310
 bad is worth then 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.420
 It is a repetition that just made me 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:16.970
 a little while ago 48 minutes ago 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.910
 recently and well then call ryan is 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.570
 in a clan that I do not know where will be English 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.869
 I do not know English and good has attacked me 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.350
 more or less than with 20 vague 107 of 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.850
 goblins 4 breaks walls and 10 barbarians and a 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.580
 giant that has left the castle 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.640
 as you speak in the castle, it is not 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.070
 I know but good ray spells in 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.390
 these two ray guys are not for 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.940
 destroy any mortar or anything 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.070
 now you will see it is very funny and the 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.560
 mancillo is theme given 24 20 trophies 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.590
 that this is very good then we are going to 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.640
 see the repetition and see why I do not 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.840
 has stolen anything hand to steal the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.220
 resources so let's see what is it 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.960
 that has done what he has done 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.540
 then well 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.450
 first payment to the town hall for 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.790
 be cured of what destroys it and let's say a 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.750
 line of magicians here in this area to 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.740
 destroy it is pure magicians so they are very 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.569
 weak 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.880
 die very fast is not recommended 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.190
 do this and well I started to drop 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.069
 goblins like that to destroy the mines by 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.439
 outside and other loose and breaks walls 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.439
 and there he is entering with the elves 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.540
 all magicians have already died so 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.549
 It has been quite useless but good 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.709
 to clean the area a bit too 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.510
 magician is very expensive a long time and not 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.609
 It's worth it, my troops have left 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.939
 castle has released his clan castle 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.290
 there loose more elves and attentive to these 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.319
 Archers from here is the magician there 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.870
 destroying the town hall and outside it 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.159
 there is the city hall to nothing of lives and 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.139
 are all my castle troops 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.599
 outside any loose of the elves not 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:54.030
 I know I do not know why they are missing and attentive 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.829
 a hit of rays the town hall will 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.659
 is nothing other rays to study 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:02.780
 City Hall and look at how it stays 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.459
 the town hall or 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.130
 with what life has the 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.550
 council that is going back to 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.860
 put the repetition because of course 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.260
 it's worth it then 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.000
 again we are going to see a magician the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.830
 town hall to make sure that what 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.710
 destroy that the city does not get but 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.210
 well I try to try the tarpon 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.980
 he has tried it turns out that the magicians 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.000
 that the towers of 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.000
 archers the cannons 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.730
 they can not do anything they have very little 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.769
 life four spaces each 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.200
 break the wall that and immediately my 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.659
 castle troops already and clear as only 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.430
 you do is the magicians and you do not have only 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.959
 has goblins because it has no way of 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.970
 kill her or anything or check the castle 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.280
 before good to review it here in this 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.390
 where it is complicated but good maybe 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.040
 with the castle troops have 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.650
 finished then pantojas towards diaz 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.790
 of the clan castle and just the three 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.170
 shares have cooled loose and 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.010
 goblins to see if it can distract the 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.440
 but no no no 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.260
 my archers go go there are white soul to 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.700
 fuck they saw the wizard of the 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.569
 town hall and the one that leaves nothing of 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.569
 life then 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.609
 I applaud the archers good work because 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.129
 he started jumping from knowing if he 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.389
 clueless and the goblins but have not 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.769
 gone directly to the magician had 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.320
 signed to the magician the magician had seen the 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.630
 trio of the town hall I said is here 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.960
 the city ​​council do not destroy ideas and have 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.280
 gone there and then killed the magician they made it 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.470
 the day to man civ this has thrown two 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.139
 rays level 4 I guess we would be going to 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.129
 watch it now 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:38.490
 and there we are level 4 rays and good 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:40.830
 the wizards at level 3 a little bit trash what 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.860
 let's go to level 3 are malillos and the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.050
