00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it's the right a.m. then because there

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.170 
it's the right a.m. then because there
are<00:00:49.500> two<00:00:49.680> AMS<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> clock<00:00:50.550> pit<00:00:50.820> phone<00:00:50.969> number

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
are two AMS on a clock pit phone number

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.330 
are two AMS on a clock pit phone number
two<00:00:51.329> AM<00:00:51.930> FM<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.800> might<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.070> think<00:00:53.100> this

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
two AM FM now you might not think this

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.889 
two AM FM now you might not think this
matters<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:53.879> either<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> radio

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
matters because either one is the radio

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.060 
matters because either one is the radio
and<00:00:55.050> noise<00:00:55.260> should<00:00:55.440> come<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.710> either<00:00:55.860> way

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and noise should come out either way

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.650 
and noise should come out either way
right<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.550> I'm<00:00:56.760> betting<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.510> listen

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
right but I'm betting you don't listen

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720 
right but I'm betting you don't listen
to<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> whole<00:00:58.140> lot<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.350> AM<00:00:58.770> radio<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.550> I'm

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
to a whole lot of AM radio and so I'm

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.790 
to a whole lot of AM radio and so I'm
betting<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.329> your<00:01:00.600> AM<00:01:00.960> radio<00:01:01.140> isn't<00:01:01.620> even

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
betting that your AM radio isn't even

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.170 
betting that your AM radio isn't even
pre<00:01:02.010> tuned<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> something<00:01:02.699> that's<00:01:02.820> making

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
pre tuned to something that's making

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
pre tuned to something that's making
noise<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.809> mean<00:01:03.989> who's<00:01:04.199> even<00:01:04.500> listening<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.979> AM

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.650 
I guess you could say that's not really
the<00:02:53.130> machines<00:02:53.459> fault<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.030> human<00:02:54.420> error

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
the machines fault it's just human error

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.660 
the machines fault it's just human error
but<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.350> some<00:02:55.560> degree<00:02:55.590> all<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.220> these<00:02:56.370> are<00:02:56.520> just

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
but to some degree all of these are just

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.160 
but to some degree all of these are just
a<00:02:56.730> little<00:02:56.970> bit<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.180> human<00:02:57.450> error<00:02:57.660> there's<00:02:57.900> just

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
a little bit of human error there's just

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.380 
a little bit of human error there's just
so<00:02:58.680> many<00:02:58.920> opportunities<00:02:59.370> for<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.120> fail

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
so many opportunities for you to fail

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.420 
so many opportunities for you to fail
for<00:03:00.780> something<00:03:01.230> that's<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.590> important<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
for something that's so important on a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.370 
for something that's so important on a
day<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.670> day<00:03:02.850> basis<00:03:03.330> but<00:03:03.630> it's<00:03:03.720> not<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.080> day

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
day to day basis but it's not on a day

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.080 
day to day basis but it's not on a day
to<00:03:04.440> day<00:03:04.620> basis<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.190> typically<00:03:05.550> have<00:03:05.670> this

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
to day basis that I typically have this

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
to day basis that I typically have this
problem<00:03:06.540> it's<00:03:06.690> not<00:03:06.780> there's<00:03:06.959> something

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
problem it's not there's something

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.020 
problem it's not there's something
important<00:03:07.770> I<00:03:07.830> have<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.130> wake<00:03:08.280> up<00:03:08.310> for<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.820> next

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
important I have to wake up for the next

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.550 
important I have to wake up for the next
day<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.300> have<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.510> set<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> whole<00:03:09.959> new<00:03:09.990> alarm

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
day and have to set a whole new alarm

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.050 
day and have to set a whole new alarm
and<00:03:10.830> that's<00:03:10.980> what's<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.310> frustrating<00:03:11.490> man

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
and that's what's so frustrating man

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.490 
and that's what's so frustrating man
you're<00:03:12.240> not<00:03:12.330> sleeping<00:03:12.750> through<00:03:13.020> day<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.290> day

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
you're not sleeping through day to day

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.320 
you're not sleeping through day to day
things<00:03:13.800> you're<00:03:13.980> sleeping<00:03:14.310> through<00:03:14.430> important

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
things you're sleeping through important

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.120 
things you're sleeping through important
things<00:03:15.660> like<00:03:15.930> if<00:03:16.020> I'm<00:03:16.170> 15<00:03:16.560> minutes<00:03:16.830> late<00:03:16.980> to

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
things like if I'm 15 minutes late to

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.949 
things like if I'm 15 minutes late to
work<00:03:17.160> it's<00:03:17.550> probably<00:03:18.090> not<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.330> end<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
work it's probably not the end of the

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.630 
work it's probably not the end of the
world<00:03:19.170> but<00:03:19.410> if<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.560> sleep<00:03:19.830> through<00:03:19.890> an<00:03:20.130> exam<00:03:20.459> or

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
world but if I sleep through an exam or

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.460 
world but if I sleep through an exam or
something<00:03:20.940> yeah<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.600> pretty<00:03:21.840> much<00:03:21.959> feels<00:03:22.230> like

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
something yeah it pretty much feels like

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.810 
something yeah it pretty much feels like
the<00:03:22.590> end<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.860> world<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.340> because<00:03:23.640> it's

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
the end of the world and because it's

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.160 
the end of the world and because it's
typically<00:03:24.120> an<00:03:24.300> important<00:03:24.690> event<00:03:24.780> there's

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
typically an important event there's

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.220 
typically an important event there's
really<00:03:25.410> no<00:03:25.800> room<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:26.340> failure<00:03:26.850> if<00:03:27.300> 99<00:03:28.080> out<00:03:28.200> of

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
really no room for failure if 99 out of

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.199 
really no room for failure if 99 out of
100<00:03:28.440> times<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:29.100> set<00:03:29.340> your<00:03:29.519> alarm<00:03:29.580> correctly
