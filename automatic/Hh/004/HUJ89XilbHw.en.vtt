it<00:02:20.639> in<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:21.420> wavy<00:02:21.719> form<00:02:22.230> because<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.219> don't

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
it in it's wavy form because I don't

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.270 
it in it's wavy form because I don't
like<00:02:23.760> really<00:02:24.749> short<00:02:25.079> curly<00:02:25.590> hair<00:02:25.769> on<00:02:25.920> me<00:02:26.129> it

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
like really short curly hair on me it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.979 
like really short curly hair on me it
looks<00:02:26.519> really<00:02:26.939> weird<00:02:26.969> to<00:02:27.599> me

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
looks really weird to me

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.500 
looks really weird to me
because<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.709> feel<00:02:28.889> like<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.099> have<00:02:29.219> a<00:02:29.250> fat<00:02:29.670> face<00:02:30.090> so

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
because I feel like I have a fat face so

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.899 
because I feel like I have a fat face so
it<00:02:31.170> doesn't<00:02:31.560> frame<00:02:31.769> my<00:02:31.920> face<00:02:32.159> well<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.700> has<00:02:32.879> a

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
it doesn't frame my face well it has a

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.759 
it doesn't frame my face well it has a
really<00:02:33.209> pretty<00:02:33.299> curl<00:02:33.840> powder<00:02:34.109> and<00:02:34.409> it<00:02:34.530> easily

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
really pretty curl powder and it easily

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.569 
really pretty curl powder and it easily
straightens<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:36.019> it<00:02:37.019> easily<00:02:37.439> curls<00:02:37.950> as<00:02:38.219> you

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
straightens and it easily curls as you

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.580 
straightens and it easily curls as you
can<00:02:38.790> see<00:02:39.120> these<00:02:39.419> girls<00:02:39.629> have<00:02:39.959> been<00:02:40.169> in<00:02:40.319> here

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
can see these girls have been in here

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.550 
can see these girls have been in here
for<00:02:40.650> about<00:02:41.370> two<00:02:41.639> days<00:02:41.879> and<00:02:42.239> it's<00:02:42.810> still<00:02:43.139> curled

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
for about two days and it's still curled

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.179 
for about two days and it's still curled
really<00:02:44.069> nicely<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.849> didn't<00:02:45.239> use<00:02:45.510> any

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
really nicely and I didn't use any

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:53.000 
really nicely and I didn't use any
I<00:02:47.219> didn't<00:02:48.150> use<00:02:48.269> any<00:02:48.419> hairspray<00:02:51.439> so<00:02:52.439> that<00:02:52.769> SOT

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
I didn't use any hairspray so that SOT

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.970 
I didn't use any hairspray so that SOT
looks<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.489> back<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.409> it<00:02:55.409> already<00:02:55.680> comes

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
looks in the back and it already comes

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.119 
looks in the back and it already comes
with<00:02:56.159> layers<00:02:56.579> as<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.090> can<00:02:57.359> see<00:02:57.659> and<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.889> comes

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
with layers as you can see and it comes

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.449 
with layers as you can see and it comes
like<00:02:59.459> pretty<00:02:59.819> well<00:03:00.180> layered<00:03:01.069> so<00:03:02.069> you<00:03:02.189> don't

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
like pretty well layered so you don't

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.580 
like pretty well layered so you don't
have<00:03:02.669> to<00:03:02.879> do<00:03:03.000> any<00:03:03.239> work<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.379> can<00:03:04.560> just

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
have to do any work to it you can just

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.039 
have to do any work to it you can just
curl<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.489> go<00:03:05.699> with<00:03:05.939> it<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.329> this<00:03:06.659> is<00:03:06.719> the

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
curl it and go with it so this is the

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.610 
curl it and go with it so this is the
whole<00:03:07.260> way<00:03:09.919> it's<00:03:10.919> not<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.159> very<00:03:11.519> full<00:03:11.879> wig<00:03:12.180> and

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
whole way it's not a very full wig and

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.849 
whole way it's not a very full wig and
the<00:03:13.620> reason<00:03:14.129> that<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:15.780> really<00:03:16.349> like<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.739> is

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
the reason that I really like it is

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.710 
the reason that I really like it is
because<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.519> looks<00:03:17.729> more<00:03:17.819> natural<00:03:18.419> looking

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
because it looks more natural looking

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.319 
because it looks more natural looking
because<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.439> not<00:03:19.680> full<00:03:20.009> I<00:03:20.250> love<00:03:20.879> full

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
because it's not full I love full

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.960 
because it's not full I love full
divalicious<00:03:22.019> wigs<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.489> one<00:03:23.639> looks<00:03:23.669> like

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
divalicious wigs but this one looks like

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.809 
divalicious wigs but this one looks like
it<00:03:24.180> could<00:03:24.329> be<00:03:24.449> my<00:03:24.599> real<00:03:24.870> hair<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.549> that's<00:03:26.549> what

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
it could be my real hair and that's what

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.210 
it could be my real hair and that's what
I<00:03:26.849> like<00:03:27.150> about<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.629> it's<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.989> very<00:03:28.319> realistic

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
I like about it it's a very realistic

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.099 
I like about it it's a very realistic
unit<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.239> if<00:03:30.359> you're<00:03:30.509> going<00:03:30.750> for<00:03:31.049> something

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
unit and if you're going for something

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.679 
unit and if you're going for something
that<00:03:31.620> looks<00:03:31.859> very<00:03:32.129> realistic<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:33.419> I<00:03:33.509> would

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
that looks very realistic and I would

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.710 
that looks very realistic and I would
definitely<00:03:34.139> recommend<00:03:34.259> this<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:35.069> have<00:03:35.879> had<00:03:36.090> no

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
thing I hate about though the hairline

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.899 
thing I hate about though the hairline
it's<00:03:51.900> kind<00:03:52.169> of<00:03:52.290> moon<00:03:52.500> shaped<00:03:52.889> French<00:03:53.609> lace

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
wigs are moon shaped unfortunately so I

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.369 
wigs are moon shaped unfortunately so I
wouldn't<00:03:59.250> wear<00:03:59.340> this<00:03:59.579> unit<00:03:59.939> back<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.599> would

wouldn't wear this unit back I would

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.499 
wouldn't wear this unit back I would
definitely<00:04:01.769> put<00:04:01.919> a<00:04:01.979> part<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.639> and<00:04:02.819> rock<00:04:03.449> it

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
like that doesn't have much lace on it

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.749 
like that doesn't have much lace on it
it<00:04:07.109> probably<00:04:07.319> has<00:04:07.620> about<00:04:07.889> an<00:04:08.009> inch<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.579> length

feels so the color is a 1b I don't know

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.469 
if I said that are
I<00:04:17.799> think<00:04:18.069> this<00:04:18.190> looks<00:04:18.430> really<00:04:18.519> natural<00:04:21.300> it's<00:04:22.300> a

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
I think this looks really natural it's a
