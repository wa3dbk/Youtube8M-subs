00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.055
 Where will your journey end? 

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:14.365
 You are looking for what gives you the right to become a ruler. 

00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:22.332
 You long to retake your homeland and kill the dragon. 

00:00:34.146 --> 00:00:35.448
 For the sake of darkness 

00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:40.009
 Do not think that I will not kill you, dwarf. 

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:45.178
 When did we let evil become stronger than us? 

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:47.489
 This is not our battle. 

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:49.954
 No, this is our battle. 

00:00:52.628 --> 00:00:53.925
 And if it is a trap? 

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:58.128
 Of course, this is a trap. 

00:00:59.773 --> 00:01:02.024
 OUTSIDE OF THE VOID 

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:05.278
 Such is the nature of evil. 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.324
 Over time, evil creatures cease to hide. 

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:14.987
 EXPECTS GREAT HAZARD 

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.726
 If you wake the monster, you will destroy us all. 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.434
 Is it an earthquake? 

00:01:33.732 --> 00:01:35.258
 This, my friend ... 

00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:39.003
 ...the Dragon. 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.571
