00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
whisk but it's about adding a little of

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.980 
whisk but it's about adding a little of
the<00:01:31.409> hot<00:01:31.560> milk<00:01:31.740> at<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.009> time<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:33.000> allowing<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the hot milk at a time and allowing the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.410 
the hot milk at a time and allowing the
heat<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.439> its<00:01:34.590> job<00:01:34.770> which<00:01:35.009> burst<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
heat to do its job which burst the the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.240 
heat to do its job which burst the the
starch<00:01:36.659> molecules<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.680> allows<00:01:37.860> it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
starch molecules and then it allows it

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.429 
starch molecules and then it allows it
to<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.850> milk<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.540> incorporated<00:01:39.780> into<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
to the milk to be incorporated into the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.800 
to the milk to be incorporated into the
roof<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.850> little<00:01:42.000> beating<00:01:42.479> motion

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
roof so it's that little beating motion

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.330 
roof so it's that little beating motion
at<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:42.960> end<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:43.770> burst<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> heat

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
at the end and that little burst of heat

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.069 
at the end and that little burst of heat
that<00:01:44.759> smooths<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.750> between<00:01:45.869> each

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
that smooths it out in between each

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.170 
that smooths it out in between each
addition<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.740> milk<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> important

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
addition of milk so that's the important

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.830 
addition of milk so that's the important
bit<00:01:48.409> all<00:01:49.409> right<00:01:49.619> oh<00:01:49.909> god<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> together<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.689> don't
