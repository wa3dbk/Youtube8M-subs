00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 all the boxes are not traced back to me 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.410
 girls today days of video I am 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.360
 straining even if the tooth hurts 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.950
 park power that if worse is still the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.530
 shop even more then fail to 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.599
 talk about it to farmville 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.930
 in any case, today video precisely about the new ones 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.779
 set up of kate and on new ones provoked 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.119
 training calyx then all one a 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.189
 small all of rimmel 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.099
 I love kate moss and lately 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.590
 I discovered that I had never held in 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.200
 imac consideration of kate moss those 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.360
 with the red pack that I don't 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.120
 sorry at all but a problem that is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.219
 I would like from a life in 104 to 107 not 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.690
 I can find them in stores with 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.300
 parma you see that they do not sort them 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.550
 stands well and are always broken or 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 there are not 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.809
 and I wanted and am looking for a life of 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.059
 aim is the new pencil of acol news that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.170
 stu perna say is not on time 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.480
 found anywhere 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.219
 however these are three of the new ones 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.030
 colors come out those that I like 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.979
 more and they are 36 31 05 see I wanted to do 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.420
 see quickly on the lips 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.420
 let's start from the 36 that my favorite 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.810
 then I found them slightly more 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.000
 shine in the rem gods already present in 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.049
 collection however despite this a 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.509
 they practice a fruit fragrance 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.659
 fantastic I use them with under one 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.700
 rather dull pencil and I get a 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.680
 effect also slightly buffers that 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.990
 however it becomes rather velvet therefore 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:42.030
 I do not mind and this is the 36 that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:46.290
 then I love the 0 5 instead it is a kind of 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:52.409
 very beautiful old bricks rose there 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:57.060
 I show this every day 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.159
 a news my lips butler that emphasizes ve 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.210
 in the color of the lips and rose 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.040
 I really like it's a light chin to 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.480
 marsala but remains in the category of 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.020
 rose 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:14.060
 waves but will do other than I chose is the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.160
 number 31 which surely more 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.540
 autumn because it is more intense but 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.540
 beautiful I'll show you 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:45.090
 and from this he has a swollen cheek 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:47.590
 virtually a lipstick is he anyway 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.480
 it's nice and in fact I had put it 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.650
 with the pencil the other times it seems more 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.730
 dark put on by itself 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.310
 no, however, as you can see, they have slightly 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.950
 more brightness than rain and classics that 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.470
 on me they were much more satèn and tiri ho 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.530
 taken only these do not hold me 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.790
 but especially my lips I find that 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.519
 however, they have a rather long duration 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.920
 good not obviously comparable to 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.650
 example to a madman who or in any case for 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.720
 be non-lucid but not even loved 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.190
 duration is pretty good me if there 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.410
 I apply with one below but you with one 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.030
 pencil really do measure a lot 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.860
 lately I'm really enjoying them 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.500
 long lasting of wight with pencils 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.510
 lips, and I really like and 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.350
 new collistar that I find fantastic 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.519
 this new collection and I discovered 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.049
 very very good but I already knew it 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.060
 those of clarence even though there 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.090
 this year a little bit more ok 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.430
 we come to these provaca lips instead 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.130
 are shades for lips than from a 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.010
 side step 1 we have the color that to 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.660
 end dries turns out to be opaque 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.220
 on the other hand we have the fix 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.620
 umbrella that would practically be the 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.350
 color fixer with echoes that have become 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.090
 reddish I try to wear them too 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.190
 without the fix it seems like why anyway 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.100
 I like matte effect but on me I am 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.299
 absolutely too dry ie tia 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.220
 portal where to put on his tour 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.140
 okaka roma if elected under the burqa o 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.040
 does not take root well and I do not 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.290
 do is as it should 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.500
 I chose two colors in particular 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.970
 we hope we find the other number 110 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:31.050
 little minx and the fatal number 230 kiss 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:31.050
 I 'll show you this is beautiful 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.380
 you don't notice real girls that you 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.290
 like foxes 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.250
 lately I am in landline for and fuchsia or 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:48.669
 for the purple defects of this product 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.490
 you will have already noticed it is very liquidino e 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.900
 so it tends to print itself and also 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.120
 with the applicator difficult to apply 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.889
 because it is sold by the edges so I am there 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.860
 I must always apply with a pencil 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.289
 transparent to the outline and I prefer 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:07.120
 take from the messina with a small brush 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:08.530
 because it is said that there was already at once 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.479
 that it dries then it doesn't move anymore 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.820
 however being very liquid at a 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.560
 little more difficulty than 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.360
 example to the colors of kiko to apply it 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.130
 while we wait for this show 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.979
 I'll show them to you on the other hand 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.190
 color that instead is beautiful a beautiful intense 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.320
 burgondi but depending on how much 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.410
 you will put the result of an intense or a 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.500
 Burgundy more challenging and different 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.599
 of the pink one that has none for the 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.370
 science inside this has one 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.370
 light for science and this is it 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.060
 then for example I found it on mine 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.680
 friend that lips very clear and 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.050
 my lips seem clearer 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.080
 rather obscure and therefore sent a lot 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.060
 more at the burgondi then as you can see 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:57.070
 it is drying and once it is fixed 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:01.270
 no longer takes off and becomes dull though 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:05.320
 alone I don't know if you notice that you can't 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.300
 note look at that is very sticky 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.610
 very stiff according to me it is not made for 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.870
 to be carried alone I will do it for you 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.130
 see the cost including his big one 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.560
 which certainly makes it more 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.630
 comfortable even if I continue to 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.419
 have an idea indeed companies if you ever 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.030
 views are looking I recommend you do 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.830
 there the double of the lipstick e 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.270
 because we apply a lipstick 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.830
 Once a day the gloss must 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.240
 continue and put it to keep 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.010
 the comfortable trim 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.020
 otherwise glosses end sooner 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.150
 because it's not just a gloss that one says 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.710
 puts us on my year transparent gloss 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.970
 within the fixative polymers 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.500
 therefore it cannot be replaced by a 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.199
 other product 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.349
 small engraved and is the one with his 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:43.349
 big 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.669
 I will show you something you see that 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.990
 did not move to the brush 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:56.759
 precisely because one adheres very well 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.759
 once it dries it does not release the product 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:06.909
 and in my opinion with the cross it becomes a lot 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:09.250
 very nice good thing 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:11.560
 the gloss dries after a while and then 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.870
 you must I advise you to bring it to you 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.690
 handbag to be able to reapply I 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.830
 these I paid her 10 euros and 90 but he 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.330
 I wrote that the girls 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.479
 found on offer 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.490
 maybe not from tigotà or soap making 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:26.379
 I remember however it must be paid 790 then 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.379
 much better I can always do the 

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:31.449
 things at their maximum price while 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:34.150
 those I would say I found them on offer 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:37.000
 strangely from miracle coin and I have it 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:40.360
 paid instead of 896 90 then a 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.190
 price that added up valid and convenient 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.710
 I hope the video was helpful and 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.020
 I hope soon we turn it over Monday 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:50.409
 we still see favorite sites but that 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:53.039
 if I don't have a face like that, a kiss to 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:53.039
 next video
