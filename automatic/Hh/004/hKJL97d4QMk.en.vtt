prior to repainting is actually get

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.189 
prior to repainting is actually get
yourself<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.099> tube<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.789> toothpaste<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.990> can

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
yourself a tube of toothpaste you can

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.620 
yourself a tube of toothpaste you can
just<00:00:28.349> use<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> toothpaste<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:30.090> fill<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.449> those

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.900 
just use the toothpaste to fill in those
holes<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.289> if<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.130> know<00:00:32.160> white<00:00:32.550> paste

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
holes and if it's a you know white paste

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.060 
holes and if it's a you know white paste
that's<00:00:33.360> typically<00:00:33.750> better<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.620> toothpaste

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
that's typically better that toothpaste

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.030 
that's typically better that toothpaste
will<00:00:35.219> actually<00:00:35.520> dry<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.739> give<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.890> good

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
will actually dry and give you a good

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.680 
will actually dry and give you a good
surface<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:39.739> to<00:00:40.739> paint<00:00:40.980> over<00:00:41.360> for<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.510> so

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
surface to to paint over for that so

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.000 
surface to to paint over for that so
that's<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:43.050> something<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.320> use<00:00:43.620> risks<00:00:43.920> with

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
that's just something you use risks with

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.310 
that's just something you use risks with
some<00:00:44.190> around<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> house<00:00:44.870> now<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:46.140> you've<00:00:46.289> got

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
some around the house now if you've got

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.830 
some around the house now if you've got
some<00:00:46.620> larger<00:00:47.039> areas<00:00:47.430> then<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.539> good

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
some larger areas then a good

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.670 
some larger areas then a good
lightweight<00:00:49.289> spackling<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:51.110> is<00:00:52.110> useful<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
lightweight spackling is is useful to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.170 
lightweight spackling is is useful to
have<00:00:52.800> around<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.430> good<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> that's

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
have around and good for that and that's

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.139 
have around and good for that and that's
what<00:00:54.780> we'll<00:00:54.930> use<00:00:55.370> for<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.489> particular<00:00:56.730> case

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
what we'll use for this particular case

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.170 
what we'll use for this particular case
and<00:00:57.949> this<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.070> an<00:00:59.190> old<00:00:59.309> attach<00:00:59.609> point<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.090> we

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and this is an old attach point that we

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.060 
and this is an old attach point that we
had<00:01:00.359> an<00:01:00.480> old<00:01:00.600> anchor<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.739> want<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.920> do

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
had an old anchor so what you want to do

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.250 
had an old anchor so what you want to do
is<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.280> want<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> scoop<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.049> your

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
is you want to just take a scoop of your

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.580 
is you want to just take a scoop of your
lightweight<00:01:04.470> spackling<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
lightweight spackling and you want to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.120 
lightweight spackling and you want to
press<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:09.080> into<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.260> area<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:13.130> typically

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
press it into the area and typically

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.550 
press it into the area and typically
anything<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:17.689> that<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.869> repair<00:01:19.290> like

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
anything that we that we repair like

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.640 
anything that we that we repair like
this<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.330> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.600> sitting<00:01:22.080> down<00:01:22.110> below

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
this is going to be sitting down below

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.219 
this is going to be sitting down below
the<00:01:22.799> surface<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> what<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.080> we

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the surface so what we want to do is we

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.749 
the surface so what we want to do is we
don't<00:01:25.409> want<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> whole<00:01:26.250> lot<00:01:26.280> of

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
don't want to have to do a whole lot of

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.940 
don't want to have to do a whole lot of
sanding<00:01:27.659> when<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.380> use<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.680> lightweight

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
sanding when we use this lightweight

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.020 
sanding when we use this lightweight
spackling<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.200> fill<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.030> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
spackling so when you fill it in and you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.710 
spackling so when you fill it in and you
just<00:01:33.060> scrape<00:01:33.509> across<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.850> then<00:01:35.850> any<00:01:36.090> residual

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
just scrape across and then any residual

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.179 
just scrape across and then any residual
you<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.680> kind<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.979> rub<00:01:38.189> rub<00:01:38.850> away<00:01:40.189> but

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you can just kind of rub rub away but

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.429 
you can just kind of rub rub away but
now<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.579> need<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.759> do<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:43.049> need<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.290> let

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
now what we need to do is we need to let

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.130 
now what we need to do is we need to let
this<00:01:43.619> dry<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.549> 10<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.060> 15<00:01:45.210> minutes<00:01:45.869> with

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
this dry for about 10 to 15 minutes with

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.840 
this dry for about 10 to 15 minutes with
the<00:01:46.229> lightweight<00:01:46.619> spackling<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:48.890> in<00:01:49.890> some

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the lightweight spackling and in some

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.179 
the lightweight spackling and in some
cases<00:01:51.149> may<00:01:51.509> need<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.810> take<00:01:52.380> something<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
cases may need to take something like a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.670 
cases may need to take something like a
220<00:01:53.909> grit<00:01:54.090> sandpaper<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.049> 300<00:01:55.530> grit

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
220 grit sandpaper or a 300 grit

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.469 
220 grit sandpaper or a 300 grit
sandpaper<00:01:56.040> or<00:01:56.369> something<00:01:56.700> really<00:01:56.909> fine

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
sandpaper or something really fine

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.770 
sandpaper or something really fine
and<00:01:57.799> just<00:01:58.799> lightly<00:01:59.070> sand<00:01:59.430> over<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.820> area<00:02:00.030> but

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and just lightly sand over this area but

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.420 
and just lightly sand over this area but
in<00:02:00.899> most<00:02:01.110> cases<00:02:01.500> when<00:02:01.860> you're<00:02:01.979> doing<00:02:02.219> minor

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
in most cases when you're doing minor

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.639 
in most cases when you're doing minor
repairs<00:02:02.969> if<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> good<00:02:04.020> job<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.590> just

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
