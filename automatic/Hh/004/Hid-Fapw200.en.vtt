00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:14.129
 hello such greetings to the whole band was good then I want to do 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.589
 a video percent this miner is referring to the concept of what in 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.589
 Sometimes we have come to talk or comment 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.319
 that we can write the own countries with which we are 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:31.210
 feeding our turtles for that saying that the theater some 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.330
 microbes the kids that we buy in the markets 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.780
 Well, it's very simple, look what I did, I just bought a little 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.500
 where of alga 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.850
 I do not remember the name of this species of algae but sometimes it is very common in 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.250
 either side to find 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.530
 it is a very healthy species because it is 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.010
 If it grows easily, it grows easily with just a little 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.630
 Sun 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.780
 begins to grow does not need even root 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.400
 but this time it is buried what I do recommend is that of the treatment of 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.010
 hold on a trunk 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.820
 because otherwise it starts there 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.360
 to walk everywhere 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.830
 is that they sit on a piece of mangrove 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.100
 make holes with a drill and there join four or five branches 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.470
 I invent the positions just like I did 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.570
 and it is common because he managed that he is not moving 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.070
 if you are in a little bit of attention and pity that you are going in the shade 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.190
 barely visible 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.370
 to fill them the dads of the minnows 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.940
 solomon sara reads already great as cordobeses pc by seem 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.000
 p like someone who still says with the sword but 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.140
 of tone 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.500
 detonated this healthy business have the typical orange colors 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.110
 i have an average mochomo focus in brazil four males more or less 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.110
 they have commissioned to have their jokes 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.220
 because of all that 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.830
 so you can see that out there they go a lot with a lot of 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.220
 from fry yard already this club and healthy growing them 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.210
 slowly 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.050
 let's come over there you get to see some right now as is the sun in 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.420
 full that hides 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.019
 it is very curious that we were moved 0 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.119
 from there the little fish walk 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:16.719
 that have been had in addition there is another more than objects 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.579
 they are hidden in 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.499
 between the platform and all are below 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.849
 i some are here because of that day in the league 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.539
 as well as cry that the Gemini options chunk draws everything 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.709
 pepa with what we will do 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.030
 well easily about 150 to new vines 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:38.509
 and there they go percent of the begin to some and to grow 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:42.259
 some are already a little bit bigger at all times there are there of all 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:44.169
 sizes there are ones that are 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.089
 that someone gave me the best about 5 millimeters 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:51.299
 but there are also others that already measure approximately five o'clock or five o'clock 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.539
 six centimeters 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.709
 then as such they are interested 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.090
 schulz who jesus 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.070
 that they always have food 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.090
 forgiveness suspend your turtles have food that simply what you have 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.309
 tasks 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:07.299
 put a little sand because because the almeria because they are going to be the 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.089
 fry answer small 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:12.109
 and of course have a good fleet of kids 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.819
 that allow them just to begin to procreate 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.599
 to everyone else 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.759
 salek and it is so this mind like you can not 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:24.799
 put so your city PCs and your turtles forgiveness can go 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.289
 feeding all those when you least careless rocky rock pont were going to die 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.229
 he took chabÃ¡n 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.829
 then in that way it's like I do 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.009
 they feed and have food available 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.009
 Okay then that's the recommendation or how can you 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.639
 generate 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.769
 per cent and have their own babies either bup and soda de charales 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.489
 all they need is a good space 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.359
 a good temperature 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.759
 a bit of male and female algae and nature takes care of everything 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:56.529
 the rest 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:00.319
 do not worry so much them three in eating solutions 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.779
 it's like fish food every third day and look and they're growing 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.809
 Shannon moment I did not care or go there 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:10.909
 he stood on a maternity grenade 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.949
 nature are Basque 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.150
 if we pay attention there they go everywhere 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.430
 the little fishes 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.430
 there they go there they walk north even with the filter so that one 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:24.219
 we had problems with sound 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:26.680
 they come here there are a lot too 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.449
 this side and they are 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.590
 dirty is not easy to get them to start playing 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:35.650
 the fish only understand 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.360
 where has its structure 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.219
 really needed 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:42.219
 are not the heads of the happy cars comadres 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:43.990
 one 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.979
 leaning 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.809
 the charms with 12 and insult 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:52.299
 come out guys that's that easy is that they can start producing dams 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.749
 this one for which we have been experimenting and good to be certain that they are fish 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:59.419
 healthy without parasites 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.330
 and acts for your turtles until soon it can be
