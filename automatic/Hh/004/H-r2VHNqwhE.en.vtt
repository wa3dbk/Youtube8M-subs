hello guys Winston here it's been quite

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.870 
hello guys Winston here it's been quite
a<00:00:13.870> while<00:00:14.020> since<00:00:14.080> my<00:00:14.410> last<00:00:14.530> CNC<00:00:15.190> project<00:00:15.670> and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
a while since my last CNC project and

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.429 
a while since my last CNC project and
that's<00:00:16.090> because<00:00:16.480> I<00:00:16.509> was<00:00:16.720> on<00:00:16.810> a<00:00:16.840> rotational

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
that's because I was on a rotational

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.380 
that's because I was on a rotational
detail<00:00:17.800> for<00:00:18.040> work<00:00:18.250> which<00:00:18.550> took<00:00:18.820> me<00:00:18.939> to<00:00:19.029> Florida

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
detail for work which took me to Florida

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.179 
detail for work which took me to Florida
for<00:00:19.540> two<00:00:19.689> months<00:00:19.960> I<00:00:20.170> didn't<00:00:20.860> have<00:00:20.950> a<00:00:20.980> lot<00:00:21.160> of

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
for two months I didn't have a lot of

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.010 
for two months I didn't have a lot of
time<00:00:21.400> at<00:00:21.550> home<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:21.790> by<00:00:22.210> extension<00:00:22.599> with<00:00:22.869> my

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
time at home and by extension with my

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.380 
time at home and by extension with my
shaco<00:00:23.380> Co<00:00:23.560> it<00:00:24.160> is<00:00:24.310> also<00:00:24.520> however<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.060> reason<00:00:25.210> I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
shaco Co it is also however the reason I

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.609 
shaco Co it is also however the reason I
was<00:00:25.509> able<00:00:25.570> to<00:00:25.720> make<00:00:25.899> several<00:00:26.079> trips<00:00:26.380> to<00:00:26.470> the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
was able to make several trips to the

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.139 
was able to make several trips to the
Kennedy<00:00:26.950> Space<00:00:27.070> Center<00:00:27.220> so<00:00:27.489> I<00:00:27.669> think<00:00:27.759> it's<00:00:28.060> a

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:28.149 
Kennedy Space Center so I think it's a

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.089 
Kennedy Space Center so I think it's a
net<00:00:28.329> win<00:00:28.540> if<00:00:29.140> you<00:00:29.349> didn't<00:00:29.500> bother<00:00:29.619> to<00:00:29.829> see<00:00:29.980> my

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
net win if you didn't bother to see my

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.859 
net win if you didn't bother to see my
last<00:00:30.279> video<00:00:30.579> it<00:00:30.849> was<00:00:30.970> a<00:00:31.000> montage<00:00:31.360> showing<00:00:31.750> off

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
last video it was a montage showing off

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.210 
last video it was a montage showing off
some<00:00:32.079> of<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.259> things<00:00:32.470> I<00:00:32.559> got<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:32.739> see<00:00:33.010> while

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
some of the things I got to see while

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.760 
some of the things I got to see while
exploring<00:00:33.579> KSC<00:00:34.239> as<00:00:34.450> part<00:00:34.750> of<00:00:34.809> NASA<00:00:35.050> social<00:00:35.380> a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
exploring KSC as part of NASA social a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.590 
exploring KSC as part of NASA social a
program<00:00:36.399> that<00:00:36.550> gives<00:00:36.670> press<00:00:36.969> credentials<00:00:37.300> to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
program that gives press credentials to

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.240 
program that gives press credentials to
social<00:00:37.960> media<00:00:38.170> users<00:00:38.530> who<00:00:38.710> want<00:00:38.830> to<00:00:38.920> share<00:00:39.100> the

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
social media users who want to share the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.010 
social media users who want to share the
experience<00:00:39.280> with<00:00:39.820> others<00:00:40.090> I<00:00:40.480> got<00:00:40.750> to<00:00:40.870> see<00:00:40.990> a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
experience with others I got to see a

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.390 
experience with others I got to see a
lot<00:00:41.140> of<00:00:41.200> really<00:00:41.410> cool<00:00:41.650> things<00:00:41.920> like<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.220> Orion

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
lot of really cool things like the Orion

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.640 
lot of really cool things like the Orion
crew<00:00:42.910> exploration<00:00:43.330> vehicle<00:00:43.690> in<00:00:44.170> addition<00:00:44.560> to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
crew exploration vehicle in addition to

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.770 
crew exploration vehicle in addition to
the<00:00:44.740> launch<00:00:44.950> of<00:00:45.130> a<00:00:45.280> falcon<00:00:45.670> 9<00:00:45.700> rocket<00:00:45.880> I'll

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
the launch of a falcon 9 rocket I'll

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.120 
the launch of a falcon 9 rocket I'll
probably<00:00:47.050> make<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.290> video<00:00:47.470> explaining<00:00:47.950> what

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
probably make a video explaining what

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.800 
probably make a video explaining what
was<00:00:48.220> going<00:00:48.490> on<00:00:48.550> in<00:00:48.700> that<00:00:48.820> montage<00:00:49.180> in<00:00:49.330> February

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
was going on in that montage in February

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.810 
was going on in that montage in February
so<00:00:50.290> if<00:00:50.410> your<00:00:50.530> side's<00:00:50.770> inclined<00:00:51.220> you<00:00:51.400> may<00:00:51.610> want

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
so if your side's inclined you may want

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.730 
so if your side's inclined you may want
to<00:00:51.850> keep<00:00:52.000> an<00:00:52.150> eye<00:00:52.240> out<00:00:52.390> for<00:00:52.420> that<00:00:52.600> now<00:00:53.350> back<00:00:53.710> to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
to keep an eye out for that now back to

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.440 
to keep an eye out for that now back to
our<00:00:53.890> regularly<00:00:54.310> scheduled<00:00:54.820> programming<00:00:55.180> I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
our regularly scheduled programming I

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.150 
our regularly scheduled programming I
have<00:00:56.020> a<00:00:56.050> lot<00:00:56.200> of<00:00:56.320> projects<00:00:56.650> planned<00:00:56.829> for<00:00:57.040> this

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
have a lot of projects planned for this

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.710 
have a lot of projects planned for this
year<00:00:57.400> that<00:00:57.550> I'm<00:00:57.640> really<00:00:57.820> excited<00:00:58.000> about<00:00:58.270> so<00:00:58.690> I

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
year that I'm really excited about so I

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.479 
year that I'm really excited about so I
figured<00:00:59.110> I'd<00:00:59.200> do<00:00:59.290> a<00:00:59.320> pre<00:00:59.650> spring<00:00:59.980> cleaning<00:01:00.280> and

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
figured I'd do a pre spring cleaning and

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.819 
figured I'd do a pre spring cleaning and
tune-up<00:01:00.940> on<00:01:01.090> my<00:01:01.270> ship<00:01:01.480> OCO<00:01:01.810> it's<00:01:02.440> been<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.650> while

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
tune-up on my ship OCO it's been a while

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.140 
tune-up on my ship OCO it's been a while
since<00:01:03.070> I've<00:01:03.250> done<00:01:03.280> any<00:01:03.610> sort<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:03.910> maintenance

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
since I've done any sort of maintenance

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.510 
since I've done any sort of maintenance
activity<00:01:04.780> on<00:01:04.869> my<00:01:05.019> CNC<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:05.530> because<00:01:06.130> I<00:01:06.159> spent<00:01:06.460> a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
activity on my CNC and because I spent a

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.280 
activity on my CNC and because I spent a
couple<00:01:06.700> days<00:01:06.820> during<00:01:07.119> my<00:01:07.270> rotation<00:01:07.810> shadowing

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
couple days during my rotation shadowing

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.020 
couple days during my rotation shadowing
an<00:01:08.380> engineer<00:01:08.799> in<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.040> machine<00:01:09.369> shop<00:01:09.579> I<00:01:09.790> thought

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
an engineer in a machine shop I thought

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.190 
an engineer in a machine shop I thought
this<00:01:10.149> would<00:01:10.329> be<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.450> good<00:01:10.630> time<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.990> start

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
this would be a good time to start

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.420 
this would be a good time to start
putting<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.500> little<00:01:11.650> more<00:01:11.860> thought<00:01:12.070> into<00:01:12.250> my

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
putting a little more thought into my

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.340 
putting a little more thought into my
experimentations<00:01:13.270> while<00:01:14.020> learning<00:01:14.170> about

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
experimentations while learning about

experimentations while learning about

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
all the tolerances that industrial CNC

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.030 
all the tolerances that industrial CNC
machines<00:01:16.750> are<00:01:16.900> held<00:01:17.050> to<00:01:17.229> I<00:01:17.409> gained<00:01:17.920> an

machines are held to I gained an
appreciation<00:01:18.130> for<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:18.909> dedication<00:01:19.330> to

appreciation for that dedication to

appreciation for that dedication to
precision<00:01:20.050> that<00:01:20.170> machinists<00:01:20.800> have<00:01:21.010> and<00:01:21.250> while
