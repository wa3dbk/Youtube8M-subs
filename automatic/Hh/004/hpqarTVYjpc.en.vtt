chain has swivels on it which if it were
stick<00:01:05.119> to<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.390> ground<00:01:05.630> I<00:01:05.869> could<00:01:05.930> easily<00:01:06.290> move

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
stick to the ground I could easily move

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.950 
stick to the ground I could easily move
my<00:01:06.920> hand<00:01:07.159> around<00:01:07.340> I<00:01:07.790> wouldn't<00:01:08.570> break<00:01:08.720> any

gonna hurt an animal like now here's an
even<00:01:22.250> larger<00:01:22.610> trap<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:23.630> one<00:01:23.899> is<00:01:24.080> designed

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
even larger trap this one is designed

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.399 
even larger trap this one is designed
for<00:01:24.800> catching<00:01:25.479> larger<00:01:26.479> sized<00:01:26.720> animals<00:01:27.229> like

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
for catching larger sized animals like

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.700 
for catching larger sized animals like
coyotes<00:01:28.040> big<00:01:28.430> Bobcats<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:30.200> could<00:01:30.350> even<00:01:30.500> catch

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
coyotes big Bobcats you could even catch

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.389 
coyotes big Bobcats you could even catch
an<00:01:30.890> otter<00:01:31.160> in<00:01:31.399> this<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:32.979> as<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.220> can<00:01:34.340> see

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
an otter in this and as you can see

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.419 
an otter in this and as you can see
unlike<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.179> little<00:01:35.600> fox<00:01:36.380> trap<00:01:36.740> this<00:01:37.009> one<00:01:37.190> has

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
unlike the little fox trap this one has

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.660 
unlike the little fox trap this one has
four<00:01:37.970> coils<00:01:38.330> instead<00:01:38.929> of<00:01:39.020> two<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:40.280> makes<00:01:40.520> the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
four coils instead of two that makes the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.930 
four coils instead of two that makes the
jaws<00:01:40.880> close<00:01:41.210> faster<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:41.990> stronger<00:01:42.520> but<00:01:43.520> it

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
jaws close faster and stronger but it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.300 
jaws close faster and stronger but it
works<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.509> same<00:01:44.600> way<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.619> also<00:01:45.830> has<00:01:45.979> the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
works the same way it also has the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.999 
works the same way it also has the
swivels<00:01:46.729> on<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.000> chain<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.479> help<00:01:47.890> protect<00:01:48.890> the

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
swivels on the chain to help protect the

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.910 
swivels on the chain to help protect the
animals<00:01:49.399> limbs<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.440> just<00:01:51.440> like<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.740> other

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
animals limbs and just like the other

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.630 
animals limbs and just like the other
one<00:01:55.149> my<00:01:56.149> fingers<00:01:56.539> are<00:01:56.690> fine<00:01:57.100> mouse<00:01:58.100> no<00:01:58.429> harm

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
one my fingers are fine mouse no harm

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.940 
one my fingers are fine mouse no harm
comes<00:01:58.940> of<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.270> it's<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.110> little<00:02:00.350> tighter<00:02:00.619> grip

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
comes of it it's a little tighter grip

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.889 
comes of it it's a little tighter grip
but<00:02:01.690> it's<00:02:02.690> in<00:02:02.869> durable<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:04.750> doesn't<00:02:05.750> hurt<00:02:05.840> that

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
but it's in durable it doesn't hurt that

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.999 
but it's in durable it doesn't hurt that
much<00:02:06.289> it's<00:02:07.039> just<00:02:07.840> it's<00:02:08.840> tight<00:02:09.229> but<00:02:09.560> I<00:02:09.590> wouldn't

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
much it's just it's tight but I wouldn't

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.729 
much it's just it's tight but I wouldn't
I<00:02:10.280> wouldn't<00:02:10.700> consider<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.300> like<00:02:11.739> unbearable

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
I wouldn't consider it like unbearable

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.860 
I wouldn't consider it like unbearable
pain<00:02:13.010> like<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.849> could<00:02:14.090> deal<00:02:14.270> with<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.599> if<00:02:14.780> I

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
pain like I could deal with this if I

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.250 
pain like I could deal with this if I
was<00:02:15.020> caught<00:02:15.230> in<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.530> for<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.739> while<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:19.150> that's

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
was caught in it for a while so that's

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.830 
was caught in it for a while so that's
how<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.410> works<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:22.819> holds<00:02:23.270> on<00:02:23.390> tight<00:02:23.629> till

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
how it works it just holds on tight till

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.080 
how it works it just holds on tight till
you<00:02:23.959> can<00:02:24.110> come<00:02:24.290> get<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.590> animal<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.430> can
