00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
so taking a closer look at the modules

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.550 
so taking a closer look at the modules
for<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:14.390> map<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.810> first<00:01:15.020> one<00:01:15.170> I<00:01:15.200> would<00:01:15.290> like

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
for this map the first one I would like

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.890 
for this map the first one I would like
to<00:01:15.710> recommend<00:01:16.100> its<00:01:16.580> armor<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.270> hands<00:01:17.720> but<00:01:17.810> of

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
to recommend its armor and hands but of

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.990 
to recommend its armor and hands but of
course<00:01:18.080> armor<00:01:18.440> has<00:01:18.619> been<00:01:18.860> good<00:01:19.130> just<00:01:19.760> because

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
course armor has been good just because

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.120 
course armor has been good just because
it<00:01:20.479> reduces<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:21.110> drain<00:01:21.380> speed<00:01:21.680> of<00:01:21.800> energy

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
it reduces the drain speed of energy

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.609 
it reduces the drain speed of energy
while<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:23.240> armor<00:01:23.660> modes<00:01:23.869> okay<00:01:24.320> you're<00:01:24.470> gonna

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
while in armor modes okay you're gonna

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.380 
while in armor modes okay you're gonna
be<00:01:24.740> in<00:01:24.830> our<00:01:24.950> remote<00:01:25.250> a<00:01:25.369> lot<00:01:25.580> in<00:01:25.760> this<00:01:25.850> map<00:01:26.090> since

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
be in our remote a lot in this map since

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.330 
be in our remote a lot in this map since
you<00:01:26.930> want<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.170> go<00:01:27.290> into<00:01:27.440> armor<00:01:27.770> mode<00:01:27.890> as<00:01:28.100> soon

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
you want to go into armor mode as soon

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.070 
you want to go into armor mode as soon
as<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.610> spot<00:01:28.880> an<00:01:29.030> enemy<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:29.660> will<00:01:29.840> spot

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
as you spot an enemy and you will spot

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.980 
as you spot an enemy and you will spot
enemies<00:01:30.530> it's<00:01:31.040> like<00:01:31.369> 24<00:01:31.940> 7<00:01:32.330> on<00:01:32.390> this<00:01:32.540> map<00:01:32.750> so

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
enemies it's like 24 7 on this map so

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.109 
enemies it's like 24 7 on this map so
this<00:01:33.170> will<00:01:33.320> be<00:01:33.470> a<00:01:33.619> really<00:01:34.220> good<00:01:34.369> module<00:01:34.820> for

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
this will be a really good module for

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.999 
this will be a really good module for
this<00:01:35.270> map<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.020> switching<00:01:36.350> focus<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.979> the

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
this map so switching focus to the

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.249 
this map so switching focus to the
second<00:01:37.640> module<00:01:38.030> for<00:01:38.330> this<00:01:38.509> map<00:01:38.750> we<00:01:39.050> have<00:01:39.229> a

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
second module for this map we have a

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.080 
second module for this map we have a
covert<00:01:39.800> op<00:01:40.100> there<00:01:40.460> of<00:01:40.520> course<00:01:40.640> if<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:40.940> don't

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
covert op there of course if you don't

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.420 
covert op there of course if you don't
know<00:01:41.210> covert<00:01:41.960> ops<00:01:42.110> reduces<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.040> sound<00:01:43.280> of

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
know covert ops reduces the sound of

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.640 
know covert ops reduces the sound of
your<00:01:43.460> own<00:01:43.580> footsteps<00:01:43.910> while<00:01:44.690> it<00:01:44.930> increases

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
your own footsteps while it increases

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.790 
your own footsteps while it increases
the<00:01:45.950> enemy<00:01:46.280> footsteps<00:01:46.490> as<00:01:46.910> well<00:01:47.450> as<00:01:47.800> provides

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
the enemy footsteps as well as provides

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.950 
the enemy footsteps as well as provides
protection<00:01:49.310> from<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.670> Ceph<00:01:49.910> airstrike<00:01:50.509> bonus

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
protection from the Ceph airstrike bonus

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.660 
protection from the Ceph airstrike bonus
so<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.110> can't<00:01:51.320> really<00:01:51.410> go<00:01:51.740> wrong<00:01:51.770> with<00:01:52.550> this

nice nice turn around killing them
another<00:03:31.940> great<00:03:32.150> line<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.570> sight<00:03:32.780> for<00:03:33.050> this

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
another great line of sight for this

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.500 
another great line of sight for this
spare<00:03:33.560> area<00:03:33.860> is<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.760> one<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.180> what<00:03:35.270> you<00:03:35.360> want

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
this will take some time to master so

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.570 
this will take some time to master so
don't<00:03:39.530> worry<00:03:39.650> if<00:03:39.830> you<00:03:39.980> don't<00:03:40.100> nail<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.400> the

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
first time it's tough you know the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.300 
first time it's tough you know the
ending<00:03:41.959> world<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:42.440> this<00:03:42.590> works<00:03:42.830> as<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.040> great

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
ending world so this works as a great

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.949 
ending world so this works as a great
lot<00:03:43.490> of<00:03:43.610> sites<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.150> couple<00:03:44.510> of<00:03:44.570> drop<00:03:44.750> falls

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
lot of sites to a couple of drop falls

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.080 
lot of sites to a couple of drop falls
around<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.320> map<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.650> also<00:03:46.190> as<00:03:46.400> sort<00:03:46.970> of<00:03:47.000> a

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
around the map that also as sort of a

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.170 
around the map that also as sort of a
great<00:03:47.360> overview<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:48.080> also<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.500> great<00:03:49.070> way<00:03:49.180> to

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
great overview and also a great way to

now<00:03:53.090> we're<00:03:53.240> going<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.420> switch<00:03:53.660> over<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.110> take

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
now we're going to switch over and take

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.230 
now we're going to switch over and take
a<00:03:54.500> look<00:03:54.620> some<00:03:54.920> drop<00:03:55.130> off<00:03:55.310> spots<00:03:55.610> for<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:55.940> drop

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
a look some drop off spots for the drop

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.930 
a look some drop off spots for the drop
off<00:03:56.390> that<00:03:56.630> lands<00:03:56.930> inside<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.830> bank<00:03:58.070> area<00:03:58.700> so

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
off that lands inside the bank area so

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.120 
off that lands inside the bank area so
here<00:03:59.120> we<00:03:59.209> go<00:03:59.240> here<00:03:59.900> is<00:03:59.990> to<00:04:00.080> drop<00:04:00.260> on<00:04:00.500> this<00:04:00.980> is

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
here we go here is to drop on this is

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.199 
here we go here is to drop on this is
something<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.430> can<00:04:01.580> do<00:04:01.670> while<00:04:01.850> goofing

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
something you can do while goofing

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.970 
something you can do while goofing
around<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.690> having<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:03.020> good<00:04:03.230> time<00:04:03.440> this<00:04:03.680> won't

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
around and having a good time this won't

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.860 
around and having a good time this won't
you<00:04:04.400> know<00:04:04.520> work<00:04:04.730> one<00:04:05.030> hundred<00:04:05.300> percent<00:04:05.330> versus

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
you know work one hundred percent versus

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.150 
you know work one hundred percent versus
good<00:04:06.019> place<00:04:06.290> because<00:04:06.530> they've<00:04:06.830> sort<00:04:07.070> of

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
good place because they've sort of

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.009 
good place because they've sort of
built-in<00:04:07.610> I<00:04:07.910> for<00:04:08.209> this<00:04:08.330> they<00:04:08.480> can<00:04:08.660> spot<00:04:08.840> you

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
built-in I for this they can spot you

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.840 
built-in I for this they can spot you
right<00:04:09.230> away<00:04:09.380> but<00:04:10.190> yeah<00:04:10.400> if<00:04:10.459> we're<00:04:10.670> goofing

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
right away but yeah if we're goofing

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.130 
right away but yeah if we're goofing
around<00:04:11.150> having<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.450> good<00:04:11.480> time<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.900> connect

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
around having a good time you connect

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.440 
around having a good time you connect
you<00:04:12.230> jump<00:04:12.440> up<00:04:12.620> onto<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.640> drop<00:04:13.880> pod<00:04:14.060> and

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
you jump up onto the drop pod and

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.090 
you jump up onto the drop pod and
there's<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.810> tree<00:04:15.110> there<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.560> if<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:15.800> stealth

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
there's a tree there and if you stealth

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.560 
there's a tree there and if you stealth
in<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:16.549> you<00:04:16.640> can<00:04:16.790> use<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:16.970> confuse<00:04:17.479> your

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
in that you can use to confuse your

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.750 
in that you can use to confuse your
enemies<00:04:17.870> like<00:04:18.049> okay<00:04:18.709> I<00:04:18.739> can't<00:04:19.190> cap<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.549> drop

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
enemies like okay I can't cap the drop

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.550 
enemies like okay I can't cap the drop
off<00:04:19.910> we're<00:04:20.239> easier<00:04:20.660> there's<00:04:20.840> an<00:04:20.959> enemy<00:04:21.229> on<00:04:21.380> it

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
off we're easier there's an enemy on it

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.380 
off we're easier there's an enemy on it
I<00:04:21.680> can't<00:04:21.890> cap<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.310> where<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.580> see<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:23.180> you're

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
I can't cap it where you see and you're

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.790 
I can't cap it where you see and you're
on<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.630> drop<00:04:23.840> pod<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:24.350> can<00:04:24.470> kill<00:04:24.680> him

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
on the drop pod and you can kill him

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.560 
on the drop pod and you can kill him
easily<00:04:25.010> this<00:04:25.340> is<00:04:25.460> something<00:04:25.580> as<00:04:25.970> I<00:04:26.030> said<00:04:26.450> you

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
easily this is something as I said you

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.000 
easily this is something as I said you
can<00:04:26.630> do<00:04:26.810> while<00:04:26.990> goofing<00:04:27.350> around<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:27.740> having<00:04:27.890> a

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
can do while goofing around and having a

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.070 
can do while goofing around and having a
good<00:04:28.130> time<00:04:28.210> but<00:04:29.210> if<00:04:29.330> you<00:04:29.450> want<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.630> defend<00:04:29.930> it

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
good time but if you want to defend it

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.600 
good time but if you want to defend it
really<00:04:30.470> well<00:04:30.680> there's<00:04:30.979> not<00:04:31.130> really<00:04:31.190> a

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
really well there's not really a

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.150 
really well there's not really a
position<00:04:32.090> inside<00:04:32.600> range<00:04:33.080> inside<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.740> cap<00:04:33.950> and

friend or a couple of friends cabinets
you<00:04:38.330> can<00:04:38.479> actually<00:04:38.630> jump<00:04:38.960> off<00:04:39.140> on<00:04:39.320> these

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
you can actually jump off on these

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.170 
you can actually jump off on these
lockers<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.220> actually<00:04:40.640> have<00:04:40.790> a<00:04:40.820> pretty

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
pretty good defensive position if you

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.920 
pretty good defensive position if you
stealth<00:04:43.460> in<00:04:43.700> you<00:04:43.850> will<00:04:44.030> be<00:04:44.060> pretty<00:04:44.450> pretty

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
stealth in you will be pretty pretty

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.990 
stealth in you will be pretty pretty
undetectable<00:04:45.710> if<00:04:46.010> they're<00:04:46.430> not<00:04:46.520> using<00:04:46.790> the
