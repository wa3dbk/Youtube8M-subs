00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.589
 and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.970
 Y 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.220
 today we will learn to make the necklace that 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.279
 we already saw at the beginning that it is this 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.119
 I bring here since it's a necklace 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:31.660
 dolls the idea is to simulate some 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.510
 little hands that are some Russian dolls at 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.760
 which are called matrioskas this necklace 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.180
 belongs to the eco chic collection because 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.090
 if you can see 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.040
 the ring dolls are made 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.940
 of cans of cans 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.160
 tuna or cough chilli beans 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.110
 of all those cans the truth that remains 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.710
 very cute you can do it like this 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.930
 with many like me or they can do it 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.780
 only with a leaf that is the necklace and 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.879
 choose nothing else or you can even use them 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.460
 bracelet also uses the is looking for the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.990
 I said for bracelets and also I'm going to 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.060
 make some with magnets for me 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.770
 refrigerator so if you want to know 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.790
 how do you do not miss the next 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.790
 video bye 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.070
 Well the first thing we will do is cut 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.610
 is the minist here have some 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 rings with the help of a pair of tweezers 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.869
 this way the next thing will be to paint the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.390
 Two color ring dividing the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.010
 the smallest and largest hole or 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.740
 the smallest will be the face 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.130
 of one color and the largest will be like 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.160
 dress or clothes and goes another color 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.880
 You can paint it with acrylic paints or 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.600
 with nail polish paint if it 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.050
 have painted with acrylics will have to 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.810
 put a clear varnish or 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.090
 porcelain zador and in case if not 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.100
 have none of these two can 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.620
 put several layers of glue 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.780
 liquid white to make it a 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.390
 protection for painting and we do not know 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.740
 go to fall if they used nail polish 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.490
 this is not necessary now we will place 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.740
 behind felt pink on it in the 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.030
 smaller hole which is going to be the 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.030
 face then felt pink or skin color 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.750
 then we cut the excess and now 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.300
 we stick the patch of patterned fabric in 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.500
 the largest hole for it to be the 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.020
 dress 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.670
 we're going to stick it with liquid silicone or 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.350
 hot silicone 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.780
 I in this case use glue in bar 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.390
 but it was because at that time 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.550
 I had silicone but you 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.070
 Use silicone is very important for 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.090
 that sticks well as we finish 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.090
 there must be something like that 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.790
 here is the time when I place the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.890
 porsche pitcher or varnish but you 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.890
 they can do it before placing the fabric 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.200
 as it is dry varnish or 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.110
 be a pitcher porsche we're going to 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.110
 place them to stick a silicon in a 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.610
 piece of black felt and we cut it 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.890
 leaving a black outline that protrudes 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.320
 of the ring and especially in the part of 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.470
 above that is where we are going to place the 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.190
 hoop to hang it and now with a 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.769
 black permanent marker delgadito or 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.530
 with markers we are going to paint the eyes 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.810
 and the mouth with the help of something 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.010
 pointy we will do at the end of 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.100
 above 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.989
 a hole to be able to insert easier 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.989
 what is going to be our ring 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.400
 and ready've finished one of your 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.200
 dolls and we will do the same with all 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.870
 only that we will paint them differently 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.720
 way and try to use different 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.060
 colors decorations and fabrics remember 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.100
 that first we painted in two colors the 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.950
 ring and decorate it if you use 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.110
 Acrylic paint must be protected with 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.080
 clear varnish porcel a nice door o 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.960
 white glue we glue felt pink 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.930
 behind in what will be the face and the 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.930
 piece of cloth on the bottom 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.520
 then we stick the doll on a 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.220
 piece of black felt cut by 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.560
 the outline leaving a surplus and 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.950
 we put a ring on the end 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.440
 superior and ready you will make the dolls 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.960
 that you want can be - they can be 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.450
 more and when you have finished you should 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.940
 something like this now I will use a 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:17.330
 chain of links 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:20.750
 which measures approximately 70 centimeters 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.950
 we fold it in half and accommodate 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.390
 the dolls to the height that we want 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.250
 now that we have skewered the 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.620
 rings of the dolls in the 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.540
 links of the chain we are going to place 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.540
 two rings at the ends of the chain 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.570
 and a whale brooch and so we will have 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.820
 finished our necklace I hope this 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.680
 tutorial liked it and I do not know 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:48.260
 forget to subscribe to the channel for more 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:51.290
 videos like this bye and good finally 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.870
 we finished our necklace but at 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.960
 finish I 've realized that you 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.970
 you place and some turn around like this and 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.310
 more than I always accommodate them they leave 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.400
 to be turning around then I have decided 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.740
 again make other pretty rings 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.250
 with his piece of cloth and his face and 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.720
 stick them here backwards so that if 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.370
 they turn around so if they keep seeing the 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:19.669
 dolls and then do not miss 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.669
 to excel well now I 'm leaving
