 [Music] 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.330
 in the first option we start by separating 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.590
 the back and we make a pigtail 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.670
 we tied the hair with a rubber band 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.160
 little 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 and with the comb we give volume 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.910
 we take the lock from one side and we go to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.680
 make a cord braid always 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.070
 we roll it towards the face and what 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.660
 we roll up and cross it over and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.660
 we do the same in each crossing 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.270
 we roll all the hair 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.170
 and we hold it with a small rubber band and 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.200
 we do exactly the same in the other 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.130
 side we add hair we roll it up and what 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.409

 we just rolled up the whole lock and what 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.030

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.830
 [Music] 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.280
 we roll it up making a bun we enter 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.880
 all the tips and we hold them with 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.880
 Forks 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.740
 we put the hair on one side what 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.340
 we bend and enter the tips so that 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.340
 do not look 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.560
 and we hold it with forks 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.520
 we place the other side rolling the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.540
 the bun 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.110

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.840
 shape the hair with the plates and 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.820
 let's make a three root braid 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.130
 ends when we cross inside 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.819
 we add hair and out we do it 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.219
 normal 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.080
 we tie it with a small rubber band and 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:18.269
 we do the same on the other side 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.269

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.000
 we have the two braids tied 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.040
 back with a small rubber and now 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.470

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.280
 [Music] 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.709
