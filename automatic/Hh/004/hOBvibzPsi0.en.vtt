00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.690
 i 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.480
 Hi, I'm going to talk about a little bit 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.550
 complicated at what temperature should we 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.009
 serving the wines is very complicated 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.060
 because everyone has their taste and liking 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.369
 he does not like wine of any 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.770
 different temperature there are people who 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.869
 I like very cold white wines 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.830
 there are people who like red wines 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.770
 very hot 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.770
 but I will try to explain the reason for 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.770
 every temperature 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.650
 when we lower the temperature we notice 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.820
 less alcohol 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.989
 but at the same time we give less aromas 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.270
 but at the same time all the bitterness goes up 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.650
 of wines that may have a little 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.260
 of wood 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.750
 that's why red wines are taken at a 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.520
 Higher temperature and white wines 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.180
 can be taken at a higher temperature 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.869
 low so if we start with a cava 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.720
 with a sparkling one in this case an extra 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.050
 brut we will serve it between 6 and 8 degrees 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.729
 was a cava with more aging between 9 and 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.590
 11 degrees a fresh young white wine 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.310
 between 6 and 8 degrees too 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.530
 but a white wine that has a barrel 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.780
 it will be served between 10 and 12 degrees 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.290
 with the pink ones also happens a little bit 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.280
 the same cooler pink softer 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.990
 we could serve it between 6 and 8 degrees 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.310
 a pink with a little more body 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.950
 between 8 and 10 degrees 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.280
 between 10 and 12 degrees we will serve the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.640
 light young red wines without much 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.640
 body 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.220
 the aging wines would not be seen 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:04.409
 between 14 and 16 degrees and the reserves and 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.780
 the great reserves between 16 and 18 degrees 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.970
 there are also special wines like 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.019
 could be the fines and the chamomiles 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.940
 which are wines with a lot of alcohol with a 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.760
 pretty high alcoholic degree that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.430
 we will serve them between 6 and 8 degrees later 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.530
 the odorous amontillados that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.430
 they would serve at a temperature between 14 and 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.450
 16 degrees and then the sweet wines or 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.350
 vintage be days 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.770
 we will serve them between 12 and 15 degrees 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.030
 that yes each one that they take it as more 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.030
 you like that you enjoy 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.930
 one
