00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.150 
the company 10 years ago after a raw
food<00:02:38.209> diet<00:02:38.350> seemed<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.470> improve<00:02:39.860> her<00:02:40.130> own

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160

dog's<00:02:40.730> health<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:42.019> I<00:02:42.290> really<00:02:42.890> began<00:02:43.220> trying<00:02:43.640> to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
dog's health so I really began trying to

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.039 
dog's health so I really began trying to

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
think of a way that I could still

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.509 
think of a way that I could still
continue<00:02:45.410> feeding<00:02:45.680> him<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.980> whole<00:02:46.190> food<00:02:46.489> diet

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
continue feeding him a whole food diet

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.820 
continue feeding him a whole food diet

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
but make it in a format that was just

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.550 
but make it in a format that was just
more<00:02:48.950> simple<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.519> prepare<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.840> she<00:02:50.900> started

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
more simple to prepare so she started
