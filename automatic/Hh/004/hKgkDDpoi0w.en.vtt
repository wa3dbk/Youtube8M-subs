 well I'm doing him a crowbar 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:11.509
 I put a cup of sugar to heat 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.240
 and since he was undoing the 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.980
 sugar I put half a bar of 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.620
 Butter 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.960
 and I put a splash of honey 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.670
 when the milk sugar was dissolved 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.340
 trickle of honey and half of honey 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.020
 the butter very carefully because 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.300
 this if we jump because it burns us 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.210
 Much is all remember what you 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.630

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.640
 slow then since it broke half 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.130

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.680

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.870

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.630
 add the peanuts the swallowed this 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.350
 It is also already buy us the sachet and 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:55.580
 I have this this so we're going to empty it 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.580
 way that impregnates all 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.600
 this one of the honey and then we're going to put it 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.000
 Monday on the Aryan fact that is already 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.710
 is with a little butter so that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.850
 do not know, do not hit us at the moment of 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.710
 remove it 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.100
 and see if it reaches me for all the kk 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.100
 gloves 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.740
 once you're careful because the 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.759
 pot is hot and no longer has 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.759
 wooden handles 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.479
 Well, I'm just going to stir 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.869
 and then I'm going to empty them to stress 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.869
 refractory that I have there 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.570
 and see and so it was ready we can 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.480
 we can put to with holly also already 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.560
 he buys it for 1 hour and then I know 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.560
 they empty it here all scrambled 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.630
 I will empty the hand 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.170

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.170

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.780
 with the spoon because this is hot 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.780
 we settled 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.210
 in the A 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.350
 and peanut with the knife 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.350

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.400

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.850
 here we stop it 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.850
 and we wait for it to cool 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.180
 and then we cut it with a knife 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.670
