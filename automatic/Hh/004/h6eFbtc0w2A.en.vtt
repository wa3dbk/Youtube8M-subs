practice directing your air to the wrist
area<00:02:30.829> about<00:02:31.489> here

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.390 

great<00:02:38.750> now<00:02:39.750> intensity<00:02:40.409> is<00:02:40.620> much<00:02:40.920> harder<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
great now intensity is much harder to

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.300 
great now intensity is much harder to
gauge<00:02:41.700> because<00:02:42.090> every<00:02:42.989> individual<00:02:43.709> has<00:02:44.280> a

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
gauge because every individual has a

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.309 
gauge because every individual has a
different<00:02:44.700> range<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.599> intensity

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
different range of intensity

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.610
