00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
kidding me we were created at precisely

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.200 
kidding me we were created at precisely
the<00:04:12.810> same<00:04:12.840> time<00:04:13.050> on<00:04:13.500> Cybertron<00:04:14.190> by<00:04:14.670> an<00:04:14.820> Autobot

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
the same time on Cybertron by an Autobot

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.630

elder<00:04:15.510> named<00:04:15.720> alpha<00:04:16.140> Trion<00:04:16.590> we<00:04:17.130> were<00:04:17.310> raised

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
elder named alpha Trion we were raised

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.000 
elder named alpha Trion we were raised
together<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.570> guess<00:04:19.230> we're<00:04:19.440> not<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:19.590> alike

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
together I guess we're not so alike

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.920 
together I guess we're not so alike
anymore<00:04:20.420> are<00:04:21.420> we

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
anymore are we

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.310 
anymore are we
but<00:04:22.830> then<00:04:23.040> if<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:24.030> two<00:04:24.270> were<00:04:24.420> so<00:04:24.630> close<00:04:24.660> well

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
but then if you two were so close well

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.830 
but then if you two were so close well
then<00:04:25.860> why<00:04:26.550> on<00:04:26.730> earth<00:04:26.820> did<00:04:27.060> he<00:04:27.090> even<00:04:27.390> attack<00:04:27.660> you

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
then why on earth did he even attack you

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.110 
then why on earth did he even attack you
like<00:04:27.870> that<00:04:28.340> really<00:04:29.340> I<00:04:29.370> mean<00:04:29.730> what<00:04:29.940> did<00:04:30.090> you

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
like that really I mean what did you

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.970 
like that really I mean what did you
ever<00:04:30.420> do<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.810> deserve<00:04:31.290> an<00:04:31.440> attack<00:04:31.740> like<00:04:31.950> that

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
ever do to deserve an attack like that

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.630 
ever do to deserve an attack like that
in<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.370> first<00:04:32.610> place<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:34.530> Allspark<00:04:34.860> vector
