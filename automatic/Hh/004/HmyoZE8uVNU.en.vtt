00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.029
 grape 12th day 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.130
 everything is going well I feel 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.189
 wonderfully well even in full 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.810
 form 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.090
 no disgust of grapes just a little 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.030
 not very proud but that I explained it to you 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.520
 yves mans it's just due as soon as I 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.430
 read about food where 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.840
 I pass there are thoughts that is 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.180
 finally appear it's something 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.129
 that I have noticed many times 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.780
 now I am careful to read 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.839
 rather things that have nothing to do 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.800
 with the food rather even 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:56.800
 spiritual to calm the mind etc 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.540
 and that's good but it will I eat 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.909
 about the same amounts a little bit 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.030
 least my weight has stabilized at 71 1 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:08.890
 kg 5 the last five days since 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.060
 Monday and I usually wake up towards 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.900
 5-6 hours 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.759
 I get up at 6am or even before and then I 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.350
 go to the park next to my house i'm doing 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.439
 the exercises that suits guys 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.850
 breathing exercises and watch the 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.979
 sun also sam healing and I feel 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.689
 extremely well something I 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.439
 will continue his navy and spontaneously 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.119
 last week where I wanted to 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.950
 stand up and then I tell you ok I'm going 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.729
 go do train exercises can 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.109
 take a little fresh air and I feel 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.729
 I felt so good 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.909
 that automatically now I'm going 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.039
 every morning he does well he does 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.200
 still night anyway and that he 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:56.439
 beautiful weather or cloudy no matter 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.109
 just fine tickets no problem 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.549
 so for the grape cure nothing 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.310
 specific to say I advise you 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.740
 just this book called the little 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.220
 guide to the grape cure 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.770
 I will put the info usb n down in 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.830
 ballast 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:18.050
 the video info you can 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.490
 surely find it on on amazon that's 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.290
 the book I used to do the 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.910
 cure all the information is in 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.220
 what you want to make do not eat 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.230
 to do and so that's it you just 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.770
 to read it and then you can do the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.830
 cure without problem small precision 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.600
 so good I have a week left 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:43.280
 I think most of the cure is 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.950
 past 1 it's easier every day 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.260
 will say bad year what is very important 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.570
 and especially for those who make them 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.250
 want to do a cure where a young person is 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.600
 really the recovery goes on there is no 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.600
 really dangerous 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.310
 to consequences in doing this kind of 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.140
 cure it's natural 1 unlike this 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.290
 what do some people want us to believe 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.730
 people or the agri-food industry 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.830
 who wants to obviously do a lot 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.330
 money if you eat less if you eat 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.190
 healthy it brings less money but good 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.430
 that's another topic then for those 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.910
 who want to make cures and cure 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.040
 of grapes 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.130
 what matters is really there 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.890
 recovery so so usually for a 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.360
 normal young you have to count so many 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.040
 days you have I have so if you 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.060
 annoy three days it will take three 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.239
 days for you re is used to eating 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.610
 and eat gradually by is 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.730
 attacked the raclette immediately after 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.830
 three weeks of reserve we will avoid 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.799
 so the only worries is really that 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.330
 if you pick up for the grape tail 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.080
 it's half because there's still 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.700
 a food you eat one so there for 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.910
 me three weeks and well he's going to me 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.489
 we have to say a week and a half 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.359
 ten days to rehabilitate my 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.790
 food 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.709
 so is adapted it means to start 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.530
 by fluids fruit salads 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:20.900
 vegetables and then so street and then 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.900
 kindly bring a feed 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:27.960
 more elaborate but I'm not sure 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.370
 as the most natural remains the 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.200
 fruits the natural fresh organic vegetables and 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.760
 it's something that's obvious 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.880
 maybe it's not for you yet 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.160
 but but 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.990
 animals one comes from nature to 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.980
 contrary again of what we 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.040
 would like to make us believe 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.300
 and well in nature just be 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.760
 outside pick up an apple amassed 1 1 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.390
 to eat that's what brings us to 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.310
 to be healthy and in good shape 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:02.540
 so that both faces would 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:07.140
 a video finally cure 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:11.100
 I'm happy but here it is 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.130
 common experience host in any case at 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.220
 energy level is much better 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.660
 much better than before there is 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.180
 really nothing to say until now 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.290
 I feel the benefits I hope it 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.350
 will continue at the end of the mans cure 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.930
 I will start eating and now I you 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.860
 wish a good day good 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.290
 continuation and then for those who 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.740
 want to do the parish ben good luck 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.190
 and remember organic raisin is good 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.850
 quality 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.850
 thank you goodbye
