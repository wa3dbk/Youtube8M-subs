you start judging size you have to ask

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.260 
you start judging size you have to ask
yourself<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.699> want<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> leg

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

extensions or the leg curls because

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.670 
extensions or the leg curls because
there<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> difference<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:01.020> all<00:01:01.170> depends<00:01:01.620> on

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
there is a difference it all depends on

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
there is a difference it all depends on
which<00:01:01.920> way<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.370> pendulum<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.390> swing

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
which way the pendulum is going to swing

your<00:01:03.780> rotate<00:01:04.170> during<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.100> exercise<00:01:05.420> by

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
your rotate during your exercise by

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.830 
your rotate during your exercise by
having<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> weight<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.380> front<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.630> pin

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
having the weight in front of the pin

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.190 
having the weight in front of the pin
here<00:01:10.970> that<00:01:11.970> means<00:01:12.210> I'm<00:01:12.420> gonna<00:01:12.540> extend<00:01:12.900> my<00:01:12.990> legs

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
here that means I'm gonna extend my legs

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.100 
here that means I'm gonna extend my legs
outward<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.070> raise<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.640> weights<00:01:14.850> forward<00:01:15.390> so

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
outward and raise the weights forward so

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.469 
outward and raise the weights forward so
in<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.290> example<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.490> had<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
in this example if I had just the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
in this example if I had just the
sundial<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.439> let's<00:01:19.979> say<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:20.400> sitting<00:01:20.640> down

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
sundial and let's say I'm sitting down

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.149 
sundial and let's say I'm sitting down
here<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.450> extend<00:01:21.900> outward<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.650> way<00:01:22.890> I'm

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
here and I extend outward this way I'm

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.450 
here and I extend outward this way I'm
pushing<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.750> weights<00:01:24.930> go<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.250> want

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
pushing out the weights go up if I want

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.300 
pushing out the weights go up if I want
to<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> leg<00:01:26.880> curls<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.810> would<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:28.650> bring

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
to do the leg curls I would then bring

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.770 
to do the leg curls I would then bring
the<00:01:29.490> weights<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:31.200> side<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.770> pin<00:01:35.780> so

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the weights on this side of the pin so

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.499 
the weights on this side of the pin so
when<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.960> curl<00:01:37.079> my<00:01:37.470> legs<00:01:37.860> underneath<00:01:38.490> me<00:01:38.850> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
when I curl my legs underneath me it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.510 
when I curl my legs underneath me it
brings<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.990> weights<00:01:40.170> back<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.250> first

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
brings the weights back so the first

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.920 
brings the weights back so the first
thing<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.090> figure<00:01:42.270> out<00:01:42.420> which

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
thing you have to do is figure out which

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.469 
thing you have to do is figure out which
exercise<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.649> want<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.820> leg

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
exercise you want to do so leg
