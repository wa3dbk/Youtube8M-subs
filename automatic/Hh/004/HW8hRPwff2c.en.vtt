00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi to all and the room in this 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.700
 video i'm going to explain to you how 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.049
 you will be able to play with us finally 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.000
 how are you going to be able to make 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.110
 races with us so I say race 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 but there's no race you go 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.590
 can also do activities with 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.210
 us to do that to make 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.590
 activities with us to make 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.289
 races with us I simply 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.150
 create a crew specifically for that then 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.740
 this crew at the time I'm talking to you there 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.109
 is an invitation that is to say that you 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.000
 can join that if I accept your 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.800
 invitation but by the time you 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.140
 listen to this video so at the moment 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.820
 this video and publish the crew there is 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.550
 more at the invitation so you can the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.989
 freely join this crew quarter time 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.910
 if we do not join him is not if you 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.890
 do not intend to do what I tell you 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.600
 this crew is made for you 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.610

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 you do activities with us 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.620
 but only for that is to say that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.910
 if you join this crew but you 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.469
 do not go shopping with us 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.629
 or that you intend to go shopping 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.770
 with us I not in August or at 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.690
 september 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.300
 these dead we must not join him 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.469
 must leave room for those who want 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.820
 go shopping with us want 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.809
 do activities with us but soon 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.060
 now 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.740
 it's not a project anyway 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.510
 do like that to the snatch ie 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 that we do it there but if there is any 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.570
 request within a month we will redo the same 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.330
 something in a month 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.560
 so you join this crew only if you 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.180
 want to participate in activities with 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.500
 we anyway will know if you 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.520
 participate or not because all 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.619
 weeks where every two weeks 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.659
 we will sort all the nicks we 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.850
 will never have seen with us in the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.799
 shopping or in the activities is good 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.000
 exclude them simply has to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.710
 give way to new ones 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.950
 people and then we will warn in video 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.290
 so especially if you want to integrate a 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.619
 word crew but you know that you 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.479
 do not necessarily play with us 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.909
 integrate one of the other crew did not integrate 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.549
 not this one the other nuts they are 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.170
 full from the beginning of the holidays so the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.270
 very soon we will not wait for the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.250
 end of the holidays we will do a sort in 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.659
 the others so that you can 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.159
 join if for example you want the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.409
 color of crewe if for example you 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.590
 want the emblem of croo all the crew 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.899
 held by aurelian and jason wynn will suffer 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.159
 a sort and you can join them at 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.229
 at any given moment anyway it's 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.149
 the same I will warn again on video 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.590
 so for the raw that I put you 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.340
 in the description of this video 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.980
 besides, I 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.420
 me that this crew there in the description of 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.819
 the video for not being mistaken 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.440
 with another join them only if you 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.720
 expect to play as I told you a 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.610
 sorting will be done then there are some 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.050
 small problems that can arise and 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.970
 we will solve them now 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.470
 for example there are some people 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.610
 who will say I've never been able to join 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.049
 one of your activities 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.420
 because every time I want 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.090
 join there is more room then 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.830
 it's true that it can happen but hey 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.519
 that would be very rare given that 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.709
 do not give the schedules of our activities 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:49.410
 for example one can very well make a 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.069
 activity at 14:52 another at 19:34 etc 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.870
 etc. 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.880
 in any case we do not have schedules 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.739
 fixed against it is sure that if we 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.840
 gave a fixed schedule for example if 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.360
 I told you we are doing an activity in 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.340
 18:01 to 19:01 to 20 hours there necessarily 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.750
 there will always be the same ones that will be 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.549
 always the fastest and who 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.410
 will always participate in our activities 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.269
 gold is not the case we it works 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.660
 not like that we give no schedule have 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.459
 do our activities anytime like 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.150
 that everyone has a chance to 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.780
 participate 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.200
 we will necessarily invite 999 people to 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.260
 every time 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.880
 so you imagine 1999 people for 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.430
 ten or twenty places 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.349
 it's not a lot so you can not 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.299
 participate in all activities at 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.190
 unless you are really at the cleat 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.269
 and it's still not going to be all 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.889
 activities but it's true that you 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.459
 may participate in a lot 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.019
 activity 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.639
 so everyone will have a chance to 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.109
 participate but as I told you 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.459
 every two weeks 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.829
 weeks all the nicks we do not have 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.329
 seen we will have to exclude them to leave the 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.299
 place to new people who 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.680
 want to do the activities and then to 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.299
 anyway it's not so bad in itself 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.069
 since there are others 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.349
 crew in which we will do a sort 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.079
 so if I make you this video and if 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.760
 I made a special crew for you 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.919
 can do the activities with us 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.840
 it's because the question comes back 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.000
 often in the comments in any 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.799
 case I see it everywhere bah all 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.269
 just people who say I can 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.310
 not to participate with you it's difficult 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.750
 to participate with you how to do 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.760
 to participate in your shopping because 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.079
 of course there are people they 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.349
 look at our races but he would like 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.160
 to be in and I understand them 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.750
 sometimes hunger 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.280
 it's gta we want to play we want 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.280
 to have fun so we want to participate 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.260
 so I voluntarily removed myself from 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.330
 my other crew to create this one for 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.860
 put crewe manager over the same 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.200
 if I do not have my emblem good I gave 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.240
 the same crewe color but I have not 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.650
 my emblem I'm just doing them for 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.630
 to be able to play with new 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.550
 people and also for that new 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.080
 people can play with us because 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.180
 that it 's not going that in a sense there is 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.320
 not that we who want to have others 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.180
 people with us there are others 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.460
 people who also want to play with 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.110
 we then I said a lot of times the 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.110
 Crew word I hope you understand 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.480
 the principle of this crew that I created 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.070
 if you have other questions by 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.510
 report to the crew I created 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.080
 not to ask them a comment on it 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.860
 answer 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.840
 on the other hand there is 999 place so done 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.340
 fast to join does not tell you by 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.440
 example pretty good game I have time I 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.030
 will join tomorrow or after tomorrow we 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.670
 never know it can go very fast 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.560
 there may soon be more room and 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.630
 as I told you the time to redo 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.070
 a sort to see people who do not have 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.320
 played with us it can take a 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.730
 week or two so if you want 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.770
 really do the shopping with us the 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.060
 activities with us go ahead all of 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.920
 following that is to say go in the 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.530
 description of the video click on the 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.540
 crew link join the crew soon 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.020
 now and we will invite you there is 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.250
 no schedule there are no specific rules 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.050
 then there is just a small point on 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.669
 which I am going to dwell on is 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.240
 important for easter and surprises 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:48.150
 so if I make an example if we do 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.669
 a race gta and who has a guy who is 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.720
 who is there standing in the race who 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.700
 waiting for everyone to pass and who 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.400
 smash everything at the rocket launcher and that 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.550
 do not care royally of the ranking this 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.919
 dude there he will be excluded from the crew and he will 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.140
 permanently excluded from the activities so 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.390
 the goal of activity is to have fun 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.190
 it's not to piss off the others 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.330
 because necessarily the people they are there 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.870
 for fun are there to make a 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.419
 race 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.190
 and if to the anti game ben that's it 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.410
 will not necessarily please then do not 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.850
 to confuse with if you 're in the 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.290
 race throw you grenades of 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.970
 sticky bombs and it's in a 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.820
 gta race it's perfectly normal 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.530
 to play the race is normal but to do 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.600
 anti gambling ie not playing 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.240
 the race does not care about the 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.080
 race and be fucked everyone 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.720
 in fact 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.550
 in others the no there is excluded 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.530
 directly and then we invite more what 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.509
 so that's just the little point 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.819
 on which I wanted to insist being 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:43.500
 given that it has happened 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.090
 exclude the person and then the person 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.039
 it sends us messages for us 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.439
 ask but why did you exclude me 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.750
 here we will not explain each time 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:53.310
 to the person ben that's what you do 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.139
 it's anti play where what you do 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.699
 it's not at all correct for 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.189
 other people who are here to do 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.780
 the race and who are there to have fun 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:02.819
 we do not have time every time 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.580
 give that speech back then so it's for 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:07.020
 what I say in the video if ever 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.969
 here we run and you 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.560
 see someone do it completely 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:12.569
 the anti game do not race do not 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.009
 to do the activity also it is possible 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:16.020
 in an activity 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.610
 I spend if we start an activity and 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.479
 we say good activity begins soon 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.580
 that everyone is in his vehicle 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:22.319
 and that there is someone who is there it is 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.699
 already happened too that goes up in his 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.930
 vehicle and that are already starting at all 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.039
 smashed while the game did not 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.199
 start 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:30.509
 it's the same person lenval exclude 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:32.939
 and we will invite more so that everything 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:35.069
 the world can have fun that everything 

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:37.379
 pass correctly and that is so that the 

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:38.849
 activities are not wasted and we 

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:40.349
 does not want to send a 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:41.310
 message every time the person who 

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:44.370
 ask us why you asked me 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.750
 excluded from him again we are not excluded because 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.009
 that you screwed up the activity where 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.750
 you screwed up the race 

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:51.029
 so here it was important it was necessary 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.529
 specify the crew in the description 

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:53.699
 of the video only if you want 

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:55.589
 participate in our activities 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.909
 that's all for this video and I 

00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:58.909
 tell you just now ciao
