00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.700 
this adds a little bit you know it adds
something<00:01:48.659> special<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> glitter<00:01:49.439> so

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
something special with the glitter so

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.319 
something special with the glitter so
it's<00:01:49.829> not<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.340> boring<00:01:50.700> plain<00:01:50.909> old<00:01:51.090> sweater

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
it's not just a boring plain old sweater

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.630 
it's not just a boring plain old sweater
you<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> thought<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.310> was<00:01:53.369> really

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you know so I thought that was really

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.530 
you know so I thought that was really
really<00:01:54.000> pretty

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
really pretty

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.870 
really pretty
and<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.290> also<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:55.950> sweater<00:01:56.460> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and then I also got this sweater and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.179 
and then I also got this sweater and
again<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> kind<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.049> has<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> glitter<00:01:58.619> infused

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
again it kind of has the glitter infused

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.030 
again it kind of has the glitter infused
in<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.460> this<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> black<00:02:00.689> sweater<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.829> has

in it this is a black sweater and it has

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.819 
in it this is a black sweater and it has
like<00:02:02.570> yeah<00:02:03.570> that's<00:02:03.899> gold<00:02:04.140> -<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.469> thought<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> was

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
like yeah that's gold - I thought it was

gold<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.250> silver<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.640> can't<00:02:05.880> really<00:02:05.969> tell<00:02:06.299> and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
gold and silver I can't really tell and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.529 
gold and silver I can't really tell and
again<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.140> gold

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
again just gold

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.929 
again just gold
but<00:02:09.319> it's<00:02:09.500> kind<00:02:09.769> of<00:02:09.829> like<00:02:10.069> flowy<00:02:10.519> where<00:02:10.819> it

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
but it's kind of like flowy where it

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.819 
but it's kind of like flowy where it
kind<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.239> just<00:02:11.450> like<00:02:11.599> is<00:02:11.840> kind<00:02:12.079> of<00:02:12.230> slouchy<00:02:12.500> on

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
kind of just like is kind of slouchy on

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.429 
kind of just like is kind of slouchy on
you<00:02:13.069> um<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.790> does<00:02:13.969> have<00:02:14.180> short<00:02:14.480> sleeves<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.170> I

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
you um it does have short sleeves so I

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.289 
you um it does have short sleeves so I
don't<00:02:15.920> always<00:02:16.099> like<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.579> in<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.819> winter<00:02:17.150> but

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
don't always like that in the winter but

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.550 
don't always like that in the winter but
I<00:02:17.359> thought<00:02:17.569> this<00:02:17.719> would<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:17.900> good<00:02:18.140> for<00:02:18.409> like<00:02:18.439> a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.009 
I thought this would be good for like a
holiday<00:02:18.920> party<00:02:19.129> or<00:02:19.370> something<00:02:19.909> so<00:02:20.659> I<00:02:20.689> thought

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
holiday party or something so I thought

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.690 
holiday party or something so I thought
it<00:02:21.200> would<00:02:21.319> be<00:02:21.439> fine<00:02:21.739> but<00:02:22.099> that's<00:02:22.340> what<00:02:22.609> it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
it would be fine but that's what it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.429 
it would be fine but that's what it
looks<00:02:23.000> like<00:02:23.269> so<00:02:23.540> it's<00:02:23.659> kind<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:23.930> like<00:02:24.049> big<00:02:24.260> and

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
looks like so it's kind of like big and

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.490 
looks like so it's kind of like big and
flowy<00:02:24.769> like<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.459> said<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.689> again<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.109> can<00:02:27.290> see

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500

it's this um it's like a black little
cropped<00:03:59.389> jacket<00:03:59.989> but<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.620> has<00:04:00.829> like<00:04:01.040> these

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
cropped jacket but it has like these

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.580

gold<00:04:01.519> like<00:04:01.760> chain-link<00:04:02.449> details<00:04:02.989> around<00:04:03.229> the

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
gold like chain-link details around the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.499 
gold like chain-link details around the
edges<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:05.239> can<00:04:05.509> see<00:04:05.780> that<00:04:06.069> and<00:04:07.299> then<00:04:08.299> it

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:08.509 
edges so you can see that and then it

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.740 
edges so you can see that and then it
also<00:04:08.720> has<00:04:09.169> them<00:04:09.470> on<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.829> sleeves<00:04:10.569> so<00:04:11.569> that's

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
also has them on the sleeves so that's

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.870

so I thought this is just like really
pretty<00:04:16.860> and<00:04:17.100> dressy<00:04:17.520> and<00:04:17.640> again<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.000> could

pretty and dressy and again you could

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.670 
pretty and dressy and again you could
wear<00:04:18.330> this<00:04:18.480> for<00:04:18.720> like<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.930> holiday<00:04:19.290> party<00:04:19.650> or

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
wear this for like a holiday party or

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.760

something<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.520> it<00:04:20.940> also<00:04:21.090> has<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.870> like<00:04:22.140> on<00:04:22.500> the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
something and it also has it like on the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.910 
something and it also has it like on the
little<00:04:23.100> pockets<00:04:23.750> which<00:04:24.750> aren't<00:04:25.170> real<00:04:25.410> pockets

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
little pockets which aren't real pockets

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.130

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.960 
little like ruffles as you can see
and<00:06:26.040> I<00:06:26.160> just<00:06:26.310> thought<00:06:26.430> the<00:06:26.580> color<00:06:26.820> was

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
and I just thought the color was

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.660 
and I just thought the color was
absolutely<00:06:27.810> gorgeous<00:06:28.020> and<00:06:28.560> then<00:06:29.070> it<00:06:29.190> has<00:06:29.370> this

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
absolutely gorgeous and then it has this

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.520 
absolutely gorgeous and then it has this
zipper<00:06:30.090> detailing<00:06:30.660> going<00:06:31.110> all<00:06:31.230> the<00:06:31.320> way<00:06:31.350> down

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
zipper detailing going all the way down

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.140 
zipper detailing going all the way down
the<00:06:31.710> back<00:06:34.310> so<00:06:35.310> I<00:06:35.340> thought<00:06:35.730> this<00:06:35.850> would<00:06:36.000> be

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
the back so I thought this would be

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.330 
the back so I thought this would be
really<00:06:36.450> good<00:06:36.600> to<00:06:36.660> wear<00:06:36.930> for<00:06:37.200> Christmas<00:06:37.710> so
