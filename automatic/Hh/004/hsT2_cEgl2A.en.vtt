00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.250
 Yes 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:05.250
 Osaka Candy 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.160
 And Gundam's 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.160
 It's stage 2 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.740
 Fist 2 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.740
 Better to start 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.110
 It's Ne Well 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.520
 That this game 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.520
 There is a method called omar knack to make each other cheaper 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.920
 In Well I do not know what can be seen this 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.790
 I think it will change a lot 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.960
 If you are frustrated, it may be this problem 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.960
 First of all 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.950
 Soon after you start you're pushing success 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.300
 This is karoo 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.300
 It took quite some time to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 Oh my God it is with now red circle 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.740
 It means that the iron bridge six roots 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.180
 Cross mark in it 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.650
 This can be fixed to water injection 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.650
 By pressing this select button 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.570
 What is 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.360
 Opportunity entered 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.170
 yeah 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:48.570
 Because it is about mi type , I finally defeated at the 8th shot with Zack 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.570
 Come kill people physical education and will come out boss 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.890
 One suit that moved once 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.690
 It is quite early though- 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.540
 I can't run away 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.290
 It may be okay though 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.220
 Well I'm touching the back to earn some time 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.039
 8 Ne this 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.440
 Not capture 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:19.320
 I have a little tips 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.320
 Well, it always starts from the distance 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.930
 Kuruyo Yeah this character suit is always different from the head 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.349
 I'm going to try this 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.349
 If 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.490
 Things shot from a distance can be avoided with the left and right 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.490
 It can be avoided by shaking it from side to side . 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.650
 Problem Then and single-phase this guy 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.840
 Won't 2 when approaching 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.950
 It depends on this 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.940
 Only the stage of that child 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.940
 There is a time limit 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.780
 Even if it runs away 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.380
 It is good 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.380
 okay to how 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.920
 Well I want to beat 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:12.030
 Either one of them is fine, but I think that last one 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.440
 v will change 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.440
 It is a good guy to win 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.519
 I think Kato 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.470
 Whether open when coming towards 5 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.790
 More than anything by all means wallet 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.790
 Well as shoes 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.510
 1st unit 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.130
 While shifting towards the other side which is trying to escape 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.480
 Depression 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.680
 I think I'm easy to hit the source 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.310
 When I hit, I'll hit it a little bit further 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.310
 In a feeling of saying 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.989
 But the enemy it is less likely to be pretty I lock on Naa available 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.180
 The movement is fast 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.180
 Pretty much 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.120
 Trying to do well this Iun 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.340
 Either against the oncoming enemy from 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.950
 I have no choice but to run away 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:31.750
 Well this game has always been in such pattern after all 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.750
 Without thinking that there is also a runaway 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.620
 8-way is I think a good 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.380
 Let me show you 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.050
 Seynod N group 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.930
 me 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.930
 It is a stage 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:03.080
 Ma's way of stasis 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.080
 I can go left and right two 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.050
 So 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.340
 If you do it slowly and say 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.970
 Major major 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.970
 It was defeated
