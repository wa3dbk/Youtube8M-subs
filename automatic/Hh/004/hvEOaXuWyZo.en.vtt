00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.139
 where 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.110
 a little over a year of bad air and 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.030
 no doubt you fight the program 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.980
 favorite entertainment of the béticos 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.590
 it was for this reason that we went to talk 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.840
 with some of the older ones so that 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.119
 tell us what is the moment they have 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.950
 lived in combats that remember with 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.779
 a lot of love 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.509
 an anecdote is a beautiful experience 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.239
 good despite the year I have to be 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.160
 here in combat sharing with everyone 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.020
 the boys and girls have entered us 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.290
 that have come out this has been known 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.640
 any amount of friendship with well 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.379
 can not be can not share day to 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.559
 day here with same presenters 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.870
 also what are the ones with which very 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.679
 well but despite all the effort to each 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.420
 combat that we have given here I had the 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.710
 Cute travel experience better to go out 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.480
 of the country that was what there was never 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.859
 made this go to Ecuador that already 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.719
 they have for the country 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.179
 I have been given several things but 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.890
 between one of them there is a bunny that 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.300
 it's too much seeing that he does not estimate it 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.570
 school exists here the ball is 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.640
 too beautiful that little girl already 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.150
 you know 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.040
 and on Friday a gentleman although in reality 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.200
 I do not catholic but I like it too 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.440
 These bracelets are several 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.950
 virgins that I really loved 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.350
 too much and I think the truth is that a 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.450
 one reaches him very are people who 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.680
 worry about one curiously in the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.210
 market in the shot I always handled 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.810
 on television and I always have to 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.610
 young as for adults when I entered 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.619
 combat rather they should find with a 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.210
 spectrum that opened the entire range of 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.280
 ages because here they came rather 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.270
 towards is a very large audience of children 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.759
 and older adults also get in the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.649
 street or the supermarket a great local and 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.869
 that children arrive and hold on and that 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.600
 embrace the store and became fond of wine 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.090
 sometimes it is who says a down payment 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.229
 affection they feel for one and that they embrace 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.149
 a very special way I think you can 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.280
 louis I do not think it's me but I do not take it off 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.679
 which was that while a great detail 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.970
 for me he goes to ecuador came and I 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.310
 He confessed that he loves me a lot 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.740
 let's put a bunch of flowers a little bit 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.350
 it was going to be my blessing I took it 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.810
 for the player and really that's all 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.970
 hard with me and you take it to the same 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.650
 program but do not remove it by pulling ride 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.880
 I think it was quite in said for 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.870
 while I think they are soft they are not 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.870
 better that happened to me 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.410
 the first time of the call of the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.350
 true program producer in combat 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.090
 where that makes me think that everything 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.770
 It comes the time since I have seen 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.540
 often the perfect time and the 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.370
 second and definitely that trip 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.440
 Ecuador where an opportunity opens 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.120
 for the actuator I was not in the 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.709
 program plans but how am I doing? 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.440
 saying you are cousins ​​persevering if one 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.390
 believe that you can can be very big and 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.620
 the third one that evidently if only with 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.200
 this is having met people so 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.610
 special even as my girlfriend here was 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.350
 a moment where for me it was very 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.760
 important to be in the program not 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.380
 We were new start at that time 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.030
 we were friends but you who will be calculated 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.130
 which it was consolidated and has kept 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.850
 through time really many 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.160
 things is the fact that one comes out and and 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.600
 children be like 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.560
 these droplets like it has been the same 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.020
 way 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.180
 elderly gentlemen who really do 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.670
 feel like one and he says but is that 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.650
 why did this happen and I'm here I am 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.990
 they are not people who love the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.480
 program and they want to know why not 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.600
 passed to the preferred team that lost that 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.940
 He won what happened and the truth is 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.120
 a lot of things combat has done 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.300
 incredible changes in all of us in 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.280
 our daily lives the fact of 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.310
 know that here people come to line up 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.500
 from early to bring us good to see the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.200
 program that is bringing us one chocolatito 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.610
 of simple is my little detail is the 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.610
 which marks many differences
