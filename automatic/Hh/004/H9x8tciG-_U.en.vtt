00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.630
 and tonight I came to the apollo theater 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.130
 I came to see almost normal I was with a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.929
 part of the cast let's see the note 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.760
 well I'm here with the cast of almost 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.760
 normal or as I quite normal 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.369
 it is very well very correct 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.050
 tell me a little bit first for the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.170
 people who still did not see them like me 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.349
 account this almost normal story is a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.559
 musical that tells the story of a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.750
 pretty dysfunctional family that does 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.890
 years have a mom that in my wife 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.079
 target with psychiatric problems but 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.879
 she faces this disease not from 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.149
 a dramatic way but in a way 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.039
 quite optimistic and with a lot of humor and 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.620
 true sarcasm actually in general 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.910
 the show laughs a little too 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.370
 this family misfortune 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.290
 they put their hearts because it is a 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.880
 family that loves each other have two 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.800
 children a therapist and a daughter is 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.000
 he's also dating a boy who 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.000
 it is more so much the normal 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.909
 but tells the story of a family 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:17.090
 like any other that faces a 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.229
 Illness situation and good that 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.460
 they put the chest to the bullets and try to 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.159
 keep going there is a lot of humor and 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.950
 there are also moments of emotion not yes yes 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.289
 yes people get pretty excited if 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.680
 it is listened to I think that already at 10 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.590
 minutes of the work start now 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.870
 in the audience they are all running 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.150
 sorry it's because it's winter they're all 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.430
 restored 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.920
 because it will be hard for nothing they are going to 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.250
 load of laughter is almost like the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.480
 of the midachi no that's not true do not 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.310
 that is terrific is almost normal is 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.200
 that most people when it comes 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.880
 to see a musical comedy happens to them that 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.220
 does not meet with a musical comedy 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.200
 typical is not that they will find the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.780
 characters of this work making you the 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.310
 theater corridors are actors that 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.800
 They sing, I listen, I think it's 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.899
 the definition of musical theater 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.220
 of course there is a story to tell there 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.560
 all sung not and 80% is sung in 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.300
 alive was published they leave it to me that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.980
 to the role of the doctor who spends 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.300
 talking to Diana all day and there 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.300
 musicians on stage too 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.959
 we have musicians in stages we are six 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.660
 actors this is a work that we could 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:38.570
 say it's pretty bare 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:40.850
 pretty good but it's not like that with a 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.520
 Hair mounted saw that little by little is 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.280
 do the six actors and six musicians is 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.069
 a work really of actors 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.310

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.100
