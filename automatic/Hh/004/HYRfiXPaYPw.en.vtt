00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.430
 at 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.699
 hi everyone i hope you 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.410
 go well anyway I wish you 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.210
 to go as well as me on time 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.070
 of today since we had with yoda 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.840
 a huge just a sublime one 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.060
 wonderful news that fell to us 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.199
 it's really something but 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.669
 which simply impresses us 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.290
 because it's the first time that 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.210
 we happen then those who follow us 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.890
 on twitter who are fairly loyal to 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.239
 all the tweets that can be dropped and 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.190
 unfortunately they are very numerous 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.809
 you will probably already know 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.010
 this news for the others 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.519
 the big news that fell to us 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.680
 above 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.500
 it is simply that activision 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.149
 blizzard after this generous decision 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.789
 to invite us to visit the studios 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.199
 bungie directly to if only one so 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.090
 you can imagine how far we can 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.160
 to get mad in our heads nothing 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.180
 that having heard this announcement so 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.219
 we did not have the right to tell you 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.350
 so far that's it today we can 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.390
 finally informed our community that we 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.759
 let's go and so our big departure will have 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.560
 place next Thursday the 23rd of April and we 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.030
 will be back on the 26th 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.070
 if everything goes well if we do not decide 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.990
 to put our suitcases there and live 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.130
 a little longer to six athletes 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.200
 but in any case what is certain is 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.940
 we just stay a few days and we 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.039
 will have the opportunity of course to 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.319
 meet on the spot other youtuber 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.450
 I think mostly even essentially 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.220
 American English such as dp 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.330
 of the zino movie I know they will 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.310
 present for example 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.590
 after I do not know exactly if we 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.149
 will be staying in the same hotel as 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.489
 we are rather managed by the section 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.479
 French activision blizzard so 

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:39.860
 here I have no more info 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.989
 unfortunately for that I do not know 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.149
 precisely who will be invited to this 

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:46.819
 open door studios among the 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.470
 other youtube of esteem in any case what 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.750
 which is sure it will be there and we will 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.399
 to have on all this is really the thing 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.770
 who makes us I believe the most that makes 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.390
 the opportunity to meet obviously 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.800
 all teams of 20 guides have 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.450
 all those people we know 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.610
 really saw that through pages 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.379
 twitter information pages on the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.539
 site bing there is for example there we go 

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:07.160
 to meet them in real flesh-and-blood 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.450
 we'll even be able to spend an evening 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.640
 with them apparently there is a small 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.200
 planned evening in a wine bar a 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.710
 evening I do not know what in a 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.540
 bar 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.430
 in short, it's really cool we're going to share 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.140
 that moment with team 2 benguigui 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.450
 so here it's really you imagine to 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.190
 how crazy we are just crazy 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.590
 nothing that this new and second 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.720
 thing that really but ko puts us 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.220
 is we going to have the opportunity is there 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.950
 I know that many of you 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.080
 would like to live this opportunity 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.080
 to test the next dlc he's getting 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.410
 names in the flight jump that will be released on May 19 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.910
 next 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.530
 so the house of the wolves we are going to have 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.540
 the opportunity to test it forward 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.400
 first one so we'll know first of all the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.430
 world all the content that will us 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.140
 wait for this next dlc 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.970
 unfortunately we will have an embargo and we 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.250
 can not give you the information 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.720
 before a certain date so it serves no purpose 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.670
 nothing to ask us the questions 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.260
 we will not be able to answer all 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.420
 world since this is our contract with 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.900
 acti vision simply we in 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.670
 stop 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.560
 so in fact what will happen and the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.030
 why of this video it is there it is 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.040
 we're going to talk about everything 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.170
 that have the opportunity to talk with these 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.340
 people these developers these products 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.380
 that I know there will be in the heap 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.750
 some reference contacts like 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.860
 scott tyler who is the producer 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.020
 christopher barrett who is the director 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.960
 artistic or even bakken lars which is 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.490
 So the designer these people well 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.590
 still others say that there is benji 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.450
 good simply to offer us 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.650
 the opportunity to ask them questions 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.510
 and meet them 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.220
 and so this video is there for that 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.170
 it is also through us the opportunity 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.580
 for you to ask them some 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.840
 things that are important to you or 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.890
 so things on which it's 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.170
 not very clear if you have any 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.270
 questions this is the moment or never of 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.860
 ask us all your questions in 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.570
 the comment space below this 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.130
 video we will select the most 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.650
 relevant one that is worth it 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.810
 which of course could 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.860
 possibly get an answer by 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.540
 example the people who will ask 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.070
 things a little too hairy or a little 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.740
 too detailed about future challenges 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.330
 necessarily we can not retransmit 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.930
 your questions anyway for all 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.390
 others 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.070
 if ever tried to attempt the blow 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.890
 your questions and if we can we will try 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.960
 it's our turn to ask directly 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.000
 questions to the people concerned 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.980
 so here we will be in parallel of 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.019
 all this missing from the twitter web 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.120
 facebook is probably is obviously 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.889
 youtube for four days so from 23 to 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.840
 If everything goes well, I think we 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.449
 will be the same for sure 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.830
 wi fi at the hotel in truth he prefers 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.720
 warn you that if you have three four 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.100
 days of absence do not surprise you 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.840
 This is perfectly normal 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.400
 we will do our utmost to keep you 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.470
 many made given news 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.540
 fresh Hebrew is in any case I hope 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.729
 really sincerely that you will have 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.290
 the opportunity to discover these things to 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.280
 through our videos and that will make you 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.139
 pleasure 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.780
 I make very big kisses and it was 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.520
 a lot of excitement that I 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.090
 tell you very soon for others 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.870
