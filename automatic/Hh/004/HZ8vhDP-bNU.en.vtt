00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
switching this thing in right here he's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.940 
switching this thing in right here he's
going<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.300> be<00:01:14.870> able<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.260> negate<00:01:15.500> this<00:01:15.710> sleep

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
going to be able to negate this sleep

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.260

powder<00:01:16.100> but<00:01:16.400> then<00:01:16.490> he's<00:01:16.640> gonna<00:01:16.760> have<00:01:16.940> to<00:01:17.090> take

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
powder but then he's gonna have to take

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.660 
powder but then he's gonna have to take
a<00:01:17.300> pretty<00:01:17.690> heavy<00:01:17.990> sludge<00:01:18.830> bomb<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.400> face

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
a pretty heavy sludge bomb to the face

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.700 
a pretty heavy sludge bomb to the face
so<00:01:19.880> he<00:01:20.510> does<00:01:20.690> set<00:01:20.840> up<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:20.990> sticky<00:01:21.200> web<00:01:21.409> which<00:01:21.560> way

for an earthquake forgetting about the
defense<00:05:24.420> raised<00:05:24.660> earthquake<00:05:25.140> probably

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
defense raised earthquake probably

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.480

that are key I'm just gonna have to come
back<00:05:55.530> in<00:05:55.800> so<00:05:56.460> he's<00:05:57.030> gonna<00:05:57.150> take<00:05:57.390> some<00:05:57.510> stealth

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
back in so he's gonna take some stealth

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.150

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
attack raises attacks honestly looking

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.520

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
so the malamar is still kind of a

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.070 
so the malamar is still kind of a
minimal<00:06:08.730> threat<00:06:08.940> if<00:06:09.060> this<00:06:09.180> thing<00:06:09.300> if<00:06:09.480> malamar

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
minimal threat if this thing if malamar

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.140 
minimal threat if this thing if malamar

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.160 
enough power to kill that
and<00:06:44.520> that<00:06:44.760> is<00:06:44.880> a<00:06:44.910> battle<00:06:45.300> of<00:06:45.540> the<00:06:45.660> birds<00:06:45.870> right
