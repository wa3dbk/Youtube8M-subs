catch<00:00:23.810> you<00:00:23.990> up<00:00:24.080> with<00:00:24.440> what<00:00:24.619> I've<00:00:24.710> done<00:00:24.890> already

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
catch you up with what I've done already

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.330 
catch you up with what I've done already
first<00:00:26.300> on<00:00:26.690> the<00:00:26.900> cabinet<00:00:27.350> itself<00:00:27.500> I've<00:00:28.070> added

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
first on the cabinet itself I've added

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.310 
first on the cabinet itself I've added
these<00:00:28.550> gussets<00:00:29.150> at<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.390> top<00:00:29.600> and<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:29.930> gussets

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
these gussets at the top and the gussets

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.530 
these gussets at the top and the gussets
are<00:00:30.439> cut<00:00:30.680> at<00:00:30.800> an<00:00:30.920> angle<00:00:31.369> that<00:00:31.880> matches<00:00:32.330> what's

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
are cut at an angle that matches what's

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.119 
are cut at an angle that matches what's
called<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.930> spring<00:00:33.350> angle<00:00:33.710> of<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:33.920> crown

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
called the spring angle of the crown

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.890 
called the spring angle of the crown
molding<00:00:34.489> itself<00:00:34.879> so<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:35.210> deal<00:00:35.360> with<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:35.600> is

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
molding itself so the deal with that is

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.080 
molding itself so the deal with that is
that<00:00:35.930> if<00:00:36.530> all<00:00:36.800> I<00:00:36.830> do<00:00:37.010> is<00:00:37.309> glue<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:37.820> Brad<00:00:38.059> the

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
that if all I do is glue and Brad the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.689 
that if all I do is glue and Brad the
crown<00:00:38.449> molding<00:00:38.840> here<00:00:39.140> onto<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.830> cabinet<00:00:40.280> if

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
crown molding here onto the cabinet if

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.549 
crown molding here onto the cabinet if
something<00:00:41.150> ever<00:00:41.269> grabs<00:00:41.659> onto<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.110> top<00:00:42.320> there

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
something ever grabs onto the top there

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.170 
something ever grabs onto the top there
it's<00:00:42.680> going<00:00:42.769> to<00:00:42.830> be<00:00:42.920> pretty<00:00:43.159> fragile<00:00:43.519> and<00:00:43.879> may

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
it's going to be pretty fragile and may

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.180 
it's going to be pretty fragile and may
become<00:00:44.540> loose<00:00:44.750> so<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.500> gusset<00:00:45.890> is<00:00:45.979> going<00:00:46.129> to

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
become loose so the gusset is going to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.039 
become loose so the gusset is going to
give<00:00:46.339> us<00:00:46.430> a<00:00:46.549> surface<00:00:46.940> that<00:00:46.970> we<00:00:47.210> can<00:00:47.239> fasten<00:00:47.900> to

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:48.049 
give us a surface that we can fasten to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:50.350 
give us a surface that we can fasten to
and<00:00:48.290> glue<00:00:48.739> to<00:00:48.949> make<00:00:49.549> sure<00:00:49.699> everything<00:00:50.059> is<00:00:50.150> nice

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
and glue to make sure everything is nice

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.509 
and glue to make sure everything is nice
and<00:00:50.600> rigid<00:00:50.780> I've<00:00:51.620> got<00:00:51.799> the<00:00:51.949> piece<00:00:52.129> on<00:00:52.339> this

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
and rigid I've got the piece on this

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
corner of the case I'm a big advocate of

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.459 
corner of the case I'm a big advocate of
transferring<00:01:56.569> measurement<00:01:57.020> rather<00:01:57.229> than

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
transferring measurement rather than

with a tape measure or a stick rule

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.249 
with a tape measure or a stick rule
really<00:02:01.549> really<00:02:01.789> hard<00:02:01.969> to<00:02:02.060> execute<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:03.139> now<00:02:03.229> I

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
really really hard to execute so now I

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.899 
really really hard to execute so now I
can<00:02:03.499> take<00:02:03.649> this<00:02:03.859> off<00:02:04.100> take<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.429> to<00:02:04.549> my<00:02:04.670> miter

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
can take this off take it to my miter

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:14.690 
can take this off take it to my miter
saw<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:05.450> make<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.200> mitre<00:02:06.439> cut

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.160 

before<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.730> glue<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.209> fasten<00:02:16.659> this<00:02:16.750> baby<00:02:16.989> in

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
before I glue and fasten this baby in

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.580 
before I glue and fasten this baby in
place<00:02:17.439> let's<00:02:17.980> use<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.549> trick<00:02:19.150> again<00:02:19.590> make

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
place let's use this trick again make

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:42.199 
place let's use this trick again make
sure<00:02:20.620> it's<00:02:20.829> just<00:02:21.069> right

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.449 

and<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.900> way<00:02:44.079> out<00:02:44.230> check<00:02:44.530> its<00:02:44.739> length<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.310> by

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
and the way out check its length is by

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.460 
and the way out check its length is by
grabbing<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.970> piece<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.510> returns<00:02:47.079> down

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
grabbing the piece that returns down

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.569 
grabbing the piece that returns down
this<00:02:47.650> other<00:02:47.860> side

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
this other side

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.740 
this other side
and<00:02:49.269> hold<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.290> up<00:02:50.650> here<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:52.209> make<00:02:52.390> sure<00:02:52.420> that

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
and hold that up here to make sure that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.110 
and hold that up here to make sure that
corner<00:02:53.200> lines<00:02:53.470> up<00:02:53.829> just<00:02:55.980> right<00:02:56.980> all<00:02:57.970> right

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
corner lines up just right all right

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.059 
corner lines up just right all right
that's<00:02:58.390> good<00:02:58.599> to<00:02:58.690> go<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.260> next<00:02:59.440> thing<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.739> can<00:02:59.950> do

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
that's good to go so next thing I can do

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.539 
that's good to go so next thing I can do
is<00:03:00.250> take<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:00.670> back<00:03:00.819> down<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.180> apply<00:03:01.450> glue<00:03:05.549> one

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
is take it back down and apply glue one

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.500 
is take it back down and apply glue one
of<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.730> things<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.090> want<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.299> pay<00:03:07.480> attention

to when you put a crown molding or
really<00:03:10.599> any<00:03:10.870> molding<00:03:11.230> on<00:03:11.379> a<00:03:11.409> cabinet<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:12.040> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
really any molding on a cabinet is the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.539 
really any molding on a cabinet is the
notion<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.500> I've<00:03:14.500> got<00:03:14.739> a<00:03:14.769> nice<00:03:15.010> cabinet

notion that I've got a nice cabinet
there<00:03:15.730> right<00:03:15.940> now<00:03:16.120> it's<00:03:16.450> all<00:03:16.629> sanded

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
there right now it's all sanded

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.780 
there right now it's all sanded
everything<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.680> clean<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:17.950> good<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.370> go

of that cabinet so there are glues in

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.379 
of that cabinet so there are glues in
the<00:03:25.989> marketplace<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:27.549> are<00:03:27.700> specifically
