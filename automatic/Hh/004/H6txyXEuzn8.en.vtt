Jetstream in this particular case we're
actually<00:00:12.849> looking<00:00:13.089> at<00:00:13.299> a<00:00:13.330> prototype<00:00:13.990> that

water fed brush way you make it to jets

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.469

or<00:01:28.539> four<00:01:28.810> Jets<00:01:29.430> more<00:01:30.430> I<00:01:30.789> guess<00:01:31.119> if<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:31.329> do<00:01:31.450> a

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
or four Jets more I guess if you do a

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.480 
or four Jets more I guess if you do a
little<00:01:31.630> bit<00:01:31.750> of<00:01:31.810> custom<00:01:32.170> work<00:01:32.200> on<00:01:32.530> it<00:01:32.710> this<00:01:33.219> has

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
little bit of custom work on it this has

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.940 
little bit of custom work on it this has
jets<00:01:34.030> all<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.539> way<00:01:34.630> across<00:01:34.899> so<00:01:35.350> what<00:01:35.799> those

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
jets all the way across so what those

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.319 
jets all the way across so what those
Jets<00:01:36.250> are<00:01:36.399> actually<00:01:36.670> gonna<00:01:36.759> be<00:01:36.820> doing<00:01:37.210> when

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
Jets are actually gonna be doing when

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
the pad and also because you are rinsing

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.220 
the pad and also because you are rinsing
above<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.610> pad<00:02:20.850> as<00:02:21.150> you're<00:02:21.720> cleaning

you've loosened up so as opposed to a

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.050 
you've loosened up so as opposed to a
you<00:02:28.860> know<00:02:28.950> traditional<00:02:29.550> thinking<00:02:29.730> about

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
you know traditional thinking about

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.000 
you know traditional thinking about
water<00:02:30.420> fed<00:02:30.720> where<00:02:30.960> you're<00:02:31.140> scrubbing<00:02:31.770> with

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
water fed where you're scrubbing with

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.530 
water fed where you're scrubbing with
the<00:02:32.100> brush<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.490> scrub<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.850> whole<00:02:32.970> windowpane

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
the brush you scrub the whole windowpane

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.900 
the brush you scrub the whole windowpane
and<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.810> come<00:02:33.990> up<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.350> do<00:02:34.500> your<00:02:34.650> rinse

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
and you come up and you do your rinse

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.850 
and you come up and you do your rinse
and<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.420> great<00:02:36.690> many<00:02:37.050> instances<00:02:37.590> you're<00:02:37.770> gonna

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
and in great many instances you're gonna

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.730 
and in great many instances you're gonna
be<00:02:38.100> able<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.340> do<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.610> all<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.000> one<00:02:39.210> step

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
be able to do this all in one step

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.620 
be able to do this all in one step
now<00:02:40.740> one<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.160> things<00:02:41.370> that's<00:02:41.550> very<00:02:41.910> key

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
now one of the things that's very key

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.930 
now one of the things that's very key
about<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.020> pimping<00:02:43.410> action<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.730> jet

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
about the pimping action of the jet

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.890 
about the pimping action of the jet
stream<00:02:45.240> is<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.050> allows<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.660> clean<00:02:48.660> a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
stream is that it allows you to clean a

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.680 
stream is that it allows you to clean a
window<00:02:49.350> like<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.740> would<00:02:50.090> if<00:02:51.090> you're<00:02:51.360> doing<00:02:51.540> a

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
window like you would if you're doing a

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.110 
window like you would if you're doing a
Fanning<00:02:52.170> technique<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.610> natural<00:02:53.910> fact

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
Fanning technique and the natural fact

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.120 
Fanning technique and the natural fact
it's<00:02:54.270> like<00:02:54.420> Fanning<00:02:55.170> two-hander<00:02:55.950> did<00:02:56.070> you

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
it's like Fanning two-hander did you

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.190 
it's like Fanning two-hander did you
ever<00:02:56.280> see<00:02:56.400> those<00:02:56.520> guys<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:57.060> say<00:02:57.780> those<00:02:57.959> guys

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
ever see those guys I say those guys

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.220 
ever see those guys I say those guys
because<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.560> was<00:02:58.890> really<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.610> good<00:02:59.880> at<00:03:00.000> it

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
because I was really that good at it

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.870 
because I was really that good at it
when<00:03:01.230> they<00:03:01.350> go<00:03:01.530> with<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.770> scrubber<00:03:02.070> with<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
when they go with the scrubber with the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.120 
when they go with the scrubber with the
one<00:03:03.030> hand<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.540> they<00:03:03.810> follow<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.290> up<00:03:04.410> with<00:03:04.650> the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
one hand and they follow it up with the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.430 
one hand and they follow it up with the
squeegee<00:03:05.370> on<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.820> other<00:03:05.959> it's<00:03:06.959> pretty<00:03:07.260> much

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
squeegee on the other it's pretty much

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.400 
squeegee on the other it's pretty much
the<00:03:07.560> same<00:03:07.740> thing<00:03:08.130> except<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.940> this<00:03:09.360> case<00:03:09.660> using

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the same thing except in this case using

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.020 
the same thing except in this case using
the<00:03:10.530> scrubber<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.130> pure<00:03:11.370> water<00:03:11.610> like<00:03:11.910> you

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
the scrubber in the pure water like you

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.240 
the scrubber in the pure water like you
would<00:03:12.180> for<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.690> scrubber<00:03:13.200> pad<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.830> you're

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
would for a scrubber pad and you're

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.220 
would for a scrubber pad and you're
using<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.670> steady<00:03:15.000> stream<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.390> water<00:03:15.720> above

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
using that steady stream of water above

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.880 
using that steady stream of water above
to<00:03:16.980> follow<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.670> immediately<00:03:18.600> behind<00:03:19.260> the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
to follow in immediately behind the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.670 
to follow in immediately behind the
scrubber<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:21.239> remove<00:03:21.540> all<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.350> loosened

go you know me too some of you sound
good<00:03:48.239> in<00:03:48.390> theory<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:48.959> how<00:03:49.080> does<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.230> work<00:03:49.440> in

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
good in theory but how does it work in

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.770 
good in theory but how does it work in
practice<00:03:49.820> well<00:03:50.820> I<00:03:50.850> had<00:03:51.030> like<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.299> said<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.540> was<00:03:51.750> a

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
practice well I had like I said I was a

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.840 
practice well I had like I said I was a
little<00:03:51.959> bit<00:03:52.049> concerned<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:53.130> maybe<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.610> pad

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
would get too too dirty mucked up and

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.890 
would get too too dirty mucked up and
whatnot<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:56.940> just<00:03:57.180> be<00:03:57.299> dragging<00:03:57.690> dirt

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900
