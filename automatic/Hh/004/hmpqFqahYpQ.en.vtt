00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.230
 the mantra that the world cup marks the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.389
 beginning of a new era in football 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.790
 Brazil seems to apply to all 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.070
 factors involving the world including 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.660
 with regard to technology and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.609
 lawn maintenance 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.890
 of the six stadiums that will receive the cup 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.260
 of the confederations was adopted a new 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 philosophy in the cultivation of the playing fields 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.070
 all so that no one questions the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.990
 quality of the show on the stage where 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.910
 the ball artists will be performing 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.280
 curiously part of this technology 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.230
 invisible to the eyes of the supporter 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.600
 today the football field is composed of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.399
 several layers that reach half a meter 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 below the level of the lawn 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.390
 everything starts at the so-called base ground that is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.640
 laser-level and ripped 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.350
 pipes that will drain the water to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.930
 off the field 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.340
 above it comes a layer of gravel that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.140
 can make the water 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.030
 drained faster 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.070
 next comes a thick layer of 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.719
 sand that is just where the grass will 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.520
 establish its roots 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.920
 the type of sand chosen varies according to 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.840
 the rainfall in the region of the stadium 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.780
 The finer the grain, the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.820
 ability of the land to withhold water from 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.890
 the foundation ready finally comes the turn 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.780
 of grass that was planted in two ways 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.210
 different in the stages of the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.369
 confederations in the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.860
 new source, the method chosen was the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.869
 the tufts of grass called 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.820
 splits were spread over the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.619
 layer of sand so that later 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.439
 to create their roots 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.450
 already in the maracanã in the pernambuco arena and 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.340
 mané garrincha stadium the playing field 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.710
 was formed by several rolls of grass 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.240
 installed under the prepared soil 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.270
 this grass is grown on farms 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.549
 and is then trimmed 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.100
 in carpets of 20 square meters and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.780
 four centimeters thick 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.610
 the rollers are transported during the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.369
 to prevent the grass from 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.500
 deteriorates the choice of planting method 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.740
 depends basically on rest time 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.329
 that the grass will have to root its roots 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.280
 in its specifications to fifa 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.740
 recommends that the roll is always the option 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.799
 with preference given to the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.959
 of seedlings or the traditional sowing this 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.330
 to secure the ground grass 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.860
 avoiding the release of tufts 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.170
 during a match 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.900
 late afternoons it was mandatory to 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.490
 use of the roller method before 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.130
 Someone questions the quality of the 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.570
 lawn of the grand final of the 2014 World Cup 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.130
 the roller method is used without 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.710
 in other sacred temples 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.650
 football as a field in the 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.840
 barcelona whether by molt or roll 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.570
 the new technology changes the height of 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.430
 cutting of grass that will decrease from 28 to 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.500
 15 millimeters 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.380
 the grassy lawn favors the game 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.580
 in it the ball rolls easier without 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.580
 to be attached to both the field
