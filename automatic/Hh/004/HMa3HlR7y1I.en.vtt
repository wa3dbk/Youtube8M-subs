00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.429 
did a miss beat the Green Bay Packers
when<00:00:29.369> they<00:00:29.490> were<00:00:29.550> undefeated<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.390> they<00:00:31.260> play

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
when they were undefeated and they play

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.250 
when they were undefeated and they play
pretty<00:00:31.679> good<00:00:31.800> defense<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:33.000> game<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.750> don't

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
pretty good defense on that game I don't

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.530 
pretty good defense on that game I don't
know<00:00:34.320> if<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.469> all<00:00:34.500> saw<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.180> next

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
know if you all saw it but I think next

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.360 
know if you all saw it but I think next
year<00:00:36.719> they<00:00:36.870> need<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> driver<00:00:37.440> cornerback

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
year they need a driver cornerback

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
year they need a driver cornerback
because<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:39.090> lost<00:00:39.239> Brenda<00:00:39.719> car<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
because they lost Brenda car to the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.560 
because they lost Brenda car to the
Cowboys<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.640> think<00:00:41.969> next<00:00:42.300> year<00:00:42.450> they're

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
Cowboys so I think next year they're

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.600 
Cowboys so I think next year they're
going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:43.020> better<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:44.160> never<00:00:44.309> fix

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
going to get better and they never fix

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.690 
going to get better and they never fix
