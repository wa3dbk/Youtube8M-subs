00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.390 

so<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:13.020> bring<00:01:13.200> your<00:01:13.260> preteens<00:01:14.010> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
so you can bring your preteens to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.580 
so you can bring your preteens to
collect<00:01:14.760> shells<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.630> hobby<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:15.930> them<00:01:16.229> or

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
collect shells it's a hobby for them or

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.620 
collect shells it's a hobby for them or
I<00:01:16.620> think<00:01:17.400> toddlers<00:01:17.760> also<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
I think toddlers also can do that and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.040 
I think toddlers also can do that and
they<00:01:18.870> can<00:01:19.020> make<00:01:19.140> suncast<00:01:19.680> castles<00:01:20.930> then<00:01:21.930> you

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
they can make suncast castles then you

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.910 
they can make suncast castles then you
can<00:01:22.200> bring<00:01:22.350> your<00:01:22.530> sim<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:23.010> do<00:01:23.360> snorkelling

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
can bring your sim to do snorkelling

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.050 
can bring your sim to do snorkelling
once<00:01:25.920> they've<00:01:26.070> collected<00:01:26.280> their<00:01:26.670> gear<00:01:26.910> they

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
once they've collected their gear they

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.550 
once they've collected their gear they
go<00:01:27.210> into<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> water<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:28.110> go<00:01:28.259> into<00:01:28.380> this

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
go into the water they go into this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.940 
go into the water they go into this
small<00:01:29.360> designated<00:01:30.360> area<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.990> think<00:01:31.530> once

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
small designated area I think once

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.530 
small designated area I think once
they've<00:01:32.160> collected<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> shells<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
they've collected all the shells in the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210 
they've collected all the shells in the
area<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.290> move<00:01:34.440> on<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> another<00:01:34.920> area

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
area then they move on to another area

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:55.480 
area then they move on to another area
but<00:01:35.490> I'm<00:01:35.610> not<00:01:35.729> sure<00:01:35.970> yet

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.590 

okay<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.700> any<00:01:56.939> hobby<00:01:57.180> once<00:01:57.450> they've

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
okay like any hobby once they've

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.109 
okay like any hobby once they've
collected<00:01:57.869> their<00:01:58.710> prize<00:01:59.039> it<00:01:59.610> goes<00:01:59.789> into<00:02:00.000> a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
collected their prize it goes into a

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.090 
collected their prize it goes into a
charts<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.689> once<00:02:01.289> they<00:02:01.439> click<00:02:01.649> three<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.009> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
charts and once they click three in a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.360 
charts and once they click three in a
row<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.610> another<00:02:02.820> prize

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370
