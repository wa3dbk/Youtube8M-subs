an ultra rare one so I'm thinking that's
how<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.290> works<00:03:05.500> is<00:03:05.769> you<00:03:05.890> can<00:03:06.100> only<00:03:06.250> get<00:03:06.430> your

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
how it works is you can only get your

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.309 
how it works is you can only get your
ultra<00:03:06.970> rare<00:03:07.150> ones<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.750> mystery<00:03:08.140> ones

ultra rare ones in the mystery ones

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.290 
ultra rare ones in the mystery ones

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
because you can't see them otherwise you

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.729
