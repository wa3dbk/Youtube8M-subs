because<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.190> makes<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> easier<00:01:41.760> to<00:01:41.790> transition

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
because it makes it easier to transition

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.640 
because it makes it easier to transition
back<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.500> C<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.010> G<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.340> fast<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.650> so

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
back to C and G really fast like that so

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.380 
back to C and G really fast like that so
I'm<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.890> kind<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.670> play<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> way<00:01:48.090> he

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
I'm going to kind of play it the way he

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.969 
I'm going to kind of play it the way he
does<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:48.870> you're<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.410> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.620> play<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.400 
does but you're not going to play the
whole<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:51.420> whole<00:01:51.450> chord<00:01:51.900> you're<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.260> going

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
whole the whole chord you're just going

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.710 
whole the whole chord you're just going
to<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.560> playing<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:53.220> couple<00:01:53.940> notes<00:01:54.150> in<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.450> cord

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
to be playing a couple notes in the cord

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.670 
to be playing a couple notes in the cord
and<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.250> way<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> song<00:01:56.729> goes<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.680> you're

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
and so the way the song goes is you're

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.150 
and so the way the song goes is you're
going<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.160> doing<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.580> on<00:02:00.440> every<00:02:01.440> beat<00:02:01.920> of

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
going to be doing this on every beat of

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.550 
going to be doing this on every beat of
the<00:02:02.550> measure<00:02:05.450> in<00:02:06.450> between<00:02:06.840> those<00:02:07.080> you're

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the measure in between those you're

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.480 
the measure in between those you're
going<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.770> be<00:02:07.860> alternating<00:02:08.610> between<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:10.490> g

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.400 
and C it with d I move my index finger
and<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.580> middle<00:04:32.640> finger<00:04:32.910> down<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.840> string<00:04:34.110> so

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
and the middle finger down the string so

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.240 
and the middle finger down the string so
I'll<00:04:34.530> play<00:04:34.710> in<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.870> B<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.200> E<00:04:37.320> strings<00:04:37.800> on

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
I'll play in the B and the E strings on

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.910 
I'll play in the B and the E strings on
that<00:04:38.760> one<00:04:38.910> so<00:04:39.200> again<00:04:40.200> here's<00:04:40.410> here's<00:04:40.740> how<00:04:40.860> you

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
that one so again here's here's how you

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.590 
that one so again here's here's how you
play<00:04:41.010> G

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:56.540 

and<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:48.410> sea<00:04:48.650> is<00:04:48.919> probably<00:04:49.160> like<00:04:49.310> this

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:04.950 

and<00:04:57.550> then<00:04:57.669> the<00:04:57.820> G<00:04:58.030> again<00:05:00.419> d<00:05:01.419> is<00:05:01.750> played<00:05:03.960> again

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
and then the G again d is played again

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.070 
and then the G again d is played again
you<00:05:05.190> play<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.340> D<00:05:06.550> and<00:05:06.580> then<00:05:06.940> you<00:05:07.030> play<00:05:07.270> on<00:05:07.900> the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
you play the D and then you play on the

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:22.710 
you play the D and then you play on the
be<00:05:08.230> a<00:05:08.500> strings<00:05:21.120> you<00:05:22.120> probably<00:05:22.330> hear<00:05:22.510> some

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
be a strings you probably hear some

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.050 
be a strings you probably hear some
inconsistencies<00:05:23.290> on<00:05:23.680> whether<00:05:24.370> i<00:05:24.460> play<00:05:24.790> the

he goes back and forth he plays a lot of
lots<00:05:32.950> of<00:05:33.100> times<00:05:33.280> we'll<00:05:33.490> play<00:05:33.669> a<00:05:33.700> G<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.240> a

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
lots of times we'll play a G and a

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.540 
lots of times we'll play a G and a
different<00:05:34.570> formation<00:05:35.200> it<00:05:36.190> doesn't<00:05:36.460> really

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
different formation it doesn't really

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.920 
different formation it doesn't really

matter as long as you get that pattern

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.820 
matter as long as you get that pattern
down<00:05:39.690> it's<00:05:40.690> going<00:05:40.780> to<00:05:40.870> sound<00:05:41.020> you<00:05:41.229> nobody's

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
or not you change it up so all the

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.610 
or not you change it up so all the
verses<00:05:46.630> sound<00:05:47.020> just<00:05:47.229> like<00:05:47.290> that<00:05:49.229> the<00:05:50.229> second

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
verses sound just like that the second

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.360 
verses sound just like that the second
part<00:05:50.830> is<00:05:51.040> the<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:51.850> bridge<00:05:52.479> and<00:05:52.840> it's<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:54.010> the

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
part is the the bridge and it's the the

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.010 
part is the the bridge and it's the the
one<00:05:54.580> part<00:05:54.850> that<00:05:55.120> sounds<00:05:55.510> different<00:05:55.840> than<00:05:55.900> the

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
one part that sounds different than the

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.730 
one part that sounds different than the
rest<00:05:57.150> starts<00:05:58.150> with<00:05:58.300> when<00:05:58.810> he<00:05:58.840> says<00:05:59.140> we<00:05:59.680> don't

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
rest starts with when he says we don't

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.650 
rest starts with when he says we don't
notice<00:06:00.010> any<00:06:00.160> time<00:06:00.370> pass<00:06:00.640> I'll<00:06:01.180> go<00:06:01.390> and<00:06:01.479> play

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
notice any time pass I'll go and play

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.070 
notice any time pass I'll go and play
for<00:06:01.900> you<00:06:02.160> you<00:06:03.160> don't<00:06:03.310> notice<00:06:03.789> any<00:06:04.300> time<00:06:04.720> has

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
for you you don't notice any time has

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.040 
for you you don't notice any time has
we<00:06:08.069> don't<00:06:08.250> notice<00:06:08.879> anything<00:06:11.360> we<00:06:12.360> sit<00:06:12.689> side<00:06:12.720> by

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
we don't notice anything we sit side by

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.230 
we don't notice anything we sit side by
side<00:06:13.680> in<00:06:13.710> every<00:06:14.310> class<00:06:16.430> teacher<00:06:17.430> thinks<00:06:18.060> that

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
side in every class teacher thinks that

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.929 
side in every class teacher thinks that
I<00:06:18.270> sound<00:06:18.780> funny<00:06:19.199> but<00:06:19.650> she<00:06:20.069> likes<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:20.699> way<00:06:20.879> you

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:20.939 
I sound funny but she likes the way you

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:24.020 
I sound funny but she likes the way you
see<00:06:21.539> it's<00:06:21.990> not<00:06:22.259> all<00:06:22.439> tree<00:06:22.710> okay<00:06:23.189> that's<00:06:23.400> so

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
see it's not all tree okay that's so

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.059 
see it's not all tree okay that's so
that's<00:06:24.150> the<00:06:24.330> bridge<00:06:24.569> and<00:06:24.870> notice<00:06:25.770> that<00:06:25.800> it<00:06:26.039> has

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
that's the bridge and notice that it has

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.700 
that's the bridge and notice that it has
the<00:06:26.189> same<00:06:26.460> chords<00:06:26.819> in<00:06:26.969> except<00:06:27.960> he<00:06:28.229> throw<00:06:28.439> an<00:06:28.560> A

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
the same chords in except he throw an A

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.570 
the same chords in except he throw an A
in<00:06:28.919> there<00:06:29.210> I<00:06:30.680> think<00:06:31.680> the<00:06:31.770> way<00:06:31.919> he<00:06:31.949> plays<00:06:32.370> it<00:06:32.520> he

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
in there I think the way he plays it he

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.209 
in there I think the way he plays it he
probably<00:06:32.669> plays<00:06:33.030> it<00:06:33.180> up<00:06:33.680> on<00:06:34.680> the<00:06:35.039> next

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219 
probably plays it up on the next

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.279 
probably plays it up on the next
somewhere<00:06:35.610> because<00:06:35.849> I<00:06:35.969> hear<00:06:36.300> this<00:06:36.479> this<00:06:37.050> note

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
somewhere because I hear this this note

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
sneak in at one point we feel listen

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.100 
sneak in at one point we feel listen
really<00:06:39.210> closely<00:06:39.479> but<00:06:39.780> i'm<00:06:39.840> just<00:06:39.870> going<00:06:40.080> to

show you how to play with the normal
open<00:06:42.750> a<00:06:42.870> chord<00:06:43.520> so<00:06:44.520> at<00:06:44.849> the<00:06:45.000> beginning<00:06:45.060> of<00:06:45.360> the

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449 
open a chord so at the beginning of the

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:50.930 
open a chord so at the beginning of the
bridge<00:06:45.629> it<00:06:45.810> starts<00:06:46.050> out<00:06:46.139> with<00:06:46.440> C<00:06:49.669> think<00:06:50.669> is<00:06:50.819> the

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
bridge it starts out with C think is the

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:57.060 
bridge it starts out with C think is the
G<00:06:51.180> let's<00:06:52.080> see<00:06:52.289> again

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070
