00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.589
 ah 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.540
 hello today I'm going to show you how to shape 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.150
 the skin of a leopard on one foot do you 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.060
 fun recipe which we can 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.259
 to make accomplices to our children you will see 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.599
 that come only by action first 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:35.660
 instead we need 75 grams of flour 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:39.070
 100 grams of sugar 2 tablespoons 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.260
 tureens of cocoa powder 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.250
 three eggs a teaspoon of powder 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.670
 bake or yeast royal also a couple 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.980
 of drops of yellow dye can be 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.440
 the one that you have in house liquid by gel 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.720
 I always use gel because I never 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.239
 problems this you are going to find in 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.980
 pastry shops also guide 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.500
 online the wilton brand and we start in 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.009
 first place we will separate the yolks from 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.930
 the clear ones we are going to put them in the 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.450
 processor together with the 100 grams of 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.590
 sugar 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.590
 and we raise 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.430
 and now they are given to beat the egg whites 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.430
 on the verge of snow 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.440
 we already have it perfect and here I have 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.720
 the sieving flour and we're going to 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.630
 add the teaspoon of powder 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.080
 bake or yeast 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.080
 we will be very good 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.810
 and we will integrate it with the egg and the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.810
 sugar 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.920
 once it's fine it's free 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.420
 we will put the whites very carefully 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.819
 whipped 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.819
 in an enveloping way that we look well 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.230
 we already have all the ingredients well 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.380
 integrated we are going to take a couple of 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.380
 spoonfuls 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.090
 2 for here 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.080
 and with one I think we 'll have enough 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.080
 for what 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.650
 there is this what would be now 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.840
 we will put a little cocoa in this one 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.840
 let's paint the two pretty 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.940
 in this other that there is a little less 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.610
 let's also put a little bit of 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.840
 cocoa 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:38.140
 here quite less quantity and also 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.000
 let's put a droplet of dye 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.130
 yellow 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.090
 ah 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.090
 and 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.890
 i 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.430
 here I have two pastry sleeves and I'm going to 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.220
 first use the yellow I'll cut a 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.870
 Tiny bit as soon as we go 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.080
 Trying the yellow clarita what 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.370
 let's do is inside each 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.170
 pattern stain 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.169
 it does not have to be perfect because 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.280
 as you can see they are irregular shapes so 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.280
 we are going to fill 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:28.410
 and so we will do with all the holes in 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.410
 each spot with light color 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.290
 Okay, we've already done the interior 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.720
 of each speck and now we're going to do 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.470
 with the darkest color the exterior 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.660
 in the same way as it is more comfortable you can 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.510
 do it with a round nozzle or 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.130
 simply by cutting the tip of the 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.810
 pastry bag or you can also 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.730
 use a bag of these 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.430
 frozen and cut the tip and what 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.330
 very easy we complicate our lives with 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.330
 what you have at home 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.910
 I have also put the preheated oven 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.090
 to 180 degrees and now once we have 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.450
 finished let's put it like that and 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.220
 as it is in the oven at 180 degrees 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.800
 for a single minute 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.580
 we come back but we have had a 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.370
 minute 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.430
 maybe a minute and a half and now we're going to 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.440
 put the rest of the piero cream 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.440
 About our printing 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.259
 it has already been in about 10 minutes 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.759
 oven and now we are going to roll it up very 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.860
 slowly with much fear to not 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.860
 burn ourselves in your own paper 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:20.320
 and then with this damp cloth what 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.530
 let's wrap this up will serve us for 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.770
 that does not lose the elasticity the pionono 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:28.129
 we will discover it until it cools in its 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.639
 whole 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:34.279
 and here we have our own jungle already 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.819
 we have the pionono and we can decorate 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:40.610
 our pies our pioneers or 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:42.769
 anything you can think of hope 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.759
 that you liked a little kiss and even 

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:45.909
 next video 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.909
 bye
