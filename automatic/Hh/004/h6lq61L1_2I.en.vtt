 that this time it has taken us to Mexico we are in the headquarters of the culinary center 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.789
 ambrosia school of chefs 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.149

 world but that not everyone knows how to do it is about the fourth love 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.160
 well these good 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.730
 we evoke the traditional parade preparation 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.710
 from mexico the shreds 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.050
 avocado 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.200
 We would also like to have chopped tomato without seed 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.770
 chile that may be your preference 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.060
 yes landrón 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.060
 and a little salt just harass that 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.270
 guacamole joke is the point of support of laporta that we do not have 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.200
 to see what the shell is slightly greenish 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.130
 so this nation is black because it lacks maturity 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.910
 for mature lung is very simple it is proposed to take out the matches the win 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.020
 what they are told and 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.100
 this helps him to mature dry they have returned a newspaper 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.770
 close to it the stove and healthy will last approximately 3 to 5 days 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.080
 and to prepare your which is very simple 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.560
 we are going to 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.560
 patti by half 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.360
 jp 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.409
 ban 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.460
 very nice be europe not always not always become masters oz gates 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.880
 fidel does not move without sauce those to say something is another matter 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 if this does not make you lose as an interpreter 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.700
 for his part of the fault 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.200
 how long before they want to consume we can not start doing 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.060
 accounts because it's always 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.169
 this problem 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.289
 p that if it gets black but good if it is used myself I think that helps 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:13.769
 that does not suppose the prof 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.870
 4 hours before we can do it 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.109
 the ideal is to do a half hour approximately no more 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.189
 for the pp to put on what is as it says is that there are many people who put the 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:23.809
 monkey puts cream 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.199
 but that already loses 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.979
 the proper foot flavor 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.749
 of guacamole meet with these avocados that rode salcedo what 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.060
 means the word 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.640
 Photo télam 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.880
 means testicles 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.869
 this context 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:40.569
 and good to prepare a single with the help of the goalkeeper that everyone will start 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.130
 smash 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.209
 ap 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.399
 many people what it does is put it in a processor 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:50.479
 in ecuador a but that so much friction makes it stand out the dry mouth 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:55.089
 is very fat and therefore contact with the president of this faster 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.149
 twice Tuesday by little 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:01.879
 since we have this paste consistency 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.499
 that is here we are happy for this plague even more or leave it like that 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.499
 that I have some pieces for 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.339
 in this point 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:18.659
 the good thing already 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.249
 we incorporate and tomato 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:22.459

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.099
 to taste 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.829
 now this sentence in the millésime the yes no path is not not peeled 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.499

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.599
 a little yes inside 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.229
 look carefully is known in tone as part of the treatment is and in fact in 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.799
 Beijing Mexico only in the center of the country 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.330
 it is known as tomato 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.680
 our states 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.680
 and we have to ask for it as tomás 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.209

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:56.939
 the specialist 1 the actions of latin america the avocado is a 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:58.999
 fruit 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:00.839
 rich in fat 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:05.409
 and that can be a good substitute for for another race for example instead of 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.799
 the butter can be used avocado which is highly if it is a thing that 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.379
 has omega 3 nations 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.579

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.029
 of the few countries where it is consumed 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.519

 we continue without wanting 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:38.889
 The only thing we can do also to avoid accidents 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.889
