see all this crap as Reinhard again
really<00:05:47.130> it<00:05:47.310> isn't<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.789> fascinating<00:05:48.080> anyway

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080

we're<00:05:49.260> gonna<00:05:49.349> kill<00:05:49.590> these<00:05:49.740> two<00:05:49.800> guys<00:05:50.130> largely

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
we're gonna kill these two guys largely

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.920 
we're gonna kill these two guys largely
because<00:05:50.820> I've<00:05:50.940> wrapped<00:05:51.210> myself<00:05:51.360> right<00:05:51.780> the

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
because I've wrapped myself right the

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.480 
because I've wrapped myself right the
fuck<00:05:52.110> down<00:05:52.289> on<00:05:52.349> that<00:05:52.770> red<00:05:52.979> gems<00:05:53.250> we're

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
fuck down on that red gems we're

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.330 
fuck down on that red gems we're
throwing<00:05:53.699> axes<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.180> those<00:05:54.300> two<00:05:54.479> bosses<00:05:55.340> but

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
throwing axes and those two bosses but

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.529 
throwing axes and those two bosses but
there's<00:05:56.699> nothing<00:05:56.940> really<00:05:57.180> requires<00:05:57.449> that

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
there's nothing really requires that

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.210 
there's nothing really requires that
much<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:57.930> way<00:05:58.020> of<00:05:58.080> acting<00:05:58.409> in<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:59.039> next

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
much the way of acting in the next

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.070 
much the way of acting in the next
levels<00:05:59.460> which<00:05:59.699> is<00:05:59.940> fortunate<00:06:00.300> because<00:06:00.570> we

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
levels which is fortunate because we

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.529 
levels which is fortunate because we
can't<00:06:01.440> do<00:06:01.710> it<00:06:01.860> if<00:06:02.010> there<00:06:02.220> was<00:06:02.460> we<00:06:02.970> can't<00:06:03.240> we

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
can't do it if there was we can't we

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.820 
can't do it if there was we can't we
couldn't<00:06:03.930> couldn't<00:06:04.440> Texas<00:06:05.190> boy<00:06:05.400> tenses

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
couldn't couldn't Texas boy tenses

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.990 
couldn't couldn't Texas boy tenses
anyway<00:06:07.830> so<00:06:07.889> I'll<00:06:08.220> gather<00:06:08.370> up<00:06:08.460> some<00:06:08.550> red<00:06:08.729> jewels

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
anyway so I'll gather up some red jewels

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.110 
anyway so I'll gather up some red jewels
and<00:06:09.539> then<00:06:09.930> we<00:06:10.110> can<00:06:10.260> depress<00:06:10.530> the<00:06:10.860> button<00:06:14.990> tower

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
and then we can depress the button tower

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.909 
and then we can depress the button tower
it's<00:06:18.120> a<00:06:18.270> tower<00:06:18.539> that's<00:06:18.840> full<00:06:19.080> of<00:06:19.110> science<00:06:19.710> and

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
it's a tower that's full of science and

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.710 
it's a tower that's full of science and
this<00:06:20.070> is<00:06:20.400> that<00:06:20.639> other<00:06:20.820> hazardous<00:06:21.300> material

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
this is that other hazardous material

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.469 
this is that other hazardous material
what<00:06:22.409> is<00:06:22.500> it<00:06:22.650> doing<00:06:22.830> there<00:06:23.159> why<00:06:24.090> do<00:06:24.150> you<00:06:24.330> want

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
what is it doing there why do you want

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.240 
what is it doing there why do you want
to<00:06:24.570> drop<00:06:24.720> off<00:06:24.870> mandragora<00:06:25.440> here<00:06:25.889> all<00:06:26.039> the

technology above it the property would

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.040 
technology above it the property would
work<00:06:47.229> the<00:06:47.380> whole<00:06:47.500> time<00:06:47.530> as<00:06:48.400> the<00:06:48.580> last<00:06:48.760> thing

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
work the whole time as the last thing

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.270 
work the whole time as the last thing
enormous<00:06:50.050> machine<00:06:50.470> we<00:06:50.889> don't<00:06:51.010> know<00:06:51.070> what<00:06:51.160> it

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
enormous machine we don't know what it

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.040 
enormous machine we don't know what it
does<00:06:51.310> we<00:06:52.000> don't<00:06:52.180> want<00:06:52.300> it<00:06:52.360> makes<00:06:52.630> but<00:06:52.960> it's

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
does we don't want it makes but it's

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.770 
does we don't want it makes but it's
obviously<00:06:53.440> gonna<00:06:53.620> be<00:06:53.680> something<00:06:53.970> which<00:06:54.970> I<00:06:55.300> bet

obviously gonna be something which I bet

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.010 
obviously gonna be something which I bet
it<00:06:55.900> makes<00:06:56.050> like<00:06:56.260> my<00:06:56.710> steps<00:06:57.190> and<00:06:57.520> leather<00:06:58.020> yeah
