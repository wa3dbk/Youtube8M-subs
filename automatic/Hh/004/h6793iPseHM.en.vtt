00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.620 
consider what's the essential takeaway
for<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.950> course<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.330> absolute

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
for the course what is the absolute

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.840 
for the course what is the absolute
minimum<00:00:16.080> thing<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.949> we<00:00:17.070> want<00:00:17.279> students<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
minimum thing that we want students to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.460 
minimum thing that we want students to
be<00:00:18.000> able<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.300> do<00:00:18.510> at<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.960> end<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> course

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
lower level of cognitive skills so we

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.640 
lower level of cognitive skills so we
don't<00:00:24.060> want<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.630> focus<00:00:24.900> on<00:00:25.260> memorization

types<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.609> facts<00:00:27.420> or<00:00:27.779> things<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.410> but

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
types of facts or things like that but

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.550 
types of facts or things like that but
having<00:00:29.160> students<00:00:29.699> actually<00:00:30.330> know<00:00:30.570> how<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.260> do

these<00:00:34.290> kind<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.620> deeper<00:00:34.920> cognitive<00:00:35.399> skills<00:00:35.700> we

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
these kind of deeper cognitive skills we

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.330 
these kind of deeper cognitive skills we
want<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.960> focus<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.440> observable<00:00:37.860> skills<00:00:38.190> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
want to focus on observable skills and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.369 
want to focus on observable skills and
behavior<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.059> say<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:40.050> people<00:00:40.230> should

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
behavior we can say that people should

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.709 
behavior we can say that people should
know<00:00:40.770> something<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.910> how<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.300> they<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
know something but how are they going to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.930 
know something but how are they going to
be<00:00:42.840> able<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.110> demonstrate<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.760> other

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
be able to demonstrate that the other

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.760 
be able to demonstrate that the other
great<00:00:45.300> thing<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.719> want<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.989> consider<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
great thing we want to consider is to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.590 
great thing we want to consider is to
communicate<00:00:46.980> clear<00:00:47.550> expectations<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
communicate clear expectations to the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.299 
communicate clear expectations to the
students<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.860> they<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:50.100> what's

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
students so that they know what's

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.459 
students so that they know what's
expected<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.780> finally<00:00:52.320> we

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
expected of them and then finally we

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.080 
expected of them and then finally we
want<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:52.800> things<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.309> capable<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.910> being

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
want these things to be capable of being

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.700 
want these things to be capable of being
assessed<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.780> other<00:00:54.930> words<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.620> be

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
assessed in other words they have to be

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.490 
assessed in other words they have to be
measurable

here's<00:00:58.500> Bloom's<00:00:58.859> taxonomy<00:00:59.090> that<00:01:00.090> kind<00:01:00.629> of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
here's Bloom's taxonomy that kind of

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.900 
here's Bloom's taxonomy that kind of
looks<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.140> higher<00:01:01.770> versus<00:01:02.340> lower<00:01:02.550> order

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
looks at higher versus lower order

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.200 
looks at higher versus lower order
thinking<00:01:02.940> skills<00:01:03.890> at<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.460> lower<00:01:05.640> level<00:01:06.090> is

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
thinking skills at the lower level is

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
thinking skills at the lower level is
just<00:01:06.240> pure<00:01:06.810> knowledge<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.380> remembering<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.850> go

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
just pure knowledge or remembering we go

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.060 
just pure knowledge or remembering we go
up<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.240> comprehension<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.960> understanding

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
up to comprehension and understanding

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.920 
up to comprehension and understanding
and<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> highest<00:01:11.850> levels<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.689> things

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and at the highest levels we have things

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.740 
and at the highest levels we have things
like<00:01:13.020> analysis<00:01:13.770> synthesis<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.549> evaluation

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
like analysis synthesis and evaluation

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.410 
like analysis synthesis and evaluation
actually<00:01:15.750> creating<00:01:16.259> things<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:17.330> always<00:01:18.330> like

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
actually creating things I always like

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.510 
actually creating things I always like
to<00:01:18.780> look<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.080> some<00:01:19.110> verbs<00:01:19.530> too<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.189> put

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
to look at some verbs too to put

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.999 
to look at some verbs too to put
together<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:21.030> learning<00:01:21.390> outcomes<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.830> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
together my learning outcomes so this is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.880 
together my learning outcomes so this is
a<00:01:23.040> nice<00:01:23.340> little<00:01:23.670> table<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.570> what<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> does<00:01:25.650> is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
a nice little table and what it does is

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
a nice little table and what it does is
it<00:01:26.040> gives<00:01:26.220> some<00:01:26.520> possible<00:01:27.030> verbs<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.659> use

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
it gives some possible verbs you can use

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.170 
it gives some possible verbs you can use
in<00:01:28.229> developing<00:01:28.680> your<00:01:28.829> outcomes<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.640> kind<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
in developing your outcomes that kind of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.420 
in developing your outcomes that kind of
address<00:01:30.509> Bloom's<00:01:31.290> various<00:01:31.860> levels<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
address Bloom's various levels of the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.690 
address Bloom's various levels of the
taxonomy<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.740> you're<00:01:34.979> interested<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.520> just

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
taxonomy so if you're interested in just

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.520 
taxonomy so if you're interested in just
very<00:01:36.000> low<00:01:36.270> level<00:01:36.630> skills<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.140> might<00:01:37.290> ask

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
very low level skills you might ask

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.679 
very low level skills you might ask
people<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.920> define<00:01:38.400> something<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.180> describe

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
people to define something or describe

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.840 
people to define something or describe
it<00:01:39.869> or<00:01:40.020> list<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:42.560> up<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:43.979> higher<00:01:44.220> perhaps

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
it or list it up a little higher perhaps

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.819 
it or list it up a little higher perhaps
in<00:01:45.149> application<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.079> might<00:01:46.200> ask<00:01:46.500> them<00:01:46.710> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
in application you might ask them to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.440 
in application you might ask them to
calculate<00:01:47.070> or<00:01:47.520> apply<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.780> practice<00:01:49.350> predict

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
calculate or apply to practice predict

calculate or apply to practice predict
at<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.530> analysis<00:01:53.130> level<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.729> might<00:01:53.880> have

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
at the analysis level you might have

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.780 
at the analysis level you might have
people<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:54.990> able<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.290> distinguish<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.549> to

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.980 

at<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.399> synthesis<00:02:02.939> level<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.390> might<00:02:03.570> ask<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
at the synthesis level we might ask the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.990 
at the synthesis level we might ask the
students<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.560> formulate<00:02:05.100> something<00:02:05.460> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
students to formulate something to

and<00:02:10.179> at<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.079> highest<00:02:11.319> level<00:02:11.799> we<00:02:11.950> have<00:02:12.129> kind<00:02:12.370> of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
and at the highest level we have kind of

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.670 
and at the highest level we have kind of
a<00:02:12.549> critical<00:02:13.030> evaluation<00:02:13.269> level<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.319> in<00:02:14.530> that

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
a critical evaluation level and in that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.259 
a critical evaluation level and in that
case<00:02:14.829> we<00:02:15.069> might<00:02:15.250> ask<00:02:15.489> people<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:15.879> appraise

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
case we might ask people to appraise

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.350 
case we might ask people to appraise
things<00:02:16.689> assess<00:02:17.170> them<00:02:17.439> critique<00:02:17.890> them<00:02:18.360> measure

now<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.560> structure<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.159> learning<00:02:24.430> outcome

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
now the structure of a learning outcome

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.759 
now the structure of a learning outcome
is<00:02:25.000> important<00:02:25.870> there<00:02:26.230> are<00:02:26.349> certain<00:02:26.739> things

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
is important there are certain things

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.729 
is important there are certain things
that<00:02:27.099> we<00:02:27.220> absolutely<00:02:27.640> want<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.060> specify<00:02:28.439> in<00:02:29.439> a

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
that we absolutely want to specify in a

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.830 
that we absolutely want to specify in a
learning<00:02:30.069> outcome<00:02:30.189> it<00:02:31.120> will<00:02:31.239> have<00:02:31.390> an<00:02:31.510> actor

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
learning outcome it will have an actor

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.440 
learning outcome it will have an actor
generally<00:02:32.379> that<00:02:32.500> will<00:02:32.620> be<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.859> student<00:02:33.450> it

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
generally that will be the student it

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.690 
generally that will be the student it
will<00:02:34.599> have<00:02:34.780> an<00:02:34.930> observable<00:02:35.439> behavior<00:02:36.189> so

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
will have an observable behavior so

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.640 
will have an observable behavior so
that's<00:02:36.909> usually<00:02:37.209> what<00:02:38.140> you're<00:02:38.260> asking<00:02:38.620> them

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
that's usually what you're asking them

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.330 
that's usually what you're asking them
to<00:02:38.799> do

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
to do

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.119 
to do
that's<00:02:40.120> your<00:02:40.299> verb<00:02:40.569> typically<00:02:41.200> an<00:02:41.440> object<00:02:42.010> of

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
that's your verb typically an object of

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.860 
that's your verb typically an object of
the<00:02:42.250> behavior<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.030> that's<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.690> object

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
the behavior so that's the object

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.410 
the behavior so that's the object
generally<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.680> verb<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.970> also<00:02:46.120> need<00:02:46.389> a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
generally of the verb you also need a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.030 
generally of the verb you also need a
criterion<00:02:47.019> level<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.440> don't<00:02:47.590> want<00:02:47.739> people<00:02:47.980> to

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
criterion level you don't want people to

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.770 
criterion level you don't want people to
just<00:02:48.220> do<00:02:48.489> something<00:02:48.790> any<00:02:49.120> old<00:02:49.329> way<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.599> want

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
just do something any old way you want

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.629 
just do something any old way you want
them<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.109> do<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.349> well<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.220> what<00:02:51.459> are<00:02:51.549> the

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
them to do it well and so what are the

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.520 
them to do it well and so what are the
criteria<00:02:51.760> by<00:02:52.389> which<00:02:52.420> we're<00:02:52.810> going<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.079> judge

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
criteria by which we're going to judge

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.890 
criteria by which we're going to judge
them<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.099> then<00:02:54.819> finally<00:02:55.090> what<00:02:55.389> conditions

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
them and then finally what conditions

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.899 
them and then finally what conditions
under<00:02:56.439> which<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.829> behavior<00:02:57.010> shall<00:02:57.549> occur

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
under which the behavior shall occur

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.750 
under which the behavior shall occur
that<00:02:58.629> might<00:02:58.810> be<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.019> time<00:02:59.439> frame<00:02:59.889> it<00:03:00.370> might<00:03:00.579> be

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that might be a time frame it might be

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.809 
that might be a time frame it might be
