00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
application rate is actually a quarter

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.540 
application rate is actually a quarter
dosage<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:49.959> what<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.290> full<00:02:50.500> dosage<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:51.100> so

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
lower viscosity so it'll be a little

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.400 
lower viscosity so it'll be a little
easier

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
easier

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.100 
easier
but<00:04:56.890> anyways<00:04:57.160> this<00:04:57.340> was<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.580> really<00:04:58.150> thick<00:04:58.600> gel

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
but anyways this was a really thick gel

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.750 
but anyways this was a really thick gel
when<00:04:59.410> we<00:04:59.590> came<00:04:59.770> into<00:04:59.980> the<00:05:00.040> shot<00:05:00.340> this<00:05:00.520> works

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
when we came into the shot this works

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.700 
when we came into the shot this works
was<00:05:01.000> about<00:05:01.150> 50<00:05:01.450> degrees<00:05:01.540> all<00:05:02.290> we<00:05:02.470> did<00:05:02.590> was

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
was about 50 degrees all we did was

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.410 
was about 50 degrees all we did was
allow<00:05:02.920> this<00:05:03.100> to<00:05:03.280> warm<00:05:03.490> up<00:05:03.760> slightly<00:05:04.180> above

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
allow this to warm up slightly above

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.790 
allow this to warm up slightly above
room<00:05:04.450> temperature<00:05:04.690> and<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:05.320> want<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.560> show<00:05:05.740> you

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
room temperature and I want to show you

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.120 
room temperature and I want to show you
how<00:05:06.640> thin<00:05:06.970> it<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.180> once<00:05:07.480> it<00:05:07.630> warms<00:05:08.560> up<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:08.890> room

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
how thin it is once it warms up to room

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
how thin it is once it warms up to room
temperature<00:05:11.010> so<00:05:12.010> this<00:05:12.190> is<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.520> super<00:05:12.910> clean

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
temperature so this is the super clean

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.790 
temperature so this is the super clean
neem<00:05:13.450> as<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:15.550> can<00:05:15.760> see<00:05:16.000> here<00:05:16.450> it's<00:05:16.630> very<00:05:17.110> very

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
neem as you can see here it's very very

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.840 
neem as you can see here it's very very
very<00:05:18.280> clean<00:05:19.470> it's<00:05:20.470> almost<00:05:20.740> it's<00:05:21.490> definitely

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
very clean it's almost it's definitely

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.750 
very clean it's almost it's definitely
thinner<00:05:22.090> than<00:05:22.270> a<00:05:22.360> honey<00:05:22.600> almost<00:05:22.990> like<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.140> syrup

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.820
