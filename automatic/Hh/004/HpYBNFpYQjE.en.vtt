00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:09.260
 good original distribution kit reindeer 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:12.280
 k 4 m made in france as you can see there is 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.280
 we have the original runs 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.890
 we have the fixed tensor that has some 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.570
 badges that you have to take them out 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.860
 time to do the distribution in this 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.400
 is the fixed as they come out next 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.620
 we have the mobile tensioner as you can see 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.190
 here 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.430
 the mobile 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.130
 and the crankshaft bolt that also 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.270
 it replaces when you do the distribution 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.940
 when we do the distribution too 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.680
 we have to take into account the replacement 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.050
 of the cylinder head plugs 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.380
 which is both the big one and the boy that 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.730
 it is indispensable for the moment of 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.920
 work of the liver trees as 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.590
 come here are two is a bigger one and it's 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.180
 a new guys 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.910
 another thing that we have to have in 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.590
 account is the moment when we make the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.200
 distribution change the polybial kit 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.300
 Why is this so important because 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.070
 this tensor that is here 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.119
 this is the free- form mobile tensor 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.590
 as you can see there you see the tensioner 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.530
 see as full billy but so 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.270
 general bends and if it bends to simple 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.400
 seen you can see that the belt works 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.350
 wrong and if the belt works poorly it can be 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.770
 detach and can be rolled up in the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.080
 distribution we also have in the kit 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.240
 the corresponding strap with the measurement 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.320
 corresponding as you can see five 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.380
 small 747 and we also have the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.770
 fixed roller kit 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.880
 of poly now let's show the bomb 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.189
 of water 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.590
 as in the water pump is original re 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.630
 is not the one we recommend in which 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.939
 we put advantage these leave as 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.590
 comes and comes with the sheet metal seal 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.140
 brings a plastic seal like the others 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.630
 this board does not carry good sealant 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.820
 I hope you also know that if they have 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.979
 a sandero carries the same kit 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.310
 distribution the same plugs but 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.819
 varies to whether or what would be the measure 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.049
 of the poly belt sees nothing but good 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.829
 I hope you learn information 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.829
 see you later
