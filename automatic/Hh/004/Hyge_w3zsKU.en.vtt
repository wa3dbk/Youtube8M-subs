00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
it and if I go if I'm going through my

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.110 
it and if I go if I'm going through my
second<00:05:13.170> set<00:05:13.380> very<00:05:14.040> easily<00:05:14.310> in<00:05:14.670> the<00:05:14.700> same<00:05:14.970> spot

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
second set very easily in the same spot

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.930 
second set very easily in the same spot
I<00:05:15.480> don't<00:05:15.810> use<00:05:15.990> my<00:05:16.020> second<00:05:16.620> set<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.040> that<00:05:17.760> way<00:05:17.910> I

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
I don't use my second set and that way I

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.780 
I don't use my second set and that way I
pretty<00:05:18.510> much<00:05:18.890> build<00:05:19.890> it<00:05:20.040> build<00:05:20.250> onto<00:05:20.430> it<00:05:20.730> and

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
pretty much build it build onto it and

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.520 
pretty much build it build onto it and
I'm<00:05:20.880> like<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:21.150> have<00:05:21.390> a<00:05:21.420> MOAB<00:05:21.780> possible<00:05:22.350> game

here so I'm just going to go for the

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.370 
here so I'm just going to go for the
Moab<00:05:23.970> even<00:05:24.600> though<00:05:24.690> i<00:05:24.720> don't<00:05:24.810> really<00:05:24.990> upload

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
Moab even though i don't really upload

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.540 
Moab even though i don't really upload
those<00:05:25.530> Moab's<00:05:25.830> anymore<00:05:26.160> because<00:05:26.280> a<00:05:26.400> lot<00:05:26.490> of

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
those Moab's anymore because a lot of

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.340

people<00:05:26.640> didn't<00:05:26.970> like<00:05:27.030> them<00:05:27.390> because<00:05:28.080> they

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
people didn't like them because they

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.610 
people didn't like them because they
were<00:05:28.380> rather<00:05:28.620> campy<00:05:29.160> I<00:05:29.960> still<00:05:30.960> enjoy<00:05:31.170> doing<00:05:31.560> it

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620
