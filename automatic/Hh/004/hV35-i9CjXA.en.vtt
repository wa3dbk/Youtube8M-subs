00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 do not 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.840
 dear neighbors I am great the life of your 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.830
 candidate for councilor color 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.299
 I graduated right in university of 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.950
 development and I realized my practice 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.539
 professional in the corporation of 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.460
 judicial assistance of our commune 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.320
 all my life I have felt a great 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.760
 vocation for public service in the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.380
 which I was able to develop and learn 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.850
 a lot of working and collaborating 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.380
 foundations as it is in the case of the 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.450
 international foundation new leaders 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.290
 where we develop workshops entities 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.780
 to promote entrepreneurship 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.730
 development of our young people I have 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.890
 assumed the challenge of this candidate to 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.879
 councilman and I know how difficult it is to apply 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.220
 to this position as a candidate 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.230
 independent man I'm convinced of 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.610
 that council work is to say be 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.220
 at the service of neighbors and not of 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.630
 political interests of any sector 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.310
 I have great ideas for our community 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.170
 especially in terms of security 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.340
 where my project is the increase the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.989
 municipal surveillance system 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.180
 especially the access avenue of the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.890
 commune and in parallel coordinate a 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.930
 efficient system that really works 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.760
 with regard to the coordination of 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.739
 the carabineros neighbors and security 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.989
 citizen the leonine and are missing 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.509
 Carabineros and there must be at least one 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.280
 holding pair as they would be more now in 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.840
 matter of urban growth I think that 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.280
 this to be very regulated 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.619
 not affect the concept of as a 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.509
 redemption of lohan this year will demand that 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.039
 in each project organization the 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.380
 existence of green areas and spaces 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.789
 for the family sport I think the 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.009
 mayor felipe guevara with whom 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.539
 we share the same ideas has been a 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.679
 great mayor just like our 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.329
 great parliamentarians cristiÃ¡n 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.549
 monckeberg and ernesto silva so 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.959
 would be a great collaborator of 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.520
 work equipment that allows us 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.649
 produce visible changes for our 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.959
 neighbors I want to ask from the estate 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.670

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.609
 they will always be open to work 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.989
 with the neighbors I will be the best friend of 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.610

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:46.159

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.450
 of the work of the organized community 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.099
 I know it 's a great feeling that I can 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.659
 win and show that councilors do not 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.280
 they must be political positions neither 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.840
 they should waste money the way 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.159
 embarrassing that a lot are doing what 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.739

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.560
