I<00:03:23.670> like<00:03:24.360> ABS<00:03:24.900> brakes<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.440> gives<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.769> the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
I like ABS brakes it gives you the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.800 
I like ABS brakes it gives you the
ability<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.459> brake<00:03:26.819> and<00:03:27.030> steer<00:03:27.360> so<00:03:27.720> you

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
ability to brake and steer so you

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.839 
ability to brake and steer so you
actually<00:03:28.260> can<00:03:28.440> avoid<00:03:28.799> an<00:03:29.159> accident<00:03:29.700> by

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
actually can avoid an accident by

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.119 
actually can avoid an accident by
steering<00:03:30.420> out<00:03:30.599> of<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.900> instead<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.530> sliding

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
steering out of it instead of sliding

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.030 
steering out of it instead of sliding
straight<00:03:32.849> into<00:03:33.360> whatever<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.409> in<00:03:34.620> front<00:03:34.890> of

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
straight into whatever it is in front of

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.490 
straight into whatever it is in front of
you<00:03:35.190> it's<00:03:35.400> skidding<00:03:36.030> at<00:03:36.180> all<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:36.900> that's<00:03:37.319> why

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
you it's skidding at all so that's why

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500 
you it's skidding at all so that's why
we<00:03:37.709> like<00:03:37.860> ABS<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.549> pumps<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:38.909> brakes<00:03:39.209> and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
we like ABS it pumps the brakes and

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.089 
we like ABS it pumps the brakes and
