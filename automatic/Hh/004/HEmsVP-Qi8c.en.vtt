00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.540
 the bay of mine did not win his bet a month ago he is managing the 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.410
 Sochaux very disappointed to finish second to five seconds of Jose barbara had 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.020
 promised to return to the area to take revenge this weekend all the 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.440
 world was waiting for duel data barbara 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.560
 but the driver of the 205 gti despite a good recovery from 4th to 2nd place 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.970
 failed to worry the winner 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.080
 on the lily barbara is at home he knows all the pitfalls of the course 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.719
 and despite the rain although the porsche was 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.050
 we listen on five cylinders he managed to keep his opponents to 

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:38.690
 fifty seconds for the second time 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.649
 fabien de mm 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.789
 so had to settle for 2nd place think I'm still going a very 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.530
 good pilot you must not take it away 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.530
 but for the party of the realistic song failure 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.360
 it has been dropped despite all today% and still do 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.810
 back scratch time so I do not know the sex and the most serious in c but he 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.010
 is hot more than ever have been disadvantaged 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.890
 I announced my arrival I want and give back the barbara were 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.520
 reconciled on the podium a podium that could have been the same project years 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.549
 if rené delaunay and greenhouse 5 turbo had been able to finish after winning this 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.270
 special air had to give up in the last loop of the rally leaving 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.409
 the third place to a porsche that of parisian michel nourry 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.230
 they take back the cars of the series the fight for the places of honor did not 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.520
 concerned that r5 gt turbo that of olive flying more here than a seventh 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.950
 that of Sylvain Bourdon 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.700
 of mauritian bernard but none of the three could catch up philippe lefèvre 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.320
 he finished in the top five after winning a special stage 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 barbara le fevre a rally regular it's bingo 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.880
 early I was used to a little bit in e com 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.740
 a success to the soloist what the ua like three years I did 3rd scratch 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.410
 behind March 27 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.170
 r5 gt turbo is a car that goes very very well on the water 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.190
 you had 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.730
 i think it takes ten sion an ethics 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.670
 he is more favorable to finish in fourth place but in the last 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.680
 loop was outpaced by 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.279
 try opel manta 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.969
 this seventh edition because of the cost was a big success both the 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.900
 130 competitors at the start than the public 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.279
 despite the rain and a lot 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:17.639
 the world yesterday on the course 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.459
 the organizers even had to cancel the last special just because 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.729
 that there were too many people 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.729
 for both 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.479
