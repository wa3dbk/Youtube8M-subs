dry<00:02:59.180> form<00:02:59.480> though<00:02:59.860> that's<00:03:00.860> another<00:03:01.010> reason

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
dry form though that's another reason

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.009

form because then you can see the ending

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.850 
form because then you can see the ending
cutscene<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.819> world<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.620> Souris<00:03:06.620> dry
