00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.570
 minecraft 1.7 point 2 and this is very 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.269
 critters and what is this mod so this 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.040
 way it's going to add a lot of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.160
 creatures and when a button came it 's a 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.760
 bunch of creatures to our world 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.800
 from dragonlets that we can create and 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.970
 fly with them zebras horses that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.740
 we can create to give us offspring 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.220
 goats tigers bears two rabbits 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.620
 crabs 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:40.480
 panthers a lot a lot bunch of 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:44.680
 bugs and well now I do remember how 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.840
 the world was put on at night it is worth 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.160
 in set 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.160
 to fast mode 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.649
 and good guys if you have seen a cut 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.140
 it's because I had the game mode in 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.420
 Peaceful and I did not get the bugs 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.300
 as you can see here there are a lot of 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.250
 creatures there from zombie horses 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.020
 horses skeleton bat horses 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.710
 this golem of emeralds there is 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.990
 diamond and gold that more than more achievements 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.890
 for example this shoulder gives you 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.200
 to kill him drinks and diana be careful 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.260
 because they destroy the walls that are in 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.080
 house they enter and that maybe here there 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.140
 there was an attachment a hammer to the ground and 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.200
 has burst fire just as the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.530
 Blue diamonds are worth you get a 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.530
 diamonds 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.790
 and more creatures than more werewolves 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.170
 werewolves 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:52.330
 I'm going to put three there are for the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.670
 can become can night is 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.970
 here at night because they are transformed 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.010
 because days become human 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.000
 and beige this has become a 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.000
 man then brown 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.530
 black white or there is not fire me 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.840
 level of these that pick up objects from 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.420
 floor squares and you throw them like this 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.120
 Clear 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.060
 and good as you can see is a very, very, very, very 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.020
 very spacious 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.020
 not 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.319
 that I do not finish is that I was seeing that 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.470
 here was to see rock that these are the 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.019
 coles is worth destroying give you the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.690
 objects that break I do not know if they have 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.120
 arranged the water thing because before you 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.280
 they gave little squares of lava and water to the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.880
 quite interesting time 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.120
 and good as you can see is a huge nickname that 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.010
 of a bunch and a lot of creatures that 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.840
 you can create you can play with them 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.660
 you can do what you want and 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.550
 you can do a lot and a lot of things 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.340
 so now I'm going to move on to how it 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.069
 install vale is to say is that there is a couple 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.900
 of things you need to play him 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.420
 it's worth two files that will be in the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.420
 description and see you now 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.350

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.430
 It works a group motorcycle connect two 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.680

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.959

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.600

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.160

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.410
 to our start button and pressing the 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.110
 windows button is worth so here 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.880
 we write both percent app so much 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.970
 percent 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.910

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.160
 simply 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.970
 once done that you close in three a 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.970

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.810
