so this is the first tutorial on how to
use<00:00:04.319> make<00:00:04.859> my<00:00:05.069> 3d<00:00:05.520> so<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.839> can<00:00:07.319> allow<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.189> to

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
use make my 3d so I can allow you to

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.870 
use make my 3d so I can allow you to
hear<00:00:12.080> so<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.469> all<00:00:13.620> your<00:00:13.799> shows<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.460> the

can switch on or off switch off right
okay<00:02:00.680> this<00:02:01.680> menu<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.369> col-<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.140> first

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
okay this menu is a col- so the first

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.670 
okay this menu is a col- so the first
one<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.460> background<00:02:06.170> for<00:02:07.170> changing

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
one is for the background for changing

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.730 
one is for the background for changing
the<00:02:08.039> background<00:02:08.220> color<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.660> second<00:02:09.959> one<00:02:10.170> is

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
the background color the second one is

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.450 
the background color the second one is
or<00:02:10.800> changing<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.580> color<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.840> head<00:02:13.460> the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
or changing the color of the head the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.580 
or changing the color of the head the
other<00:02:14.520> one<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.270> hair<00:02:15.540> took<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.650> glasses<00:02:16.920> etc

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
other one the hair took the glasses etc

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.910 
other one the hair took the glasses etc
so<00:02:19.590> i<00:02:19.950> will<00:02:20.310> show<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.580> some<00:02:21.170> deformation<00:02:22.170> so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
so i will show you some deformation so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.040 
so i will show you some deformation so
for<00:02:23.130> example<00:02:23.900> here<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:26.600> increase<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.630> size

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
for example here I can increase the size

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.120 
for example here I can increase the size
of<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.560> highs<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.570> then<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.870> can<00:02:31.380> for<00:02:32.070> example

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
of the highs and then I can for example

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.430 
of the highs and then I can for example
this<00:02:32.550> one<00:02:34.880> ok<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:36.450> i<00:02:36.720> double<00:02:36.990> touch<00:02:37.290> the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
this one ok and if i double touch the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.270 
this one ok and if i double touch the
screen<00:02:37.650> i<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.340> enter<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.840> view<00:02:40.080> mode<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.680> i

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
screen i can enter the view mode and i

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.620 
screen i can enter the view mode and i
can<00:02:41.490> rotate<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.810> head<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:44.190> can<00:02:44.370> see<00:02:44.520> that

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
can rotate the head and you can see that

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.700 
can rotate the head and you can see that
the<00:02:46.250> geometric<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:48.180> deformation<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.050> in

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
the geometric the deformation is in

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:58.300 
the geometric the deformation is in
three

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.620 

ok<00:02:59.090> so<00:02:59.150> now<00:02:59.540> i<00:02:59.810> will<00:03:00.140> add<00:03:00.800> some<00:03:01.310> hair<00:03:02.300> for

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
ok so now i will add some hair for

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:11.110 
ok so now i will add some hair for
example<00:03:04.209> like<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:05.270> one<00:03:07.030> okay<00:03:08.030> here<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:10.120> you

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
example like this one okay here and you
