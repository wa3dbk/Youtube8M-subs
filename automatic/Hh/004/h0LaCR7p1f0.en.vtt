simple one it's something that's holding
its<00:03:34.069> form<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:35.560> little<00:03:36.560> bit<00:03:36.769> of<00:03:36.860> vanilla<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.900> we

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
its form a little bit of vanilla and we

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.759 
its form a little bit of vanilla and we
just<00:03:39.080> fold<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.410> in<00:03:39.440> as<00:03:39.590> well

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
just fold it in as well

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:40.990 
just fold it in as well
what<00:03:39.920> you're<00:03:40.010> looking<00:03:40.250> for<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.610> see<00:03:40.819> as<00:03:40.910> you

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
what you're looking for you see as you

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.570 
what you're looking for you see as you
fold<00:03:41.209> it's<00:03:41.420> like<00:03:41.510> softly<00:03:42.110> whipped<00:03:42.350> cream<00:03:42.739> but

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
fold it's like softly whipped cream but

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.920 
fold it's like softly whipped cream but
because<00:03:43.940> it's<00:03:44.090> got<00:03:44.209> the<00:03:44.300> condensed<00:03:44.540> milk<00:03:44.630> in

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
because it's got the condensed milk in

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.710 
because it's got the condensed milk in
it<00:03:45.050> just<00:03:45.650> about<00:03:45.980> sticks<00:03:46.850> to<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.120> spoon<00:03:47.300> slot

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
it just about sticks to the spoon slot

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.680 
it just about sticks to the spoon slot
or<00:03:48.019> okay<00:03:48.560> so<00:03:48.830> they<00:03:48.890> just<00:03:49.220> flop<00:03:49.459> kind<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.209> just

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
or okay so they just flop kind of just

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.560 
or okay so they just flop kind of just
just<00:03:51.110> you're<00:03:51.260> popular<00:03:52.190> for<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.489> cream<00:03:52.730> and

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
just you're popular for the cream and

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.000 
just you're popular for the cream and
then<00:03:53.690> if<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.870> grab<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.200> blueberries<00:03:54.709> and

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
then if you grab the blueberries and

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.840 
then if you grab the blueberries and
basically<00:03:55.430> just<00:03:55.850> dot<00:03:56.150> them<00:03:56.500> over<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.850> into

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
basically just dot them over and into

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.490 
basically just dot them over and into
that<00:03:59.150> mixture<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:02.269> this<00:04:02.450> is<00:04:02.690> just<00:04:02.959> more<00:04:03.140> dark

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
that mixture so this is just more dark

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.140
