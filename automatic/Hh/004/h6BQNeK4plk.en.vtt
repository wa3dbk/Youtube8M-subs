 Route is a piston from the front mountain trail to the summit 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:27.750

 I arrived at the entrance of the summit square for 2 hours from the departure 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:36.690

 Turn on the alcohol lamp and heat it 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:59.760
 It is a sign of boiling if bubbles are attached to the filter chain

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:09.080
