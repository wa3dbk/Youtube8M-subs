00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 touching letter from a fan of 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.990
 independent the first time I had the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.210
 feeling that my old man was dying was 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.150
 going to see red rodolfo so 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.980
 he called he was a journalist and many parties 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.590
 in the booths next door the rapporteurs of 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.380
 radios or in luxurious stalls but in 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.689
 1980 the hand came different the old 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.130
 I was not working in the media 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.689
 We lived with the just to top 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.340
 journalist lacked the brightness of the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.199
 profession 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.489
 the once recognized scribe and jefazo 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.760
 now he was selling alfajores turrones and 4370 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.430
 it is possible that I with 11 in shanties 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.280
 years have insisted on going to the court is 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.890
 On the hot December day we took the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.559
 bondi avellaneda arriving at the box office 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.239
 I saw the old man facing the line of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.540
 the popular one I understood that it was what 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.460
 I could 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.690
 suddenly I saw him came out of that tide of 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.940
 last minute shoppers are going 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 this is not for us he told me no longer 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.809
 it was what it had been did not open 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.820
 the doors of the cabins did not reach 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.119
 buy two stalls a few blocks 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.970
 my old man stopped his walk he looked at me and I 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.909
 he said wait a second what's wrong with you 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.520
 I said I do not feel very well anymore 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.899
 I'm not sure why but December 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.930
 something told me that my old man was 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:21.400
 dying and I was many years 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.700
 after very depressed 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.410
 rodolfo left a year and a half later I 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.790
 he left a handful of invaluable things on 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.200
 taste for history the passion for 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.860
 reading the pleasure of a good game 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.180
 of chess and of course the black palate of 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.820
 independent fan 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.520
 rodolfo used to come with a candy me 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.090
 I gave it to him and he told me he sent it to you 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.730
 independent sometimes instead of a 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.160
 candy brings an aspirin before me 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.520
 look of disgust I answered you send it 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:56.050
 Mr. racing the old man left in June 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.430
 for the chance of 1982 it did not reach 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.050
 see the goal of percudani to liverpool 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.460
 neither did he live that afternoon in which 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.040
 we left champions in front of a racing that 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.600
 He descended but his life was full of 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.930
 Olympic rounds of glory exploits 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.840
 international that was full 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.459
 I write this in full agony unless 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.080
 that works a miracle in three weeks 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.950
 we will have been at the same time 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.180
 for my old man appears in costume 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.500
 wrapped in a red flag tell me that 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.540
 all this is an aspirin that sent me 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.100
 Mr. racing if you can not go back 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.730
 I understand it's time to bank me the only 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.650
 I will be worthy even if I notice you secretly 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.850
 lola I will mourn little old ciao 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.900
 rests in the non-existent sky of the 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.880
 atheists someday let's go back this 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.170
 wrote luciano frees 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.300
 Rodolfo's son clicks independently 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.000
 curiously it touched me loyal and it is also 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.500
 alive 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.500
 is 66 years old 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.519
 and for him 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.519
 my mouth license when reality 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.790
 I had started my football passion for 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.379
 another team 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.909
 I swear I did not even think 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.700
 to get excited like that the thing that luckily 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:14.840
 one can not and does not want to drive 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.930
 and as long as things happen 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.719
 will be worth 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.989
 to do a radio program from 6 to 10 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.989
 in the morning
