PSN<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:23.939> down<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> service

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
PSN is down so if you have a service

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.020 
PSN is down so if you have a service
that<00:01:25.740> needs<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.310> done<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.909> probably

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that needs to be done that is probably

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.850 
that needs to be done that is probably
why<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> service<00:01:27.960> has<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.320> been<00:01:28.619> done

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
why the service has not been done

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.560 
why the service has not been done
because<00:01:29.130> i<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.520> actually<00:01:29.670> not<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.420> online

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
because i can actually not get online

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.270 
because i can actually not get online
and<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> service<00:01:31.470> also<00:01:31.979> make<00:01:32.130> sure<00:01:32.159> to
