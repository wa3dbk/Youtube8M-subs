00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.080
 the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.849
 the future of laren the context of rotterdam 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.509
 and the sixth national title range of Bloemendaal 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.509
 welcome to the rabo hockey journal from Monday 9 May 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.529
 Sunday the east German star of laren played one last 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.789
 competition in the rabo main class 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.050
 loek turner and and that in one go a next season not back in the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.939
 throw you because of the Olympic preparation of a jet 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.980
 also this through one that was no longer there on Sunday and that became it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.810
 sat on the side with a broken ankle since November 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.060
 won't wear the true shirt next season 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.320
 how will laren fill this gap that the aussies leave behind 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.490
 with own youth 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.060
 that seems unlikely 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.550
 boys a one does not play nationwide 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.500
 with the aussies from the b category top players from the international shake 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.830
 had seen then 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.280
 that doesn't seem like an option either 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.310
 because coach roelant oltmans prefers to work only with the top players 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.990
 the dutch toppers then 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.220
 that could be 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.530
 the rumors are that there will be an urgent call with various 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.710
 main class players 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.750
 but whether or not toppers are in between all the big names are fixed until 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.980
 and with london 2012 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.150
 it seems likely that next season in laren there will only be sub-top players 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.150
 to admire 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.250
 the interim departure of coach Caroline van Nieuwenhuizen has the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.770
 women of rotterdam no harm 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.470
 due to the victory on Sunday in the away match against pinokÃ©, the team is on an equal score 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.190
 updated with number 9 June 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.680
 and all thanks to the interim group laid the palau 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.460
 under whose leadership three prizes have already been won 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.290
 which once again proved that the shock effect works in the short term 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 incidentally, the chance that rotterdam will pass by is very small 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.720
 play themselves against ssc on Sunday while the Amsterdam competitor plays against relegant 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.360
 hagen said plays 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.130
 but one thing is certain 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.420
 Rotterdam is completely ready for the promotion relegation fight against 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.700
 best number 2 in the transition class 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.270
 the main classification for rotterdam therefore seems safe thanks to albrecht 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.270
 asked 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.389
 Saturday, May 14, the men's playoffs for the national championship start 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.870
 Amsterdam poses is one of the semi-final posters, the other is Bloemendaal 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.799
 Rotterdam 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.299
 and it must go crazy if Bloemendaal is confronted by a maximum of three 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.649
 competitions do not win 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:29.019
 Because Bloemendaal they know more and more about five national titles in a row 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:29.989
 winning is 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.900
 so in dead rising and thomas left boerma in friday 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.189
 May number of highlight en record 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.419
 we therefore put our money in a flower pot 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.829
 also it is only to satisfy those who were not 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.529
 the injured Australian star told Twitter the editors of 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.820
 hockey.nl an advantage 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.689
 compared to his club 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.260
 do want to know where you warn us with our 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.409
 predictions are often wrong 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:55.149
 until next week
