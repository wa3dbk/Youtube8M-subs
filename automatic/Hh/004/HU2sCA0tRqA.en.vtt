show<00:01:38.040> he<00:01:38.250> was<00:01:38.460> inspiring

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.140 

and<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.040> course<00:01:50.250> that's<00:01:50.400> one<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> things

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
and of course that's one of the things

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.170 
and of course that's one of the things
that<00:01:51.390> gives<00:01:52.200> such<00:01:52.409> wonderful<00:01:52.830> continuity<00:01:53.460> is

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that gives such wonderful continuity is

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.940 
that gives such wonderful continuity is
that<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:56.930> outside<00:01:57.930> comes<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.500> into<00:01:58.830> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that the outside comes on into the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.749 
that the outside comes on into the
inside<00:01:59.570> these<00:02:00.570> screen<00:02:00.990> patterns<00:02:01.580> move<00:02:02.580> from

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
inside these screen patterns move from

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.370 
inside these screen patterns move from
the<00:02:02.850> outside<00:02:03.180> windows<00:02:03.570> into<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> inside

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the outside windows into the inside

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.820 
the outside windows into the inside
screens<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.780> get<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> continuity<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
screens so you get a continuity the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.729 
screens so you get a continuity the
outside<00:02:08.280> into<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> inside<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.750> then<00:02:10.649> of

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
outside into the inside and then of

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:21.220 
outside into the inside and then of
course<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.130> use<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.520> glass<00:02:11.790> all<00:02:12.180> around

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.460

and the vaulted ceiling that a ad in

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:37.570 
and the vaulted ceiling that a ad in
there<00:02:25.630> makes<00:02:26.630> an<00:02:26.780> interesting<00:02:26.959> form

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.310

drawings and they kind of fall down when

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.650 
drawings and they kind of fall down when

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
in reality but this house is so dramatic

in reality but this house is so dramatic
in<00:03:35.810> real<00:03:35.990> life<00:03:36.260> yes<00:03:37.160> it's<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:37.970> way<00:03:38.060> the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
in real life yes it's the way the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.910 
in real life yes it's the way the
plywood<00:03:38.630> is<00:03:38.750> everywhere<00:03:39.350> it's<00:03:39.500> used<00:03:39.740> I<00:03:39.890> mean

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
plywood is everywhere it's used I mean

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.090 
plywood is everywhere it's used I mean
it's<00:03:40.340> effectively<00:03:40.940> just<00:03:41.590> but<00:03:42.590> there's<00:03:42.800> a<00:03:42.890> real

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
it's effectively just but there's a real

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.890 
it's effectively just but there's a real
I<00:03:43.310> got<00:03:43.580> a<00:03:43.610> real<00:03:43.820> sense<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.330> peace<00:03:44.660> in

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
I got a real sense of peace in

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.990 
I got a real sense of peace in
themselves<00:03:45.260> too<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.860> think<00:03:46.250> because<00:03:46.820> of<00:03:46.850> the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
themselves too I think because of the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.570 
themselves too I think because of the
unity<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:48.050> in<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.260> floor<00:03:48.500> space<00:03:48.920> I<00:03:49.370> like

unity of it in the floor space I like

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:59.200
