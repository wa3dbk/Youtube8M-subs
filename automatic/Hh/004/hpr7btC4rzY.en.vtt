in a little bit here but i'm also using

in a little bit here but i'm also using
something<00:00:35.579> kind<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.480> unique<00:00:36.809> if<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.440> at

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
something kind of unique if you look at

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.490 
something kind of unique if you look at
my<00:00:37.739> my<00:00:38.280> brightness<00:00:38.610> level<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.239> my<00:00:39.360> options<00:00:39.840> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
my my brightness level of my options you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
my my brightness level of my options you
can<00:00:40.620> see<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.190> negative<00:00:41.940> fifty

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
can see that it is negative fifty

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.060 
can see that it is negative fifty
percent<00:00:42.660> now<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.440> normally

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
percent now this is not normally

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
percent now this is not normally
something<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.940> could<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.480> couldn't

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
something that you could do you couldn't

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.200 
something that you could do you couldn't
pull<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.050> down<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.710> far<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.640> little<00:00:47.879> slider

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
pull it down this far the little slider

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
pull it down this far the little slider
but<00:00:48.719> if<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:49.020> into<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.410> options<00:00:49.920> text<00:00:50.489> in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
but if you go into the options text in

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.520 
but if you go into the options text in
your<00:00:50.730> minecraft<00:00:51.149> bin<00:00:51.690> folder<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.379> can

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
your minecraft bin folder you can

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.590 
your minecraft bin folder you can
actually<00:00:52.680> change<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> gamma<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.850> i<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.480> it

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
actually change the gamma and i have it

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
actually change the gamma and i have it
at<00:00:54.719> negative<00:00:55.020> 0.5<00:00:55.860> which<00:00:56.129> puts<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.730> down

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
at negative 0.5 which puts it down

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.849 
at negative 0.5 which puts it down
pretty<00:00:57.239> dark<00:00:57.660> now<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.710> even

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
pretty dark now it's going to be even

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.889 
pretty dark now it's going to be even
harder<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.430> me<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.760> see<00:01:00.030> mob<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
harder for me to see mob so this is a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.310 
harder for me to see mob so this is a
bit<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.350> challenge<00:01:01.770> test<00:01:02.899> if<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.960> were<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
bit of a challenge test if you were to

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.350 
bit of a challenge test if you were to
go<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> negative<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> hundred<00:01:06.090> percent

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
go to negative like a hundred percent

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.510 
go to negative like a hundred percent
negative<00:01:06.990> 1<00:01:07.140> point<00:01:07.409> 0<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.070> almost

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
negative 1 point 0 it is almost

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490 
negative 1 point 0 it is almost
impossible<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.479> anything<00:01:09.600> that's<00:01:10.260> not

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
impossible to see anything that's not

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.679 
impossible to see anything that's not
like<00:01:10.979> more<00:01:11.549> than<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> couple<00:01:12.000> feet<00:01:12.330> ahead<00:01:12.510> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
like more than a couple feet ahead of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.530 
like more than a couple feet ahead of
you<00:01:12.930> from<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> torch<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:14.010> any<00:01:14.159> light<00:01:14.400> source<00:01:14.670> so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
you from a torch or any light source so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.210 
you from a torch or any light source so
it's<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:16.080> difficult<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.860> i'm<00:01:16.950> doing

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
it's really difficult but i'm doing

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.160 
it's really difficult but i'm doing
negative<00:01:17.369> fifty<00:01:18.150> percent<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:18.930> too

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
negative fifty percent so it's not too

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.810 
negative fifty percent so it's not too
dark<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.680> guys<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.189> we're<00:01:20.460> about<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> get

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
started here now this is a test to show

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.830 
started here now this is a test to show
just<00:01:23.340> how<00:01:23.430> difficult<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
just how difficult it can be with the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
just how difficult it can be with the
new<00:01:25.020> zombies<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.890> spot<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.369> from

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
hundreds of blocks away you can belt the

hundreds of blocks away you can belt the
skeletons<00:01:30.299> there's<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.750> bit<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.020> an

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.890 
exploit that i'm going to show you guys
that'll<00:01:32.850> probably<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.210> fixed<00:01:33.479> pretty<00:01:33.659> soon

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that'll probably get fixed pretty soon

difficulty things like regional
difficulty<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.310> basically<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:41.939> i

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
difficulty is now in so basically if i

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
difficulty is now in so basically if i

come after me so yeah the the darkness
is<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.640> making<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> game<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.630> lot<00:02:06.840> harder<00:02:07.110> now

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
is is making the game a lot harder now

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.469 
is is making the game a lot harder now
but<00:02:07.770> i'm<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.429> doing<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> make<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
but i'm just doing that for to make it a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.910 
but i'm just doing that for to make it a
little<00:02:09.599> bit<00:02:09.780> extra<00:02:09.899> spooky<00:02:10.500> because<00:02:10.590> i<00:02:10.770> can

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
little bit extra spooky because i can

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.010 
little bit extra spooky because i can
barely<00:02:11.129> see

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
barely see

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.510 
barely see
what's<00:02:12.320> coming<00:02:12.680> at<00:02:12.800> me<00:02:12.980> but<00:02:13.190> we're<00:02:13.340> going<00:02:13.460> to

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
what's coming at me but we're going to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.920 
what's coming at me but we're going to
do<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> little<00:02:14.000> test<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.480> see<00:02:14.570> how<00:02:14.630> long<00:02:14.810> you

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
do a little test and see how long you

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.990 
do a little test and see how long you
can<00:02:14.990> survive<00:02:15.230> but<00:02:15.980> basically<00:02:16.370> if<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.670> was<00:02:16.850> to

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
can survive but basically if I was to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.030 
can survive but basically if I was to
stay<00:02:17.210> in<00:02:17.360> one<00:02:17.540> spot<00:02:17.570> for<00:02:17.840> too<00:02:18.050> long<00:02:18.320> zombies

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
stay in one spot for too long zombies

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.250 
stay in one spot for too long zombies
and<00:02:19.340> skeletons<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.510> sooner<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:20.990> can<00:02:21.050> already

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
and skeletons and sooner I can already

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.530 
and skeletons and sooner I can already
hear<00:02:21.440> spider<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:22.040> different<00:02:22.730> like<00:02:23.240> higher

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
hear spider of different like higher

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.720 
hear spider of different like higher
difficulties<00:02:24.260> such<00:02:24.530> as<00:02:24.770> like<00:02:25.130> enchanted

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
difficulties such as like enchanted

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.610 
difficulties such as like enchanted
armor<00:02:26.150> better<00:02:26.420> armor<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.900> know<00:02:27.020> weapons

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
spiders with potion effects that would

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.960 
spiders with potion effects that would
all<00:02:30.470> start<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.830> spawn<00:02:31.190> more<00:02:31.430> often<00:02:31.820> because

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
all start to spawn more often because

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.150 
all start to spawn more often because
I've<00:02:32.270> stayed<00:02:32.540> in<00:02:32.690> one<00:02:32.840> spot<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.410> all<00:02:33.920> head<00:02:34.130> out

I've stayed in one spot I all head out

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.130 
I've stayed in one spot I all head out
because<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.760> don't<00:02:34.940> think<00:02:35.360> I<00:02:35.690> don't<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:35.990> any

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
because I don't think I don't see any

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.690 
because I don't think I don't see any
zombies<00:02:36.500> yet<00:02:36.740> but<00:02:37.310> they<00:02:37.460> are<00:02:37.490> definitely

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
zombies yet but they are definitely

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.400 
zombies yet but they are definitely
going<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.120> see<00:02:38.300> me<00:02:38.480> pretty<00:02:38.720> soon<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:39.260> we're

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
going to see me pretty soon and we're

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.080 
going to see me pretty soon and we're
gonna<00:02:39.500> guess<00:02:39.740> warm<00:02:40.040> coming<00:02:40.370> after<00:02:40.670> me<00:02:40.790> as<00:02:40.910> soon

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
gonna guess warm coming after me as soon

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.200 
gonna guess warm coming after me as soon
as<00:02:41.210> they<00:02:41.330> start<00:02:41.570> spawning<00:02:41.780> in<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.910> gets

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
as they start spawning in and it gets

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.630 
as they start spawning in and it gets
difficult<00:02:45.020> pretty<00:02:45.530> quick<00:02:45.800> because<00:02:45.980> when<00:02:46.520> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
difficult pretty quick because when the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.390 
difficult pretty quick because when the
zombies<00:02:47.000> can<00:02:47.180> see<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.570> from<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.020> far<00:02:48.050> off<00:02:48.560> they

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
zombies can see you from so far off they

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.580 
zombies can see you from so far off they
they<00:02:50.030> will<00:02:50.180> start<00:02:50.390> swarming<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.170> then<00:02:51.350> as<00:02:51.470> I

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
they will start swarming and then as I

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.700 
they will start swarming and then as I
start<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.950> kill<00:02:52.280> them<00:02:52.550> they<00:02:53.240> will<00:02:53.510> put<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.440> torch

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
start to kill them they will put a torch

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.560 
start to kill them they will put a torch
down<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.070> show<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.150> amount<00:02:56.450> of

down to show you this is the amount of

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.190 
down to show you this is the amount of
light<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:57.020> get<00:02:57.460> and<00:02:58.460> then<00:02:59.120> this<00:02:59.540> is<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.690> skeleton

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
light I get and then this is a skeleton

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.780 
light I get and then this is a skeleton
test<00:03:00.380> over<00:03:00.590> here<00:03:00.710> but<00:03:00.920> yeah<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.430> zombies

once they start coming in there's a

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.690 
once they start coming in there's a
skeleton<00:03:03.410> already<00:03:03.800> coming<00:03:03.980> I'm<00:03:04.520> gonna

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
skeleton already coming I'm gonna

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.040 
skeleton already coming I'm gonna
actually<00:03:04.850> go<00:03:05.090> in<00:03:05.240> here<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.450> try<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.780> show<00:03:05.990> you

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
actually go in here and try to show you

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.690 
actually go in here and try to show you
this<00:03:06.260> little<00:03:06.320> test<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:07.340> i<00:03:07.400> was<00:03:07.520> talking

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
this little test that i was talking

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.940 
this little test that i was talking
about<00:03:08.030> if<00:03:08.210> i<00:03:08.300> can<00:03:08.510> get<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.870> spiders<00:03:09.590> gonna<00:03:09.770> try

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
about if i can get it spiders gonna try

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.010 
about if i can get it spiders gonna try
to<00:03:10.010> come<00:03:10.190> up<00:03:10.280> above<00:03:10.760> me<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:11.420> if<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.540> skeleton

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
to come up above me but if the skeleton

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.740 
to come up above me but if the skeleton
comes<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.440> i<00:03:12.620> will<00:03:13.070> be<00:03:13.400> safe<00:03:13.670> because<00:03:14.510> if<00:03:14.660> you

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
comes in i will be safe because if you

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.570 
comes in i will be safe because if you
right<00:03:15.080> now<00:03:15.230> if<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.500> hide<00:03:15.740> or<00:03:15.980> around<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.310> corner

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
right now if you hide or around a corner

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.730 
right now if you hide or around a corner
like<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.420> skeleton<00:03:17.840> cannot<00:03:18.170> shoot<00:03:18.500> you

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
like so the skeleton cannot shoot you

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.160 
like so the skeleton cannot shoot you
it'll<00:03:19.430> just<00:03:19.610> keep<00:03:19.700> shooting<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.300> corner<00:03:20.660> so

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
it'll just keep shooting the corner so

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.530 
it'll just keep shooting the corner so
unless<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.100> hit<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.610> back<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:22.970> up<00:03:23.060> but<00:03:23.390> you

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
unless you hit it and back it up but you

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.910 
unless you hit it and back it up but you
have<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.020> right<00:03:24.140> in<00:03:24.320> your<00:03:24.410> face<00:03:24.590> there

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
have to have it right in your face there

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.770 
have to have it right in your face there
but<00:03:25.370> this<00:03:25.490> is<00:03:25.610> basically<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:25.970> skeleton<00:03:26.510> proof

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
but this is basically a skeleton proof

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.660 
but this is basically a skeleton proof
little<00:03:27.230> thing<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.070> these<00:03:28.220> filters<00:03:28.459> are

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
little thing and these filters are

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.070 
little thing and these filters are
probably<00:03:28.910> gonna<00:03:29.030> shoot<00:03:29.270> each<00:03:29.420> other<00:03:29.600> before

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
probably gonna shoot each other before

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.510 
probably gonna shoot each other before
they<00:03:30.170> shoot<00:03:30.230> me<00:03:30.560> up<00:03:30.830> to<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.160> one's<00:03:31.310> pissed

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
they shoot me up to that one's pissed

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.070 
they shoot me up to that one's pissed
off<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:32.180> can't<00:03:32.420> even<00:03:32.480> hit<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.720> other<00:03:32.900> guy

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
off you can't even hit the other guy

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.050 
off you can't even hit the other guy
because<00:03:33.320> it's<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.590> similar<00:03:33.920> situation<00:03:34.459> so

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
because it's the similar situation so

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.790 
because it's the similar situation so
yeah<00:03:35.240> this<00:03:35.450> is<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.630> skeleton<00:03:36.080> proof<00:03:36.260> area<00:03:36.620> but

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
yeah this is a skeleton proof area but

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.080 
yeah this is a skeleton proof area but
if<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.040> get<00:03:37.190> anything<00:03:37.400> other<00:03:37.670> than<00:03:37.820> skeletons

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
if I get anything other than skeletons

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.180 
if I get anything other than skeletons
I'm<00:03:38.420> going<00:03:38.570> to<00:03:38.630> be<00:03:38.720> in<00:03:38.810> trouble<00:03:38.930> here<00:03:39.290> oh<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:40.070> i

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
I'm going to be in trouble here oh and i

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.010 
I'm going to be in trouble here oh and i
hit<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.400> torch<00:03:40.730> things<00:03:41.480> aren't<00:03:41.690> looking<00:03:41.780> too

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
hit the torch things aren't looking too

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.570 
hit the torch things aren't looking too
great<00:03:42.290> let's<00:03:42.680> get<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:42.920> spider<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.340> then

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
great let's get the spider and then

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.440 
great let's get the spider and then
we're<00:03:43.670> going<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.820> head<00:03:43.970> out<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.300> actually

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
we're going to head out and actually

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.870 
we're going to head out and actually
start<00:03:44.780> fighting<00:03:45.170> zombies<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.830> once<00:03:46.459> creepers

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
start fighting zombies and once creepers

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.160 
start fighting zombies and once creepers
start<00:03:47.180> getting<00:03:47.420> in<00:03:47.480> this<00:03:47.630> area<00:03:47.900> it's<00:03:48.050> gonna

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
start getting in this area it's gonna

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
I when we have basic supplies so trying

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.510 
I when we have basic supplies so trying
to<00:04:06.080> survive<00:04:06.410> very<00:04:06.650> long<00:04:06.770> it's<00:04:07.220> going<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.400> be

to survive very long it's going to be

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.460 
to survive very long it's going to be
tough<00:04:07.760> there's<00:04:08.450> a<00:04:08.540> skelly<00:04:08.840> down<00:04:09.080> there<00:04:09.320> this

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
tough there's a skelly down there this

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.590 
tough there's a skelly down there this
is<00:04:09.590> Kelly<00:04:09.860> ah<00:04:10.120> there's<00:04:11.120> another<00:04:11.300> skeleton

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
is Kelly ah there's another skeleton

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.970 
is Kelly ah there's another skeleton
somewhere<00:04:12.140> i'm<00:04:12.290> going<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.470> eat<00:04:12.590> my<00:04:12.709> golden

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
somewhere i'm going to eat my golden

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.410 
somewhere i'm going to eat my golden
apple<00:04:13.250> i<00:04:13.400> didn't<00:04:13.640> want<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.820> use<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.120> early

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
apple i didn't want to use it so early

skeletons here comes out of their zombie

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.530 
skeletons here comes out of their zombie
so<00:04:18.320> as<00:04:18.470> I<00:04:18.620> kill<00:04:18.890> these<00:04:19.100> zombies<00:04:19.239> they're<00:04:20.239> going

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
so as I kill these zombies they're going

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.540 
so as I kill these zombies they're going
to<00:04:20.660> spawn<00:04:20.930> other<00:04:21.260> zombies<00:04:21.770> into<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.250> darkness

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
to spawn other zombies into the darkness

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.780 
to spawn other zombies into the darkness
that<00:04:22.729> are<00:04:23.000> going<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.150> come<00:04:23.330> after

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
that are going to come after

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.790 
that are going to come after
oh<00:04:23.850> god<00:04:24.660> there's<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.050> creeper<00:04:25.410> I'm<00:04:25.620> going

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
ton of them well as I was saying that if

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
you kill or if you hit zombies they can

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.220 
you kill or if you hit zombies they can
have<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.400> chance<00:04:50.730> to<00:04:51.000> spawn<00:04:51.330> another<00:04:51.660> one<00:04:52.050> and

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
have a chance to spawn another one and

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.170 
have a chance to spawn another one and
that<00:04:52.380> chance<00:04:52.650> is<00:04:52.860> greater<00:04:53.250> if<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:54.150> zombies

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
that chance is greater if the zombies

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.310 
that chance is greater if the zombies

can get me okay start some armor on I

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
can get me okay start some armor on I
just<00:06:15.630> want<00:06:15.750> to<00:06:15.780> see<00:06:15.900> if<00:06:15.930> I<00:06:16.020> can<00:06:16.200> survive<00:06:16.320> a

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
just want to see if I can survive a

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.960 
just want to see if I can survive a
little<00:06:16.680> longer<00:06:16.860> I<00:06:17.280> showed<00:06:17.640> you<00:06:17.790> guys<00:06:17.910> the

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
little longer I showed you guys the

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.030 
little longer I showed you guys the
skela<00:06:18.360> thing<00:06:18.660> that<00:06:19.140> was<00:06:19.320> my<00:06:19.470> main<00:06:19.620> thing<00:06:19.920> I

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
skela thing that was my main thing I

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.400 
skela thing that was my main thing I
wanted<00:06:20.280> to<00:06:20.970> illustrate<00:06:21.090> as<00:06:21.600> well<00:06:21.750> there's<00:06:22.290> an

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
wanted to illustrate as well there's an

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.190 
wanted to illustrate as well there's an
extra<00:06:22.710> bow<00:06:22.860> because<00:06:23.280> it<00:06:23.460> looks<00:06:23.610> like<00:06:24.140> there<00:06:25.140> we

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
extra bow because it looks like there we

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.750 
extra bow because it looks like there we
go<00:06:25.290> I<00:06:25.440> don't<00:06:25.620> need<00:06:25.740> my<00:06:25.860> skeleton<00:06:26.310> eggs<00:06:26.460> anymore

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
go I don't need my skeleton eggs anymore

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.940 
go I don't need my skeleton eggs anymore
so<00:06:27.450> yeah<00:06:27.600> that<00:06:27.780> that's<00:06:28.020> that's<00:06:28.590> pretty<00:06:28.710> much

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
so yeah that that's that's pretty much

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.500 
so yeah that that's that's pretty much
why<00:06:29.130> I<00:06:29.160> want<00:06:29.400> to<00:06:29.460> show<00:06:29.610> and<00:06:29.850> also<00:06:30.120> the<00:06:30.300> gamma

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
why I want to show and also the gamma

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.810 
why I want to show and also the gamma
test<00:06:30.840> so<00:06:31.020> again<00:06:31.410> if<00:06:31.620> you<00:06:31.740> want<00:06:31.980> to<00:06:32.190> try<00:06:32.790> that

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
test so again if you want to try that

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.300 
test so again if you want to try that
out<00:06:33.060> try<00:06:33.870> going<00:06:34.080> to<00:06:34.410> negative<00:06:34.830> one<00:06:35.010> hundred

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
out try going to negative one hundred

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.050 
out try going to negative one hundred
percent<00:06:35.340> it<00:06:35.790> is

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
percent it is

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.850 
percent it is
saying<00:06:36.360> how<00:06:36.630> little<00:06:37.020> you<00:06:37.200> can<00:06:37.350> see<00:06:37.530> ahead<00:06:37.740> of

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
saying how little you can see ahead of

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.040 
saying how little you can see ahead of
you<00:06:37.980> it's<00:06:38.400> probably<00:06:38.550> harder<00:06:39.480> for<00:06:39.510> you<00:06:39.690> guys<00:06:39.870> to

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
you it's probably harder for you guys to

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.510 
you it's probably harder for you guys to
see<00:06:40.200> human<00:06:40.500> because<00:06:40.800> you're<00:06:40.980> on<00:06:41.100> a<00:06:41.130> video<00:06:41.460> that

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
see human because you're on a video that

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.640 
see human because you're on a video that
I've<00:06:41.760> already<00:06:41.910> rendered<00:06:42.270> out<00:06:42.600> and<00:06:42.840> it<00:06:43.290> adds<00:06:43.440> a

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
I've already rendered out and it adds a

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.220 
I've already rendered out and it adds a
little<00:06:43.740> bit<00:06:43.889> of<00:06:44.010> a<00:06:44.160> darkness<00:06:44.580> to<00:06:44.820> that<00:06:45.000> geez<00:06:45.960> I

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
little bit of a darkness to that geez I

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.780 
little bit of a darkness to that geez I
just<00:06:46.440> got<00:06:46.590> hit<00:06:46.740> like<00:06:46.889> a<00:06:46.980> couple<00:06:47.250> times<00:06:47.490> and<00:06:47.669> I'm

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
just got hit like a couple times and I'm

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
already really low I don't know if I can

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.440 
already really low I don't know if I can
fight<00:06:50.100> the<00:06:50.250> off<00:06:50.370> these<00:06:50.610> zombies<00:06:51.000> long<00:06:51.210> enough

out<00:07:18.270> that<00:07:18.450> challenge<00:07:18.930> for<00:07:19.229> yourself<00:07:19.590> if<00:07:19.800> you

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 
out that challenge for yourself if you

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.290 
out that challenge for yourself if you
want<00:07:20.070> to<00:07:20.190> make<00:07:20.310> it<00:07:20.430> even<00:07:20.580> harder<00:07:20.790> by<00:07:21.090> not

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 
want to make it even harder by not

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.810 
want to make it even harder by not
letting<00:07:21.900> yourself<00:07:22.590> see<00:07:22.860> very<00:07:23.160> far<00:07:23.400> with<00:07:23.700> the

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:23.820 
letting yourself see very far with the

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.090 
letting yourself see very far with the
gamma<00:07:24.030> but<00:07:24.540> even<00:07:24.690> outside<00:07:25.110> of<00:07:25.380> that<00:07:25.590> one<00:07:25.830> point

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.100 
gamma but even outside of that one point

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.550 
gamma but even outside of that one point
six<00:07:26.310> is<00:07:26.580> a<00:07:27.030> difficult<00:07:27.630> update<00:07:28.020> in<00:07:28.169> terms<00:07:28.200> of

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 
six is a difficult update in terms of

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.409 
six is a difficult update in terms of
survival<00:07:28.889> I<00:07:29.190> bet<00:07:29.550> that<00:07:29.580> zombie<00:07:30.090> glitch<00:07:30.270> is

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:30.419 
survival I bet that zombie glitch is

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:31.760 
survival I bet that zombie glitch is
going<00:07:30.600> to<00:07:30.660> be<00:07:30.720> fixed<00:07:31.050> so<00:07:31.169> use<00:07:31.350> it<00:07:31.530> while<00:07:31.650> you

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:31.770 
going to be fixed so use it while you

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.310 
going to be fixed so use it while you
still<00:07:31.979> can<00:07:32.040> and<00:07:32.840> thanks<00:07:33.840> for<00:07:33.960> watching<00:07:33.990> guys

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.320 
still can and thanks for watching guys
