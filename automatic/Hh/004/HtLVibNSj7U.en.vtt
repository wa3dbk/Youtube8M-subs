best team in Division three but are

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.530 
best team in Division three but are
there<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> smartest<00:01:35.580> if<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.180> had<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.360> little

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
there the smartest if we had a little

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.859 
there the smartest if we had a little
too<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.170> two-game<00:01:38.009> process<00:01:38.610> or<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.180> two-part

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
too a two-game process or a two-part

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.570 
too a two-game process or a two-part
process<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.590> whole<00:01:40.770> playoffs<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.340> think

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
process to the whole playoffs I think

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.340 
process to the whole playoffs I think
you<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.119> with<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.509> part<00:01:42.780> being<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
you know with one part being a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.410 
you know with one part being a
basketball<00:01:44.130> game<00:01:44.400> in<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.700> next<00:01:44.939> part<00:01:45.180> being

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
basketball game in the next part being

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.810 
basketball game in the next part being
maybe<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.869> calculus<00:01:46.590> test<00:01:46.650> I<00:01:47.159> think<00:01:47.579> we'd<00:01:47.700> be

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
maybe a calculus test I think we'd be

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.640 
maybe a calculus test I think we'd be
able<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.030> hold<00:01:48.150> our<00:01:48.329> own<00:01:48.360> pretty<00:01:48.689> tough<00:01:48.960> now<00:01:49.530> as

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
able to hold our own pretty tough now as

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.929
