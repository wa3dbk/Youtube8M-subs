00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.689
 like on a sand court 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.320
 what you have are two yellow flags that marks you an aria nine 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.359
 meters 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:13.259
 the goalkeeper can leave from the aria from the line so that's a way to 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.389
 the finish line 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.949
 nine meters the field is the area that the goalkeeper covers to grab it with the 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:18.650
 hand 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.489
 then once it comes out that they commit a last as 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.889
 but that the area destined for us the reform tried to order a 

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:27.919
 little or in some things that 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.919
 that you have to draw attention but in reality the team 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.820
 we all communicate why it is something very fast night 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.400
 if you can see it in the game 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.870
 when an opposing player passed then 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.050
 To avoid wear, what you have to do is 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.100
 ask for the change of mark miraral let it I grab it then 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.590
 in a communication from the whole Navarre team soto de lade one of the most 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.220
 important as a soldier area was stopped tons has the peculiarity of 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.400
 attack and defend bush saying a strategic question g let's say 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.729
 the other team usually gold but it has 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.230
 how ugly they are very tall meza stagnated in six years 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.690
 everything very high of the flamenco picture we have been closed 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.180
 completely if it helps to favor companies 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.090
 the main entrance of the recovery of the ball 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.780
 the command positioning of the sides 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.359
 is ideal or eave and of the pib or above 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:19.360
 simply 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.830
 talks with the positioning what does not give the impression the professor closed 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.780
 our course our game system we recover ball freed them 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.300
 per cent what increases is on that date that time because the newspaper 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.770
 but I always look for my position as leader and I recover dove povea goalkeeper 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.530
 the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.350
 pulls to the hill important but always important positioning books 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.520
 always have to be 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.780
 positioned to the defensive pair of the d of the field as such the libero in handles 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.030
 a lot of times and a pension 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.900
 The bookcase 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.270
 positionally 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.270
 may be when the gib or 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.469
 tactically 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:55.509
 plays of pivot 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.439
 he throws the ball to him reception to throw it to the eroski returns the part 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.740
 defensive but the start as such has to be by the goalkeeper today the 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.859
 leader managing the times but press 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.530
 the gay conama starts papi otea but immediately for a while to the brand 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.529
 immediately flight his pivot position 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.709
 everyone has his style his identity to ours 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.870
 just like the France of the match and the football are not at all the establishment our 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.079
 Farro style against another simple 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.419

 to recover the hyde ball I just move offensive

 and we owe the characteristic of gore very well very well very violent on the finger what 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.719
 offensive

 it's a model center is a framework 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.329
 of crime and apart with how it is worth
