00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.710

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.430

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.729
 also from the ring scenario and it is not 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:51.380

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.409
 that you can jump on the strings that it is 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.140

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.229
