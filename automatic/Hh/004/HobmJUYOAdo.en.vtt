00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.890
 if he will be 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.890
 They thank to say this in an eternal service 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.640

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.080
 the texis flip 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.850
 in a beautiful week the hair the long and healthy hair nor with the textures e 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.970
 precious in what you're saying besides is that we're changing the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.460
 format to entertain of bush towards the 80 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.650
 instead of taking hair by completing nonsense only choose the part 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.850
 central hair 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.759
 which makes ripple in a much softer way much more 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.540
 to see this model we will teach four different 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.560
 that we can dare to do at home like tools or very well and 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.820
 know gonzalo teaches do not throw you have here the picture of how it will be 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.560
 true 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.780
 This what the village commanded barragán valencia that lemus navarro cameron 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.590
 and above all what you are looking for is to try to translate a little what we have seen in 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.590
 the winter footbridges in both the milan as in london and in new york 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.210
 and move it but we're going to do it at home so we do not have to be 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.430
 president worried take a long time and and what he told us is that he is 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.120
 convicted it is possible to do it more or less 1 7 8 minutes at home if you do not want 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.340
 complicated especially those based on which advantage as quickly as the 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.800
 gateways is that you want to leave each other perhaps to another that has to leave or to 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.389
 parade 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.249
 and we'll see also wolf how models come out 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.409
 and if it's done and mons 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.299
 that requirement 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.189
 yes the switch 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.010
 while more exciting than you have to use in 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.419
 nothing that he likes because 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.079
 I am happy is to distribute the luqueño disney channel you know the 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.539
 useful effectism his tweets his and sinister and 3 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.889
 Suarez to tell us what are the crimes of the hair iron for calpe 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.269
 the absolutely smooth 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.049
 the difference that this iron has 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.199
 is that it vibrates 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:55.829
 and when vibrating homogenously distributed heat throughout the entire hair and 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:56.959
 allows in addition 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.959
 be 30% faster so we gained a lot of time at the time of 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.700
 do it and also allows 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.709
 that the hair does not suffer so much when we are using the iron 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.349
 which is also used to use the iron 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.279
 smoke comes out is not burning not you do not get lost it's you 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:13.279
 the iron to gain some professional temperatures but it is also 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:15.980
 Coated special stuff so as not to damage the hair 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.110
 and especially the violation by doing that that 30 percent is faster 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.019
 what it allows is precisely that nextel hair so long in contact with 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.300
 the iron I do not know what she's doing to her so we can see how she's doing 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:26.879
 to finish 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.079
 then we will see each other on the walk through the floor 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.989
 we have called them the lateral effect 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.799
 and that allows just that in general the hair in a tremendous way 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.299
 in movies in others not 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.629
 and also that long bangs years we left the day after the 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:42.949
 next model 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.369
 that there was what they are doing to this model 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:49.059
 it's wrong they're doing it and very sorry lion we love you baobab men a 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:50.209
 trend 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.169
 it is used especially of 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.399
 a bionic bagged dryer that what allows us is that I do not know the hair is not 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.120
 have static electric eliminatory ethics and allow us 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.079
 give volume the way we want 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.159
 one of the bullets and with it the day like this the silence of itavu is 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.299
 technology but above all to apply it 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.040
 to the comfort of daily life of the reign people eat troublemakers not 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.870
 must be saved effectively it's a little more crazier than this 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.769
 aspect but in the end about everything you are looking for is that is to have a comfort in 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.930
 him in the hair 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.930
 have a quick way to do it and deaf and cuatrecasas 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.099
 and the last one to finish 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.470
 is a picked up because they are also going to take the collected but 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.630
 I guess you think that English we go back in time exactly this 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.309
 tendency the gray mamos that the mayor 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:37.379
 and it's a trend that what makes it accurate 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.029
 before that using 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.590
 the tipper using the hair iron what we do is 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.029
 if you look at him 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:51.099
 the iron the stations will review its establishment but the very soft form does not try 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.360
 in a very delicate way it escapes to make it much of that list we 

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:57.779
 allows then the collected in that very impressive aspect so of the 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:58.689
 50s 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.360
 Well, we're left with this 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.350
 but long crazy hair for a special night the picked up to walk a 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.470
 event that we have type you think that the one that rubén ito but 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.580
 always long I do not know what I'm going to do I have to let it grow so that 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.460
 then they did not have indec, it does not give me time, but let's see how the 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.569
 collected and these are waiting for those who are doing andy and we are not going to carry 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.569
 girls to the catwalk that they have organized there next 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.870
 exceeded delivered to us by goals have said to the house zafra those of 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.260
 arias in the house the hairdressers week managed to be careful that pedrosa 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.980
 that has aborted girls of the team wanting to end up cova running by 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.400
 programs 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.490
 hahahaha the price is so serious that at the same time 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.379
 career by speaking partially 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.180
 You have to improve but Juan Pablo
