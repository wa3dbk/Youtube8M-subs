shooting for you know consistency the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.020

factory<00:02:38.900> barrel<00:02:39.320> on<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.770> Ruger<00:02:40.010> 10/22<00:02:40.250> is

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
factory barrel on the Ruger 10/22 is

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.400 
factory barrel on the Ruger 10/22 is
awesome<00:02:41.420> for<00:02:41.600> squirrel<00:02:41.870> accuracy<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:44.960> for

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
awesome for squirrel accuracy it is for

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.280 
awesome for squirrel accuracy it is for
from<00:02:45.830> my<00:02:46.250> studies<00:02:46.850> it's<00:02:47.180> very<00:02:47.630> very<00:02:47.900> finicky

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
from my studies it's very very finicky

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.470 
from my studies it's very very finicky
as<00:02:48.650> far<00:02:48.830> as<00:02:48.950> accuracy<00:02:49.280> on<00:02:49.610> ammunition<00:02:50.270> it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
as far as accuracy on ammunition it

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.500 
as far as accuracy on ammunition it
shoots<00:02:50.720> other<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:51.020> munitions<00:02:51.709> better<00:02:52.100> than

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
shoots other a munitions better than

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.710 
shoots other a munitions better than
others<00:02:53.510> but<00:02:54.490> it's<00:02:55.490> pretty<00:02:55.760> inconsistent<00:02:56.209> in

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
others but it's pretty inconsistent in

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.590 
others but it's pretty inconsistent in
my<00:02:56.840> book<00:02:57.110> as<00:02:57.890> far<00:02:57.950> as<00:02:58.459> some<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.030> testing

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
my book as far as some of the testing

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.210 
my book as far as some of the testing
and<00:02:59.840> some<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.440> data<00:03:00.650> points<00:03:00.740> that<00:03:01.100> I've

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
and some of the data points that I've

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.810 
and some of the data points that I've
come<00:03:01.430> across<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.900> your<00:03:03.440> next<00:03:03.740> viable<00:03:04.280> option

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
come across so your next viable option

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.310 
come across so your next viable option
is<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:06.350> math<00:03:07.130> grade<00:03:07.430> 920<00:03:08.360> have<00:03:08.930> your<00:03:09.050> target

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
is a math grade 920 have your target

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.040 
is a math grade 920 have your target
barrel<00:03:09.560> there<00:03:10.130> are<00:03:10.370> many<00:03:10.820> many<00:03:11.239> reasons<00:03:11.660> on

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
barrel there are many many reasons on

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.960 
barrel there are many many reasons on
why<00:03:12.080> I<00:03:12.350> go<00:03:12.800> with<00:03:12.950> a<00:03:13.070> heavy<00:03:13.280> target<00:03:13.730> barrel

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
why I go with a heavy target barrel

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.850 
why I go with a heavy target barrel
first<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.959> foremost<00:03:16.989> this<00:03:17.989> one<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.530> match

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
first and foremost this one is a match

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.300 
first and foremost this one is a match

the<00:03:53.299> stainless<00:03:53.390> steel<00:03:53.870> barrels<00:03:54.260> it's<00:03:54.890> a<00:03:54.950> lot

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
the stainless steel barrels it's a lot

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.039 
the stainless steel barrels it's a lot
easier<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.519> clean<00:03:55.790> honestly<00:03:56.209> it<00:03:56.690> cuts<00:03:56.930> your

gonna be a lot more accurate and a lot

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.600 
gonna be a lot more accurate and a lot
