through<00:01:32.130> my<00:01:32.280> die<00:01:32.310> cut<00:01:32.759> machine<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.990> just

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
through my die cut machine and I just

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.569 
through my die cut machine and I just
watched<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> way<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.890> which<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.189> handle

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
watched the way in which the handle

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.620 
watched the way in which the handle
turns<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:38.460> I'm<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.700> turn<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.210> it's

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
