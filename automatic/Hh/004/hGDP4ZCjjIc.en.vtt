00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
regular and then you so that would be

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.400 
regular and then you so that would be
the<00:00:56.910> first<00:00:57.210> part<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> skull<00:00:57.960> right<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.320> the

there<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.350> then<00:01:46.950> lay<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> fight<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.180> is

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
there and then lay a fight so this is

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.370 
there and then lay a fight so this is
where<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.869> show<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.049> how<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
where I'm going to show you how to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.850 
where I'm going to show you how to
create<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.009> central<00:01:50.430> bits<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.210> layer<00:01:51.420> 15<00:01:52.020> I've

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
create the central bits so layer 15 I've

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.550 
create the central bits so layer 15 I've
gone<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.369> used<00:01:53.610> domain<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.439> would<00:01:55.500> be

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
gone in used domain and so that would be

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.440 
gone in used domain and so that would be
the<00:01:55.740> right<00:01:55.950> hand<00:01:56.250> bottom<00:01:56.640> right<00:01:56.790> hand<00:01:56.969> sides<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the right hand bottom right hand sides a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.170 
the right hand bottom right hand sides a
tend<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.719> cool<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:58.500> layer<00:01:58.710> 16<00:01:59.250> I've<00:01:59.880> used

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
tend to cool and then layer 16 I've used

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.630 
tend to cool and then layer 16 I've used
the<00:02:00.299> curved<00:02:00.540> lines<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.310> get<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.430> bit

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
the curved lines just to get that bit

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.280 
the curved lines just to get that bit
more<00:02:02.850> around<00:02:03.090> effect<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> bottom<00:02:04.049> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
more around effect on the bottom and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.590 
more around effect on the bottom and
there<00:02:04.619> are<00:02:04.710> repeated<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.700> left<00:02:06.420> hand

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
there are repeated it on the left hand

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.990 
there are repeated it on the left hand
side<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.229> as<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.549> there<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
side of that as you can see there and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.319 
side of that as you can see there and
then<00:02:09.360> layer<00:02:09.630> 19<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.350> 20<00:02:10.860> I've<00:02:11.130> used<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.850> smile

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
then layer 19 and 20 I've used the smile

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.030 
then layer 19 and 20 I've used the smile
outline<00:02:12.720> now<00:02:13.230> guys<00:02:13.440> don't<00:02:13.739> forget<00:02:13.860> to

freestyle that just to get a little

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.489 
freestyle that just to get a little
a<00:02:16.129> rounded<00:02:16.760> effect<00:02:17.180> on<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.599> bottom<00:02:17.780> there<00:02:18.170> and

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:18.499 
a rounded effect on the bottom there and

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:22.420 
a rounded effect on the bottom there and
then<00:02:19.129> literally<00:02:19.700> guys<00:02:19.879> from<00:02:20.650> from<00:02:21.650> layer<00:02:21.859> 15

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
then literally guys from from layer 15

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.209 
then literally guys from from layer 15
straight<00:02:22.819> up<00:02:22.999> to<00:02:23.120> layer<00:02:23.299> 32<00:02:23.989> that<00:02:24.799> is<00:02:24.950> how<00:02:25.159> you

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
straight up to layer 32 that is how you

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.059 
straight up to layer 32 that is how you
create<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:26.629> tentacle<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:27.680> just<00:02:27.889> make<00:02:28.040> sure

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
create the tentacle so just make sure

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.059 
create the tentacle so just make sure
you<00:02:28.310> copy<00:02:28.609> each<00:02:28.909> one<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.510> obviously<00:02:30.439> paste<00:02:30.769> it

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
you copy each one and obviously paste it

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.459 
you copy each one and obviously paste it
in<00:02:31.999> the<00:02:32.269> next<00:02:32.450> layer<00:02:32.689> you<00:02:32.930> might<00:02:33.139> have<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.379> make

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.469 
in the next layer you might have to make

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.660 
in the next layer you might have to make
it<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.680> little<00:02:33.859> bit<00:02:34.010> smaller<00:02:34.219> as<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.459> get

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
it a little bit smaller as you get

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.129 
it a little bit smaller as you get
nearer<00:02:34.909> to<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.180> top<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:35.569> obviously<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:35.989> not

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
nearer to the top so obviously it's not

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.530 
nearer to the top so obviously it's not
that<00:02:36.379> much<00:02:36.560> room<00:02:36.799> but<00:02:37.609> that<00:02:37.639> is<00:02:37.939> how<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.209> put

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
that much room but that is how you put

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.390 
that much room but that is how you put
it<00:02:38.629> together<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:39.829> hope<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.159> appreciate
