00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.400 
he'll probably bring that car back we
also<00:00:17.789> look<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.270> we've<00:00:18.539> got<00:00:18.750> yellows<00:00:19.109> at

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
also look like we've got yellows at

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.830 
also look like we've got yellows at
Marsh<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.980> point<00:00:20.160> five<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.060> seven<00:00:21.660> now

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
tires big time and once just as we were

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.979 
tires big time and once just as we were
starting<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.699> see<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:53.910> really<00:00:54.360> hot<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.809> on

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
starting to see this really hot up on

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.610 
starting to see this really hot up on
for<00:00:55.230> Joey<00:00:56.449> we<00:00:57.449> did<00:00:57.629> see<00:00:57.780> Andre<00:00:57.930> Lotterer<00:00:58.320> go

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
for Joey we did see Andre Lotterer go

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.080 
for Joey we did see Andre Lotterer go
through<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.219> last<00:00:59.430> lap<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.879> another

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
through on that last lap with another

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.230 
through on that last lap with another
personal<00:01:00.480> best<00:01:01.190> 324<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.489> massive<00:01:03.030> accident

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.550 

so<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:09.450> thought<00:01:09.689> somewhere<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.290> want<00:01:10.439> to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
so that's thought somewhere you want to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.270 
so that's thought somewhere you want to
have<00:01:10.740> an<00:01:10.860> incident<00:01:11.900> clearly<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.500> didn't

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
have an incident clearly you know didn't

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.700 
have an incident clearly you know didn't
didn't<00:01:14.580> look<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:15.030> he<00:01:15.600> hit<00:01:15.780> too<00:01:16.049> hard<00:01:16.350> there

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
didn't look like he hit too hard there

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.679 
didn't look like he hit too hard there
he<00:01:16.950> came<00:01:17.460> into<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> wall<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> inside

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
he came into the wall on the inside

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.300 
he came into the wall on the inside
that's<00:01:18.930> what<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.170> cars<00:01:19.380> designed<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that's what the cars designed to do and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.030 
that's what the cars designed to do and
again<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.330> again<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> bodywork<00:01:22.650> has

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
again we see again that the bodywork has

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.039 
again we see again that the bodywork has
dissipated<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.210> lot<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> energy<00:01:24.869> there

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
dissipated a lot of the energy there

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.100 
dissipated a lot of the energy there
that<00:01:25.080> has<00:01:25.470> all<00:01:25.560> come<00:01:25.770> away<00:01:26.479> driver<00:01:27.479> talking

surprisingly at 2025 with 34 minutes
remaining<00:01:38.900> these<00:01:39.900> things<00:01:40.140> seem<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.350> come<00:01:40.470> in
