00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.140
 the escorts at the show behind the scenes and how they feel 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.970
 prepare the finalists for their most important performance before throwing them off 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.230
 we have a look into the future we have two fortune tellers us a shaman 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.869
 asked who has the best cards tonight 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.220
 the number of occupancy Meier have jerked into the glass ball Center of the jury 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.220
 spoken most respected seat 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.280
 it's the last big name of the season in less than an hour 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.480
 the election for the Supertalent 2010 starts 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.880
 and there are people who can claim to help 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.590
 Yes, this evening 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.420
 The cell phone 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.410
 sometimes too little 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.790
 about everything exclusion the seniors more 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.890
 sorted out 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.940
 Norbert Aul Cage America 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.060
 the camera can be clairvoyant 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.850
 and the next crisis stops everyone in his own way to find out who 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.240
 will be announced tonight to the super talent that he wants to get fit now 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.000
 Alimony we will 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 honestly 10 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.030
 that she will definitely get her money 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.580
 window 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.250
 and well deserved 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.800
 For me to leave the Sharia at a conference and free for one 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.469
 Connoisseur in terms of stars 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.499
 he is the big favorite of Sylvie van der Vaart 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.750
 non-disabled suitable for the men have the whole 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.539
 Time the clearance action but currently does not like 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.809
 I did not say Stehr was endangered with Closer around all the time 

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:48.920
 also my LÃºcio Rebholz year stood 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.930
 Marcel Gerstle 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.500
 "I thought it was brave 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.010
 in the past always worse races not Svindal 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.790
 and it is supposedly reliability Marcel Geeren Sandras Munich can about 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.450
 looking six months into the future Vienna 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.630
 one year longer horses 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.009
 Euro I also know that I can help many people and it is 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.409
 also actually sense and in order 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:15.540
 there are falsely sent there is a close down and also help on 29 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.319
 Sandra already help to predict the winner of the Supertalent and yes 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:27.049
 After a few laying on of hands she is quite sure the battery Kordic is with me 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.769
 definitely 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.109
 among the guests 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.109
 three to four 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.319
 Dr 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.449
 was 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.540
 the vocalist Darko sees the psychic right at the top of the list but Sammer favorite 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.709
 is lost 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.379
 for the great moment 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.379
 whoever becomes first he forms all hearts 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.879
 there it goes very deep in and come from above I cry to be ready 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:06.839
 should 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:10.629
 Anyway, that's definitely worth it for me for the city 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.549
 in any case it is safe it feels inside 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.249
 I also see who is more, but who more even if I am one 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.149
 Put your hand on these pictures 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.949
 and if that feels the Fredy Schellin 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.019
 will win 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.889
 he is director 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.889
 Scholz's shells are with Heller Stimme and Lessing 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.709
 without aids 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.339
 with the singer 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.489
 often difficult to say once 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.829
 Ben as he does not stay that way while trendy and comes 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.299
 on the Munich Christmas market meet the handy maple 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.500
 Robert Cawthorn 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.039
 also animal experiments for us to determine the winner it is ddp to Berlin 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.119
 there comes 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:13.909
 possibly choose freely 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.059
 we are very strong 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:17.359
 from the energy 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.529
 this is as if painting after 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.329
 Ltd. 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.500
 Robert Dahlgren numbers actually reads not only in the cards but also out 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.229
 the hand, that is to say about the hotlines 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.620
 because he promised those the Karbener and we have a certain blur 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.569
 released his prophecies probably accepted 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.099
 now it was really worth the look of this world 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.090
 Bianco 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.410
 that makes the MFG at MyPlace that on the market so a very natural 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.629
 Gift that should be something special 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.440
 but maybe a bit wilder a Bear Reversal winner of the Red 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.249
 Maybe not over Chaumont complete work 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:03.909
 Nathalie 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.009
 Notter is very high in the course 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.300
 This one sees the departure of actually has in life really 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.300
 the opportunity to go one percent ahead 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.960
 since comforts get on the floor completely 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.589
 now it is his 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.589
 Hissing Darko and Natal will be her 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.070
 So that's within the narrowest limits, well, winning could be a definite one 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.090
 but thinks Dieter pointed in which we again with 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.090
 Clairvoyant Sandra compare 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.240
 Ostermann 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.540
 pay a very pretty radiance of this woman a whole 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.870
 great Thuringia 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.039
 but currently rather 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.150
 nothing too specific 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.240
 so that they too are not the investigators of various the news to Italy 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.969
 to form 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.969
 HSH Nordbank Dirk Nonnenmacher this year 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.889
 Well, certainly his 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.930
 a very thoughtful man 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.530
 Gets incredible things on the bee every year 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.050
 times 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.009
 cook cooking is not about years are more with the tense 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.020
 Here drive another expert in the field of clairvoyance 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.070
 Pixel Chrysler gave up for the Supertalent winner 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.059
 that there are only two 

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:33.180
 ste 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.289
 and it is unclear how she is here 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.270
 window 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.270
 especially highlights the singer Michel Orsinger 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.910
 now the new super talent 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.749
 three psychics four opinions 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.860
 so you have to summarize in our survey probably 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.849
 Back then for Freddy Robert, Natalia Gaitan favors Christian Berg 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:05.029
 I hope not 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:09.899
 This ambiguity will probably be due to the fact that this evening only super talent 

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:11.050
 occur 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.399
 and who is the best of them 

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.230
 that chatter once more 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.400
 the audience must decide
