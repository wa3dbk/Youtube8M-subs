00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.760 
so yeah that's why i didn't do it
okay<00:04:19.120> so<00:04:19.180> along<00:04:19.540> here<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:20.140> will<00:04:20.290> find<00:04:20.530> your

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
jump on that rope and then jump again

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.530
