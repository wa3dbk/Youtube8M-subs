00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.020
 hello and welcome work processes hairs 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.930
 we already kind because braids done 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.939
 especially for the pass or people still 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.259
 have never braided only one 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.970
 another one was missing on the bad 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.200
 so of course let it go today 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.329
 see because you also have this basis so 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.809
 where is just coated 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:44.350
 I take the top layer, there I go 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:53.559
 braid again so close this is for something 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:56.429
 thin brush me all that with you 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.429
 a group 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:13.850
 so so the issue of dividing it into 3 parts 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.310
 three equal pieces have given me one 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.130
 ordinary in bad go over it 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.880
 you don't do that, you go under it now 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.560
 so take that bottom piece now has one 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.190
 Another thing show 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.479
 I got it here right there and there 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.210
 Below 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.869
 so grab that third finger 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:40.460
 I grab that piece with these two fingers 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:43.369
 upper over then I grab it so tight 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.440
 so here and forefinger and my thumb and 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.560
 below compli middle finger and there 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.560
 I grab the door with that 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.300
 forefinger thumb middle finger the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.030
 underneath and then I grab the third one 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.450
 stuck down and this is my toes hand 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.680
 and I grab with my other hand and 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.860
 sneaked her all the way to the braid 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.870
 Make momentarily, so I have enough here so 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.769
 ready and then I pull backwards 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.190
 that glass is now going to be grandfather's 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:24.019
 now that goes with her so that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.120
 along the bottom it takes over mine 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.400
 index finger under the strip that I just 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.320
 did everything on it 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.280
 the middle again underneath and then 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:39.769
 I pick it up again on the other side 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:43.370
 a tight hair so is all the way to the 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.350
 bad weather had open piece in the finger 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.620
 her there 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.060
 here I grab him underneath 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.019
 secure everything again with my thumb and 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.239
 forefinger middle finger below me and me 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:01.400
 grab again 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.170
 so pick it up again while about 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.260
 to grab 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:14.010
 the mouse finger middle finger below 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:16.200
 and grab it by the clamps 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.560
 underneath grasp everything here 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.680
 middle finger so hair again 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.570
 add make sure the hair is well combed 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.890
 is because because we are you with clip 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.500
 therefore the very 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.490
 your hair were very small 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.970
 wrongly packed and so still color 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.970
 intruder 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:44.790
 this we will go along it is 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.110
 actually the exact opposite 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.080
 from 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.080
 braiding then you do everything above 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.890
 now i have the last one under 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.590
 and so quickly you girl to join 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.660
 can just wonder rights of course this is 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.280
 just a basic you can use it 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.630
 used this week to go to school 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.100
 go or something 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.800
 but I usually use the braid myself 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.120
 for other purposes such as the school 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.820
 flies 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.470
 for example with the flower on flights 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.920
 but a base is very handy to one 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.020
 sometime to show that you can practice 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.600
 than the more difficult flights 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.510
 you can braid it as far as 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.490
 that you want to stop now so I put you there 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.140
 around it 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.250
 yes why show and turned through 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.700
 that should turn the degrees and again 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.700
 again 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:49.240
 such a kind that is tight all the time 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.100
 sound in the weather error 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.960
 yes what you can do to songs that just 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.700
 but you can also choose if 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.990
 you want rubber band a little too down 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.450
 to pull 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.970
 and then this one bit apart 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.470
 nothing happens to the braid 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.870
 the only thing is that it gets tighter 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.310
 to sit on the sides and less 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.270
 tight in the braid 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:14.620
 allowing the braid larger body but good 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:19.540
 I need it so they certainly have my 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:22.440
 straight and so you click on braided in 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.440
 place of braided 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.390
 then for my chin my weather
