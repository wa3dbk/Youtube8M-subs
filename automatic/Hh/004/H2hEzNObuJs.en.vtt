00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:14.599
 good morning on all sides now we raise for you me 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.299
 welcome you 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.939
 real number four 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.349
 and reason flight 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.159
 Park 2 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:24.839
 What I'm going to show you today, I could probably think but 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.869
 in addition I will you 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.949
 my class will show such concoctions 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.590
 certainly with such tax simply relatively fast 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.940
 Anspach times come because there are simply extremely good points, however 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.350
 There are just a few things to note as I think 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.870
 at the class compilation 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.000
 oil to it 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.110
 Dior should include or what should not be neglected 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.400
 I go with the song and always say my class 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.810
 that is currently 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.000
 one with the APA, but of course that's up to you now 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.960
 what he wants to play there 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.960
 and the game to do nothing big role 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.820
 around 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.470
 as a sentence you should definitely use the muffler because 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.580
 As everyone knows, there is no reason to go back 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.880
 the corresponding 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.320
 careful you have to bed your opponent knows where you are then you have 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 him a problem and of course not too smart 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.230
 1 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.740
 if then, of course 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.740
 Maybe not seen by many a family 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.840
 and settle with that 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.800
 Negotiate Foucault completely 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.780
 you do not sound too strong anyway in the game anyway you should 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.550
 do not underestimate that 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.830
 and as an extra 2 because you can argue ever 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.940
 I have nimbleness thereby another possibility would be 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.070
 fix her what is that from there too 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.950
 puts August in the 2nd as the second sharpest 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.950
 who likes can of course go for a reflex pick up point action or 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.650
 Magazine was still a bunch 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.679
 I'm super 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.010
 the BaFin shares 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.010
 2 not that in some situations does not save 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.320
 then there is of course the primary kanat as selection of this text is not the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.319
 Grenade or Straumur OK 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.540
 playfully good Sachs became the day of the match because of the Baroque 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.809
 of course was a foul 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:22.219
 Can sometimes save you in close combat in the seminar Qantas have it better 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:25.559
 does not like it that way 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:27.819
 then, of course, the opportunity 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.219
 Dan Karate Nowack approached or Deception SCA 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.419
 I am and the channel continues is also relatively open 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.199
 there is still the possibility 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.479
 Claim Mor camera 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.850
 motion detector 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.049
 or that the 4 I use temporarily 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.620
 only the claymore who does not save quite often and even after my death 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.739
 in the cinema 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.499
 The cameras are not too early, but not too much used 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:56.369
 because "you love me 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.469
 after the death still using engine brings with it 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.369
 yes and as a secondary weapon I have to say quite honestly I do not use 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:06.209
 too much 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.049
 but of course I have it with me 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.040
 i've just gg around people if they can commit a robbery then 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.859
 rushes to shoot 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.460
 clear in it because some sanctions melee Doppler Auer 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.629
 But there are fast to the water 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.229
 And, of course, it's not allowed to do that either 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.769
 Percent the face paint is missing to make the opponent so far 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.799
 the black to white of it 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.829
 and just give it 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.829
 Chris takes over the school to switch operations CIO the card and 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.580
 praised the unadorned the information 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.479
 Continue year 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.479
 and praised the papers 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.129
 and how they just make him a suitable one 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.749
 Critical as he is setting is also a good thing to do 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:54.519
 what the hell my goodness 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.959
 Merkel is Jansch is also a bit of time 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.529
 not very bad 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:01.259
 that leaves me on mine 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:05.199
 Talking to Frankel is where played while German is full 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:06.609
 what a setup 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.419
 Of course not interested 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.419
 and maybe what you think of me 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:16.099
 and above all I'm in praise the two of me I am pleased groans I see degrees 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.249
 All the July Bonds will also be reset 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:21.819
 and because the Vororchester asked 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:26.030
 This was too far from the leather about comment or what I am for 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.559
 quite happy 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:28.179
 Previous year
