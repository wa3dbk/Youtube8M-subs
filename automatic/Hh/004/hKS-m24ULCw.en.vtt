00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.360 

and<00:02:33.989> if<00:02:34.409> you're<00:02:34.560> doing<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.980> work<00:02:35.159> yourself

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
and if you're doing the work yourself

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.059 
and if you're doing the work yourself
this<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> good<00:02:36.659> time<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.290> go<00:02:37.709> ahead<00:02:37.739> and

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
this is a good time to go ahead and

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.240 
this is a good time to go ahead and
freeze<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.640> bearings<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.920> now<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:40.980> can

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
freeze the bearings and now you can

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.330 
freeze the bearings and now you can
proceed<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:42.060> drive<00:02:42.510> out<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.140> old<00:02:43.379> bearing

okay<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.630> our<00:03:10.720> case<00:03:11.020> we<00:03:11.290> had<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.470> little

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
okay in our case we had a little

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.070 
okay in our case we had a little
difficulty<00:03:12.250> with<00:03:12.490> the<00:03:12.730> lower<00:03:13.000> steering<00:03:13.720> stem

little<00:03:19.060> difficulty<00:03:19.780> driving<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.320> out<00:03:20.500> we

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
little difficulty driving it out we

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.490 
little difficulty driving it out we
decided<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.700> remove<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.240> electronic<00:03:22.750> box<00:03:23.140> and

using a punch and a hammer which is the

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.330 
using a punch and a hammer which is the
most<00:06:36.550> common<00:06:37.000> fashion<00:06:37.710> however<00:06:38.710> if<00:06:38.949> you<00:06:39.099> have

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
most common fashion however if you have

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.610 
most common fashion however if you have
a<00:06:39.370> special<00:06:39.789> spanner<00:06:40.330> wrench<00:06:40.660> you<00:06:41.259> can<00:06:41.440> use

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
a special spanner wrench you can use

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.540 
a special spanner wrench you can use
that<00:06:41.889> and<00:06:43.440> the<00:06:44.440> trick<00:06:44.650> to<00:06:44.680> this<00:06:45.009> step<00:06:45.310> in<00:06:45.460> the

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
that and the trick to this step in the

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.330 
that and the trick to this step in the
operation<00:06:46.210> is<00:06:46.419> to<00:06:46.810> tighten<00:06:47.500> down<00:06:47.530> the<00:06:47.740> nut<00:06:48.069> to

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
operation is to tighten down the nut to

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.939 
operation is to tighten down the nut to
the<00:06:48.460> point<00:06:48.759> where<00:06:49.750> it<00:06:49.960> is<00:06:50.080> securely<00:06:50.530> in<00:06:50.770> place

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:50.949 
the point where it is securely in place

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.040 
the point where it is securely in place
and<00:06:51.520> there's<00:06:51.699> no<00:06:51.849> up-and-down<00:06:52.449> play<00:06:52.780> in<00:06:52.960> the

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
and there's no up-and-down play in the
