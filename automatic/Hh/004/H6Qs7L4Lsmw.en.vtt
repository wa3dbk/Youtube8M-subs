00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.130
 hello everyone again here in charlie 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.450
 Victor and this time we are going to teach them 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.400
 how is this painting the armor of 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.680
 Many leather do not know about the playstation3 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.029
 how this is done, many are going to 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.029
 try but do not know 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.200
 same not for now it is not but 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.930
 good and then be 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.430
 the first thing we have to do 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.430
 put on the armor 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:46.800
 we take the red of the color they want 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.800
 we press 4 on the armor 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.340
 4 with the dye and it will be painted as well as 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.030
 come in the helmet you can also with 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.030
 Other colors 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.519
 that's what the armor would look like 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.519
 if they can see 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.799
 you can also yellow yellow 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:35.550
 green red tone all colors can 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.550
 and maybe I'm going to observe 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.560
 Hello 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.369
 the green 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.650
 yes 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.360
 oranges and reds look good but 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.750
 everyone looks like they want to know if 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.750
 they want 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.600
 if the big ones are the red you do not notice 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.620
 a lot but it is good 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.620
 now a yellow 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.390
 much less 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.390
 all right 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.849
 it can be made stronger you give it more 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.030
 times and it looks more yellow that what 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.810
 discovered 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.810
 yes, I know 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.210
 They can also be a red 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.560
 it's as if they had a palette in the 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:55.540
 hand and they could see the yellow green 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.540
 but because we combine it 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:07.580
 d 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:11.110
 like green looks great purple 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.110
 let him put this vegetable 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.939
 as if of this one 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.120
 14 remember as a picture and they put the 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.160
 color that you like now orange that is not 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.590
 see so cool or it became pink 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.830
 of orange does not look so nice because it's 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.290
 like the color of leather but more more 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.870
 clear more or less 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.290
 as the prettiest color that has been seen 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.510
 so far is the blue this blue 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.290
 west also the other one also puts the 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.790
 dark that is also the dark when doing 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.510
 many times very beautiful see 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.340
 I want clear also very beautiful very 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.209
 Well, there is not much difference but 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.090
 let's be clear and he touched it in pencil 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.849
 blue and blue sign and blue and blue 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.239
 you're really blue and very young 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:14.790
 This is one of the last and most Chinese 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:19.650
 one of the last witnesses 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.650
 I think I think they paint us I do not know 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.640
 It gives you a lot the truth is that I like the 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.530
 blue as it is with this color of leather 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.180
 but I also like a lot the yellow 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.180
 so there will be many 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:41.200
 to make that color combinations of 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.020
 color as we had already told you 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.340
 well that's how it looks, I hope 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.060
 you liked that of the like and the 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:56.210
 last time I do not remember if I remember well 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:59.900
 I am teaching what was multiply 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:03.139
 exactly what it was to multiply the 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.249
 gold the easiest way all shapes 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.279
 the easiest way 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:10.769
 it was a bit difficult but not so much 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:14.839
 I hope you liked it already 

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:14.839
 how beautiful it looks 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.620
