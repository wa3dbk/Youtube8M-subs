on a towel and it'll dry within half an

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
on a towel and it'll dry within half an
hour<00:01:22.860> or<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.490> wanted<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> speed<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.420> up

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
hour or if you wanted to speed it up

hour or if you wanted to speed it up
beat<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> blow<00:01:25.020> dry<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.890> take

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
beat the blow dry it that would take

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.880 
beat the blow dry it that would take
like<00:01:26.250> two<00:01:26.580> minutes<00:01:27.229> because<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.470> stuff<00:01:28.680> does

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
like two minutes because the stuff does

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.819 
like two minutes because the stuff does
evaporate<00:01:29.369> pretty<00:01:29.579> quickly<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.960> really

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
evaporate pretty quickly but it's really

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
evaporate pretty quickly but it's really
good<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.250> freshening<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.820> your<00:01:33.180> extensions

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
good for freshening up your extensions

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.560 
good for freshening up your extensions
and<00:01:34.400> it<00:01:35.400> smells<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:35.909> nice<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and it smells really nice it's like a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.280 
and it smells really nice it's like a
citrusy<00:01:37.110> fragrance<00:01:38.030> but<00:01:39.030> totally<00:01:39.540> deodorizes

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
citrusy fragrance but totally deodorizes

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.010 
citrusy fragrance but totally deodorizes
them<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.970> know<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.390> saves<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.840> time

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
them and then you know it saves you time

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.600 
them and then you know it saves you time
and<00:01:43.079> hassle<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.009> don't<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.460> let

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
and hassle and you don't have to let

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.810 
and hassle and you don't have to let
your<00:01:44.729> extensions<00:01:45.299> dry<00:01:45.600> overnight<00:01:46.820> because

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
your extensions dry overnight because

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.399 
your extensions dry overnight because
it's<00:01:48.240> always<00:01:48.420> better<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.020> air<00:01:49.200> dry

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
it's always better if you air dry

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
it's always better if you air dry
extensions<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:51.060> actually<00:01:51.420> feels

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
extensions but this actually feels

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.960 
extensions but this actually feels
almost<00:01:51.840> dry<00:01:52.740> already<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.280> pretty<00:01:53.520> quick<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
almost dry already it's pretty quick and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.340

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
I put a whole pump in a little bit so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.039

when my hair is curly and just like fill
it<00:02:43.420> up<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.810> know<00:02:44.380> he<00:02:44.590> work<00:02:44.799> it<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.040> at<00:02:45.160> the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
it up you know he work it in at the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.740 
it up you know he work it in at the
roots<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.610> then<00:02:45.700> just<00:02:45.940> kind<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.269> comb<00:02:46.630> it

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
pretty well and I think it was only

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.440 
pretty well and I think it was only
about<00:02:50.890> five<00:02:51.310> dollars<00:02:51.579> at<00:02:51.910> Shoppers<00:02:52.209> Drug<00:02:52.239> Mart

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
about five dollars at Shoppers Drug Mart

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.360 
about five dollars at Shoppers Drug Mart

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
it'll probably get it cheaper at places

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.720 
it'll probably get it cheaper at places
