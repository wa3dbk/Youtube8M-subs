00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection High Grade Universal Century 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:12.410
 Gundam Mark 2 Titans 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.809
 High Grade Universal Century and its appearance since the end of the century in 1999 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.619
 There is a large popular Gundam series that followed 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:22.810
 The mobile suit that appears in the Universal Century 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.920
 Gundam series that's like a dream that Let the kit with the latest technology of Bandai 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.950
 Oh, 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.670
 The fact that Gunpla has continued for so long 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:36.559
 It's probably because of the increase in framed modelers. 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.460
 8 Gundam 's also good if you look at Pachi set to Kumiha are decorated by model shop of the show window's 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.660
 Is not there 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.760
 The times have changed too- 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.390
 Gundam Mark 2 is a Gundam developed by Titans as a symbol of its own power 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.470
 Camille Biddan 's father makes a messy person 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.030
 Is it because it was an aircraft that Kamille developed when the family was about to collapse? 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.650
 Camille will steal data, will cause an accident in the colony, will be robbed of English 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.990
 Is mother believers used to deal with English 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:08.190
 Fuselage of Nja Aaaa that it can be said that the Oh family discord of the symbol itself 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:11.010
 The first to introduce the Movable Frame in the basic structure is the high performance backpack that is sold 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.200
 Thanks to it, it was an aircraft with excellent maneuverability. 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.070
 Armoring material was developed from the old battlefield in the space colony though it was crowded in the old days 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.270
 To have that 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.010
 Adoption of dione technology in addition to being a rough aircraft such as causing an accident in the colony 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.960
 It wasn't so I wasn't able to pack the performance. 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:33.470
 Not only is it black impression because the body color is Titans color, it's surprisingly impressive. 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:37.820
 Shazam was the eyes also Sunge bad Gundam in the proportions 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:42.080
 After Camille came to ride in a few seconds , it was repainted white and operated 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:46.580
 It's armor material has not been changed even after forever in the main 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:52.800
 Fans of those days thought that it should be able to make a run to the original Gandalium as soon as possible 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:57.810
 Really those who ne honest I thing had been thought Nante of Ne 's what performance 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.770
 Since then the times have flowed and in Gundam work there has been a modification of the usual setting in this Gundam 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.510
 I 'm sorry 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:08.010
 Every time it is changed, it gets weak. 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:11.090
 It looks like it's a kind of shape, but the eyes are also getting kinder and it's getting cheaper 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:14.690
 It became the Gundam 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.330
 Random mark ii is 30th of High Grade Universal Century 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.920
 The kit was released in 2002 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:27.019
 Surely the price of 1000 yen is Pokkiri With this kit contents 1000 yen is said to be released at the time 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:31.080
 But there was a sense of good value quite cheap ぇ The movement range of the joint is also durable in the proportion of the modern style 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:34.430
 The power is good too and it is a recommended kit for the coming back modeler Yes 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.900
 I'm not using bs either , so I'm safe for painting 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.239
 I can feel the edge a little sweet but with a thin proportion and a mark 2 in one shot 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.420
 I think that is a good work of design 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.890
 Of course this kit is a kit of Titans specifications 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.250
 In High Grade Universal Century, the kit for English use is a single kit 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.760
 I really would with a g Defensor and flying armor I'm not 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.420
 The 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.380
 The example station appeal 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.850
 There was an extra finish version of the memorial board, but it is difficult to obtain now 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.590
 Hoho with'm not even cheap above 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.240
 That's why if you want the English version of Mark 2, you can only repaint this kit white 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.040
 It was not 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:14.810
 Hey, I had a strange feeling Once repainted white 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.250
 It is noteworthy that this series is the first beam saber with hand parts on ice 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.180
 Came with 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.989
 The blade of the saber is not a clear part, and it is effective to be remodeled to replace it with a clear part 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.390
 you know 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:30.800
 In recent times, it is artistically to express the saber blade with paint, though 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:34.970
 It marked with Balkan pod 8 d 6 rifle hyper bazooka Other than 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:39.410
 I'm replacing the shield to reproduce the expansion and contraction I'm feeling marching seal too 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.620
 Do not sell the set like Dom by all means in three seasons aligned 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:47.159
 It 's strange hey yeah 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.159
 In addition, Camino mother or left arm attachment parts are disgusting
