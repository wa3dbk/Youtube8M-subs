yeah<00:01:07.140> that's<00:01:07.470> pretty<00:01:07.680> much<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.310> do

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.090 

so<00:01:17.040> make<00:01:17.220> sure<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:18.450> get<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.140> thin

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
so make sure you get a really thin

00:01:20.100 --> 00:02:19.970

sections

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.460 

so<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.120> kind<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.450> how<00:02:21.629> it<00:02:21.690> looks<00:02:21.989> when<00:02:22.290> you

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so this is kind of how it looks when you

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.640 
so this is kind of how it looks when you
wear<00:02:22.709> this<00:02:23.400> fishtail<00:02:24.000> braid<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.450> as<00:02:25.379> you<00:02:25.500> can

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
wear this fishtail braid and as you can

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.680 
wear this fishtail braid and as you can
see<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.860> already<00:02:26.040> curled<00:02:26.760> my<00:02:26.849> bangs<00:02:27.209> this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
see I already curled my bangs this

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.750 
see I already curled my bangs this
because<00:02:28.230> i<00:02:28.500> thought<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:29.069> camera<00:02:29.430> was

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
because i thought the camera was

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.869 
because i thought the camera was
recording<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.440> actually<00:02:31.709> turned<00:02:32.310> off<00:02:32.580> for

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
recording but it actually turned off for

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.509 
recording but it actually turned off for
some<00:02:33.120> reason<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.290> i'm<00:02:34.709> just<00:02:34.920> going<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.310> show

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
some reason so i'm just going to show

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.809 
some reason so i'm just going to show
you<00:02:35.580> how<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.879> do<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.470> this<00:02:37.470> my<00:02:37.709> one<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.220> half

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
you how to do it and this my one a half

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.809 
you how to do it and this my one a half
an<00:02:38.970> inch<00:02:39.120> curling<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.099> I<00:02:41.099> just<00:02:41.310> took<00:02:41.640> a

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
an inch curling I and I just took a

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.360 
an inch curling I and I just took a
really<00:02:42.150> small<00:02:42.510> section<00:02:43.049> from<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.799> banks<00:02:44.190> and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
really small section from a banks and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.729 
really small section from a banks and
then<00:02:44.519> just<00:02:44.730> wrap<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.720> around<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.470> curling

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
then just wrap it around the curling

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.660 
then just wrap it around the curling
iron<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.370> hold<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> for<00:02:48.030> about<00:02:48.269> two<00:02:48.540> seconds

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
iron and hold it for about two seconds

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.830 
iron and hold it for about two seconds
because<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.909> like<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.510> really<00:02:51.989> tight<00:02:52.349> curl<00:02:53.840> so

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
because it's like a really tight curl so

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.449 
because it's like a really tight curl so
that's<00:02:55.170> pretty<00:02:55.410> much<00:02:55.500> all<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.950> do<00:02:56.099> with<00:02:56.340> your

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
that's pretty much all you do with your

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.960 
that's pretty much all you do with your
bags<00:02:57.410> so<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.590> don't<00:02:58.859> have<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.190> curl<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.609> but<00:02:59.790> I

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
bags so you don't have to curl it but I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.229 
bags so you don't have to curl it but I
think<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.329> looks<00:03:00.359> like<00:03:01.170> more<00:03:01.470> messy<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.250> when

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
think it looks like more messy and when

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.890 
think it looks like more messy and when
you<00:03:03.359> curl<00:03:04.319> your<00:03:04.349> bags<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.150> all<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.359> stuff<00:03:06.510> so

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
you curl your bags and all that stuff so

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.770 
you curl your bags and all that stuff so
you<00:03:07.410> can<00:03:07.680> also<00:03:07.890> wear<00:03:08.190> this<00:03:08.430> book<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.970> with

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
you can also wear this book and with

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.530 
you can also wear this book and with
just<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.709> normal<00:03:10.920> braid<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.970> I'm<00:03:12.060> going<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.329> show

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540

you<00:03:12.599> how<00:03:13.079> it<00:03:13.230> looks<00:03:13.379> just<00:03:13.890> going<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:14.910> section

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629
