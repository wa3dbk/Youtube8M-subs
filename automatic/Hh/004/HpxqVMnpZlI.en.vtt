00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.040
 Video lessons 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.520
 come on if you want to bring a print here 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:23.689
 for example you are looking for your keyboard 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:29.670
 a technique called print screen sw srq 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:31.800
 shift dalsh and key on the key that I 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.380
 said I 'll tell you there to look at 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:42.110
 clear val holy try not control v 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:46.950
 What do I want now if you want to do it? 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:49.710
 on the netbook you in the netbook case 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.620
 I 'm not going to do the netbook way 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.489
 has a technique called sn 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.520
 you click on it on the print screen swr 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.670
 that's my same button but you hold it 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.280
 fn first after giving you a 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.040
 control in the comb or in the photo heats up 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.020
 in case on this computer in my 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.770
 second computer that is faster does not 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.009
 have photoscape serve as an example there 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.530
 You think I should delete if my video 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.860
 here guys because he stayed in 480p 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.650
 filmed by type who got really bad 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.939
 I think I'll shoot in HD like this 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.579
 What am I doing? 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.579
 That's why he went so fast. 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.840
 They said I was crying but I 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.979
 I moved to the new YouTube interface which 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.909
 I found her but I'm leaving in 480 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.540
 First, excuse me , guys. 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.540
 laziness of the human being 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.049
 putz that if what I was talking about is serious 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.110
 This is how to do printing 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.390
 Then you put there in the photo escape in the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.229
 now I do not understand the photoscape the same 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.519
 thing 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.349
 shift printscreen swr than the netbook 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.450
 same thing not photoscape is cooler 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.450
 who can dictate more to hand of things
