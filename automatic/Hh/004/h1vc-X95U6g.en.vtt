00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.659
 next step 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.220
 in this case we have to put a series 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.740
 of personal information as is our 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.770

 and our last name select our 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.330
 sex in this case I am a woman who is email

 enter a promotion code that I 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.170
 I do not have therefore we are going to continue 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.930
 clicking here where I agreed 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.430
 also high our account is already 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.530
 created what we have to do is 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.730
 check that we are here 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.100
 with the name that we have created that in 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.110
 this case is to focus dyn and then to 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.700
 start broadcasting we have to go 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.700
 where he puts more shows 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.700
 in this case it tells us that it is our 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.470
 first show be our first broadcast 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.870
 and that we put a name with which we 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.790
 can they locate the people then 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.329
 let's put again in the garden 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.630
 and here we have to give what would be 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.050
 emit jazz 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.330
 this page is automatically loaded 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.610
 in which we will see the data of 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.870
 mission and we are going to configure what is the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.870
 webcam and sound 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.100
 the page has already been loaded and what it does 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.170
 It is always asking us if we give 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.580
 access to the camera and microphone in 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.580
 this case we will give to allow 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.420
 and automatically we see that it is already 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.760
 our image on this side and a series 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.000
 of data here below we have to 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.500
 modify if we are interested in this case 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.720
 the two most important are these 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.959
 here the video source and source of 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.610
 audio in video source we have to 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.290
 select the camera that we have 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.239
 installed in this case gives us for 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.380
 defect one because there is only one but 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.269
 here in audio sometimes 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.060
 we can have several entries and the 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.280
 camera has built-in audio us 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.310
 will come the corporate audio of the camera and 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.410
 apart we will also leave the output of 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.269
 card microphone audio 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.319
 sound that we have installed in the 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.450
 computer 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.390
 in this case as my camera does not have 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.540
 micro then I get the card 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.540
 sound 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.130
 and you begin to admit and it is that you do not hear 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.420
 because the error is possibly in having 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.730
 correctly selected here 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.739
 the option of audio input here 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.380
 You can give more or less quality 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.060
 video to the broadcast the same as the 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.220
 classroom quality can go up the can 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.690
 download maybe more interesting you have 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.280
 good video quality not audio 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.160
 but this is something that you yourselves 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.280
 you can try at the moment we want 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.650
 start broadcasting you have to click here and 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.630
 in this other option that is to start 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.370
 recording if we want this to be 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.500
 engraved for posterity the page 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.480
 then let's give it here 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.820
 and we give to give here also so that 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.330
 let's see the test here warns us that 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.610
 it has started 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.500
 to record and if we go back to the page 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.330
 main and we go here to go to show 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.610
 What we are going to see is what is 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.320
 seeing other people being 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.320
 connecting to our page 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.890
 in this case the page has already been loaded 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.220
 in my case with a little delay 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.260
 start watching the movement here because 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.800
 It seems that when I invite and at the same time 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.720
 medium I go with a certain delay but since 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.610
 it is as easy as this would be 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.240
 the direction we would have to give to 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.979
 anyone who wants to see us 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.099
 simply what we have to do is 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.289
 give it to them so they can connect not 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:29.849
 it has more complication than this you know 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.650
 those that participated involved the 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.889
 television that in this box here 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.840
 is where people can go writing 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.210
 a comment on what you see next to 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.310
 the retransmission and finally the only thing 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.979
 tell you then a series of options that 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.190
 you can have facing the users 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.440
 see it better as it could be here in 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.110
 this case clicking on the screen 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.720
 complete the second is that we would come out of 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.810
 here and that's it if we want to stop the 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.870
 retransmission we go back 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.270
 to the camera that we had previously 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:06.230
 we came to stop broadcasting to stop 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.940
 recording and it's all I hope that it's from 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.480
 utility this other 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.480
 do not
