00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello to all cacciotti and welcome in 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:08.400
 this brand new episode we discover 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.530
 the snap shot then I was hearing one 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.950
 week and something and a few days 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.630
 so i missed a slapshot 33 and vi 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.250
 I show all the news really not 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.970
 they are too many 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.250
 at I like them as new then 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.439
 all together in a video they did 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.980
 something like this 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.330
 then think of all the colors 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.020
 all types of wood can be made 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.950
 transform into the corresponding fans e 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.280
 don bosco are called fan gates 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.680
 so now we have a lot more possibilities 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.550
 I have already talked about construction in a 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.510
 make up titta and to pick up the gate fans 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:56.280
 the recipe has changed and there are four 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.800
 pieces of wood and in the middle two sticks 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.730
 when on the contrary it is in the opposite 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.619
 previous versions 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.750
 then they updated the b with meaning 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.729
 which is updated much faster though 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.130
 go and see my last discover 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.790
 the snap shot you see that to refresh 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.770
 the ray of light put us some 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.580
 second 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:27.180
 now, instead, if you take some 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:30.420
 red you do not see that the update is 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:35.250
 instant and therefore things can be done 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.720
 rather pussies for example create this 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.380
 what I saw from the eye miss 20 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.570
 seven create type of piston arrays 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.880
 that go to change the color in 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.540
 sequence and become uses rather fia 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.890
 puff and rainbow type and have 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.479
 added this time the doors has 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.189
 made the fans for every type of wood 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.469
 they have also made doors for each type 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.329
 of wood see above each door to the 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.590
 corresponding type of wood but note 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.780
 also from the color and nothing I like them 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.459
 I like it this is a very door in 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.750
 the present style those ones 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.710
 textures that were some episodes 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.830
 facts like 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.750
 ovals stuff like this but do not tell me 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.700
 nothing this is a Japanese door 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.250
 you know the paper doors 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.630
 Japanese and those are the ones 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.030
 I really don't know what this is 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.700
 boh type the door of a cellar la 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.170
 door of a medieval house but not 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.740
 medieval like this this is more kind 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.500
 door of this donor fortress 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.920
 it is more like a peasant's house than 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.600
 half way is yes this one is one of 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.620
 the most modern ones according to me these 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.000
 things are the most modern and there are 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.550
 like i like this what's there at 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.760
 big man type golden handle and 11 here 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.330
 summer that is heavy we see that heavy 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.870
 it would be nice if it changed 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.670
 also the resistance for example this is 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.470
 the less resistant that type is even more 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.350
 quick to wait but now it's enough 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.410
 we want to smash on the internet faster 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.070
 to break this that has all the 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.750
 iron features maybe more 2 a 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.190
 split now I know the recipe does not 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.980
 will change certain has not changed for 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.810
 However, none of the top of the dolls 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:31.530
 an implementation of the would be nice 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:35.040
 genre just doesn't actually have 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.400
 these snacks were very much achieved 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.890
 but they are interesting things because of 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.830
 sure to always put on the door of 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.180
 wood the iron door tired us 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.680
 wants some news even from the point of 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.980
 view of the building because 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:54.660
 otherwise here we go on and nothing 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.110
 stephanes I think I 'll use them in some 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.720
 so i don't really know why you think of 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.500
 acacia how do they charge maybe in a 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.160
 in short, there is a red desert 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.140
 here these are children instead always 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.220
 a brothel as you know I have one 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.990
 passion for bags and even if the 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.330
 door does not convince me too fast 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:23.069
 fast but its eastern already this 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.199
 I think it's very own paper 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:28.240
 if I vertigo if they put the type card 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:33.909
 do stuff of this as a recipe 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:37.449
 look sell it birch take the pa for a 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:42.840
 little paper where taking a little more 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.840
 the effects but now I see people who 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:54.270
 they do things like this look 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:58.240
 adopted type to do the door this 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:02.099
 you imagine yourself and instead to do that 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.590
 Russian dispose of iron in the middle 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.150
 that's why you leave it empty for this 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.460
 I put in another way for this 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.930
 I would put a gold ingot in short 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.099
 understand what I intend to make even 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.139
 recipes something more appealing and 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.909
 anyway for this snap shot this 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.319
