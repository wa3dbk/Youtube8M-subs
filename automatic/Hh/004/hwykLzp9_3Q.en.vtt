 with them a lot and bad 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.960
 if you analyze we have our shopping carts we would see that we fill them 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.400
 foods rich in carbohydrates proteins and lipids that our 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.499
 organism not to spend 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.210
 It is a great energy contribution for our body and sedentary life 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.220
 that we carry the most makes us not all that energy 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.340
 for the first time in history in the western world there are more people with 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.339
 overweight problems that people in your case 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.289
 p usa is already a classic of obesity 60 percent has 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.290
 overweight and in 31 soldiers 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.570
 eat a lot of mantilla who little exercise 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.350
 that is the american way of the five and globalization has made it spread 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.350
 all over the planet 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.000
 in Spain obesity is a problem according to public authorities 15% 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.560
 of Spaniards are obese 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.790
 if we also add the people who are overweight it turns out that more than half 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.790
 of the Spaniards eat others 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.090
 the worst of all is that we are incubating weights 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.690
 Spain is the European country with the most obese children with 16% 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.360
 It is unique and too few fats vegetables and fruits and especially eat 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.400
 a lot between meals 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.320
 the bugs and poultry are his undoing and instead of drinking water they take 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.360
 sugary refreshing drinks 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.360
 an example let's review the life of a child of 10 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.580
 need a day about 2 thousand 200 kilocalories imagine that take 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.480
 a can of soda that are 130 kilos calories 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.440
 others have a contribution of 300 kilocalories 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.760
 a small appetizer judge with 200 kilocalories and a handful of sweets 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.920
 with 120 kilos Canary 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.140
 In total it will have taken 750 kilos calories a third of what 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 you need a day and you still have to add the remains of food 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.880
 if every day you take this for sure that you have plenty of kilocalories, surely not 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.430
 they get to burn because nowadays children are increasingly quiet 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.959
 they spend asÃ­n hours in front of the television and the computer without moving 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.189
 and you can say that the TV fattening 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:18.309
 We are also exporting this lifestyle to countries in the process of 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.439
 developing 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.790
 but as they struggle to end hunger at the same time they face 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.790
 obesity opposite problem 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.159
 more and more people live in cities because in the countryside they can not earn 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.339
 lifetime 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.540
 with the same fatty food as in the West of the same drinks 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:42.649
 sweetened because it is also fashionable 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:45.649
 they have also become as sedentary as we are 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.539
 It is estimated that the least developed countries could have no more 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.539
 less than about 115 million pesos 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.059
 and the worst is that obesity is another model of malnutrition 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.760
 although some poor people are overweight that does not mean that 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.649
 are better fed 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:08.119
 Obesity often covers deficiencies in the consumption of vitamins and 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:11.119
 minerals 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.599
 taking stock the statistics say that in the world there are so many people that 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.929
 they go hungry like overweight people 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:20.180
 a billion people go hungry 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.700
 another billion are overweight and 300 million are obese 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.859
 they are figures to reflect
