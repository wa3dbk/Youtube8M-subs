00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.670
 Malaysia second race of the calendar on 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.020
 this circuit 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.110
 i rally brings the same combination 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.880
 seen on the track in 2012 0 hard 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.679
 characterized this year by the band 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.480
 orange and 30 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.270
 the orange zero is the best solution 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.470
 hard and conservative of the pirelli range 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.829
 ideal in a race that requires a 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.630
 exceptional commitment to the tires 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.490
 the fairly abrasive asphalt accentuates 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.529
 both the phenomena of usury also those of 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.820
 thermal degradation due to high 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.760
 energy transmitted to the opinion 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.589
 to this are added weather conditions 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.420
 extremely variable with high 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.879
 temperatures and possibility of rains 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.680
 torrential even in the absence of rain 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.680
 the humidity touches eighty percent 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.719
 new hard and softer compound than 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.030
 that used in 2020 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.539
 so much so that terms can be compared 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.339
 last year's performance average is 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.289
 completely changed the range of 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.809
 optimal usage has become higher is 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.479
 rendered similar to that of the stop with the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.840
 hard compound 2013 of the hard compound 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.670
 2012 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.420
 aspect of performance improvement of 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.759
 about 4 5 tenths of a second per lap 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.110
 all p zero orange will be placed side by side 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.360
 I worked the year 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.460
 normally developed to be used 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.560
 as first he finds his own in Malaysia 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.320
 natural connotation as an option 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.880
 soft and more aggressive in sepang ha 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.130
 in fact the tires are 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.259
 particularly stressed having to 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.820
 guarantee performance with temperatures of 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.500
 exercise that reach peaks of 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.930
 over 130 degrees Celsius 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.000
 on the inside of the tread a 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.600
 due to lateral accelerations that 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.670
 they even reach 3.9 down further 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.530
 critical element is represented by 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.080
 high temperatures that make more 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.789
 difficult heat dissipation e 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.340
 risk generating phenomena of 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.080
 overheating the high temperatures of the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.420
 traced a run a pretty track 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.580
 abrasive could lead to phenomena 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.920
 of degradation rather high and higher 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.869
 to those seen in Australia at medium the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.819
 pit stop last year was three 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.929
 stop by car and for this year there 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.929
 expect similar strategies
