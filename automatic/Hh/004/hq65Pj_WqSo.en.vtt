00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello you love today I wanted completely 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.930
 like to show where am I mine ? 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.170
 Keep this color with me 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.000
 mix my farm together i have 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.190
 Draw these colors are applied 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.080
 you have the pure colors and these 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.000
 colors i often like colored genes 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.420
 Together in shades I want you to have them 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.310
 or camouflage tele or klier design 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.380
 Gels or something, so always if I am 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.720
 colors along with I use these 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.810
 I have always had experience 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.700
 kept a whole in this bit 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.750
 crate of let's put it in there so 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.920
 if I just go now 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.590
 I want to get a mission like that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.270
 bit out, write down the lids 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.960
 uses the gel writes like 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.550
 again to 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.530
 and so I have the whole set of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.210
 this money potty what it laboriously 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.590
 it is just the constant on and off 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.300
 I know from the beginning 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.860
 not even if maybe still a breath 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.480
 the money needs more in or out 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.280
 a bit headless even more in it 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.930
 and so is always laborious about legal 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.489
 run daily to screw 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.649
 So I was looking for a solution 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.840
 where I keep these genes so that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.000
 they are always open anyway 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.830
 light and dust are protected and have 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.560
 now an alternative found for me 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.000
 That's an age here 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.409
 watercolor box i had the old one 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.760
 watercolor box but that looks like that 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.290
 ugly that I do not show 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.409
 So I wanted to buy a new one 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.750
 The cost now 15 euros plus 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.880
 shipping and these boxes have it here 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.950
 a metal lid of the outside 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.810
 black painted in white so 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.340
 absolutely light and dust protected 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.750
 the Indian woman is one more 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.430
 gatefold cover of once again to protect 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.500
 serves on the colors as well 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.150
 can mix and see in here now 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.009
 just this gille I use those now 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.259
 have been for months as months 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.460
 They are here in exactly this form 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.049
 always open at the top 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.970
 you can see it does not go away 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.380
 it does not smudge it does not get the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.270
 each one always stays in this pot 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.329
 and now I can just wonderful here 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.710
 I did not have that kind of gel 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.320
 I would like to have a little bit here now 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.880
 in this potty that we together 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.009
 They always mix me up like that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.110
 small spatula and then we take the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.090
 appropriate colors out pran gel 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.740
 one and can me so individually my 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.780
 on 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.670
 nice if I'm ready then believe 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.100
 I put the whole thing back together and put 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.319
 back in the corner and protected from dust 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.510
 ready for next use 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.319
 then I wish a lot of fun until the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.319
 next time bye
