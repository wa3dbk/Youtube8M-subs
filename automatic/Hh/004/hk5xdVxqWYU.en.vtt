00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
room like quite often so when we're

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.810

listening<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.440> music<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.070> lot<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.610> kids<00:02:14.730> like

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
listening to music a lot of kids like

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.270

listen to like rap and stuff and so when

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.490 
listen to like rap and stuff and so when
I<00:02:17.310> put<00:02:17.580> on<00:02:17.610> Katy<00:02:17.940> Perry<00:02:18.240> or<00:02:18.420> Taylor<00:02:18.450> Swift<00:02:18.690> it's

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
I put on Katy Perry or Taylor Swift it's

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.250 
I put on Katy Perry or Taylor Swift it's
called<00:02:19.800> gay<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.550> probably<00:02:21.480> heard<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.870> most<00:02:22.050> at

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
called gay I probably heard the most at

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.230 
called gay I probably heard the most at
home<00:02:22.290> around<00:02:22.860> my<00:02:23.280> brother's<00:02:23.610> friends<00:02:24.090> and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
home around my brother's friends and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.840 
home around my brother's friends and
they<00:02:25.080> still<00:02:25.320> say<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.650> lot<00:02:25.890> around<00:02:26.070> me<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.700> I

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
they still say it a lot around me and I

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.370 
they still say it a lot around me and I
tell<00:02:27.060> them<00:02:27.209> not<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> think<00:02:27.900> they<00:02:28.140> do<00:02:28.200> it

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
tell them not to and I think they do it

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.800 
tell them not to and I think they do it
probably<00:02:28.740> just<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.980> make<00:02:29.100> me<00:02:29.250> mad<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.510> think

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
probably just to make me mad but I think

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.050 
probably just to make me mad but I think
they<00:02:31.650> think<00:02:31.860> about<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.190> more<00:02:32.370> around<00:02:32.850> other

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
they think about it more around other

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.220 
they think about it more around other
people<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.510> they<00:02:33.570> don't<00:02:33.750> say<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.020> as<00:02:34.110> much

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
people and they don't say it as much

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.540 
people and they don't say it as much
around<00:02:34.440> other<00:02:34.650> people<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.160> hopefully<00:02:35.310> it

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
around other people and hopefully it

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.850 
around other people and hopefully it
makes<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.790> difference<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.590> remember<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.709> first

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
makes a difference I remember the first

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.800 
makes a difference I remember the first
time<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.160> heard<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.910> word<00:02:38.940> gay<00:02:39.540> use
