00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.540 

I<00:00:09.900> just<00:00:10.900> picked<00:00:11.080> up<00:00:11.200> this<00:00:11.350> new<00:00:11.620> 10,000<00:00:12.370> watt

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
I just picked up this new 10,000 watt

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.450 
I just picked up this new 10,000 watt
diesel<00:00:12.970> generator<00:00:13.890> normally<00:00:14.890> the<00:00:15.040> generator

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
diesel generator normally the generator

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.430 
diesel generator normally the generator
is<00:00:15.640> set<00:00:15.820> on<00:00:15.910> the<00:00:16.030> ground<00:00:16.299> next<00:00:16.570> to<00:00:16.810> a<00:00:16.840> home<00:00:17.140> and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
is set on the ground next to a home and

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.390 
is set on the ground next to a home and
it<00:00:17.530> looks<00:00:17.740> much<00:00:17.920> smaller

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
it looks much smaller

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.540 
it looks much smaller
I<00:00:19.050> had<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.200> generator<00:00:20.650> put<00:00:20.950> on<00:00:21.040> this<00:00:21.190> trailer

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
I had the generator put on this trailer

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.280 
I had the generator put on this trailer
so<00:00:21.820> I<00:00:21.850> could<00:00:22.029> take<00:00:22.180> it<00:00:22.240> up<00:00:22.390> to<00:00:22.540> my<00:00:22.660> garage<00:00:22.960> and

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
so I could take it up to my garage and

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.159 
so I could take it up to my garage and
play<00:00:23.710> around<00:00:23.830> with<00:00:24.010> it<00:00:24.189> a<00:00:24.279> little<00:00:24.369> bit<00:00:25.169> it

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
play around with it a little bit it

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.260 
play around with it a little bit it
didn't<00:00:26.470> take<00:00:26.590> me<00:00:26.740> very<00:00:26.770> long<00:00:27.040> to<00:00:27.220> add<00:00:27.460> oil<00:00:27.759> fuel

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
didn't take me very long to add oil fuel

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.100 
didn't take me very long to add oil fuel
and<00:00:28.540> antifreeze<00:00:28.960> and<00:00:29.470> connect<00:00:29.919> the<00:00:30.040> battery

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.390 

after<00:00:35.110> starting<00:00:35.470> it<00:00:35.590> up<00:00:35.680> I<00:00:35.860> played<00:00:36.130> with<00:00:36.280> this

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
after starting it up I played with this

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.030 
after starting it up I played with this
adjustable<00:00:37.030> voltage<00:00:37.239> regulator<00:00:38.050> and<00:00:38.140> noticed

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
adjustable voltage regulator and noticed

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.770 
adjustable voltage regulator and noticed
how<00:00:39.160> I<00:00:39.190> can<00:00:39.460> swing<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.910> voltage<00:00:40.270> up<00:00:40.450> and<00:00:40.630> down

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
how I can swing the voltage up and down

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.959 
how I can swing the voltage up and down
depending<00:00:41.110> on<00:00:41.350> my<00:00:41.530> needs<00:00:41.560> or<00:00:42.039> what<00:00:42.520> country<00:00:42.760> I

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
depending on my needs or what country I

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.939 
depending on my needs or what country I
want<00:00:43.210> to<00:00:43.270> use<00:00:43.420> a<00:00:43.449> generator<00:00:43.899> in<00:00:44.199> some<00:00:44.739> places

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949
