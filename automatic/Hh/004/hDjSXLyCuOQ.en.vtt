 of his parents or also of his 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.420
 teachers in the schoolyard 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.250

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.650
 same luck to marx when such inter 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.650
 good 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.720
 says the word of the Lord that everyone 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.050
 who practices sin is from his father the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.700
 devil and where you can easily 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.430
 educate your way but really this 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.670
 dangerous game causes you effects 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.620
 such as not sleeping or listening 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.200
 many voices it occurs that you 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.420
 you can see things because of this or for 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.700
 keep playing and can not get out of the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.700
 Even tie can cause you 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.450
 that the word of the Lord is very clear and 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.450
 I presented it to you on screen 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.400
 for three please attention to our 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.440
 children in schools have a lot 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.330
 Be careful with them you know how to get away and 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.550
 look for the right way belief in your 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.430
 Christ and only he can illuminate your life 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.560

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.020

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.150
 things that are really going wrong 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.000
 until you really know you have 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.290
 the right decision to be able 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.760
