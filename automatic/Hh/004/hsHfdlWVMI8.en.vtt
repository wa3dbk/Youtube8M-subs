just went really well because the
questions<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.450> I'd<00:02:40.630> revised<00:02:40.900> came<00:02:41.680> up<00:02:41.830> which

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
questions that I'd revised came up which

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.590 
questions that I'd revised came up which
was<00:02:42.280> very<00:02:42.880> handy<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:45.030> I'll<00:02:46.030> get<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.239> collies

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
was very handy and I'll get that collies

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.000 
was very handy and I'll get that collies
and<00:02:47.190> then<00:02:48.190> tomorrow<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:50.260> issues<00:02:50.620> and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
and then tomorrow I have issues and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.890 
and then tomorrow I have issues and
archaeological<00:02:51.489> sites<00:02:51.700> which<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.540> as<00:02:52.840> it

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
archaeological sites which is as it

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.990 
archaeological sites which is as it
sounds<00:02:53.350> been<00:02:53.530> more<00:02:53.650> sciency<00:02:54.069> but<00:02:54.250> also<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.940> bit

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
sounds been more sciency but also a bit

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.130 
sounds been more sciency but also a bit
more<00:02:55.209> straightforward<00:02:55.770> luckily<00:02:56.770> and

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
more straightforward luckily and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.930 
more straightforward luckily and
there'll<00:02:59.140> be<00:02:59.200> questions<00:02:59.470> like<00:02:59.940> what's

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
there'll be questions like what's

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.940 
there'll be questions like what's
radiocarbon<00:03:01.570> dating<00:03:02.050> what's<00:03:02.470> marine

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
radiocarbon dating what's marine

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.250 
radiocarbon dating what's marine
geophysics<00:03:03.550> what's<00:03:04.019> above<00:03:05.019> ground

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
geophysics what's above ground

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.449 
geophysics what's above ground
geophysics<00:03:06.060> think<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:08.280> yeah<00:03:09.280> there

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
geophysics think so that so yeah there

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.550 
geophysics think so that so yeah there
is<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.580> bit<00:03:09.760> more<00:03:09.910> straightforward<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.600> in<00:03:11.320> my

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
is a bit more straightforward and in my

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.850 
is a bit more straightforward and in my
in<00:03:11.830> my<00:03:11.890> head<00:03:12.150> office<00:03:13.150> in<00:03:13.480> my<00:03:14.050> experience<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.680> bit

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
in my head office in my experience a bit

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.520 
in my head office in my experience a bit
easier<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.630> bit<00:03:17.350> more<00:03:17.380> comments<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.400> C<00:03:19.530> so

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
easier and a bit more comments in C so

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.290 
easier and a bit more comments in C so
yeah<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.280> then<00:03:21.850> after<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.090> i'm<00:03:22.300> free<00:03:22.330> so

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
yeah and then after that i'm free so

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.630 
yeah and then after that i'm free so

so yep we have our bottle gun three even
comes<00:04:28.390> with<00:04:28.480> its<00:04:28.720> own<00:04:28.780> portly<00:04:29.170> sounds<00:04:29.530> and

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
comes with its own portly sounds and

comes with its own portly sounds and
I've<00:04:30.430> just<00:04:30.610> remembered<00:04:30.760> that<00:04:30.970> I<00:04:31.060> forgot<00:04:31.090> the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
I've just remembered that I forgot the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.800 
I've just remembered that I forgot the
chains<00:04:31.540> of<00:04:31.630> configs<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:33.150> what<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.360> think<00:04:34.690> ever

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
chains of configs so what I think ever

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.220 
chains of configs so what I think ever
there<00:04:34.990> no<00:04:35.290> there<00:04:35.980> and<00:04:36.570> like<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.750> game<00:04:37.930> it

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
there no there and like the game it

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.200 
there no there and like the game it
fires<00:04:38.560> a<00:04:38.680> portal<00:04:39.040> a<00:04:39.220> blue<00:04:39.670> portal<00:04:40.000> with<00:04:40.150> the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
fires a portal a blue portal with the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.670 
fires a portal a blue portal with the
left<00:04:40.390> click<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:40.810> an<00:04:41.020> orange<00:04:41.140> bottle<00:04:41.380> with<00:04:41.620> the

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
left click and an orange bottle with the

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.830 
left click and an orange bottle with the
right<00:04:41.800> click<00:04:42.010> and<00:04:42.600> because<00:04:43.600> i<00:04:43.690> haven't

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
right click and because i haven't

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.870 
right click and because i haven't
changed<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.230> configs<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:45.040> these<00:04:45.430> portals

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
changed the configs it these portals

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.640 
changed the configs it these portals
show<00:04:46.060> me<00:04:46.210> moving<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:46.720> usually<00:04:47.050> have<00:04:47.170> it<00:04:47.290> static

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
portal gun and for testing purposes i'll

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.230 
portal gun and for testing purposes i'll
leave<00:05:16.690> this<00:05:16.840> down<00:05:17.020> here<00:05:17.230> and<00:05:17.680> then<00:05:18.430> come<00:05:18.790> back

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
leave this down here and then come back

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.970 
leave this down here and then come back
up<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:21.100> you'll<00:05:22.090> see<00:05:22.350> what<00:05:23.350> i<00:05:23.410> mean<00:05:23.530> when<00:05:23.680> it
