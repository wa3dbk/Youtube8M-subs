head as arrangements and so it's like 10
so<00:04:03.360> I<00:04:03.690> knew<00:04:04.350> exactly<00:04:04.470> what<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:05.010> do<00:04:05.100> what<00:04:05.310> I

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
so I knew exactly what to do what I

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.130 
so I knew exactly what to do what I
would<00:04:05.580> do<00:04:05.730> if<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:05.970> got<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.209> opportunity<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:06.990> I

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
would do if I got the opportunity and I

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.590 
would do if I got the opportunity and I
just<00:04:07.170> never<00:04:07.470> took<00:04:07.740> it<00:04:07.890> as<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.040> fan<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.450> now

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
just never took it as a fan and so now

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.240 
just never took it as a fan and so now
I'm<00:04:09.660> taking<00:04:10.170> another<00:04:10.230> way<00:04:10.440> forward<00:04:10.740> guy<00:04:10.890> and

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
I'm taking another way forward guy and

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.160 
I'm taking another way forward guy and
uh<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.820> it's<00:04:12.090> sort<00:04:12.300> of<00:04:12.360> default<00:04:12.600> altogether

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
uh and it's sort of default altogether

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.890 
uh and it's sort of default altogether
every<00:04:13.890> every<00:04:14.370> take<00:04:14.610> on<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.880> bird<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.660> really

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
every every take on the bird is really

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.470 
every every take on the bird is really
special<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.590> don't<00:04:17.040> tend<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.310> hear<00:04:17.549> bad<00:04:18.090> ones<00:04:18.359> I

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
special I don't tend to hear bad ones I

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.490 
special I don't tend to hear bad ones I
think<00:04:18.660> it's<00:04:18.780> just<00:04:18.900> because<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.200> composition

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
think it's just because the composition

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.920 
think it's just because the composition
is<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:19.920> cool<00:04:20.160> so<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:21.150> think<00:04:21.419> it's<00:04:21.600> really<00:04:21.780> good

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
is so cool so I think it's really good

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.659 
is so cool so I think it's really good
