00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
especially in my opinion really bring

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.180

the<00:01:44.300> figure<00:01:44.690> together<00:01:45.050> and<00:01:45.410> even<00:01:45.920> though<00:01:46.099> it's

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
the figure together and even though it's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.830 
the figure together and even though it's
supposed<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.399> be<00:01:46.489> this<00:01:46.610> evil<00:01:47.060> badass<00:01:47.539> mofo

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
supposed to be this evil badass mofo

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.479 
supposed to be this evil badass mofo
he's<00:01:48.289> got<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.500> really<00:01:48.920> boyish<00:01:49.489> looking<00:01:49.759> face

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:51.489 
he's got a really boyish looking face

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:53.529 
he's got a really boyish looking face
and<00:01:52.489> I<00:01:52.520> like<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.700> fact<00:01:52.849> that<00:01:53.090> they<00:01:53.270> made<00:01:53.420> is

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
and I like the fact that they made is

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.870 
and I like the fact that they made is
Kanan<00:01:53.840> black<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.830> green<00:01:55.099> with<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.550> gray

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
Kanan black and green with the gray

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.760 
Kanan black and green with the gray
trigger<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:56.599> it<00:01:56.660> really<00:01:56.840> ties<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.410> in<00:01:57.560> with<00:01:57.739> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
trigger so it really ties it in with the
