00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.680
 of delicious oatmeal bananas 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.690
 the ingredients that we need are a 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.000
 cup of wheat flour 2 cups of flakes 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.590
 oatmeal a teaspoon of cinnamon half 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.230
 teaspoon baking soda 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.060
 half a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.579
 sugar this for the dry ingredients 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.619
 for the wet ones we need two bananas 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.539
 or medium-size bananas chopped 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.880
 teaspoon vanilla essence a 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.310
 quarter cup of sunflower oil 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.199
 half cup of raisins fourth cup 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.829
 of nuts or any other type of fruit 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.920
 dry let's start first mixing 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.620
 all the dry ingredients that's why 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.190
 first we add the flour cup 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.730
 wheat then the two cups of the flakes 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.940
 of oatmeal then we're going to add a 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.100
 teaspoon of cinnamon 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.660
 for these measures you can use the 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.140
 typical meter for example that I'm 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.850
 using now is the ikea but this what 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.219
 you get anywhere if you do not 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.230
 you can find a table of equivalences 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.640
 that there's a lot of good on the internet 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.100
 we have added the teaspoon of 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.259
 cinnamon we are now adding half 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.659
 teaspoon of baking soda and 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.479
 half a teaspoon of salt the bicarbonate 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.170
 of sodium you can replace it with the 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.990
 Baking powder or baking powder 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.580
 which is also called is the same is 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.100
 just to gasify a bit the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.899
 mass then we add half a cup of sugar 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.840
 You can also add a little more 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:33.920
 depending on how you like the banana 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.740
 it's pretty sweet then it does not 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.960
 you need to add a lot of sugar you can go 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.039
 trying good now we go with the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.110
 wet ingredients 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.979
 What we do is peel the two bananas 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.440
 and step on them to make it easier to 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.970
 handle them once stepped on let's add 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.700
 a teaspoon of vanilla essence 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.990
 this gives a lot of flavor but if you do not have 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.149
 at home 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.149
 you can not throw him 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.630
 then we add a fourth cup of oil 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.119
 of sunflower half a cup of raisins or 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.729
 any other product as I said before 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.710
 they can be chocolate chips and fourth 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.860
 house of nuts or dried fruits 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.450
 we mix everything well and add the 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.270
 dry ingredients that we already had 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.610
 mixed as you see right away 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.530
 moistens the dough and is very easy in the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.520
 half a minute is all united 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.950
 Now we preheat the oven to 175 180 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.430
 degrees for 10 minutes and while 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.800
 we are placing in the form of cookies the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.310
 you can put it in a fountain 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.520
 butter or paper towels as 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.850
 you see that I am using myself so that 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.060
 they're going to cook 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.260
 for 15 minutes to get some 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.300
 soft cookies not too hard and during 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.010
 20 minutes if we want more 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.980
 crunchy and we want them to spread 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.550
