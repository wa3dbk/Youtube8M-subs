read them you can pause the video I also

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.410 
read them you can pause the video I also
have<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.710> DVD<00:00:41.430> copy<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.239> comparison

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
have the DVD copy just for comparison

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.119 
have the DVD copy just for comparison
you<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.170> front<00:00:46.440> cover<00:00:46.739> artwork

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you can see that the front cover artwork

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.439 
you can see that the front cover artwork
is<00:00:47.489> pretty<00:00:48.210> much<00:00:48.360> exactly<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.140> same<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:51.090> then

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
is pretty much exactly the same and then

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.180 
is pretty much exactly the same and then
on<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> back<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.170> artwork<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> little

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
on the back the artwork is a little

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.670 
on the back the artwork is a little
different<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.629> think<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> bonus

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
different and I think that the bonus

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.760 
different and I think that the bonus
features<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:56.250> probably<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.120> same<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:58.500> does

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
features are probably the same it does

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.979 
features are probably the same it does
mention<00:00:59.100> different<00:00:59.820> stuff<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.539> each<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.870> them

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
mention different stuff on each of them

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.189 
mention different stuff on each of them
but<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> says<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> more<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.030> blu-ray<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
but it says and more on the blu-ray so I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.250 
but it says and more on the blu-ray so I
think<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.920> they're<00:01:05.400> probably<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
think that they're probably all all the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.990 
think that they're probably all all the
DVD<00:01:07.680> ones<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.070> included<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> blu-ray

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
DVD ones are included in the blu-ray

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.660 
DVD ones are included in the blu-ray
here<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.600> would<00:01:10.170> imagine<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.830> anyways<00:01:11.250> but

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
here I would imagine so anyways but

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.649 
here I would imagine so anyways but
let's<00:01:12.150> take<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:12.990> take<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> closer<00:01:13.920> look

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
let's take this out take a closer look

and everything on the blu-ray pack is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.450 
and everything on the blu-ray pack is
the<00:01:21.780> same<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> slipcover<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.040> let's<00:01:23.250> open
