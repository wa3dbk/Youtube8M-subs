 We are going to learn how to make jala bread 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.869
 the hard bread is the bread that we 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.669
 we prepare for every Saturday but also 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.770
 you men must learn to 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.110
 offer what in this boy party is 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.149
 the list of ingredients you can see 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.360
 down here, however, I'm going to 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.360
 to mention 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.220
 the ingredients are a kilo of flour 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.890
 of wheat half a cup of olive oil 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:50.540
 two tablespoons of yeast one 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.470
 teaspoon of salt 4 eggs 18 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.470
 tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:03.659
 and for the filling is not blueberries or 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:07.750
 dried fruit that is to taste to decorate 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:11.159
 sesame and an egg to varnish and 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.159
 stay golden 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.780
 first let's mix the yeast with 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.460
 the glass of warm water we stir and 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.460
 let stand about 10 minutes 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.770
 while the yeast is resting we are going to 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.660
 Mix the flour in a bowl 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.850
 teaspoon of salt around 3 eggs 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.250
 here it is important to mention that it is a 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.340
 good habit to break each egg 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.860
 first in a transparent container 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.800
 to verify that it is in good 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.500
 been and have no blood once 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.720
 let's see that it is fresh and has no blood 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.450
 we incorporate it into the mix and go 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.670
 stirring we also add the sugar and 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.850
 finally the mix we made with the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.850
 yeast is added at this time 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.670
 now we are going to incorporate all this and 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.800
 we add the oil we keep stirring 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.700
 if we see that the mass is being very 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.770
 dry we can put a little more water 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.930
 when it is more incorporated all 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.590
 We remove the dough from the container to 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.590
 knead it 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.760
 once it is uniform and we see that 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.360
 do not stick it let it rest on the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.360
 we cover it with a plastic and 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.780
 we cover it with a cloth we let it rest 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.670
 until it doubles its size 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.430
 about an hour and a half hour 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.910
 since it doubled its size we started with 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.910
 the braided 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:15.410
 we divide the dough into two equal parts 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.410
 and then in three parts each 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.360
 We passed each of the three parts 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.180
 to make it longer 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.969
 and we arrange them in the form of a letter 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.020
 but remember that with the letter Sin 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:40.199
 write and assume and also nothing and then 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.460
 we make a braid so we do with the 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.460
 another part of the mass 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.110
 in a tray we put flour and over 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.050
 the waxed paper and we put a little 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:06.800
 more than flour and we can put the bread 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:10.130
 over in a container we are going to beat a 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.610
 egg and with a varnish brush masters the 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:17.390
 breads with the egg after we sprinkle 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.890
 some seeds like chilli sesame or 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.890
 some seed of your preference 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.600
 we will get the bread baked 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.420
 temperature must be 180 degrees 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.360
 put about 30 to 35 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.630
 minutes or until it is golden brown 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.060
 bread we can put a wooden stick or 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.830

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.830
