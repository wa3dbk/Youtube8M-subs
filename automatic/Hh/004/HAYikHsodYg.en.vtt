00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
melody to make the melody stand out and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.029 
melody to make the melody stand out and
then<00:00:24.330> then<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> next<00:00:24.869> video<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.769> talked

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
then then in the next video we we talked

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.140 
then then in the next video we we talked
about<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.430> fills<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.570> recall<00:00:28.010> after

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
about the fills and if you recall after

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.630 
about the fills and if you recall after
after<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> melody<00:00:30.570> stops<00:00:31.170> or<00:00:31.859> pauses<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.460> that

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
after the melody stops or pauses at that

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.910 
after the melody stops or pauses at that
point<00:00:32.940> then<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.239> used<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.630> feel<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
point then we used to feel like like a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.459 
point then we used to feel like like a
run<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.309> four<00:00:35.640> octave<00:00:35.940> Ronnie

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.690 

that's<00:00:41.980> all<00:00:42.190> blah<00:00:42.489> cords

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.850 

and<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.880> said<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.470> at<00:00:49.620> some

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and I said we get to do and at some

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.420 
and I said we get to do and at some
point<00:00:50.040> we<00:00:50.130> just<00:00:50.160> echo<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> echo<00:00:51.000> other<00:00:51.420> Court

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.000 

and<00:00:56.580> then<00:00:57.330> we<00:00:57.720> took<00:00:57.900> up<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.170> half<00:00:58.350> steps<00:00:58.710> light

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and then we took up a half steps light

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.220 
and then we took up a half steps light
there<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.880> slid<00:01:00.210> from<00:01:00.450> a<00:01:00.540> flat<00:01:00.840> seventh

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
there or we slid from a flat seventh

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.820 
there or we slid from a flat seventh
down<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> seventh

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:15.470 

back<00:01:05.310> to<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> runs

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.860 

go

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.290 

and<00:01:19.870> I<00:01:20.050> saved<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.440> middle<00:01:20.770> or<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.910> second

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
and I saved the middle or the the second

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.490 
and I saved the middle or the the second
part<00:01:22.540> till<00:01:22.930> now

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
part till now

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.590 
part till now
hey<00:01:23.710> when<00:01:24.010> we<00:01:24.100> got<00:01:24.250> home<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.670> one<00:01:24.910> we<00:01:25.240> went<00:01:25.450> down

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
hey when we got home to one we went down

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.460 
hey when we got home to one we went down
a<00:01:25.630> whole<00:01:25.900> step<00:01:26.080> to<00:01:26.560> B<00:01:26.950> flat<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:28.120> came<00:01:29.080> up<00:01:29.260> by

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
a whole step to B flat and came up by

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.220 
a whole step to B flat and came up by
half<00:01:29.680> steps<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.310> be<00:01:30.520> okay<00:01:31.210> so<00:01:31.750> that<00:01:31.900> brings<00:01:32.020> us

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
half steps to be okay so that brings us

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.410 
half steps to be okay so that brings us
to<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.470> next<00:01:32.710> section<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.610> I<00:01:34.000> think<00:01:34.210> in<00:01:34.300> the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
to the next section and I think in the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.940 
to the next section and I think in the
second<00:01:34.840> section<00:01:35.050> you<00:01:35.590> ought<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.740> do<00:01:35.920> something

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
second section you ought to do something

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.650 
second section you ought to do something
different<00:01:36.580> than<00:01:36.610> block<00:01:36.880> chords<00:01:37.330> because

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
different than block chords because

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.450 
different than block chords because
people<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.500> listeners<00:01:38.890> are<00:01:38.979> prey<00:01:39.130> on<00:01:39.250> enough

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
people the listeners are prey on enough

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.020 
people the listeners are prey on enough
of<00:01:39.550> plot<00:01:39.790> coridan<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:41.229> I<00:01:41.260> would<00:01:41.530> go<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:41.940> kind<00:01:42.940> of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
of plot coridan so I would go to kind of

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.270 
of plot coridan so I would go to kind of
a<00:01:43.120> big<00:01:43.330> sound<00:01:43.660> like<00:01:43.870> that<00:01:44.110> my<00:01:44.860> right<00:01:45.070> hands

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
a big sound like that my right hands

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.240 
a big sound like that my right hands
play<00:01:45.550> an<00:01:46.150> octave<00:01:46.360> with<00:01:46.870> one<00:01:47.320> chord<00:01:47.650> note<00:01:47.860> in

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
play an octave with one chord note in

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.430 
play an octave with one chord note in
between<00:01:48.750> his<00:01:49.750> third<00:01:51.840> octave<00:01:52.840> thirds<00:01:53.140> if<00:01:53.320> you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
between his third octave thirds if you

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.580 
between his third octave thirds if you
want<00:01:53.650> in<00:01:53.830> other<00:01:53.979> words<00:01:54.160> here's<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.000> melody

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
want in other words here's the melody

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.080 
want in other words here's the melody
and<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.860> can<00:01:56.979> put<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.160> third<00:01:57.490> under<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.850> top

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
and you can put a third under the top

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.960 
and you can put a third under the top
octave<00:01:58.660> note<00:01:58.690> wherever<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.320> sounds<00:02:00.160> decent<00:02:00.430> I

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
octave note wherever it sounds decent I

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.999 
octave note wherever it sounds decent I
wouldn't<00:02:01.570> put<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:01.720> in<00:02:01.869> there<00:02:02.140> because<00:02:02.320> that's

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
wouldn't put it in there because that's

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.359 
wouldn't put it in there because that's
an<00:02:03.280> encore<00:02:03.700> tone<00:02:04.060> but

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.670 

then<00:02:09.670> when<00:02:09.849> he<00:02:09.940> got<00:02:10.060> there<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:11.050> film<00:02:11.319> a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
then when he got there that the film a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.180 
then when he got there that the film a
good<00:02:12.489> film<00:02:12.790> would<00:02:12.910> be<00:02:13.060> an<00:02:13.150> open<00:02:13.390> octave<00:02:14.190> run

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
good film would be an open octave run

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.860 

there'd<00:02:53.530> probably<00:02:55.350> probably<00:02:56.350> do<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.650> minor<00:02:57.370> run

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
there'd probably probably do a minor run

there'd probably probably do a minor run
there<00:03:01.770> continue<00:03:02.770> with<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.040> strong<00:03:03.310> octave

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.229 

there's<00:03:15.090> kind<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> climax<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.140> song
