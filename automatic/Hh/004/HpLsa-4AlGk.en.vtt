00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
on this team certainly I had experience

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.470 
on this team certainly I had experience
with<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> national<00:00:59.550> team<00:00:59.579> before<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
with the national team before and a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.319 
with the national team before and a
little<00:01:00.960> bit<00:01:01.050> older<00:01:01.199> than<00:01:01.379> most<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> guys

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329

on<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.390> squad<00:01:03.809> already<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:04.860> that

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
on the squad already but I think that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.330 
on the squad already but I think that
that's<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.659> my<00:01:06.659> role<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> images

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that's going to be my role in the images

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.000 
that's going to be my role in the images
is<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.960> know<00:01:09.960> whatever<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.830> bring

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
is to know whatever it is to bring

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.859 
is to know whatever it is to bring
experience<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:12.030> bring<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
experience to bring you know that that

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.539 
experience to bring you know that that
commitment<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.560> no<00:01:16.740> matter<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.130> happens

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
commitment that no matter what happens

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
commitment that no matter what happens
we're<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> we're<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> put<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
we're going to we're going to put in the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.010 
we're going to we're going to put in the
work<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.979> think<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> field<00:01:21.540> for<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.840> game

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
work I think on the field for this game

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.210 
work I think on the field for this game
hopefully<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> little<00:01:22.890> bit<00:01:23.040> more

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
hopefully have to be a little bit more

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.070 
hopefully have to be a little bit more
of<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.430> leader<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.880> take<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> more<00:01:24.570> central<00:01:25.049> role

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
of a leader and take a more central role

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.219 
of a leader and take a more central role
to<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.650> game<00:01:25.890> try<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.759> know<00:01:27.229> really

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to this game try to you know really

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.140 
to this game try to you know really
dictate<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.250> flow<00:01:29.490> hopefully<00:01:29.939> through

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
dictate the the flow hopefully through

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.330 
dictate the the flow hopefully through
through<00:01:30.570> through<00:01:30.990> Beasley<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.650> myself<00:01:32.100> I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
through through Beasley and myself I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.910 
through through Beasley and myself I
think<00:01:33.270> obviously<00:01:33.450> DeMarcus<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> big<00:01:34.680> leader

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
think obviously DeMarcus is a big leader

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.560 
think obviously DeMarcus is a big leader
on<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> field<00:01:35.220> when<00:01:35.520> he<00:01:35.670> plays<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> way

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
on the field when he plays just the way

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.999 
on the field when he plays just the way
you<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:36.960> he's<00:01:37.079> not<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.229> big<00:01:37.439> talker<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
you know he's not a big talker but the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.870 
you know he's not a big talker but the
way<00:01:38.159> he<00:01:38.220> plays<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.329> it

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
way he plays you know it

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.209 
way he plays you know it
he<00:01:40.659> leaves<00:01:40.930> us<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.439> know<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.560> think<00:01:41.649> being

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
he leaves us and you know I think being

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:43.590 
he leaves us and you know I think being
in<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.399> last<00:01:42.579> two<00:01:42.729> qualifiers<00:01:43.180> I've<00:01:43.390> learned

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
in the last two qualifiers I've learned

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.730 
in the last two qualifiers I've learned
a<00:01:43.659> lot<00:01:43.689> from<00:01:43.810> being<00:01:44.140> around<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.439> lot<00:01:44.469> of<00:01:44.619> the

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
a lot from being around a lot of the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.020 
a lot from being around a lot of the
veteran<00:01:45.039> guys<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:45.460> I<00:01:45.490> think<00:01:45.700> coming<00:01:45.880> into

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
veteran guys and I think coming into

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.429 
veteran guys and I think coming into
this<00:01:46.240> game<00:01:46.420> with<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.630> lot<00:01:46.840> more<00:01:46.990> young<00:01:47.229> guys

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
this game with a lot more young guys

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.660 
this game with a lot more young guys
know<00:01:47.680> a<00:01:47.710> lot<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:47.890> guys<00:01:48.100> I'm<00:01:48.280> used<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.549> playing

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
know a lot of guys I'm used to playing

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.060 
know a lot of guys I'm used to playing
with<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.240> Olympic<00:01:49.570> team<00:01:49.799> it'll<00:01:50.799> be<00:01:50.890> good

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
with it the Olympic team it'll be good

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.109 
with it the Olympic team it'll be good
and<00:01:51.280> I<00:01:51.310> think<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:51.579> got<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.820> take<00:01:51.909> a<00:01:51.939> more

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
and I think I just got to take a more

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.819 
and I think I just got to take a more
central<00:01:52.539> role<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:52.750> being<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.439> little<00:01:53.619> bit<00:01:53.710> more

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
central role in being a little bit more

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.709 
central role in being a little bit more
of<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.979> leader<00:01:54.159> on<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.429> field<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:55.450> have<00:01:55.479> to

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
of a leader on the field you have to

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.539 
of a leader on the field you have to
understand<00:01:56.170> your<00:01:56.649> role<00:01:56.860> on<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.189> team<00:01:57.340> and

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
understand your role on the team and

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.710 
understand your role on the team and
especially<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.090> goalkeeper<00:01:58.539> because

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
especially the goalkeeper because

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.330 
especially the goalkeeper because
there's<00:01:59.079> only<00:01:59.140> one<00:01:59.439> spot<00:01:59.649> for<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.920> goalkeeper

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
there's only one spot for a goalkeeper

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.190 
there's only one spot for a goalkeeper
on<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.520> field<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:01.149> obviously<00:02:01.630> Tim<00:02:01.869> he's<00:02:02.020> been

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
think that this game is is going to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.170 
think that this game is is going to
require<00:03:11.769> something<00:03:12.370> special<00:03:12.940> something<00:03:13.600> more

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
require something special something more

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.789 
require something special something more
from<00:03:16.180> each<00:03:16.389> of<00:03:16.540> each<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.410> people<00:03:17.680> that

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
from each of each of the people that

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.309 
from each of each of the people that
steps<00:03:18.190> on<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.430> field<00:03:18.639> and<00:03:18.959> each<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.170> guys

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
steps on the field and each of the guys

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.890 
steps on the field and each of the guys
in<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.500> 18<00:03:20.889> but<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:21.910> don't<00:03:22.269> necessarily<00:03:22.480> think

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
in the 18 but I don't necessarily think

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.809 
in the 18 but I don't necessarily think
it's<00:03:23.200> going<00:03:23.319> to<00:03:23.380> be<00:03:23.470> if<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:24.160> get<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.400> ball<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.579> got

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
it's going to be if I get the ball I got

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.030 
it's going to be if I get the ball I got
to<00:03:24.940> do<00:03:25.060> something<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.720> little<00:03:25.870> extra<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.680> know

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
to do something a little extra you know

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.830 
to do something a little extra you know
to<00:03:27.160> prove<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:27.609> for<00:03:27.910> myself<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.450> think<00:03:28.660> it's<00:03:28.780> more

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
to prove it for myself I think it's more

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.500 
to prove it for myself I think it's more
gonna<00:03:29.170> be<00:03:29.350> like<00:03:29.560> there's<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.459> play<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.359> need

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
gonna be like there's a play that I need

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.289 
gonna be like there's a play that I need
to<00:03:31.600> make<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:32.310> ten<00:03:33.310> yard<00:03:33.489> sprint<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:34.000> little

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
to make that ten yard sprint a little

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.860 
to make that ten yard sprint a little
bit<00:03:34.389> harder<00:03:34.780> or<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:34.989> need<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:36.269> work<00:03:37.269> back<00:03:37.510> for<00:03:37.750> my

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
bit harder or I need to work back for my

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.319 
bit harder or I need to work back for my
teammate<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.380> do<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.650> little<00:03:38.859> bit<00:03:39.040> extra

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329

to pick somebody up I think that that's

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.900

where<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.410> the

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
where the the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.320 
where the the
the<00:03:47.810> extra<00:03:48.170> ten<00:03:48.350> percent<00:03:48.790> needs<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:50.000> come<00:03:50.180> from

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
the extra ten percent needs to come from

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.990 
the extra ten percent needs to come from
well<00:03:50.960> it's<00:03:51.170> it's<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.950> process<00:03:52.190> like<00:03:52.430> you<00:03:52.730> said
