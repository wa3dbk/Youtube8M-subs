DSR<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:49.110> got<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.920> other<00:00:50.100> half<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.760> my

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
DSR and I got the other half with my

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.420 
DSR and I got the other half with my
second<00:00:51.449> area<00:00:51.629> what<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.410> b23r<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.399> I

second area what is it that b23r and I

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
second area what is it that b23r and I
think<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.699> pick<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> type<00:00:54.570> 95<00:00:54.840> tell<00:00:55.680> me

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
think I pick up like a type 95 tell me

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950 
think I pick up like a type 95 tell me
out<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.219> I'm<00:00:57.149> not<00:00:57.300> claiming<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
out so I'm not claiming this is a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.470 
out so I'm not claiming this is a
hundred<00:00:58.199> percent<00:00:58.699> DSR<00:00:59.699> nuclear<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.329> not

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
hundred percent DSR nuclear it's not

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.779 
hundred percent DSR nuclear it's not
like<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.930> those<00:01:01.050> surgeries<00:01:01.859> gameplays

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
like one of those surgeries gameplays

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.889 
like one of those surgeries gameplays
where<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.149> don't<00:01:03.329> switch<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.750> their

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
where they don't switch to their

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.060 
where they don't switch to their
secondary<00:01:04.290> at<00:01:04.439> all<00:01:04.530> they're<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.860> quick

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
secondary at all they're just quick

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.469 
secondary at all they're just quick
scoping<00:01:05.460> people<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:05.939> come<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.240> close<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
scoping people and they come up close to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.090 
scoping people and they come up close to
them<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:07.260> that's<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:07.799> me<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
them now that's not really me as a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.160 
them now that's not really me as a
sniper<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.119> still<00:01:09.570> think<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> pretty

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
sniper but I still think it's a pretty

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.960 
sniper but I still think it's a pretty
good<00:01:10.290> gameplay<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.920> my<00:01:11.040> opinion<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.640> hope

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970
