from the late 80s onwards with for me
and<00:04:52.160> I'm<00:04:52.250> not<00:04:52.280> saying<00:04:52.580> this<00:04:52.670> because<00:04:52.730> of<00:04:53.030> this

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
and I'm not saying this because of this

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.240 
and I'm not saying this because of this
my<00:04:53.510> film<00:04:53.810> but<00:04:53.960> for<00:04:54.110> me<00:04:54.200> the<00:04:54.290> u.s.<00:04:54.830> QT<00:04:55.130> which

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
my film but for me the u.s. QT which

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.190 
my film but for me the u.s. QT which
community<00:04:55.760> it<00:04:55.880> was<00:04:56.060> a<00:04:56.090> turning<00:04:56.420> point<00:04:56.450> because

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
community it was a turning point because

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.930 
community it was a turning point because
it<00:04:57.320> came<00:04:57.530> with<00:04:57.770> a<00:04:57.800> circuit<00:04:58.430> I<00:04:58.640> mean<00:04:58.790> is<00:04:58.910> a

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
it came with a circuit I mean is a

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.170 
it came with a circuit I mean is a
completely<00:04:59.510> different<00:05:00.370> sensibility<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:02.030> what

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
completely different sensibility to what

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.630 
completely different sensibility to what
was<00:05:02.330> happening<00:05:02.660> there<00:05:02.870> so<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.590> had<00:05:03.920> since<00:05:04.460> the

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
was happening there so you had since the

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:15.130 
was happening there so you had since the
big<00:05:04.820> successes<00:05:13.390> no<00:05:14.390> doubt<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.870> they<00:05:14.990> have<00:05:15.110> a

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
big successes no doubt and they have a

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.170 
big successes no doubt and they have a
certain<00:05:15.470> sensibility<00:05:15.770> which<00:05:16.160> you<00:05:16.520> know<00:05:16.610> when

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
certain sensibility which you know when

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.580 
certain sensibility which you know when
you<00:05:17.240> look<00:05:17.390> at<00:05:17.510> today<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:17.780> like<00:05:17.990> what<00:05:18.440> I<00:05:18.470> like

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
no one else like I was saying I think

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.800 
no one else like I was saying I think
from<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.890> from<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.790> late<00:05:23.150> eighties<00:05:23.480> on<00:05:23.630> which

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
from the from the late eighties on which

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.050 
from the from the late eighties on which
there<00:05:23.990> is<00:05:24.080> a<00:05:24.110> change<00:05:24.200> I<00:05:24.560> think<00:05:24.740> with<00:05:25.280> you<00:05:25.940> know

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
there is a change I think with you know

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.870 
there is a change I think with you know
but<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.330> directors<00:05:26.630> like<00:05:26.780> console<00:05:27.490> or<00:05:28.490> a

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
Satoshi depending when gossip oh she

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.210 
Satoshi depending when gossip oh she
came<00:05:30.710> in

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
came in

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.670 
came in
a<00:05:34.450> sensibility<00:05:35.450> kind<00:05:35.780> of<00:05:35.840> those<00:05:36.200> shift<00:05:36.530> in

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
a sensibility kind of those shift in

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.060 
a sensibility kind of those shift in
sensibility<00:05:37.280> which<00:05:37.850> has<00:05:38.060> been<00:05:38.770> growing<00:05:39.770> and

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
sensibility which has been growing and

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.980 
sensibility which has been growing and
changing<00:05:40.340> gradually<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:41.180> I<00:05:41.210> think<00:05:41.450> you<00:05:41.870> know

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
changing gradually and I think you know

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.200 
changing gradually and I think you know
around<00:05:42.290> 2000<00:05:43.250> again<00:05:43.460> there<00:05:43.640> was<00:05:43.730> a<00:05:43.760> more

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
around 2000 again there was a more

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.260 
around 2000 again there was a more
definite<00:05:44.630> shift<00:05:45.670> towards<00:05:46.670> a<00:05:46.730> certain<00:05:46.940> kind<00:05:47.180> of

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
definite shift towards a certain kind of

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.290 
definite shift towards a certain kind of
cinema<00:05:47.570> if<00:05:47.720> you<00:05:47.810> look<00:05:47.990> at<00:05:48.140> the<00:05:48.230> last<00:05:48.970> few<00:05:49.970> years

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
cinema if you look at the last few years

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.610 
cinema if you look at the last few years
the<00:05:50.660> big<00:05:50.870> successes<00:05:51.880> are<00:05:52.880> films<00:05:53.390> which<00:05:53.630> no

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
the big successes are films which no

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.270 
the big successes are films which no

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
longer fall into the category of what we

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.030

care as long as citizens make money so

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.810 
care as long as citizens make money so
they<00:06:57.650> are<00:06:57.680> not<00:06:57.740> really<00:06:57.919> dictating<00:06:58.460> as<00:06:58.580> to<00:06:58.700> what
