although<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:31.049> agree<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.920> wonder<00:01:32.310> weapon

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
although I will agree this wonder weapon

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.630 
although I will agree this wonder weapon
is<00:01:32.880> bad<00:01:33.240> ass<00:01:33.710> nothing<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.860> cooler<00:01:35.100> than<00:01:35.400> just

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
is bad ass nothing is cooler than just

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.420 
is bad ass nothing is cooler than just

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.000 
right none of course and it's probably
just<00:01:58.840> like<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.110> thundergun<00:01:59.500> one<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.800> the<00:01:59.860> more

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
just like the thundergun one of the more

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
the same problem that the thundergun has

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.340 
the same problem that the thundergun has
in<00:02:03.400> terms<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.730> ammo<00:02:04.000> capacity<00:02:04.180> although<00:02:04.900> what

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
in terms of ammo capacity although what

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.750 
in terms of ammo capacity although what
is<00:02:05.440> very<00:02:05.650> useful<00:02:06.040> about<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.340> much<00:02:06.490> like<00:02:06.610> the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
is very useful about it much like the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.370 
is very useful about it much like the
thundergun<00:02:07.120> he<00:02:07.330> said<00:02:07.510> it'll<00:02:07.690> pull<00:02:07.960> you<00:02:08.110> out<00:02:08.260> of
