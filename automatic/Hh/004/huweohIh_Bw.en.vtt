pattern

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.330

this<00:01:39.520> causes<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.060> jet<00:01:40.360> stream<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.840> buckle

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
this causes the jet stream to buckle

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.740 
this causes the jet stream to buckle
causing<00:01:42.340> depressions<00:01:42.909> to<00:01:43.119> move<00:01:43.299> towards

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
causing depressions to move towards

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.960 
causing depressions to move towards
different<00:01:44.380> regions<00:01:44.860> or<00:01:45.100> blocking<00:01:45.790> their

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
different regions or blocking their

different regions or blocking their
movements<00:01:46.479> altogether

movements altogether

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.590 
movements altogether
therefore<00:01:48.520> jet<00:01:48.820> streams<00:01:49.149> can<00:01:49.420> have<00:01:49.570> a

therefore jet streams can have a

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:58.990 
therefore jet streams can have a
fundamental<00:01:50.350> effect<00:01:50.470> on<00:01:50.829> our<00:01:50.979> weather
