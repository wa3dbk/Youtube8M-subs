 correction tools 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.500
 if you propose by autopano 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.079
 our behaviors 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:14.769
 passion of lenses that allow a more precise assembly and a more 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.609
 great flexibility 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.609
 these were materials to meet 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.089
 a typical example of impossible assembly 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.089
 previously referred to 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.140
 zep using a linear lens of 14 millimeters 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 known to generate a lot of distance 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.600
 detection with the old 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.600
 lens distortion 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.190
 the agent is not assembly 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.320
 the checkpoint editor we have 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.570
 edited the links in order to correct 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.120
 the choices alduy by the motive 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.120
 recurring images 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.840
 two others correctly 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 however that the fault of assembly remain 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.100
 so we thought that 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.100
 the barrel effect and two pads of the lenses 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.370
 is more complex 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.130
 in timis settings 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.050
 new panorama 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.010
 and the metal bars look much more accurate 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.919
 to note hillsides panels to deform the i 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.839
 lassonde more complex than that 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.729
 by legally taking into account the effects of slack 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.969
 che of the lens 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.139
 ticks for the test 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.139
 usher according to the shooting 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.479
 particular difficulties 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.479
 ethically the water 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.219
 looking closer though 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.019
 we notice that 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.019
 do not superimpose perfectly 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.439
 in the way autopano distorts images to assemble them 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.719
 table of calculations at the bottom of the panorama editor 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.919
 i say no no hamas 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.919
 provided by the camera at the time of shooting 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.249
 of information computed by autopano to distort the images 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.379
 the afocal calculated by autopano 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.379
 as well as the coefficients 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.109
 while we know that the fokal pub 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.659
 autofocus for example 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.659
 in the optimization menu of the point editor 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.659
 control 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.659
 autopano to calculate the focal lengths of each of the images 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.209
 lenses 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.209
 proud that one parameter at a time 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.479
 we notice that in total our 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.409
 to find slightly different focal lengths for each 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.409
 Photo 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.209
 but this means 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.209
 better to the eye 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.860
 an example helps 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.999
 r at very short focal length 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:30.199
 surely so the 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.669
 bnp launching the detection 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.349
 the panorama is good 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:37.740
 looking more closely 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.740
 m strong anomalies in the corners of the images 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.360
 a two-year shift 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.360
 dare problem when assembling 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.639
 the mans center 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.639
 in the qualifying table 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.949
 they will take into account when optimizing 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.270
 for that 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.320
 m hop you consume this in the parameters of team usa sion then 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.930
 mali are almost completely compensated 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.939
 6 it's a great tool
