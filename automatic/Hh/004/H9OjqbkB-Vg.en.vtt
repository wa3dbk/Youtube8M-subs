00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
on the tools for sand sculpture here

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.560 
on the tools for sand sculpture here
today<00:00:26.260> right<00:00:26.470> not<00:00:27.460> like<00:00:27.790> it's<00:00:28.029> hard<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.300> find

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
today right not like it's hard to find

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.700 
today right not like it's hard to find
the<00:00:28.689> stuff<00:00:28.930> it's<00:00:29.080> not<00:00:29.170> like<00:00:29.350> it's<00:00:29.470> expensive

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
the stuff it's not like it's expensive

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.890 
the stuff it's not like it's expensive
this<00:00:30.400> is<00:00:30.579> made<00:00:30.730> out<00:00:30.759> of<00:00:30.910> banding<00:00:31.450> material<00:00:31.810> the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
this is made out of banding material the

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.540 
this is made out of banding material the
stuff<00:00:32.110> they<00:00:32.230> use<00:00:32.380> to<00:00:32.529> wrap<00:00:32.740> lumber<00:00:33.160> with<00:00:33.310> in

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
stuff they use to wrap lumber with in

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.330 
stuff they use to wrap lumber with in
lumber<00:00:33.910> yards<00:00:34.180> it's<00:00:34.360> in<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.570> trash<00:00:35.340> alright

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
lumber yards it's in the trash alright

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.970 
lumber yards it's in the trash alright
so<00:00:36.579> now<00:00:36.760> we're<00:00:37.210> going<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.360> make<00:00:37.570> castle<00:00:38.110> the

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
so now we're going to make castle the

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.150 
so now we're going to make castle the
trick<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:39.690> we're<00:00:40.690> going<00:00:40.810> to<00:00:40.870> make<00:00:41.020> an<00:00:41.230> X<00:00:41.440> so<00:00:42.040> we

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
trick is we're going to make an X so we

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.100 
trick is we're going to make an X so we
know<00:00:42.280> where<00:00:42.400> the<00:00:42.550> center<00:00:42.850> point<00:00:43.090> is<00:00:43.270> once<00:00:43.930> we

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
know where the center point is once we

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.780 
know where the center point is once we
know<00:00:44.230> where<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.440> centre<00:00:44.680> point<00:00:44.860> is<00:00:45.100> we're

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
know where the centre point is we're

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.660 
know where the centre point is we're
going<00:00:45.880> to<00:00:45.970> make<00:00:46.180> a<00:00:46.470> four-sided<00:00:47.470> point<00:00:47.740> and<00:00:48.010> we

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
going to make a four-sided point and we

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.730 
going to make a four-sided point and we
just<00:00:48.880> shave<00:00:49.090> it<00:00:49.240> on<00:00:49.360> down<00:00:49.570> getting<00:00:50.200> close<00:00:50.530> to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
just shave it on down getting close to

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.090 
just shave it on down getting close to
that<00:00:50.770> point<00:00:51.160> but<00:00:51.340> not<00:00:51.520> crossing<00:00:52.150> it<00:00:52.270> and

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
that point but not crossing it and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.240 
that point but not crossing it and
what's<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.220> easiest<00:00:54.490> way<00:00:54.610> to<00:00:54.760> draw<00:00:55.330> a<00:00:55.360> circle

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
what's the easiest way to draw a circle

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.430 
what's the easiest way to draw a circle
draw<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.280> square<00:00:57.700> and<00:00:57.970> round<00:00:58.450> it<00:00:58.660> out<00:00:58.780> and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
draw a square and round it out and

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
draw a square and round it out and
that's<00:00:59.590> what<00:00:59.770> we're<00:00:59.890> going<00:00:59.980> to<00:01:00.040> do<00:01:00.160> here<00:01:00.340> today

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
that's what we're going to do here today

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.550 
that's what we're going to do here today
is<00:01:00.760> we're<00:01:01.540> going<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:01.750> get<00:01:01.900> close<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.350> that

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
is we're going to get close to that

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.899 
is we're going to get close to that
center<00:01:03.130> point<00:01:03.340> but<00:01:04.059> not<00:01:04.210> cross<00:01:04.540> it<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.909> make

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
center point but not cross it and make

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.770 
center point but not cross it and make
this<00:01:07.060> steep<00:01:07.330> enough<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.970> that<00:01:10.000> we<00:01:10.299> got<00:01:10.479> a<00:01:10.540> nice

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
this steep enough so that we got a nice

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.890 
this steep enough so that we got a nice
point<00:01:11.080> there<00:01:11.439> then<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:13.270> round<00:01:13.450> off<00:01:13.750> the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
point there then you round off the

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.730 
point there then you round off the
corners<00:01:14.290> and<00:01:14.470> you<00:01:14.530> get<00:01:15.189> a<00:01:15.220> nice<00:01:15.400> pencil<00:01:15.700> point

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
corners and you get a nice pencil point

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.230 
corners and you get a nice pencil point
because<00:01:17.740> Walt<00:01:18.430> Disney's<00:01:18.790> got<00:01:18.970> us<00:01:19.090> all

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
because Walt Disney's got us all

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.330 
because Walt Disney's got us all
convinced<00:01:19.780> that<00:01:19.840> all<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.740> castles<00:01:21.159> in<00:01:21.310> the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
convinced that all the castles in the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.080 
convinced that all the castles in the
world<00:01:21.580> are<00:01:21.960> pointed<00:01:22.960> okay<00:01:23.680> now<00:01:23.980> we're<00:01:24.970> going

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
world are pointed okay now we're going

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.120 
world are pointed okay now we're going
to<00:01:25.180> show<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.450> what<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:25.780> think<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.440> critical

to show you what I think is the critical

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.910 
to show you what I think is the critical
trick<00:01:27.730> for<00:01:28.030> actual<00:01:28.330> sand<00:01:28.600> carving<00:01:29.050> we're

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
trick for actual sand carving we're

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.380 
trick for actual sand carving we're
actually<00:01:30.070> going<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.430> put<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.640> roof<00:01:30.820> line<00:01:31.120> right

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
actually going to put a roof line right

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.730 
actually going to put a roof line right
here<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:33.130> around<00:01:33.370> the<00:01:33.520> top<00:01:33.729> here<00:01:33.760> and<00:01:34.740> with

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
here right around the top here and with

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.740 
here right around the top here and with
that<00:01:35.890> roof<00:01:36.130> line<00:01:36.370> most<00:01:36.970> what<00:01:37.330> we<00:01:37.420> want<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.659> do

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
that roof line most what we want to do

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.660 
that roof line most what we want to do
is<00:01:37.900> take<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.260> sand<00:01:38.500> blow<00:01:38.830> it<00:01:38.979> away<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.460> keep

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
is take the sand blow it away and keep

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.210 
is take the sand blow it away and keep
the<00:01:39.820> sand<00:01:40.000> above<00:01:40.300> it<00:01:40.420> above<00:01:41.050> that<00:01:41.080> line<00:01:41.500> most

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
the sand above it above that line most

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.590 
the sand above it above that line most
people<00:01:42.520> will<00:01:42.610> stick<00:01:42.820> their<00:01:42.970> knife<00:01:43.150> straight

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
people will stick their knife straight

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.120 
people will stick their knife straight
in<00:01:43.780> if<00:01:44.020> they<00:01:44.229> stick<00:01:44.409> their<00:01:44.560> knife<00:01:44.710> straight<00:01:44.979> in

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
in if they stick their knife straight in

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.310 
in if they stick their knife straight in
it's<00:01:45.700> going<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.030> crack<00:01:46.330> on<00:01:46.600> both<00:01:46.810> sides<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.260> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
it's going to crack on both sides of the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.160 
it's going to crack on both sides of the
knife<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:47.770> what<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.790> do<00:01:48.970> is<00:01:49.299> you<00:01:50.049> actually

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
knife so what you do is you actually

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.350 
knife so what you do is you actually
carve<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.740> an<00:01:50.830> angle<00:01:51.370> away<00:01:51.880> from<00:01:52.150> what<00:01:52.270> you're

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
carve it an angle away from what you're

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.990 
carve it an angle away from what you're
trying<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.630> keep<00:01:52.840> which<00:01:53.110> is<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.380> roof<00:01:53.530> line

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
trying to keep which is the roof line

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.420 
trying to keep which is the roof line
and<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.930> carve<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.380> an<00:01:56.530> angle<00:01:56.920> away<00:01:57.040> from<00:01:57.159> what

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
and you carve it an angle away from what

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.180 
and you carve it an angle away from what
you<00:01:57.549> want<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.760> keep<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:59.320> you<00:01:59.470> can<00:01:59.590> go<00:01:59.710> back<00:01:59.920> in

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
you want to keep then you can go back in

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.500 
you want to keep then you can go back in
and<00:02:01.049> carve<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.320> other<00:02:02.500> direction<00:02:03.510> then

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
and carve it the other direction then

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.690 
and carve it the other direction then
you<00:02:04.690> can<00:02:04.810> go<00:02:04.930> back<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:05.590> cut<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.369> straight

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
you can go back in and cut a straight

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.380 
you can go back in and cut a straight
line<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:09.459> like<00:02:09.549> you<00:02:09.759> thought<00:02:09.909> you<00:02:10.060> wanted<00:02:10.299> to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
line just like you thought you wanted to

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.610 
line just like you thought you wanted to
make<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.629> the<00:02:10.659> very<00:02:10.720> beginnings<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.349> thought

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
make it the very beginnings you thought

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.960 
make it the very beginnings you thought
you<00:02:11.769> wanted<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.069> go<00:02:12.159> straight<00:02:12.430> in<00:02:12.670> but<00:02:12.819> you

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
you wanted to go straight in but you

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.160 
you wanted to go straight in but you
went<00:02:13.120> straight<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.540> you'd<00:02:13.629> crack<00:02:13.930> that

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
went straight in and you'd crack that

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.869 
went straight in and you'd crack that
roof<00:02:14.409> once<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:14.890> roof<00:02:15.069> line<00:02:15.250> cracks<00:02:15.610> it's

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
roof once that roof line cracks it's

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.509 
roof once that roof line cracks it's
going<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.060> fall<00:02:16.269> on<00:02:16.980> let's<00:02:17.980> go<00:02:18.129> down<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.340> little

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
going to fall on let's go down a little

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.260 
going to fall on let's go down a little
bit<00:02:18.700> farther<00:02:19.500> we're<00:02:20.500> going<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.739> make<00:02:20.950> a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
bit farther we're going to make a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.670 
bit farther we're going to make a
balcony<00:02:22.270> so<00:02:22.720> we're<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.990> keep<00:02:23.200> this<00:02:23.380> sand

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
balcony so we're going to keep this sand

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.830 
balcony so we're going to keep this sand
and<00:02:23.890> take<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.190> sand<00:02:24.580> away<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.390> again<00:02:25.690> we

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
and take that sand away so again we

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.010 
and take that sand away so again we
point<00:02:26.140> toward<00:02:26.440> what<00:02:26.590> we<00:02:26.650> want

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
point toward what we want

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.440 
point toward what we want
take<00:02:27.110> away<00:02:27.830> or<00:02:28.280> away<00:02:28.820> from<00:02:29.000> what<00:02:29.120> we<00:02:29.180> want<00:02:29.360> to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
take away or away from what we want to

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.700 
take away or away from what we want to
keep<00:02:29.600> in<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:29.900> case<00:02:30.170> we're<00:02:30.320> going<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.470> point

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
keep in this case we're going to point

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.780 
keep in this case we're going to point
up<00:02:31.810> we<00:02:32.810> slide<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.380> away<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:37.310> can<00:02:37.490> get<00:02:37.640> that

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
up we slide that away you can get that

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.900 
up we slide that away you can get that
little<00:02:38.420> sand<00:02:38.660> out<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.930> there<00:02:39.520> now<00:02:40.520> you'll

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
little sand out of there now you'll

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.910 
little sand out of there now you'll
notice<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.540> there's<00:02:41.750> not<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.960> real<00:02:42.320> obvious

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
notice that there's not a real obvious

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.980 
notice that there's not a real obvious
line<00:02:43.750> for<00:02:44.830> where<00:02:45.880> this<00:02:46.880> ends<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:47.690> where<00:02:47.810> that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
line for where this ends and where that

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.960 
line for where this ends and where that
starts<00:02:48.410> so<00:02:49.010> what<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.250> want<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.520> do<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.820> just

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
starts so what you want to do is just

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.940 
starts so what you want to do is just
make<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.210> little<00:02:50.450> line<00:02:50.690> there<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.770> world

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
make a little line there so the world

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.340 
make a little line there so the world
says<00:02:52.250> oh<00:02:52.400> yeah<00:02:52.580> that's<00:02:53.570> where<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.900> one<00:02:54.050> ends

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
says oh yeah that's where the one ends

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.400 
says oh yeah that's where the one ends
that's<00:02:54.530> where<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:54.830> other<00:02:54.980> stops<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:57.200> makes

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
that's where the other stops that makes

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.220 
that's where the other stops that makes
sense<00:02:58.180> ok<00:02:59.180> now<00:02:59.480> we're<00:02:59.750> going<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.900> go<00:03:00.050> down<00:03:00.200> just

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
sense ok now we're going to go down just

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.980 
sense ok now we're going to go down just
a<00:03:00.620> little<00:03:00.650> bit<00:03:01.100> farther<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.660> we're<00:03:02.840> going<00:03:02.960> to

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
a little bit farther and we're going to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.620 
a little bit farther and we're going to
do<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.260> bottom<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.740> balcony<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:05.480> buy

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
do the bottom of the balcony and you buy

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.760 
do the bottom of the balcony and you buy
now<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:05.840> ought<00:03:06.080> to<00:03:06.200> know<00:03:06.260> what<00:03:06.380> you're<00:03:06.560> doing

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
now you ought to know what you're doing

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.810 
now you ought to know what you're doing
here<00:03:06.980> because<00:03:07.190> you're<00:03:07.310> going<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.460> keep<00:03:07.640> this

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
here because you're going to keep this

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.810 
here because you're going to keep this
take<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.120> away<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.870> point<00:03:09.200> down<00:03:09.820> take

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
take that away so you point down take

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.400 
take that away so you point down take
that<00:03:11.060> sand<00:03:11.390> away<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:13.720> then<00:03:14.720> all<00:03:14.960> you<00:03:15.200> got<00:03:15.320> to

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
that sand away and then all you got to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.800 
that sand away and then all you got to
do<00:03:15.470> at<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:15.680> point<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.130> just<00:03:16.880> slice<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.690> on

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
do at this point is just slice it on

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.870 
do at this point is just slice it on
down

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
down

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.220 
down
continue<00:03:19.880> your<00:03:19.910> tower<00:03:20.240> so<00:03:20.870> now<00:03:21.020> you've<00:03:21.200> got

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
continue your tower so now you've got

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.100 
continue your tower so now you've got
like<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.530> basic<00:03:21.920> lighthouse<00:03:22.340> tower<00:03:22.930> you've<00:03:23.930> got

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
like a basic lighthouse tower you've got

a tower balcony and the tower obviously

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.680 
a tower balcony and the tower obviously
I<00:03:28.370> haven't<00:03:28.580> finished<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.030> back<00:03:29.180> side<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.480> this

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
I haven't finished the back side of this

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.290 
I haven't finished the back side of this

things<00:03:53.360> up<00:03:53.510> real<00:03:53.690> nice<00:03:55.030> now<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.090> can<00:03:56.360> also

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
things up real nice now you can also

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.260 
things up real nice now you can also
with<00:03:57.140> your<00:03:57.320> tower<00:03:57.590> here<00:03:57.950> if<00:03:58.520> you<00:03:58.760> wanted<00:03:59.120> to

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
with your tower here if you wanted to

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.820 
with your tower here if you wanted to
you<00:03:59.420> could<00:03:59.570> put<00:03:59.750> little<00:03:59.930> crenellations<00:04:00.440> in

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
you could put little crenellations in

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.110 
you could put little crenellations in
here<00:04:02.170> alright<00:04:03.170> you<00:04:04.160> could<00:04:04.310> put<00:04:04.520> other<00:04:04.700> doors

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
here alright you could put other doors

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.240 
here alright you could put other doors
and<00:04:05.360> windows<00:04:05.690> all<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:06.500> stuff's<00:04:06.770> possible

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
and windows all that stuff's possible

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.560 
and windows all that stuff's possible
today<00:04:07.430> we're<00:04:07.610> just<00:04:07.760> showing<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.209> basics

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
today we're just showing you the basics

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.230 
today we're just showing you the basics
here<00:04:09.220> one<00:04:10.220> thing<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.580> most<00:04:10.700> people<00:04:11.030> want<00:04:11.180> to

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
here one thing that most people want to

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.360 
here one thing that most people want to
do<00:04:11.390> is<00:04:11.540> they<00:04:11.630> like<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:11.959> make<00:04:12.080> stairs<00:04:12.440> if<00:04:13.220> you

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
do is they like to make stairs if you

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.699 
do is they like to make stairs if you
make<00:04:13.550> stairs<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:14.360> got<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.660> figure<00:04:14.840> out<00:04:15.110> what

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
make stairs you got to figure out what

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.680 
make stairs you got to figure out what
do<00:04:15.770> we<00:04:15.830> know<00:04:15.950> about<00:04:15.980> stairs<00:04:16.489> mostly<00:04:17.450> that<00:04:17.570> they

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
do we know about stairs mostly that they

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.510 
do we know about stairs mostly that they
go<00:04:17.810> up<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.169> down<00:04:18.320> we're<00:04:19.130> going<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.310> make<00:04:19.489> a

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
go up and down we're going to make a

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.909 
go up and down we're going to make a
spiral<00:04:20.090> staircase<00:04:20.350> so<00:04:21.350> we're<00:04:21.590> going<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.739> make

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
spiral staircase so we're going to make

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.890 
spiral staircase so we're going to make
a<00:04:21.950> spiral<00:04:22.280> first<00:04:22.700> and<00:04:23.450> we're<00:04:23.570> going<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.720> take

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
a spiral first and we're going to take

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.050 
a spiral first and we're going to take
away<00:04:24.110> all<00:04:24.140> the<00:04:24.380> sand<00:04:24.590> above<00:04:24.919> that<00:04:25.430> spiral<00:04:25.910> line

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
away all the sand above that spiral line

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.050 
away all the sand above that spiral line
because<00:04:26.330> we<00:04:26.480> don't<00:04:26.630> need<00:04:26.690> it

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.450 

we<00:04:29.840> take<00:04:30.080> away<00:04:30.230> that<00:04:30.350> stuff<00:04:30.800> above<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.220> spider

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
we take away that stuff above the spider

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.420 
we take away that stuff above the spider
line<00:04:31.730> and<00:04:32.000> once<00:04:32.720> you<00:04:32.930> have<00:04:33.110> this<00:04:33.560> angle<00:04:34.220> here

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
line and once you have this angle here

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.660 
line and once you have this angle here
this<00:04:34.610> ramp<00:04:34.970> it's<00:04:35.840> really<00:04:36.440> easy<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:37.040> make

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
this ramp it's really easy to make

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.930 
this ramp it's really easy to make
stairs<00:04:38.980> so<00:04:39.980> I'll<00:04:40.130> show<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.370> how<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:40.610> do<00:04:40.790> that

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
stairs so I'll show you how to do that

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.860 
stairs so I'll show you how to do that
in<00:04:41.060> just<00:04:41.120> a<00:04:41.300> second<00:04:43.270> clean<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:44.510> up<00:04:44.540> a<00:04:44.780> little

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
in just a second clean that up a little

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.270 
in just a second clean that up a little
bit<00:04:45.050> again<00:04:45.440> you're<00:04:45.620> trying<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.860> make<00:04:46.010> a<00:04:46.040> ramp

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
bit again you're trying to make a ramp

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.800 
bit again you're trying to make a ramp
that's<00:04:46.460> pretty<00:04:46.730> flat<00:04:46.970> it's<00:04:47.180> not<00:04:47.300> tipped<00:04:47.600> in

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
that's pretty flat it's not tipped in

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.800 
that's pretty flat it's not tipped in
not<00:04:48.350> tipped<00:04:48.650> out<00:04:48.830> too<00:04:49.040> much<00:04:49.190> okay<00:04:49.610> so<00:04:50.570> what<00:04:50.720> we

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
not tipped out too much okay so what we

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.540 
not tipped out too much okay so what we
do<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:50.960> make<00:04:51.080> a<00:04:51.200> spiral<00:04:51.530> staircase<00:04:51.890> is<00:04:52.280> point

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
do to make a spiral staircase is point

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.730 
do to make a spiral staircase is point
toward<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:52.850> center<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.360> go<00:04:54.880> 1/2<00:04:56.740> point

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
toward the center and go 1/2 point

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.960 
toward the center and go 1/2 point
toward<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.010> center<00:04:58.310> go<00:04:59.560> 1/2<00:05:00.730> point<00:05:01.730> toward

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
toward the center go 1/2 point toward

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.100 
toward the center go 1/2 point toward
the<00:05:02.000> center<00:05:02.330> go<00:05:03.230> on<00:05:03.760> to<00:05:04.900> right

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
the center go on to right

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.050 
the center go on to right
pretty<00:05:06.590> dang<00:05:06.800> simple<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.370> you<00:05:07.670> can<00:05:07.820> do<00:05:07.940> that

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
pretty dang simple and you can do that

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.660 
pretty dang simple and you can do that
all<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.420> way<00:05:08.510> around<00:05:09.370> point<00:05:10.370> toward<00:05:10.580> the

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
all the way around point toward the

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.130 
all the way around point toward the
center<00:05:10.970> so<00:05:12.310> 1/2<00:05:13.310> your<00:05:13.820> if<00:05:14.120> your<00:05:14.330> castle<00:05:14.930> or

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
center so 1/2 your if your castle or

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.380 
center so 1/2 your if your castle or
your<00:05:15.260> scares<00:05:15.560> are<00:05:15.770> a<00:05:15.800> little<00:05:15.980> bit<00:05:16.220> rough<00:05:16.520> on

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
your scares are a little bit rough on

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.720 
your scares are a little bit rough on
that<00:05:17.420> side<00:05:17.840> and<00:05:18.140> shape<00:05:18.410> them<00:05:18.590> out<00:05:18.740> you<00:05:19.400> can<00:05:19.550> put

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
that side and shape them out you can put

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.890 
that side and shape them out you can put
a<00:05:19.760> nice<00:05:19.970> little<00:05:20.330> line<00:05:20.510> underneath<00:05:20.870> here<00:05:22.900> again

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
a nice little line underneath here again

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.820 
a nice little line underneath here again
this<00:05:24.080> is<00:05:24.290> just<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.710> basic<00:05:24.950> lesson<00:05:25.490> for<00:05:25.670> castles

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
this is just a basic lesson for castles

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.320 
this is just a basic lesson for castles
but<00:05:27.830> hopefully<00:05:28.280> gives<00:05:28.550> you<00:05:28.670> an<00:05:28.760> idea<00:05:28.880> what<00:05:29.090> you

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
but hopefully gives you an idea what you

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.970 
but hopefully gives you an idea what you
can<00:05:29.480> do<00:05:29.630> once<00:05:30.320> you<00:05:30.470> know<00:05:30.560> how<00:05:30.680> to<00:05:30.770> make<00:05:30.950> a

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
can do once you know how to make a

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.330 
can do once you know how to make a
bucket<00:05:31.280> form<00:05:31.700> it's<00:05:32.360> really<00:05:32.900> easy<00:05:33.080> to<00:05:33.920> work<00:05:34.070> on

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
bucket form it's really easy to work on

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.320 
bucket form it's really easy to work on
faces<00:05:34.970> or<00:05:35.150> heads<00:05:35.420> or<00:05:36.340> animals<00:05:37.340> anything<00:05:38.240> you

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
faces or heads or animals anything you

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.510 
faces or heads or animals anything you
want<00:05:38.510> to<00:05:38.630> do<00:05:38.800> does<00:05:39.800> that<00:05:39.890> make<00:05:40.070> sense

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
want to do does that make sense

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.060 
want to do does that make sense
I<00:05:40.550> hope<00:05:40.820> you<00:05:40.910> had<00:05:41.030> fun
