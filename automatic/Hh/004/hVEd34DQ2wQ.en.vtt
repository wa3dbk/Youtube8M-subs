i have three things to talk about today
one<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.809> old<00:01:00.989> characters<00:01:01.379> returning

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
one is the old characters returning

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.329 
one is the old characters returning
somehow<00:01:02.539> to<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.049> new<00:01:04.199> transit<00:01:04.949> bus<00:01:05.129> route

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
somehow to is the new transit bus route

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.070 
somehow to is the new transit bus route
i<00:01:05.460> think<00:01:05.670> which<00:01:05.820> may<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.060> coming<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.540> three<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
i think which may be coming and three is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.300 
i think which may be coming and three is
the<00:01:07.260> file<00:01:07.439> map<00:01:07.680> which<00:01:07.920> will<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:08.100> tying

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the file map which will be tying

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.950 
the file map which will be tying
everything<00:01:08.400> together<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.360> first<00:01:09.570> i'll<00:01:09.780> talk

everything together the first i'll talk
about<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.680> transit<00:01:11.040> bus<00:01:11.159> route<00:01:11.400> now<00:01:11.939> in

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
about is the transit bus route now in

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
about is the transit bus route now in
transit<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.990> now<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.350> are<00:01:13.560> some<00:01:13.920> kind<00:01:14.280> of

ever you know specified and it's also

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.499 
ever you know specified and it's also
sometimes<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.400> board<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> spawn<00:01:27.360> that

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
sometimes on the board in the spawn that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.749 
sometimes on the board in the spawn that
says<00:01:27.720> bus<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.619> bus<00:01:28.829> route<00:01:29.070> time<00:01:29.310> number<00:01:29.490> one

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
says bus like bus route time number one

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.789 
says bus like bus route time number one
and<00:01:29.939> buzzsprout<00:01:30.150> time<00:01:30.509> number<00:01:30.630> two<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.650> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
and buzzsprout time number two so that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.410 
and buzzsprout time number two so that
would<00:01:32.009> also<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.030> believe<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
would also we just want to believe that

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.319 
would also we just want to believe that
a<00:01:33.479> second<00:01:33.869> bus<00:01:33.990> route<00:01:34.259> will<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.159> real<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.090> being

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
a second bus route will be real is being

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.359 
a second bus route will be real is being
made<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.770> think<00:01:37.770> what<00:01:37.860> they'll<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.220> they'll

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
made I think what they'll do is they'll

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.090 
made I think what they'll do is they'll
add<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> new<00:01:40.049> map<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.920> won't

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
add it to the new map they won't

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.620 
add it to the new map they won't
actually<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.759> know<00:01:41.850> they<00:01:41.939> won't<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.210> it

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
actually you know they won't have it

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.870 
actually you know they won't have it
added<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.200> transit<00:01:43.680> itself<00:01:44.070> but<00:01:44.520> i<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:44.820> that

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
added to transit itself but i think that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.330 
added to transit itself but i think that
transit<00:01:45.299> will<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.570> an<00:01:46.320> element<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.220> new

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
transit will be an element of the new

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.609 
transit will be an element of the new
map<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.149> they<00:01:48.270> will<00:01:48.390> add<00:01:48.570> they<00:01:49.409> will<00:01:49.530> add

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
map and then they will add they will add

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.319 
map and then they will add they will add
that<00:01:49.799> second<00:01:50.159> bus<00:01:50.280> route<00:01:50.490> plus<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.000> original

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
that second bus route plus the original

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.990 
that second bus route plus the original
bus<00:01:51.450> route<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.049> final<00:01:52.560> map<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:53.939> i

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
bus route to that final map you know i

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.160 
bus route to that final map you know i
just<00:01:54.030> keep<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.479> mind<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.780> speculation

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
just keep in mind this is speculation

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.350 
just keep in mind this is speculation
but<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.920> mean<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.340> could<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.000> some<00:01:57.180> truth

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
but I mean it could have some truth

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.999 
but I mean it could have some truth
because<00:01:57.750> there<00:01:58.079> was<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> lot<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.500> information

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
because there was a lot of information

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.679 
because there was a lot of information
regarding<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.850> second<00:02:00.149> bus<00:02:00.270> route<00:02:00.479> in

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
regarding the second bus route in

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.959 
regarding the second bus route in
transit<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.280> wasn't<00:02:02.729> ever

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
transit you know it really wasn't ever

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.069 
transit you know it really wasn't ever
talked<00:02:03.270> about<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> lot<00:02:03.960> of

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
talked about but there was a lot of

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.510 
talked about but there was a lot of
clues<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.560> stuff<00:02:04.649> leading<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.189> believe

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
clues and stuff leading on to believe

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.999 
clues and stuff leading on to believe
that<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:05.759> could<00:02:05.969> be<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.090> second<00:02:06.420> bus<00:02:06.540> route

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
that there could be a second bus route

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.869 
that there could be a second bus route
the<00:02:08.009> next<00:02:08.220> thing<00:02:08.280> guys<00:02:08.429> will<00:02:08.550> be<00:02:08.640> talking

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
the next thing guys will be talking

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.020 
the next thing guys will be talking
about<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:10.020> final<00:02:10.319> map<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.340> transit

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
about is the final map now in transit

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.580 
about is the final map now in transit
they<00:02:12.180> had<00:02:12.270> elements<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.810> every<00:02:13.050> I

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
they had elements of every I

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.860 
they had elements of every I
dr.<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.069> toten<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:15.209> couple<00:02:15.450> other<00:02:15.629> maps

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
dr. and toten and a couple other maps

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.330 
dr. and toten and a couple other maps
and<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.560> know<00:02:16.620> they<00:02:16.739> kind<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.980> had<00:02:17.099> elements

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and you know they kind of had elements

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.190 
and you know they kind of had elements
of<00:02:17.610> stuff<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.629> think<00:02:18.840> what's<00:02:18.989> going<00:02:19.110> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
of stuff and I think what's going to

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.720 
of stuff and I think what's going to
happen<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.620> they're<00:02:19.860> going<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.310> one

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
happen is they're going to have one

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.339 
happen is they're going to have one
final<00:02:20.970> map<00:02:21.269> that's<00:02:21.510> kind<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.720> elements<00:02:22.200> of

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
final map that's kind of elements of

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.190 
final map that's kind of elements of
every<00:02:22.680> map<00:02:22.860> from<00:02:23.610> World<00:02:23.849> War<00:02:23.970> black<00:02:24.690> ops<00:02:24.900> and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
every map from World War black ops and

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.680 
every map from World War black ops and
from<00:02:25.739> black<00:02:26.010> ops<00:02:26.190> 2<00:02:26.340> i'm<00:02:27.209> really<00:02:27.510> going<00:02:27.629> to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
from black ops 2 i'm really going to

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.180 
from black ops 2 i'm really going to
sure<00:02:27.870> how<00:02:28.260> they're<00:02:28.440> going<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.620> do<00:02:28.739> that<00:02:28.920> but

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
sure how they're going to do that but

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.740 
sure how they're going to do that but
you<00:02:29.310> know<00:02:29.340> trailer<00:02:29.700> their<00:02:30.120> creative<00:02:30.420> team<00:02:30.599> is

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
you know trailer their creative team is

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.080 
you know trailer their creative team is
very<00:02:31.019> very<00:02:31.200> good<00:02:31.470> with<00:02:31.650> easter<00:02:32.040> eggs<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.370> you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
very very good with easter eggs and you

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.610 
very very good with easter eggs and you
know<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.269> creative<00:02:33.569> side<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.840> things<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.230> i

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
know the creative side of things and i

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.839 
know the creative side of things and i
really<00:02:34.860> think<00:02:34.950> they'll<00:02:35.129> have<00:02:35.160> no<00:02:35.310> problem<00:02:35.670> you

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
really think they'll have no problem you

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.880 
really think they'll have no problem you
know<00:02:35.940> combining<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.629> map<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.140> will<00:02:37.650> finish

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
know combining a map that will finish

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.250 
know combining a map that will finish
the<00:02:38.099> story<00:02:38.250> line<00:02:38.430> completely<00:02:39.019> for<00:02:40.019> everyone

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
the story line completely for everyone

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.199 
the story line completely for everyone
who's<00:02:40.410> followed<00:02:40.799> it<00:02:40.950> since<00:02:41.580> World<00:02:41.760> War<00:02:41.819> like<00:02:42.090> I

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
who's followed it since World War like I

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.479 
who's followed it since World War like I
have<00:02:42.450> um<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:43.530> know<00:02:43.620> it'll<00:02:43.950> finish<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.340> story

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
have um you know it'll finish the story

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.460 
have um you know it'll finish the story
line<00:02:44.670> tell<00:02:45.150> us<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.480> fate<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:46.049> characters

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
line tell us the fate of the characters

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.930 
line tell us the fate of the characters
the<00:02:46.799> old<00:02:46.950> characters<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.610> original

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
the old characters the original

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.550 
the old characters the original
characters<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:49.049> these<00:02:49.200> new<00:02:49.380> characters

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
characters and on these new characters

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.440 
characters and on these new characters
so<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.190> think<00:02:50.760> they'll<00:02:51.000> be<00:02:51.120> very<00:02:51.150> very

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
so I think they'll be very very

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.970 
so I think they'll be very very
interesting<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.019> that<00:02:52.260> if<00:02:52.440> they<00:02:52.620> actually<00:02:52.769> do

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
interesting it that if they actually do

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.830

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
the Maxis endgame so what I'm thinking

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.500 
the Maxis endgame so what I'm thinking
is<00:03:09.690> Sam<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.500> going<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.860> trade<00:03:11.239> bodies<00:03:12.239> once

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
is Sam is going to trade bodies once

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.869 
is Sam is going to trade bodies once
again<00:03:12.780> because<00:03:13.049> max<00:03:13.260> s<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.590> in<00:03:13.709> control<00:03:13.950> he<00:03:14.459> Sam

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
again because max s is in control he Sam

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.300 
again because max s is in control he Sam
will<00:03:15.060> trade<00:03:15.299> back<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.110> her<00:03:16.290> body<00:03:16.500> meet<00:03:17.099> up<00:03:17.190> with

line<00:03:30.480> out<00:03:30.690> I'm<00:03:31.440> not<00:03:31.650> really<00:03:31.769> sure<00:03:31.889> where<00:03:32.160> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
line out I'm not really sure where the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.740 
line out I'm not really sure where the
map<00:03:32.430> would<00:03:32.579> even<00:03:32.819> take<00:03:32.910> place<00:03:33.180> there<00:03:33.720> is

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
map would even take place there is

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.870 
map would even take place there is
speculation<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.590> will<00:03:34.680> be<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.769> god<00:03:35.099> Agathe<00:03:35.579> or

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
speculation it will be a god Agathe or

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.059 
speculation it will be a god Agathe or
agartha<00:03:36.480> I'm<00:03:36.959> not<00:03:37.200> exactly<00:03:37.590> sure<00:03:37.769> how<00:03:38.010> you

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
agartha I'm not exactly sure how you

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.160 
agartha I'm not exactly sure how you
would<00:03:38.280> get<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.609> middle<00:03:38.819> of<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:38.910> earth<00:03:39.170> you

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
would get the middle of the earth you

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.460 
would get the middle of the earth you
know<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.560> survive<00:03:41.160> but<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:42.120> think<00:03:42.329> Agatha<00:03:42.569> is<00:03:42.959> a

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
know and survive but I think Agatha is a

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.890 
know and survive but I think Agatha is a
code<00:03:43.859> name<00:03:44.069> for<00:03:44.370> some<00:03:44.700> kind<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:44.970> town<00:03:45.239> or<00:03:45.599> place

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
code name for some kind of town or place

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.050 
code name for some kind of town or place
somewhere<00:03:46.590> on<00:03:46.680> earth<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:47.459> will<00:03:47.669> you<00:03:47.970> know

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
somewhere on earth that will you know

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.330 
somewhere on earth that will you know
kind<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.299> like<00:03:48.419> the<00:03:49.169> final<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.799> final<00:03:49.950> battle

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
kind of like the final the final battle

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.699 
kind of like the final the final battle
will<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.970> know<00:03:51.090> showdown<00:03:51.930> how<00:03:52.079> basically<00:03:52.410> so

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
will you know showdown how basically so

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.360 
will you know showdown how basically so
you<00:03:52.950> guys<00:03:53.549> that<00:03:53.790> spell<00:03:54.060> for<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:55.370> finally

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
you guys that spell for that and finally

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.770 
you guys that spell for that and finally
I<00:03:56.400> think<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:56.970> old<00:03:57.120> characters<00:03:57.510> will<00:03:57.690> be

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
I think that the old characters will be

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.509 
I think that the old characters will be
returning<00:03:58.109> somehow<00:03:58.440> because<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.430> know

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
returning somehow because you know

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.430 
returning somehow because you know
everyone<00:03:59.940> loves<00:04:00.150> them<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:00.510> compared<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.380> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
everyone loves them and compared to the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.960 
everyone loves them and compared to the
new<00:04:01.560> characters<00:04:01.950> everyone<00:04:02.400> hates<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:02.819> new

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
new characters everyone hates the new

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.370 
new characters everyone hates the new
characters<00:04:03.389> compared<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.900> old<00:04:04.019> ones<00:04:04.200> I'm

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
characters compared to the old ones I'm

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.559 
characters compared to the old ones I'm
just<00:04:05.010> because<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.700> old<00:04:06.000> ones<00:04:06.239> you<00:04:06.480> know

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
just because I the old ones you know

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:07.879 
just because I the old ones you know
their<00:04:06.690> original<00:04:07.139> I<00:04:07.169> mean<00:04:07.319> if<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.590> can't

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
their original I mean if you can't

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.680 
their original I mean if you can't
replace<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.489> can't<00:04:08.790> replace<00:04:09.180> an<00:04:09.329> original

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
replace you can't replace an original

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.449 
replace you can't replace an original
you<00:04:09.750> guys<00:04:09.870> can<00:04:09.989> always<00:04:10.139> have<00:04:10.319> like<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.010> sequel

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
you guys can always have like a sequel

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.220 
you guys can always have like a sequel
but<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.790> original<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:12.239> always<00:04:12.419> best<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:12.989> I

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
but the original is always best so I

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.170 
but the original is always best so I
think<00:04:13.680> they'll<00:04:13.889> be<00:04:14.010> making<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.459> return<00:04:14.489> somehow

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
think they'll be making a return somehow

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.599 
think they'll be making a return somehow
um<00:04:15.620> maybe<00:04:16.620> they'll<00:04:16.829> explain<00:04:17.130> how<00:04:17.340> they<00:04:17.489> all

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
um maybe they'll explain how they all

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.819 
um maybe they'll explain how they all
you<00:04:18.090> know<00:04:18.120> how<00:04:18.299> they<00:04:18.419> met<00:04:18.690> up<00:04:18.810> or<00:04:19.139> what

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
after we talked and took over but I do

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.900 
after we talked and took over but I do
believe<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.390> Maxis<00:04:26.900> will<00:04:27.580> give<00:04:28.580> ripped<00:04:28.790> off

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
believe that Maxis will give ripped off

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.660 
believe that Maxis will give ripped off
his<00:04:29.270> body<00:04:29.660> back<00:04:29.990> because<00:04:30.440> max's<00:04:31.070> doesn't

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
his body back because max's doesn't

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.860 
his body back because max's doesn't
really<00:04:31.820> want<00:04:32.000> control<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.420> zombies<00:04:32.720> he

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
really want control of the zombies he

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.970 
really want control of the zombies he
wants<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.140> get<00:04:33.200> his<00:04:33.260> daughter<00:04:33.350> back<00:04:33.620> and

wants to get his daughter back and

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.520 
wants to get his daughter back and
that's<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.940> know<00:04:34.970> very<00:04:35.180> clearly<00:04:35.840> stated<00:04:36.380> in

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
that's you know very clearly stated in

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.010 
that's you know very clearly stated in
the<00:04:36.980> easter<00:04:37.250> egg<00:04:37.310> so<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.330> think<00:04:38.420> he'll<00:04:38.660> get<00:04:38.810> um

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020

the easter egg so I think he'll get um
he'll<00:04:39.650> get<00:04:39.800> his<00:04:39.920> daughter's<00:04:40.220> soul<00:04:40.460> back<00:04:40.640> to

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
he'll get his daughter's soul back to

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.870 
he'll get his daughter's soul back to
her<00:04:41.480> body<00:04:41.690> give<00:04:42.260> Richthofen<00:04:42.920> his<00:04:43.580> soul<00:04:43.850> back

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
her body give Richthofen his soul back

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.300 
her body give Richthofen his soul back
in<00:04:44.270> his<00:04:44.450> body<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:44.930> they<00:04:45.440> will<00:04:45.740> kind<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.130> have<00:04:46.280> a

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
in his body and they will kind of have a

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.880 
in his body and they will kind of have a
final<00:04:46.580> battle<00:04:46.970> somehow<00:04:47.300> on<00:04:47.650> one<00:04:48.650> of<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.770> new

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
final battle somehow on one of the new

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.890 
final battle somehow on one of the new
maps<00:04:49.100> also<00:04:49.550> guys<00:04:49.970> I<00:04:50.120> think<00:04:50.420> that<00:04:50.450> all<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.810> new

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
maps also guys I think that all the new

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.720 
maps also guys I think that all the new
other<00:04:51.080> maps<00:04:51.350> in<00:04:51.650> world<00:04:52.010> of<00:04:52.100> war<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.400> black<00:04:52.550> ops

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
other maps in world of war and black ops

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.700 
other maps in world of war and black ops
will<00:04:52.880> be<00:04:52.970> coming<00:04:53.180> back<00:04:53.360> as<00:04:54.140> I<00:04:54.260> can<00:04:54.290> throw<00:04:54.530> back

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
will be coming back as I can throw back

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.160 
will be coming back as I can throw back
they<00:04:55.400> did<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.640> black<00:04:55.850> ops<00:04:56.030> 1<00:04:56.120> so<00:04:56.660> why<00:04:56.870> not<00:04:57.020> do<00:04:57.140> it

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
they did it black ops 1 so why not do it

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.860 
they did it black ops 1 so why not do it
in<00:04:57.260> black<00:04:57.410> ops<00:04:57.590> 2<00:04:57.710> with<00:04:58.280> all<00:04:59.150> those<00:04:59.360> maps<00:04:59.630> guys

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
in black ops 2 with all those maps guys

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.530 
in black ops 2 with all those maps guys
I<00:04:59.900> they're<00:05:00.350> so<00:05:00.560> fun<00:05:00.800> keno<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:01.430> 5<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.060> all<00:05:02.450> his

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
that they will you know kind of do like

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.840 
that they will you know kind of do like

many<00:05:10.520> guys<00:05:10.610> that's<00:05:10.790> my<00:05:10.910> speculation<00:05:11.660> and

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
many guys that's my speculation and

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.200 
many guys that's my speculation and
theories<00:05:11.930> on<00:05:12.310> you<00:05:13.310> know<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.490> final<00:05:13.700> map<00:05:13.910> for

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
theories on you know the final map for

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.120 
theories on you know the final map for
black<00:05:14.360> ops<00:05:14.390> 2<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:14.870> possibly<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.710> last<00:05:15.830> ever

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
black ops 2 and possibly the last ever

black ops 2 and possibly the last ever
zombie<00:05:16.550> map<00:05:16.730> um<00:05:17.290> like<00:05:18.290> I<00:05:18.350> said<00:05:18.380> it<00:05:18.770> is<00:05:18.800> my

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
zombie map um like I said it is my

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.070 
zombie map um like I said it is my
theory<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.670> if<00:05:19.970> there<00:05:20.120> is<00:05:20.150> a<00:05:20.300> trailer<00:05:20.870> if<00:05:21.020> you
