00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
it like they break really easily oh the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.000 
it like they break really easily oh the
threading<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.720> threading<00:03:31.020> it<00:03:31.410> comes<00:03:31.740> undone

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
really easily so they can't really

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.750 
really easily so they can't really
tighten<00:03:34.170> all<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.470> way<00:03:34.680> like<00:03:35.010> metal<00:03:35.310> ones<00:03:35.490> can

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760
