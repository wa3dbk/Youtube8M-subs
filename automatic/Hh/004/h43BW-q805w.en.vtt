home garden well my father had always
said<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.180> there<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.390> plenty<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.689> soil<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.110> a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
said that there was plenty of soil in a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.420 
said that there was plenty of soil in a
grow<00:00:22.320> bag<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.650> any<00:00:22.770> who<00:00:22.920> turn<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.310> other

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
grow bag if any who turn it the other

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.730 
grow bag if any who turn it the other
way<00:00:23.580> up<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.450> we<00:00:24.570> were<00:00:24.660> looking<00:00:24.900> for<00:00:25.110> a<00:00:25.140> method

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
way up so we were looking for a method

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.340 
way up so we were looking for a method
of<00:00:25.860> turning<00:00:26.100> it<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.550> its<00:00:26.820> side<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.480> if<00:00:28.260> you

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
of turning it on its side and if you

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.930 
of turning it on its side and if you
turn<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.650> its<00:00:28.800> side<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:28.980> put<00:00:29.369> clamp

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
turn it on its side and put clamp

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.460 
turn it on its side and put clamp
anything<00:00:30.270> on<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> outside<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.230> tend

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
anything on the outside of it you tend

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.979 
anything on the outside of it you tend
to<00:00:31.500> make<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.680> damp<00:00:31.949> environment<00:00:32.220> for<00:00:33.059> slugs<00:00:33.330> so

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
to make a damp environment for slugs so

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.530 
to make a damp environment for slugs so
a<00:00:34.020> friend<00:00:34.379> Norman<00:00:34.920> who's<00:00:35.640> an<00:00:35.820> engineer<00:00:35.940> came

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
a friend Norman who's an engineer came

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.470 
a friend Norman who's an engineer came
up<00:00:36.720> with<00:00:36.900> a<00:00:36.930> very<00:00:37.199> innovative<00:00:37.559> clip<00:00:38.220> system

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
up with a very innovative clip system

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.210 
up with a very innovative clip system
using<00:00:39.480> metal<00:00:39.840> I'm<00:00:39.989> not<00:00:40.140> an<00:00:40.260> engineer<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.920> his

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
using metal I'm not an engineer so his

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.280 
using metal I'm not an engineer so his
it's<00:00:41.699> a<00:00:41.820> wire<00:00:42.000> bent<00:00:42.300> metal<00:00:42.659> frame<00:00:42.900> and<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it's a wire bent metal frame and it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.020 
it's a wire bent metal frame and it
supports<00:00:43.830> the<00:00:43.890> grow<00:00:44.100> bag<00:00:44.220> on<00:00:44.400> its<00:00:44.519> side<00:00:44.729> so<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
supports the grow bag on its side so you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.939 
supports the grow bag on its side so you
get<00:00:45.180> better<00:00:45.300> soil<00:00:45.659> depth<00:00:45.960> better<00:00:46.470> soil<00:00:46.769> depth

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
get better soil depth better soil depth

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.439 
get better soil depth better soil depth
obviously<00:00:47.280> means<00:00:47.460> better<00:00:47.640> root<00:00:47.940> development

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
obviously means better root development

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:49.670 
obviously means better root development
for<00:00:48.570> your<00:00:48.690> plants<00:00:49.019> so<00:00:49.080> better<00:00:49.379> crop

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
for your plants so better crop

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.020 
for your plants so better crop
potentially<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.519> look<00:00:50.670> after<00:00:50.790> your

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
potentially if you look after your

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.450 
potentially if you look after your
plants<00:00:51.330> and<00:00:51.540> it<00:00:52.530> also<00:00:52.650> gives<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.070> straps<00:00:53.339> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
plants and it also gives you straps to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.250 
plants and it also gives you straps to
grow<00:00:53.640> up<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.690> actually<00:00:54.809> move<00:00:55.080> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
grow up and you can actually move the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.810 
grow up and you can actually move the
frame<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.860> want<00:00:56.040> to<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.760> actually

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
frame if you want to you can actually

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.520 
frame if you want to you can actually
lift<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.180> whole<00:00:57.269> thing<00:00:57.330> up<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:58.049> also<00:00:58.199> makes<00:00:58.470> it

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
lift the whole thing up it also makes it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.899 
lift the whole thing up it also makes it
easier<00:00:58.830> for<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.040> water<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.580> plants

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
easier for you to water your plants

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.189 
easier for you to water your plants
because<00:01:00.089> watering<00:01:00.449> plants<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.839> it<00:01:00.900> grow<00:01:01.019> back

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
because watering plants and it grow back

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.469 
because watering plants and it grow back
is<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> bit<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.619> a<00:01:01.680> nightmare

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.950 

the<00:01:05.990> straps<00:01:06.350> are<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.579> main<00:01:07.789> support<00:01:08.689> for<00:01:08.750> the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
the straps are the main support for the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.899 
the straps are the main support for the
plant<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.500> gives<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:10.250> initial<00:01:10.759> for

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
plant and that gives you initial for

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.490 
plant and that gives you initial for
your<00:01:11.000> young<00:01:11.180> plants<00:01:11.509> that<00:01:11.630> gives<00:01:11.840> them<00:01:12.049> your

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
your young plants that gives them your

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.779 
your young plants that gives them your
vertical<00:01:12.860> support<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:13.250> you<00:01:13.310> can<00:01:13.369> tie<00:01:13.610> it<00:01:13.670> at

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
vertical support so you can tie it at

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.580 
vertical support so you can tie it at
plants<00:01:14.179> into<00:01:14.479> them<00:01:14.630> when<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:15.200> want<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.439> go

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
plants into them when you want to go

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.020 
plants into them when you want to go
taller<00:01:15.860> because<00:01:16.039> obviously<00:01:16.219> tomato<00:01:16.640> plants

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
taller because obviously tomato plants

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.179 
taller because obviously tomato plants
tend<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.270> grow<00:01:17.420> taller<00:01:17.689> than<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:17.990> frame<00:01:18.229> you

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
tend to grow taller than the frame you

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.590 
tend to grow taller than the frame you
add<00:01:19.310> a<00:01:19.340> cane<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.149> then<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.329> can<00:01:20.450> carry

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
add a cane to it and then you can carry

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.059 
add a cane to it and then you can carry
on<00:01:20.719> tying<00:01:21.079> your<00:01:21.259> plants<00:01:21.590> up<00:01:21.649> as<00:01:21.799> high<00:01:21.890> as<00:01:21.920> you

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
on tying your plants up as high as you

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:23.919 
on tying your plants up as high as you
want<00:01:22.159> to<00:01:22.310> go<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.759> because<00:01:23.390> we<00:01:23.509> know<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.659> lot<00:01:23.810> of

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
want to go and because we know a lot of

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:25.480 
want to go and because we know a lot of
people<00:01:24.170> like<00:01:24.289> to<00:01:24.380> grow<00:01:24.500> peas<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:25.039> sweet<00:01:25.250> peas

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
people like to grow peas and sweet peas

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.819 
people like to grow peas and sweet peas
which<00:01:26.030> grow<00:01:26.270> very<00:01:26.450> well<00:01:26.600> in<00:01:26.750> grow<00:01:26.960> bags<00:01:26.990> we

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
which grow very well in grow bags we

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:29.740 
which grow very well in grow bags we
also<00:01:27.979> designed<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.670> piece<00:01:29.090> of<00:01:29.270> an<00:01:29.329> internet

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
also designed a piece of an internet

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.080 
also designed a piece of an internet
which<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.229> fits<00:01:30.679> the<00:01:30.799> frame<00:01:31.039> just<00:01:31.310> fits<00:01:31.939> fit

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
which is fits the frame just fits fit

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.179 
which is fits the frame just fits fit
very<00:01:32.270> simply<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.990> your<00:01:33.439> peas<00:01:33.679> and<00:01:33.920> your<00:01:34.009> sweet
