00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.660
 you want to lose weight but have it 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.820
 never done here i'll tell you ten 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.830
 possible reasons why that is the reason 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.690
 number one you are always hungry 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.519
 there are many foods yours 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.259
 blood sugar level very rapidly upwards 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.029
 shoot and just as fast again 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.470
 blood sugar level is shot up 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.480
 He comes down again exactly 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.160
 This time is called that 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.809
 means we get the desire more 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.579
 eat mainly on food 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:29.079
 then cause more hunger 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.719
 that is, it creates a veritable 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.160
 vicious circle that always repeats itself 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.020
 on the subject of hunger, I already have 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.250
 a detailed video made that 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.949
 you can look here 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.899
 reason number two you confuse healthy 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.070
 eat with lose weight in most cases 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.839
 overweight by one 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.460
 diet on healthy 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.649
 nutrition is a weight reduction 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.839
 usually it can automatically 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.460
 still be that too much of the 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.469
 secure healthy food and thereby 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.909
 eating more calories than you 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.859
 consumes as well as you can 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.749
 theoretically with unhealthy foods 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.519
 take off possible reason number three you 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.019
 have gotten used to it too fast too 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.489
 eat if you are too fast then 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.140
 you get more food in the 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.000
 body then saturation can be felt 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.430
 usually only later tried 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.810
 but just eat a bit slower 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.790
 to chew a bit more by doing so 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.680
 you will saturate much sooner 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.570
 feel and only automatically less 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.220
 Number four you already have one 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.230
 But you have lost a few kilos 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.030
 exaggerated and that's what you have 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.100
 possibly the calorie requirement 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.140
 shot up because many slimming the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.800
 with your calories right and fast 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.330
 solid 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.130
 but you take it off but the 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.900
 Body adapts to the amount of calories 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.210
 and when the body connects to one 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.370
 Low calorie count then fits 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.170
 theoretically you would have to go further 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.340
 go down mean calories with it 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.780
 continues to decline 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.280
 At this time , calories 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.050
 but already so little be it 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.670
 impossible is even further down to 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.650
 you go and you stagnate when you're in 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.330
 This situation is one must 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.910
 or badly pause briefly and the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.890
 calories slowly over a few weeks 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.630
 increase so that you can possibly with the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.610
 Weight stagnates the body adapts 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.320
 then to those new higher calories 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.820
 number on and after a few weeks can 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.380
 Get back to the calories 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.310
 go down and then you should go back 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.200
 can lose reason number five 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.850
 away too little movement increases the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.770
 calorie consumption and keeps that 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.810
 physical processes are therefore at work 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.730
 Sport has a very strong effect though 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.440
 even if you do not do any sports 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.660
 can or want to do at least 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.390
 walk regularly every day 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.370
 walk from about 45 minutes to 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.810
 An hour has a big effect 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.000
 the body and the fat burning 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.980
 reason number itself always uses too 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.840
 a lot of sauce at the meals I have 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.120
 I 've often seen people like her 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.769
 eat with drown and most of the sauce 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.690
 Sauces are very high in calories 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.790
 So maybe you should try 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.470
 to keep the sauces moderate and moderate 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.750
 the food may be more 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.640
 to enjoy and is not with sweet 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.470
 taste to cover reason number 7 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.360
 not enough clear water is drinking here 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.760
 for all physical processes and 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.230
 organs are used a lot of liquid 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.900
 that is, if you are more fluid 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.430
 then feeds the body is more active and 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.799
 better lose weight effectively and as I said 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.180
 it should best be clear so quiet 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.299
 Be water when a drink 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.890
 taste then it is mostly strong 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.330
 sugary or stimulates cravings 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.160
 and of course that's a big one 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.340
 disadvantage in losing weight a general 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.530
 recommendation is about 2.5 to 3.5 liters 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.840
 Water depending on height and weight 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.120
 for women usually two to two 5 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.010
 liter if you have a lot of movement or 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.750
 then you should do some sports 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.970
 drink more because of your increased 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.310
 sweat production reason number 18 is too 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.140
 vegetable is the advantage of vegetables 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.060
 that it saturates very quickly as well 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.100
 Vegetables are known to have many vitamins 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.200
 and minerals that supports 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.450
 of course the physical processes and 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.340
 thus helps you with nablus vegetables 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.500
 Of course, there are usually few calories left 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.420
 that is why the amount of vegetables in 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.310
 increase your meals if it is the 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.829
 automatically less of the others 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.900
 reason number 9 uses too much grease when 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.090
 many use cooking, for example 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.250
 fry meat too much fat her 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.690
 will be surprised how little fat 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.970
 actually when frying meat 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.190
 needs reason number 10 and that is the 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.049
 typical reason you do too much 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.299
 small candy in between or 1 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.829
 usually can have a very strong effect 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.540
 your weight gain h 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.400
 because simple sugar has many more 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.880
 calories and it just makes you want to 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.490
 more 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.990
 a solution for this could be 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.510
 taste buds for sugar to get used to 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.310
 if you regularly take sweets to you 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.780
 then it is the same as for example 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.880
 when salty or spicy the 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.440
 taste buds are getting used to it 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.510
 more tuned and if the taste buds 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.880
 once used to it then the 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.890
 food to be extremely sweet with it 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.770
 I am still satisfied 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.720
 for two weeks just completely on 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.150
 to give up sweet sit down 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.890
 this goal only two weeks longer 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.510
 and if he just pulls it through 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.200
 then you will be after these two weeks 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.520
 notice 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.470
 you do not have such a big one anymore 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.150
 lust on sweet if your after this time 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.590
 but had a bit of pleasure then 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.270
 reward yourself with a blackboard 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.070
 chocolate or what so ever with 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.350
 but it does not just exaggerate one 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.270
 candy and then pulls the whole without 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.280
 candy through a week again 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.990
 then you can be rewarded again and 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.240
 so on you will notice someday 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.980
 you do not need sweets because 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:09.910
 the demand simply is not there anymore 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.910
 and won it 112 times from 106 times
