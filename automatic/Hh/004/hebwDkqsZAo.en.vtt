00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
obviously two barracks in the back makes

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.269 
obviously two barracks in the back makes
sense<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:18.810> actually<00:00:19.109> going<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.350> put<00:00:19.470> all<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
sense but actually going to put all the

way<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> back<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.240> reason<00:00:21.539> why<00:00:21.660> is

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
way in the back and the reason why is

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.939

because<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.020> don't<00:00:22.199> you're<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.590> gonna<00:00:22.710> reach

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
because you don't you're not gonna reach

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.340 
because you don't you're not gonna reach
with<00:00:23.519> your<00:00:23.550> other<00:00:23.910> towers<00:00:24.480> if<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:24.960> up<00:00:25.050> all

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
with your other towers if you put up all

the way takes you want to push them up
just<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.480> little<00:00:27.510> bit<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.260> also<00:00:28.410> gives<00:00:28.619> you

a<00:00:28.740> little<00:00:28.890> bit<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.010> breathing<00:00:29.220> room<00:00:29.369> because

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
a little bit of breathing room because

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.400 
a little bit of breathing room because
of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> doing<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.300> sneaking<00:00:30.539> through<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.260> can

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
of the doing of sneaking through you can

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.690 
of the doing of sneaking through you can
use<00:00:31.560> cough<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.980> move<00:00:32.099> her<00:00:32.189> around<00:00:32.309> or<00:00:32.610> use

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
use cough and move her around or use

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.920 
use cough and move her around or use
your<00:00:32.820> reinforcements<00:00:33.390> or<00:00:33.450> whatever<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the basic plan here obviously we're

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.540 
the basic plan here obviously we're
gonna<00:00:39.180> go<00:00:39.379> mage<00:00:40.379> towers<00:00:40.770> all<00:00:40.980> throughout<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
gonna go mage towers all throughout the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.440 
gonna go mage towers all throughout the
middle<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> map

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
middle of the map

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.779 
middle of the map
mostly<00:00:42.930> mage<00:00:43.170> towers<00:00:43.620> because<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.610> go

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
mostly mage towers because if you go

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.139 
mostly mage towers because if you go
would<00:00:45.000> mix<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.750> over<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.140> place<00:00:47.149> those

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
would mix it up all over the place those

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.910 
would mix it up all over the place those
guys<00:00:48.420> right<00:00:48.690> there<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.020> top<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.559> going<00:00:49.800> to

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
using our lightning on wave one quite

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.060 
using our lightning on wave one quite
quick<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.050> then<00:01:15.260> as<00:01:15.350> soon<00:01:15.470> as<00:01:15.560> you<00:01:15.650> use<00:01:15.860> that

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
quick and then as soon as you use that

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.980 
quick and then as soon as you use that
go<00:01:16.520> way<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.360> they'll<00:01:17.480> give<00:01:17.630> us<00:01:17.690> a<00:01:17.750> little<00:01:17.870> bit

vector<00:01:18.230> boat<00:01:18.350> I<00:01:18.500> don't<00:01:18.620> see<00:01:18.710> this<00:01:18.770> rope<00:01:19.070> chance

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
vector boat I don't see this rope chance

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.700 
vector boat I don't see this rope chance
not<00:01:19.730> that<00:01:20.030> big<00:01:20.240> of<00:01:20.300> a<00:01:20.360> deal<00:01:20.510> but<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.470> can<00:01:21.590> make

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
not that big of a deal but you can make

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.770 
not that big of a deal but you can make
now<00:01:22.700> again<00:01:22.940> one<00:01:23.090> thing<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:23.330> I<00:01:23.390> won't<00:01:23.540> end<00:01:23.720> up

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.440 
now again one thing that I won't end up
doing<00:01:24.020> too<00:01:24.170> much<00:01:24.350> is<00:01:24.530> use<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.860> views<00:01:25.040> ELISA

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
doing too much is use the views ELISA

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.760 
doing too much is use the views ELISA
these<00:01:26.450> little<00:01:26.660> trees<00:01:26.870> here<00:01:27.110> man<00:01:27.320> these<00:01:27.590> these

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
it looks like I said we're defeating

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.710 
it looks like I said we're defeating
most<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.459> these<00:02:46.519> wolves<00:02:46.730> quite<00:02:47.120> easily<00:02:47.330> so

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
most of these wolves quite easily so

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.850 
most of these wolves quite easily so
it's<00:02:48.019> about<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.260> time<00:02:48.349> since<00:02:48.709> there's

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
it's about that time since there's

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.170 
it's about that time since there's
billions<00:02:49.129> of<00:02:49.400> wolves<00:02:49.730> all<00:02:49.849> over<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.000> place

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
billions of wolves all over the place

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.470 
billions of wolves all over the place
let's<00:02:50.569> get<00:02:50.870> our<00:02:51.049> Ericsson<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.299> just<00:02:53.299> because

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
let's get our Ericsson and just because

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.910 
let's get our Ericsson and just because
we<00:02:53.569> can<00:02:53.720> we<00:02:53.870> decided<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.260> lighting<00:02:54.590> those<00:02:54.739> guys

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
we can we decided to lighting those guys

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.220 
we can we decided to lighting those guys
because<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.879> know<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.390> wasn't<00:02:56.540> exactly<00:02:56.930> the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
because I know it wasn't exactly the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.720 
because I know it wasn't exactly the
most<00:02:57.290> important<00:02:57.890> thing<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.160> be<00:02:58.190> lighting<00:02:58.459> that

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
most important thing to be lighting that

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.400 
most important thing to be lighting that
guy<00:02:58.910> but<00:02:59.239> at<00:02:59.330> least<00:02:59.390> we<00:02:59.510> did<00:02:59.660> some<00:02:59.780> damage<00:02:59.930> and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
guy but at least we did some damage and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.330 
guy but at least we did some damage and
guess<00:03:00.590> what<00:03:00.680> we'll<00:03:00.799> get<00:03:00.860> our<00:03:00.980> lighting<00:03:01.190> back

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
guess what we'll get our lighting back

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.059 
guess what we'll get our lighting back
that<00:03:01.549> time<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.730> needed<00:03:01.940> anyways

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
that time I needed anyways

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.320 
that time I needed anyways
so<00:03:04.069> we've<00:03:04.190> got<00:03:04.310> some<00:03:04.430> Volkers<00:03:04.790> up<00:03:04.940> top<00:03:05.150> here

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
so we've got some Volkers up top here

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.520 
so we've got some Volkers up top here
that's<00:03:05.450> usually<00:03:05.810> not<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.959> good<00:03:06.019> sign<00:03:06.170> at<00:03:06.440> all

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
that's usually not a good sign at all

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.020 
that's usually not a good sign at all
they're<00:03:06.890> pretty<00:03:07.099> darn<00:03:07.250> fast<00:03:07.489> they<00:03:07.819> heal

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
they're pretty darn fast they heal

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.740 
they're pretty darn fast they heal
people<00:03:08.420> they<00:03:08.780> heal<00:03:09.079> themselves<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:10.480> yeah<00:03:11.480> they

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
people they heal themselves so yeah they

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.940 
people they heal themselves so yeah they
kind<00:03:11.959> of<00:03:11.989> just<00:03:12.140> suck<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:15.470> we're<00:03:15.560> gonna<00:03:15.650> freeze

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
kind of just suck so we're gonna freeze

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.140 
kind of just suck so we're gonna freeze
some<00:03:16.129> people<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.430> try<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:16.640> get<00:03:16.819> them<00:03:17.000> all

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
some people to try and get them all

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
some people to try and get them all
separate<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.510> little<00:03:17.569> bit<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.840> hopefully<00:03:17.930> we

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
separate a little bit and hopefully we

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.360 
separate a little bit and hopefully we
get<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.290> lightning<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.829> top<00:03:19.010> there<00:03:19.220> going

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
get a lightning in the top there going

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.250 
get a lightning in the top there going
to<00:03:19.400> be<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.519> chance<00:03:19.849> to<00:03:19.970> but<00:03:20.420> there's<00:03:20.599> also<00:03:20.900> a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
to be a chance to but there's also a

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.050 
to be a chance to but there's also a
giant<00:03:21.739> purple<00:03:22.220> golem<00:03:22.579> in<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.730> middle<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:22.970> the

now it's kind of a takedown
let's<00:03:44.780> go<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:46.280> basically<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:48.049> way<00:03:48.169> to<00:03:48.200> take

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
let's go so basically the way to take

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.809 
let's go so basically the way to take
down<00:03:48.440> golems<00:03:48.889> is<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.340> try<00:03:49.519> and<00:03:49.609> get<00:03:49.700> them

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
down golems is is to try and get them

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:50.680 
down golems is is to try and get them
right<00:03:49.940> in<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.060> middle<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.329> screen<00:03:50.480> and

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
right in the middle of the screen and

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.420 
right in the middle of the screen and
they<00:03:50.750> just<00:03:50.930> never<00:03:51.139> let<00:03:51.560> them<00:03:51.739> leave<00:03:51.980> that<00:03:52.190> spot

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
they just never let them leave that spot

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.180 
they just never let them leave that spot
that<00:03:53.359> is<00:03:53.540> like<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.079> ideal<00:03:54.319> way<00:03:54.799> to<00:03:54.829> kill<00:03:55.099> the

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
that is like the ideal way to kill the

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.400 
that is like the ideal way to kill the
golem<00:03:55.750> sometimes<00:03:56.750> your<00:03:56.870> magic<00:03:57.139> will<00:03:57.260> just

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
golem sometimes your magic will just

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.809 
golem sometimes your magic will just
keep<00:03:57.530> forcing<00:03:57.829> them<00:03:58.099> back<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.489> back<00:03:58.609> and<00:03:58.639> back

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
keep forcing them back and back and back

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.069 
keep forcing them back and back and back
and<00:03:58.910> honestly<00:03:59.269> don't<00:03:59.569> want<00:03:59.750> them<00:03:59.840> in<00:03:59.930> the<00:03:59.989> back

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
and honestly don't want them in the back

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.509 
and honestly don't want them in the back
of<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.349> screen<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:00.829> you<00:04:01.010> don't<00:04:01.220> want<00:04:01.370> them<00:04:01.459> in

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
of the screen and you don't want them in

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.710 
of the screen and you don't want them in
the<00:04:01.579> front<00:04:01.760> you<00:04:02.090> want<00:04:02.269> them<00:04:02.450> right<00:04:02.599> in<00:04:02.660> the

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
the front you want them right in the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.569 
the front you want them right in the
middle<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.319> means<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:03.980> brute<00:04:04.220> force<00:04:04.489> of

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
middle that means the brute force of

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.620 
middle that means the brute force of
your<00:04:04.700> killing<00:04:04.970> power<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.359> going<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.569> be

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
your killing power is going to be

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.960 
your killing power is going to be
tacking<00:04:06.049> yeah<00:04:06.500> unless<00:04:07.280> there's<00:04:07.730> other<00:04:07.880> guys

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
tacking yeah unless there's other guys

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.720 
tacking yeah unless there's other guys
that<00:04:08.120> are<00:04:08.180> in<00:04:08.299> force<00:04:08.569> in<00:04:08.750> front<00:04:08.989> of<00:04:09.079> it<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:10.220> the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
that are in force in front of it and the

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.009 
that are in force in front of it and the
more<00:04:10.790> damage<00:04:11.090> due<00:04:11.209> to<00:04:11.239> on<00:04:11.389> the<00:04:11.480> slower<00:04:11.690> he<00:04:11.840> gets

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
more damage due to on the slower he gets

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.500 
more damage due to on the slower he gets
it's<00:04:12.200> obviously<00:04:12.470> very<00:04:12.560> important<00:04:13.130> to<00:04:13.639> keep<00:04:14.299> up

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
it's obviously very important to keep up

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.250 
it's obviously very important to keep up
for<00:04:14.780> that

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
for that

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.810
