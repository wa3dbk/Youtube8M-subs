we're<00:00:28.020> going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.199> concentrate<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.800> little<00:00:28.980> bit

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
we're going to concentrate a little bit

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.279 
we're going to concentrate a little bit
on<00:00:29.220> some<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> benefits<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.720> some<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.199> the

on some of the benefits on some of the
reduction<00:00:31.890> we're<00:00:32.879> going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> mix<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> same

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
reduction we're going to mix the same

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.510 
reduction we're going to mix the same
color<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:34.440> different<00:00:34.739> reducers<00:00:35.340> one's

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
color with different reducers one's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.010 
color with different reducers one's
going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.360> regular

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
going to be with the regular

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.750 
going to be with the regular
illustration<00:00:37.500> reducer<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.460> other<00:00:38.579> one's

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
illustration reducer and the other one's

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.889 
illustration reducer and the other one's
going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> high-performance

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
going to be with the high-performance

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.410 
going to be with the high-performance
reducer<00:00:40.380> and<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:41.040> later<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.370> after<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.090> dries

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
reducer and then later on after it dries

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.790 
reducer and then later on after it dries
we're<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> show<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> difference<00:00:43.320> with

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
we're going to show the difference with

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.340 
we're going to show the difference with
the<00:00:43.920> erase<00:00:44.190> ability<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.600> manipulation

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the erase ability and the manipulation

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.920 
the erase ability and the manipulation
of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> colors<00:00:47.030> let's<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.149> started<00:00:49.160> okay<00:00:50.160> I

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
of the colors let's get started okay I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.770 
of the colors let's get started okay I
want<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.020> test<00:00:52.260> my<00:00:52.350> color<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.690> adjust<00:00:54.690> my

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
want to test my color here and adjust my

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.069 
want to test my color here and adjust my
air<00:00:55.559> pressure<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.270> don't<00:00:57.270> really<00:00:57.780> use<00:00:58.050> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
air pressure I don't really use a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.380 
air pressure I don't really use a
regulator<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.950> go<00:00:59.309> more<00:00:59.520> by<00:00:59.730> feel<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.270> I've

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
regulator I go more by feel but I've

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.389 
regulator I go more by feel but I've
gotten<00:01:00.690> pretty<00:01:00.809> good<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.140> knowing<00:01:01.440> more<00:01:02.250> or

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
gotten pretty good at knowing more or

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.340 
gotten pretty good at knowing more or
less<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> air<00:01:02.820> pressure<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:04.049> saying

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
less the air pressure and I'm saying

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.940 
less the air pressure and I'm saying
this<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.949> about<00:01:05.280> 20<00:01:05.850> psi

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
this is about 20 psi

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.429 
this is about 20 psi
okay<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.909> color<00:01:09.209> is<00:01:09.749> the<00:01:10.020> illustration

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
okay now this color is the illustration

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.559 
okay now this color is the illustration
reducer<00:01:11.039> and<00:01:11.279> I<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.880> want<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.149> do<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> nice

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
reducer and I just want to do a nice

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.789 
reducer and I just want to do a nice
fade<00:01:13.999> with<00:01:14.999> the<00:01:15.149> illustration<00:01:15.749> reducer<00:01:16.289> if

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
fade with the illustration reducer if

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.739 
fade with the illustration reducer if
you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.340> here<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:17.789> you<00:01:17.849> start<00:01:17.969> saturating

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:18.749 
you can see here if you start saturating

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:20.269 
you can see here if you start saturating
it<00:01:18.869> too<00:01:19.049> much<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.590> start<00:01:19.859> to<00:01:19.979> get<00:01:20.069> a<00:01:20.130> little

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:20.279 
it too much you start to get a little

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.550 
it too much you start to get a little
bit<00:01:20.520> more<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.849> the<00:01:20.969> pigment<00:01:21.389> migration<00:01:21.929> that's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
bit more of the pigment migration that's

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.249 
bit more of the pigment migration that's
one<00:01:23.069> of<00:01:23.249> the<00:01:23.369> drawbacks<00:01:23.579> to<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.569> however

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
one of the drawbacks to this one however

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.349 
one of the drawbacks to this one however
you<00:01:25.649> can<00:01:25.920> reduce<00:01:26.279> it<00:01:26.520> less<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.029> it<00:01:27.270> will

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
you can reduce it less and it will

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.870 
you can reduce it less and it will
eliminate<00:01:27.569> that<00:01:28.109> I<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:29.069> to<00:01:29.189> get<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.459> more

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
eliminate that I want to get it more

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.779 
eliminate that I want to get it more
saturated<00:01:30.509> up<00:01:30.779> top<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.349> you<00:01:32.099> can<00:01:32.219> see<00:01:32.399> the

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
saturated up top so you can see the

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.539 
saturated up top so you can see the
limitation<00:01:33.419> on<00:01:33.569> on<00:01:33.779> the<00:01:34.380> film<00:01:34.709> build<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
limitation on on the film build if you

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.089 
limitation on on the film build if you
get<00:01:35.729> too<00:01:36.179> much<00:01:36.359> film<00:01:36.719> then<00:01:37.409> what<00:01:37.590> happens<00:01:37.950> is

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:38.099 
get too much film then what happens is

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:44.750 
get too much film then what happens is
it<00:01:38.249> doesn't<00:01:38.399> erase<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.999> well

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.550 

okay<00:01:45.760> now<00:01:46.540> we're<00:01:46.720> going<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.930> duplicate<00:01:47.350> this

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
okay now we're going to duplicate this

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.320 
okay now we're going to duplicate this
exact<00:01:47.950> same<00:01:48.160> thing<00:01:48.490> with<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.790> same<00:01:49.030> color

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
exact same thing with the same color

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.730 
exact same thing with the same color
except<00:01:49.810> we're<00:01:49.930> going<00:01:50.050> to<00:01:50.110> reduce<00:01:50.230> it<00:01:50.500> with<00:01:50.620> the

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
except we're going to reduce it with the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.760 
except we're going to reduce it with the
high-performance<00:01:51.340> reducer<00:01:52.350> now<00:01:53.350> one<00:01:53.590> thing

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
high-performance reducer now one thing

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.960 
high-performance reducer now one thing
you're<00:01:53.890> going<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.070> notice<00:01:54.250> is<00:01:54.640> you're<00:01:54.850> not

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
you're going to notice is you're not

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.610 
you're going to notice is you're not
going<00:01:55.150> to<00:01:55.240> get<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:55.660> weird<00:01:56.260> thing<00:01:56.440> that

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
going to get that weird thing that

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.469 
going to get that weird thing that
happens<00:01:56.950> that<00:01:57.130> pigment<00:01:57.520> migration<00:01:58.090> looks

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
happens that pigment migration looks

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.150 
happens that pigment migration looks
like<00:01:58.720> fish<00:01:58.960> eyes<00:01:59.200> you're<00:01:59.650> not<00:01:59.800> going<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.070> get

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
like fish eyes you're not going to get

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.040 
like fish eyes you're not going to get
that<00:02:00.400> with<00:02:00.580> this<00:02:00.790> now<00:02:01.360> let's<00:02:01.570> get<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:01.750> little

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
that with this now let's get a little

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.219 
that with this now let's get a little
bit<00:02:02.140> more<00:02:02.320> saturation<00:02:03.130> here<00:02:03.369> at<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.610> top<00:02:07.229> okay

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
bit more saturation here at the top okay

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.630 
bit more saturation here at the top okay
now<00:02:08.590> we're<00:02:08.740> going<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.890> wait<00:02:09.100> about<00:02:09.220> five

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
now we're going to wait about five

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.800 
now we're going to wait about five
minutes

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
minutes

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.960 
minutes
five<00:02:11.320> or<00:02:11.500> 10<00:02:11.650> minutes<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.100> then<00:02:12.700> we're<00:02:12.880> going

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
five or 10 minutes and then we're going

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.640 
five or 10 minutes and then we're going
to<00:02:13.030> take<00:02:13.270> off<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.630> tape<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.050> then<00:02:14.470> we're

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
to take off the tape and then we're

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.580 
to take off the tape and then we're
going<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.800> do<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.010> tape<00:02:15.310> test<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:16.020> okay<00:02:17.050> the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
going to do a tape test on it okay the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.830 
going to do a tape test on it okay the
paint's<00:02:17.920> been<00:02:17.950> drying<00:02:18.310> for<00:02:18.430> about<00:02:18.820> 20<00:02:19.540> minutes

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
paint's been drying for about 20 minutes

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.320 
paint's been drying for about 20 minutes
the<00:02:20.530> side<00:02:20.770> with<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.250> illustration<00:02:21.850> reducer

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
the side with the illustration reducer

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.660 
the side with the illustration reducer
we're<00:02:22.870> going<00:02:22.989> to<00:02:23.050> remove<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.590> now<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.400> what

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
we're going to remove that now and what

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.979 
we're going to remove that now and what
I<00:02:24.700> want<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.090> do<00:02:25.209> is<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.390> want<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.630> show<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.900> a

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
I want to do is I want to show you a

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.990 
I want to do is I want to show you a
little<00:02:26.290> bit<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.650> tape<00:02:26.860> ability<00:02:27.370> here<00:02:27.700> I'm

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
little bit of the tape ability here I'm

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.400 
little bit of the tape ability here I'm
going<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.239> press<00:02:28.480> down<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.750> tape<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.320> little

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
going to press down the tape a little

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.070 
going to press down the tape a little
bit<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:33.000> then<00:02:34.000> we're<00:02:34.180> going<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.330> remove<00:02:34.570> this

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
bit and then we're going to remove this

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:43.110 
bit and then we're going to remove this
and<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:41.800> side<00:02:42.100> has<00:02:42.370> been<00:02:42.550> drying<00:02:42.820> for<00:02:42.940> about

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
and this side has been drying for about

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.330 
and this side has been drying for about
ten<00:02:43.690> minutes<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.440> want<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.770> show<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.130> tape

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
ten minutes and I want to show the tape

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.550 
ten minutes and I want to show the tape
ability<00:02:45.790> here<00:02:46.120> also<00:02:46.330> this<00:02:46.959> is<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.380> green<00:02:49.560> tape

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
ability here also this is the green tape

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.539 
ability here also this is the green tape
it's<00:02:50.920> usually<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:52.709> pretty<00:02:53.709> good<00:02:53.830> tape<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.430> has

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
it's usually a pretty good tape it has

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.160 
it's usually a pretty good tape it has
pretty<00:02:54.790> good<00:02:54.880> adhesion<00:02:55.330> it's<00:02:55.630> probably<00:02:55.989> very

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
pretty good adhesion it's probably very

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.539 
pretty good adhesion it's probably very
typical<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.830> what<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:56.980> would<00:02:57.100> use<00:02:57.400> in

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
typical of what you would use in

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.520 
typical of what you would use in
automotive<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.750> want<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.019> press<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.230> down

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
automotive and I want to press it down

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.830 
automotive and I want to press it down
nicely<00:03:00.510> now<00:03:01.510> let's<00:03:01.750> give<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.110> good<00:03:02.290> pull<00:03:03.840> and

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
nicely now let's give it a good pull and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.840 
nicely now let's give it a good pull and
there<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.140> see<00:03:05.350> no<00:03:05.560> problems<00:03:06.130> that's<00:03:06.610> about

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
there you see no problems that's about

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.509 
there you see no problems that's about
10<00:03:07.150> minutes<00:03:07.360> dry<00:03:07.660> time<00:03:07.959> there<00:03:08.230> now<00:03:08.860> we<00:03:08.920> have<00:03:09.280> an

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
10 minutes dry time there now we have an

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.690 
10 minutes dry time there now we have an
ink<00:03:09.790> eraser<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:11.350> want<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.680> try<00:03:11.920> some<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:12.400> the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
ink eraser and I want to try some of the

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.509 
ink eraser and I want to try some of the
manipulating<00:03:13.360> of<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.600> paint<00:03:13.870> namely<00:03:14.519> erasing

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
manipulating of the paint namely erasing

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.710 
manipulating of the paint namely erasing
and<00:03:15.840> also<00:03:16.840> some<00:03:17.260> scratching<00:03:17.890> these<00:03:18.489> are

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
and also some scratching these are

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.210 
and also some scratching these are
typical<00:03:19.720> techniques<00:03:20.350> that<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.739> use<00:03:21.040> an

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
typical techniques that you use an

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.300 
typical techniques that you use an
illustration<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:22.799> we're<00:03:23.799> going<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.010> start

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
illustration and we're going to start

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.130 
illustration and we're going to start
with<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.610> illustration<00:03:25.180> color<00:03:25.390> remember

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
with the illustration color remember

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.840 
with the illustration color remember
that<00:03:26.470> this<00:03:26.709> is<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.040> one<00:03:27.220> that's<00:03:27.400> supposed<00:03:27.790> to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
that this is the one that's supposed to

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.990 
that this is the one that's supposed to
be<00:03:27.940> more<00:03:28.299> open<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.980> erase<00:03:30.250> ability<00:03:30.730> should

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
be more open so the erase ability should

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.030 
be more open so the erase ability should
be<00:03:31.120> better<00:03:31.299> on<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:31.690> one<00:03:31.989> now<00:03:32.650> another<00:03:32.920> thing

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
be better on this one now another thing

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.539 
be better on this one now another thing
is<00:03:33.390> typically<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.690> if<00:03:35.290> I'm<00:03:35.530> going<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.950> erase<00:03:36.280> I

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
is typically I if I'm going to erase I

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.420 
is typically I if I'm going to erase I
try<00:03:37.000> not<00:03:37.299> full<00:03:37.989> saturation<00:03:38.739> I<00:03:38.860> try<00:03:39.100> something

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
try not full saturation I try something

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.160 
try not full saturation I try something
more<00:03:39.790> like<00:03:40.000> this<00:03:40.209> when<00:03:40.510> I'm<00:03:40.630> doing<00:03:40.870> some<00:03:41.049> of

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
more like this when I'm doing some of

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.170 
more like this when I'm doing some of
the<00:03:41.230> erasing<00:03:41.650> techniques<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.310> as<00:03:42.970> you'll

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
the erasing techniques and as you'll

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.229 
the erasing techniques and as you'll
notice<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:45.120> erasing<00:03:47.430> erases<00:03:48.430> very<00:03:48.820> easily

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
notice the erasing erases very easily

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.360 
notice the erasing erases very easily
here<00:03:50.190> okay<00:03:51.209> let's<00:03:52.209> try<00:03:52.450> some<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:53.019> the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
here okay let's try some of the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.870 
here okay let's try some of the
scratching

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:05.700 

also<00:03:57.880> very<00:03:58.720> easy<00:03:59.050> here<00:04:00.780> okay<00:04:02.820> now<00:04:04.260> we<00:04:05.260> will<00:04:05.380> try

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
also very easy here okay now we will try

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.700 
also very easy here okay now we will try
over<00:04:06.100> here<00:04:08.760> still<00:04:09.760> erasing<00:04:10.720> takes<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.530> little

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
over here still erasing takes a little

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.150 
over here still erasing takes a little
bit<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:13.480> takes<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.780> little<00:04:13.930> bit<00:04:14.050> more<00:04:14.260> effort<00:04:14.920> to

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
bit it takes a little bit more effort to

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.870 
bit it takes a little bit more effort to
erase<00:04:15.480> but<00:04:16.480> it<00:04:16.600> does<00:04:16.810> erase<00:04:17.610> now<00:04:18.610> we're<00:04:18.790> going

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
erase but it does erase now we're going

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.479 
erase but it does erase now we're going
to<00:04:18.970> move<00:04:19.209> up<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.690> little<00:04:20.560> bit<00:04:20.830> on<00:04:21.040> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
to move up a little bit on the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.380 
to move up a little bit on the
saturation<00:04:22.030> let's<00:04:22.510> try<00:04:22.780> scratching<00:04:23.470> here

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.250 

pretty<00:04:28.390> good<00:04:28.630> here<00:04:28.960> also<00:04:30.600> okay<00:04:31.600> now<00:04:32.080> we're

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
pretty good here also okay now we're

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.630 
pretty good here also okay now we're
going<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.410> move<00:04:32.590> up<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.950> little<00:04:33.040> higher

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
going to move up a little higher

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.360 
going to move up a little higher
I<00:04:33.670> didn't<00:04:34.390> match<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:35.020> saturation<00:04:35.590> perfectly

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
I didn't match the saturation perfectly

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.460 
I didn't match the saturation perfectly
so<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.030> may<00:04:37.360> have<00:04:37.390> to<00:04:37.600> work<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:38.140> little<00:04:38.260> bit

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
so I may have to work a little bit

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.620 
so I may have to work a little bit
higher<00:04:38.740> here<00:04:39.100> than<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.340> do<00:04:39.400> here<00:04:39.760> but<00:04:40.000> let's<00:04:40.900> see

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
higher here than I do here but let's see

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.060 
higher here than I do here but let's see
again<00:04:43.630> over<00:04:44.380> here<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:47.230> erasing<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.830> pretty

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
again over here the erasing is pretty

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.450 
again over here the erasing is pretty
good

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
good

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.570 
good
almost<00:04:48.790> in<00:04:48.970> one<00:04:49.150> stroke<00:04:50.160> let's<00:04:51.160> come<00:04:51.430> over

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
almost in one stroke let's come over

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.800 
almost in one stroke let's come over
here<00:04:51.700> we<00:04:51.940> might<00:04:52.030> have<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.270> go<00:04:52.390> a<00:04:52.420> little<00:04:52.540> higher

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
here we might have to go a little higher

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:03.000 
here we might have to go a little higher
on<00:04:53.080> this<00:04:53.260> one<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:01.660> see<00:05:01.900> it's<00:05:02.050> not<00:05:02.260> as<00:05:02.560> bright

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
on this one you see it's not as bright

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.150 
on this one you see it's not as bright
on<00:05:03.490> this<00:05:04.210> side<00:05:04.510> so<00:05:05.169> it<00:05:05.200> does<00:05:05.500> erase<00:05:05.800> a<00:05:05.830> lot

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
on this side so it does erase a lot

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.570 
on this side so it does erase a lot
easier<00:05:06.880> there<00:05:07.300> well<00:05:07.540> not<00:05:07.660> a<00:05:07.720> lot<00:05:07.990> but<00:05:08.430> ok<00:05:09.430> now

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
easier there well not a lot but ok now

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.940 
easier there well not a lot but ok now
we're<00:05:09.730> going<00:05:09.820> to<00:05:09.880> go<00:05:10.060> up<00:05:10.210> a<00:05:10.360> little<00:05:10.540> bit<00:05:10.750> higher

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.450 

and<00:05:14.950> now<00:05:15.580> remember<00:05:15.880> this<00:05:16.180> is<00:05:16.419> dried<00:05:16.750> for<00:05:17.110> about

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
and now remember this is dried for about

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:27.320 
and now remember this is dried for about
10<00:05:18.460> more<00:05:18.640> minutes<00:05:18.700> than<00:05:19.210> this<00:05:19.360> has

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.839 

oh<00:05:27.389> yeah<00:05:28.319> the<00:05:28.500> erase<00:05:28.770> ability<00:05:29.250> is<00:05:29.400> still<00:05:29.520> very

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
oh yeah the erase ability is still very

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:32.689 
oh yeah the erase ability is still very
good<00:05:30.150> here<00:05:30.389> now<00:05:30.509> the<00:05:30.569> other<00:05:30.870> thing<00:05:31.169> is<00:05:31.699> that

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
good here now the other thing is that

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.850 
good here now the other thing is that
this<00:05:32.879> might<00:05:33.180> change<00:05:33.569> after<00:05:34.349> let's<00:05:34.650> say<00:05:34.740> a

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
this might change after let's say a

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.240 
this might change after let's say a
24-hour<00:05:35.639> period<00:05:35.969> or<00:05:36.300> much<00:05:37.229> longer<00:05:37.530> dry<00:05:37.949> time

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
24-hour period or much longer dry time

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.459 
24-hour period or much longer dry time
so<00:05:38.669> remember<00:05:39.539> that<00:05:39.569> when<00:05:39.960> you're<00:05:40.110> doing<00:05:40.289> some

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
so remember that when you're doing some

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:49.540 
so remember that when you're doing some
of<00:05:40.500> these<00:05:40.650> techniques

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.610
