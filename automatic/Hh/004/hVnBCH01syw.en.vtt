calm and this is blog number to the blog
for<00:00:07.560> December<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.730> 2007<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.650> subject<00:00:11.099> for

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
for December in 2007 and the subject for

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.959 
for December in 2007 and the subject for
discussion<00:00:11.639> today<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:13.099> which<00:00:14.099> part<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.730> what

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
discussion today is which part of what

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.820 
discussion today is which part of what
finger<00:00:15.240> should<00:00:15.660> create<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.199> fulcrum<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
finger should create the fulcrum the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.500 
finger should create the fulcrum the
fulcrum<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.609> course<00:00:17.880> being<00:00:18.119> where<00:00:18.359> we

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
fulcrum of course being where we

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.240 
fulcrum of course being where we
actually<00:00:18.690> hold<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.350> stick<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.740> let<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
actually hold the stick and let the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.609 
actually hold the stick and let the
stick<00:00:20.460> pivot<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.570> how<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.020> create<00:00:22.230> that

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
stick pivot so how do we create that

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.550 
stick pivot so how do we create that
with<00:00:22.830> our<00:00:22.859> hand<00:00:23.340> we've<00:00:24.269> talked<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:25.109> our<00:00:25.350> last

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
with our hand we've talked in our last

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.490 
with our hand we've talked in our last
blog<00:00:25.859> last<00:00:26.130> month<00:00:26.490> about<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.359> German<00:00:28.140> versus

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
blog last month about the German versus

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.990 
blog last month about the German versus
the<00:00:28.650> French<00:00:28.920> grip<00:00:29.130> well<00:00:29.279> I'm<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.670> assume

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the French grip well I'm going to assume

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.519 
the French grip well I'm going to assume
that<00:00:30.060> we're<00:00:30.390> now<00:00:30.570> we've<00:00:31.050> gone<00:00:31.260> ahead<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that we're now we've gone ahead and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.069 
that we're now we've gone ahead and
developed<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.369> German<00:00:33.120> grip<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.630> hand

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
developed the German grip with the hand

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.080 
developed the German grip with the hand
rotated<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.130> thumb<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.820> side<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
rotated so the thumb is on the side of

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.619 
rotated so the thumb is on the side of
the<00:00:36.360> stick<00:00:37.040> obviously<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> thumb<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:39.390> that

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the stick obviously the thumb is in that

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
the stick obviously the thumb is in that
spot<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> side<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> stick<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:41.280> where

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
spot on the side of the stick but where

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790 
spot on the side of the stick but where
should<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.600> create<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.140> other<00:00:43.350> half<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
should we create the other half of the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.889 
should we create the other half of the
folk<00:00:43.980> which<00:00:44.250> part<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.610> these<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.420> hand<00:00:45.660> over

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
folk which part of these the hand over

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.990 
folk which part of these the hand over
here<00:00:46.020> with<00:00:46.140> these<00:00:46.260> fingers<00:00:46.670> should<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.879> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
here with these fingers should we do it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.729 
here with these fingers should we do it
on<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.450> first<00:00:48.719> finger<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> second

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
on this first finger on the second

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
on this first finger on the second
finger<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.550> where<00:00:50.760> abouts<00:00:51.030> along<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
finger and if so where abouts along the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.510 
finger and if so where abouts along the
finger<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.100> important

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
finger so this is the really important

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.930 
finger so this is the really important
question<00:00:54.199> well<00:00:55.199> I'm<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> first<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.820> all

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
question well I'm going to first of all

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.779 
question well I'm going to first of all
just<00:00:57.140> answer<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.260> question<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.980> ok<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
just answer this question for you ok the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.549 
just answer this question for you ok the
way<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> think<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.480> should<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> lot

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
way I think it should be and for a lot

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.779 
way I think it should be and for a lot
of<00:01:01.620> reasons<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.129> I'm<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> tell<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
of reasons and I'm going to tell you the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.729 
of reasons and I'm going to tell you the
reasons<00:01:03.090> afterwards<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.629> think<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.530> we

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
reasons afterwards I think that we

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
reasons afterwards I think that we
should<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> fulcrum<00:01:05.700> between<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
should have the fulcrum between the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.380 
should have the fulcrum between the
thumb<00:01:06.810> obviously<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.580> this<00:01:08.580> part<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
thumb obviously and this part of the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.219 
thumb obviously and this part of the
index<00:01:09.810> finger<00:01:10.080> right<00:01:10.890> there<00:01:11.130> ok<00:01:12.030> behind<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
index finger right there ok behind the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.410 
index finger right there ok behind the
middle<00:01:13.380> knuckle<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> side<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
middle knuckle and on the side of the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.109 
middle knuckle and on the side of the
first<00:01:15.689> finger<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> look

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
first finger there so it's going to look

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.350 
first finger there so it's going to look
like<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:19.369> I'll<00:01:20.369> hold<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.820> there<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.299> you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
like that I'll hold that up there so you

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.320 
like that I'll hold that up there so you
can<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.810> turn<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.799> around<00:01:22.950> ok<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.520> that's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
can see turn that around ok so that's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.149 
can see turn that around ok so that's
where<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.630> won't<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> hold<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.920> stick

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
where we won't want to hold the stick

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.469 
where we won't want to hold the stick
that's<00:01:26.280> what<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.549> should<00:01:26.580> create<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.090> fulcrum

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
that's what we should create the fulcrum

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.719 
that's what we should create the fulcrum
and<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.170> see<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.650> works<00:01:29.430> very<00:01:29.610> very

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and as you can see that works very very

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.600 
and as you can see that works very very
effectively<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.320> play<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.400> stuff

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
effectively you can play a lot of stuff

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.270 
effectively you can play a lot of stuff
in<00:01:32.729> fact<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.840> bounce<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.229> stick<00:01:34.439> in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
in fact I can just bounce the stick in

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.249 
in fact I can just bounce the stick in
the<00:01:35.490> fulcrum<00:01:35.880> holding<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.630> it's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the fulcrum holding it there and it's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.719 
the fulcrum holding it there and it's
not<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> problem<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.189> very<00:01:38.400> effective

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
not a problem it's a very effective

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.660 
not a problem it's a very effective
fulcrum<00:01:39.500> ok<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.890> let's<00:01:41.070> look<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.369> reasons

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
fulcrum ok so let's look at the reasons

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.660 
fulcrum ok so let's look at the reasons
why<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.000> should<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.490> first<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.610> all

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
why it should be like that first of all

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.679 
why it should be like that first of all
and<00:01:45.439> why<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.710> finger<00:01:47.189> why<00:01:47.610> not<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.299> finger

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
and why that finger why not this finger

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.420 
and why that finger why not this finger
or<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.170> other<00:01:49.290> fingers<00:01:49.680> well<00:01:50.310> of

course if I'm holding the stick on the
second<00:01:52.350> finger<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.729> means<00:01:54.000> this

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
second finger like that that means this

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.999 
second finger like that that means this

finger is on the wrong side of the stick

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.280 
finger is on the wrong side of the stick
to<00:01:56.189> drive<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.700> okay<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.450> i<00:01:57.540> knew<00:01:57.689> now<00:01:57.930> got

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
to drive it okay so if i knew now got

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.950 
to drive it okay so if i knew now got
two<00:01:58.530> fingers<00:01:59.009> or<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.909> underneath<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.750> stick

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
two fingers or so underneath the stick

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.959 
two fingers or so underneath the stick
to<00:02:01.110> actually<00:02:01.350> drive<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.770> stick<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.640> i<00:02:02.790> hold

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
to actually drive the stick if i hold

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.179 
to actually drive the stick if i hold
the<00:02:03.149> stick<00:02:03.390> on<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:04.259> finger<00:02:04.469> I've<00:02:04.740> got<00:02:04.950> more

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the stick on this finger I've got more

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.429 
the stick on this finger I've got more
fingers<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.000> control<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.570> rebound<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.170> drive

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
fingers to control the rebound and drive

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.109 
fingers to control the rebound and drive
the<00:02:07.619> stick<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.550> me<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.819> seems<00:02:09.030> really

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the stick so to me it seems really

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.470 
the stick so to me it seems really
obvious<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.950> want<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
obvious that we want to get the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.600 
obvious that we want to get the
the<00:02:13.170> grip<00:02:13.409> on<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.920> side<00:02:14.129> of<00:02:14.159> that<00:02:14.340> first

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
the grip on the side of that first

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.750 
the grip on the side of that first
finger<00:02:14.909> now<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.739> same<00:02:17.010> reason<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.519> really

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
finger now the same reason is really

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.640 
finger now the same reason is really
about<00:02:17.970> where<00:02:18.239> along<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.959> stick<00:02:19.319> we<00:02:19.470> should

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
about where along the stick we should

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.530 
about where along the stick we should
along<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.159> thing<00:02:20.310> we<00:02:20.430> should<00:02:20.519> have<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:21.030> lot

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
along the thing we should have it a lot

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.330 
along the thing we should have it a lot
of<00:02:21.569> people<00:02:21.659> hold<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.440> stick<00:02:22.650> more<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.099> tip

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
of people hold the stick more on the tip

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.699 
of people hold the stick more on the tip
of<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.610> finger<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.450> now<00:02:25.349> if<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.530> hold

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
of the finger like that now if you hold

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.500 
of the finger like that now if you hold
the<00:02:25.830> step<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.220> other<00:02:27.000> stick<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.360> tip

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
the step on the other stick on the tip

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.970 
the step on the other stick on the tip
of<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.720> finger<00:02:27.750> there's<00:02:28.530> there's<00:02:28.830> two

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
of the finger there's there's two

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.470 
of the finger there's there's two
problems<00:02:29.160> with<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:29.519> first<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.239> all<00:02:30.330> we're

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
problems with that first of all we're

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.080 
problems with that first of all we're
really<00:02:30.750> wasting<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.620> first<00:02:31.890> finger<00:02:32.160> because

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
really wasting that first finger because

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
really wasting that first finger because
once<00:02:33.840> we<00:02:33.930> are<00:02:34.019> holding<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.470> stick<00:02:34.680> with<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
once we are holding the stick with the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.949 
once we are holding the stick with the
tip<00:02:35.069> of<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.280> finger<00:02:35.420> we<00:02:36.420> can't<00:02:36.660> do<00:02:36.780> anything

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
tip of the finger we can't do anything

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.330 
tip of the finger we can't do anything
with<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.230> we're<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:37.560> gripping<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.099> stick

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
with it we're just gripping the stick

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.979 
with it we're just gripping the stick
and<00:02:38.579> we've<00:02:38.760> only<00:02:38.910> got<00:02:39.150> these<00:02:39.299> other<00:02:39.599> fingers

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
and we've only got these other fingers

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.339 
and we've only got these other fingers
here<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.680> drive<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.129> stick<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:42.329> not<00:02:42.540> only<00:02:42.720> by

having the stick behind that middle
knuckle<00:02:45.660> not<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.170> tip<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.500> finger<00:02:46.530> but

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
knuckle not on the tip of the finger but

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
behind the know who by having it there

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.920 
behind the know who by having it there
we<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.470> we<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.160> bend<00:02:50.430> with<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.450> knuckle<00:02:51.780> and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
we can we can bend with that knuckle and

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.020 
we can we can bend with that knuckle and
we've<00:02:52.290> got<00:02:52.470> one<00:02:53.010> other<00:02:53.160> finger<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.819> first

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
we've got one other finger the first

finger to drive on the stick and that's

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.190 
finger to drive on the stick and that's
not<00:02:55.950> only<00:02:56.160> important<00:02:56.549> because<00:02:56.670> it's<00:02:56.940> one<00:02:57.200> more

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200

down<00:03:18.930> on<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.169> mobo<00:03:19.440> but<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.680> you're<00:03:19.799> doing<00:03:20.040> it

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
down on the mobo but if you're doing it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.129 
down on the mobo but if you're doing it
the<00:03:20.310> old<00:03:20.489> fashioned<00:03:20.849> phone<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.599> would<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.930> with

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
the old fashioned phone it would be with

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.080 
the old fashioned phone it would be with
that<00:03:22.290> first<00:03:22.560> finger<00:03:22.859> if<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.579> test<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
that first finger if you test the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.670 
that first finger if you test the
temperature<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.599> some<00:03:24.780> water<00:03:24.959> it's<00:03:25.380> usually

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
temperature of some water it's usually

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.659 
temperature of some water it's usually
going<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.889> be<00:03:26.010> with<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.250> first<00:03:26.430> finger

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
going to be with the first finger

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.520 
going to be with the first finger
because<00:03:27.269> it's<00:03:27.419> a<00:03:27.480> really<00:03:27.660> sensitive<00:03:28.109> finger

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
because it's a really sensitive finger

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.589 
because it's a really sensitive finger
and<00:03:28.709> it's<00:03:29.190> got<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.459> lot<00:03:29.669> of<00:03:29.730> control<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.269> we<00:03:30.359> want

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
and it's got a lot of control so we want

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.170 
and it's got a lot of control so we want
that<00:03:30.810> under<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.349> stick<00:03:31.849> driving<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.970> stick

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
that under the stick driving the stick

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.030 
that under the stick driving the stick
and<00:03:33.329> controlling<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.230> stick<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.739> don't<00:03:34.859> want

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
and controlling the stick we don't want

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.289 
and controlling the stick we don't want
to<00:03:35.099> waste<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.400> just<00:03:35.579> by<00:03:35.669> gripping<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.090> stick

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
to waste it just by gripping the stick

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.349 
to waste it just by gripping the stick
with<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.510> okay<00:03:37.079> so<00:03:37.139> that's<00:03:37.380> number<00:03:38.060> one<00:03:39.060> really

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
with it okay so that's number one really

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.479 
with it okay so that's number one really
important<00:03:39.870> reason<00:03:40.230> why<00:03:40.739> we<00:03:40.889> have<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.190> fulcrum

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
important reason why we have the fulcrum

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.629 
important reason why we have the fulcrum
in<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:41.760> spot<00:03:42.650> number<00:03:43.650> two<00:03:43.829> really<00:03:44.069> important

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
in that spot number two really important

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.140 
in that spot number two really important
reason<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.440> is<00:03:46.700> because<00:03:47.700> it's<00:03:47.849> a<00:03:47.940> really

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
reason and is because it's a really

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.080 
reason and is because it's a really
natural<00:03:48.480> position<00:03:49.200> okay<00:03:49.889> if<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.519> flop<00:03:50.910> your

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
natural position okay if you flop your

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.539 
natural position okay if you flop your
hand<00:03:51.299> on<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.870> drummer<00:03:52.109> on<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.349> pad<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.859> just

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
hand on the drummer on the pad and just

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.860 
hand on the drummer on the pad and just
have<00:03:53.700> all<00:03:53.819> that<00:03:53.970> fingers<00:03:54.389> straight<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.780> then

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
have all that fingers straight and then

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.509 
have all that fingers straight and then
move<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.200> thumb<00:03:55.349> in<00:03:55.560> you'll<00:03:55.919> see<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.220> tip<00:03:56.430> of

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
move the thumb in you'll see the tip of

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.729 
move the thumb in you'll see the tip of
the<00:03:56.639> thumb<00:03:56.879> meets<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.870> first<00:03:58.200> finger<00:03:58.500> the

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
the thumb meets that first finger the

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.800 
the thumb meets that first finger the
index<00:03:58.829> finger<00:03:59.370> actually<00:03:59.700> behind<00:04:00.239> or<00:04:00.599> about

level<00:04:01.230> with<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.440> middle<00:04:02.069> know<00:04:02.220> who<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.519> if

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
level with that middle know who is if

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.789 
level with that middle know who is if
you<00:04:03.120> just<00:04:03.150> let<00:04:03.419> your<00:04:03.569> hand<00:04:03.720> flop<00:04:03.989> you'll<00:04:04.560> see

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
you just let your hand flop you'll see

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.580 
you just let your hand flop you'll see
that<00:04:05.150> while<00:04:06.150> putting<00:04:06.419> the<00:04:06.629> stick<00:04:07.109> on<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.410> tip

that while putting the stick on the tip
of<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.799> thumb<00:04:08.010> then<00:04:08.609> it's<00:04:08.910> naturally<00:04:09.480> just

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
of the thumb then it's naturally just

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.750 
of the thumb then it's naturally just
behind<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:10.079> middle<00:04:10.379> know<00:04:10.500> who<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:11.340> do<00:04:11.489> this

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
behind that middle know who to do this

can see the muscles on the top of my
forearm<00:04:17.160> actually<00:04:17.789> tense<00:04:18.060> up<00:04:18.269> when<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.539> do<00:04:18.599> that

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
forearm actually tense up when I do that

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.640 
forearm actually tense up when I do that
so<00:04:19.849> by<00:04:20.849> holding<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.510> stick<00:04:22.079> on<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.409> tip<00:04:22.560> of

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
so by holding the stick on the tip of

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.070 
so by holding the stick on the tip of
the<00:04:22.800> finger<00:04:23.030> for<00:04:24.030> that<00:04:24.150> reason<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.930> few

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
the finger for that reason and a few

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
the finger for that reason and a few
others<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.440> do<00:04:25.530> with<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.800> leave

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
others to do with the leave

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.920 
others to do with the leave
ridge<00:04:26.220> of<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.400> first<00:04:26.670> finger<00:04:26.940> I'm<00:04:27.420> creating

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
ridge of the first finger I'm creating

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.780 
ridge of the first finger I'm creating
tension<00:04:28.350> in<00:04:28.410> my<00:04:28.530> forearm<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.040> any<00:04:29.250> tension<00:04:29.700> is

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
tension in my forearm and any tension is

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.580 
tension in my forearm and any tension is
going<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.060> be<00:04:30.120> really<00:04:30.420> bad<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:31.140> play<00:04:31.320> quickly

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
going to be really bad to play quickly

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.720 
going to be really bad to play quickly
with<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:31.980> you<00:04:32.070> want<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:32.250> get<00:04:32.340> rid<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:32.520> it<00:04:32.610> as

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
with so you want to get rid of it as

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.180 
with so you want to get rid of it as
much<00:04:32.820> as<00:04:32.880> we<00:04:33.060> can<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.230> best<00:04:34.470> spot<00:04:34.950> to<00:04:34.980> have

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
much as we can so the best spot to have

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.410 
much as we can so the best spot to have
that<00:04:35.400> fulcrum<00:04:36.330> is<00:04:36.450> on<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.260> side<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:39.000> index

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
that fulcrum is on the side of the index

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.110 
that fulcrum is on the side of the index
finger<00:04:39.600> behind<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.560> middle<00:04:40.830> knuckle<00:04:41.120> all

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
finger behind the middle knuckle all

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.550 
finger behind the middle knuckle all
right<00:04:42.300> it's<00:04:42.510> really<00:04:42.840> important<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.320> have<00:04:43.410> it

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
right it's really important to have it

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.830 
right it's really important to have it
there<00:04:43.970> um<00:04:44.990> now<00:04:45.990> we<00:04:46.380> often<00:04:46.700> find<00:04:47.700> that<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:48.270> lot<00:04:48.810> of

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
there um now we often find that a lot of

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.680 
there um now we often find that a lot of
drummers<00:04:49.560> in<00:04:49.890> particular<00:04:50.370> have<00:04:51.330> this<00:04:51.540> idea

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
drummers in particular have this idea

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.540 
drummers in particular have this idea
that<00:04:51.960> they<00:04:52.200> should<00:04:52.380> actually<00:04:52.500> let<00:04:53.100> go<00:04:53.310> of<00:04:53.430> the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
that they should actually let go of the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.800 
that they should actually let go of the
stick<00:04:53.730> at<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:53.910> point<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.180> contact<00:04:54.540> so<00:04:54.780> that

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
stick at the point of contact so that

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.150 
stick at the point of contact so that
the<00:04:55.170> stick<00:04:55.350> is<00:04:55.470> kind<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:55.710> floating<00:04:56.010> in<00:04:56.100> the

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
the stick is kind of floating in the

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.800 
the stick is kind of floating in the
back<00:04:56.310> of<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.490> hand<00:04:56.760> and<00:04:56.940> when<00:04:57.360> they<00:04:57.480> hit<00:04:57.660> the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
back of the hand and when they hit the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.120 
back of the hand and when they hit the
drum<00:04:58.020> they<00:04:58.170> sort<00:04:58.350> of<00:04:58.380> let<00:04:58.560> go<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:58.920> stick

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
drum they sort of let go of the stick

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.820 
drum they sort of let go of the stick
like<00:04:59.370> this<00:04:59.750> so<00:05:00.750> they're<00:05:00.900> really<00:05:01.110> using<00:05:01.590> using

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
like this so they're really using using

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.040 
like this so they're really using using
no<00:05:02.130> fulcrum<00:05:02.670> at<00:05:02.760> all<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.450> with<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.690> German

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
no fulcrum at all and with the German

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.830 
no fulcrum at all and with the German
grip<00:05:04.320> this<00:05:04.680> is<00:05:04.830> not<00:05:04.950> uncommon<00:05:05.340> because<00:05:05.690> we<00:05:06.690> can

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
grip this is not uncommon because we can

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.150 
grip this is not uncommon because we can
use<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.170> rest<00:05:07.380> and<00:05:07.620> that's<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.860> whole<00:05:07.980> point

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
use the rest and that's the whole point

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.400 
use the rest and that's the whole point
of<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.370> German<00:05:08.730> grip<00:05:08.970> people<00:05:09.630> often<00:05:09.900> develop

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
of the German grip people often develop

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.750 
of the German grip people often develop
their<00:05:10.680> technique<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.340> point<00:05:11.550> where<00:05:11.670> they

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
their technique to the point where they

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.400 
their technique to the point where they
tend<00:05:12.000> to<00:05:12.090> use<00:05:12.300> their<00:05:12.510> wrists<00:05:12.780> for<00:05:12.930> everything

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
tend to use their wrists for everything

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.810 
tend to use their wrists for everything
and<00:05:13.590> they<00:05:13.830> don't<00:05:14.040> really<00:05:14.190> use<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.490> fulcrum

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
and they don't really use the fulcrum

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.400 
and they don't really use the fulcrum
for<00:05:14.850> fast<00:05:15.450> things<00:05:15.720> at<00:05:15.870> all<00:05:15.930> it's<00:05:16.110> all<00:05:16.200> wrist

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
for fast things at all it's all wrist

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.260 
for fast things at all it's all wrist
wrist<00:05:16.530> wrist<00:05:16.650> rests<00:05:17.040> okay<00:05:17.790> well<00:05:17.940> that's<00:05:18.000> a<00:05:18.150> bit

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
wrist wrist rests okay well that's a bit

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.210 
wrist wrist rests okay well that's a bit
wasteful<00:05:18.660> because<00:05:18.840> we're<00:05:19.410> getting<00:05:20.070> rid<00:05:20.190> of

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
wasteful because we're getting rid of

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.570 
wasteful because we're getting rid of
one<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.610> main<00:05:20.820> tools<00:05:21.150> for<00:05:21.420> speed<00:05:21.690> they're

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
one of the main tools for speed they're

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.290 
one of the main tools for speed they're
even<00:05:24.890> putting<00:05:25.890> that<00:05:26.040> aside<00:05:26.190> from<00:05:26.580> in<00:05:26.760> it<00:05:26.850> why

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
even putting that aside from in it why

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.450 
even putting that aside from in it why
would<00:05:27.540> we<00:05:27.690> want<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:28.110> let<00:05:28.560> go<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:28.890> the<00:05:29.040> stick<00:05:29.250> as

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
would we want to let go of the stick as

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.940 
would we want to let go of the stick as
it<00:05:29.730> contacts<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:30.570> drum<00:05:30.870> well<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:31.530> way<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.680> lot

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
it contacts the drum well the way a lot

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.350 
it contacts the drum well the way a lot
of<00:05:32.070> people<00:05:32.310> have<00:05:32.430> explained<00:05:32.820> it<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:33.030> me<00:05:33.150> in<00:05:33.270> the

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
of people have explained it to me in the

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.240 
of people have explained it to me in the
past<00:05:33.540> as<00:05:33.810> I<00:05:33.930> reckon<00:05:34.170> it<00:05:34.290> changes<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:34.980> sound

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
past as I reckon it changes the sound

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.000 
past as I reckon it changes the sound
the<00:05:36.030> idea<00:05:36.450> here<00:05:36.780> is<00:05:36.810> that<00:05:36.900> by<00:05:37.440> letting<00:05:37.740> go<00:05:37.980> of

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
the idea here is that by letting go of

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.500 
the idea here is that by letting go of
the<00:05:38.220> stick<00:05:38.400> at<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:38.610> point<00:05:38.790> of<00:05:38.850> contact<00:05:39.270> what

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
the stick at the point of contact what

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.970 
the stick at the point of contact what
we're<00:05:39.750> hearing<00:05:39.990> is<00:05:40.110> not<00:05:40.320> just<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.560> sound<00:05:40.860> of

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
we're hearing is not just the sound of

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.980 
we're hearing is not just the sound of
the<00:05:41.070> drum<00:05:41.310> vibrating<00:05:41.880> but<00:05:42.000> also<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.630> sound<00:05:42.840> of

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
the drum vibrating but also the sound of

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.780 
the drum vibrating but also the sound of
the<00:05:43.110> stick<00:05:43.380> vibrating<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:44.310> it<00:05:44.370> is<00:05:44.490> true<00:05:44.760> that

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
the stick vibrating and it is true that

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.530 
the stick vibrating and it is true that
the<00:05:45.060> stick<00:05:45.270> vibrates<00:05:45.780> if<00:05:46.020> you<00:05:46.320> let<00:05:46.470> it<00:05:46.590> go

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
the stick vibrates if you let it go

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.990 
the stick vibrates if you let it go
however<00:05:48.540> in<00:05:48.810> a<00:05:49.530> realistic<00:05:49.890> playing<00:05:50.310> situation

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
however in a realistic playing situation

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.820 
however in a realistic playing situation
let's<00:05:51.240> be<00:05:51.450> honest<00:05:51.780> it<00:05:51.960> really<00:05:51.990> makes<00:05:52.500> very

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
let's be honest it really makes very

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.580 
let's be honest it really makes very
little<00:05:52.890> difference<00:05:53.130> in<00:05:53.640> sound<00:05:53.880> I've<00:05:54.810> tried<00:05:55.470> it

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
little difference in sound I've tried it

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.490 
little difference in sound I've tried it
for<00:05:55.710> myself<00:05:56.150> really<00:05:57.150> can<00:05:57.390> compared<00:05:58.110> the<00:05:58.260> sound

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
for myself really can compared the sound

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.320 
for myself really can compared the sound
of<00:05:58.620> me<00:05:58.740> playing<00:05:59.010> a<00:05:59.160> drum<00:05:59.370> holding<00:06:00.000> onto<00:06:00.120> the

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
of me playing a drum holding onto the

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.430 
of me playing a drum holding onto the
stick<00:06:00.480> and<00:06:00.570> letting<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:00.780> rebound<00:06:01.110> through<00:06:01.320> the

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
stick and letting it rebound through the

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.040 
stick and letting it rebound through the
fulcrum<00:06:01.800> and<00:06:01.920> also<00:06:02.430> letting<00:06:02.970> it<00:06:03.180> go<00:06:03.450> so<00:06:03.870> that

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
fulcrum and also letting it go so that

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.470 
fulcrum and also letting it go so that
there's<00:06:04.170> no<00:06:04.260> vibration<00:06:04.890> and<00:06:05.490> so<00:06:05.640> there's<00:06:05.970> no

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
there's no vibration and so there's no

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.690 
there's no vibration and so there's no
vibration<00:06:07.140> on<00:06:07.200> the<00:06:07.290> fulcrum<00:06:07.620> at<00:06:07.680> all<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:08.010> can't

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
vibration on the fulcrum at all I can't

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.850 
vibration on the fulcrum at all I can't
hear<00:06:08.910> any<00:06:09.030> difference<00:06:09.300> in<00:06:09.450> sound<00:06:09.660> I've<00:06:10.590> also

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
hear any difference in sound I've also

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.880 
hear any difference in sound I've also
heard<00:06:11.340> other<00:06:12.090> people<00:06:12.410> demonstrate<00:06:13.410> it<00:06:13.530> to<00:06:13.560> me

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
heard other people demonstrate it to me

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.500 
heard other people demonstrate it to me
when<00:06:14.280> they<00:06:14.310> can<00:06:14.640> swear<00:06:14.880> black<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.270> blue<00:06:15.360> that

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
when they can swear black and blue that

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.660 
when they can swear black and blue that
they<00:06:15.630> can<00:06:15.780> hear<00:06:16.020> it<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:16.770> I<00:06:16.890> really<00:06:17.220> can't<00:06:17.430> hear

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
they can hear it and I really can't hear

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.160 
they can hear it and I really can't hear
any<00:06:17.790> difference<00:06:18.120> or<00:06:18.240> if<00:06:18.330> i<00:06:18.450> can<00:06:18.660> it's<00:06:18.690> such<00:06:19.140> a

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
any difference or if i can it's such a

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.960 
any difference or if i can it's such a
small<00:06:19.410> difference<00:06:19.740> that<00:06:20.370> is<00:06:20.460> really<00:06:20.760> not

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
small difference that is really not

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.640 
small difference that is really not
worth<00:06:21.150> sacrificing<00:06:21.480> all<00:06:22.200> of<00:06:22.350> that<00:06:22.500> other

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
worth sacrificing all of that other

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.680 
worth sacrificing all of that other
technical<00:06:23.460> ability<00:06:23.940> that<00:06:24.120> you're<00:06:24.330> going<00:06:24.480> to

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
technical ability that you're going to

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.950 
technical ability that you're going to
do<00:06:24.870> by<00:06:25.080> doing<00:06:25.380> that<00:06:26.360> really<00:06:27.360> what<00:06:27.570> tends<00:06:27.840> to

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
do by doing that really what tends to

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.480 
do by doing that really what tends to
happen<00:06:28.050> I<00:06:28.320> think<00:06:28.350> in<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.710> majority<00:06:29.190> of<00:06:29.220> cases

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
happen I think in the majority of cases

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.760 
happen I think in the majority of cases
is<00:06:29.910> that<00:06:30.690> when<00:06:31.140> people<00:06:31.320> think<00:06:31.620> they're

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
is that when people think they're

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.350 
is that when people think they're
getting<00:06:31.830> a<00:06:32.040> big<00:06:32.370> difference<00:06:32.730> in<00:06:32.880> sound<00:06:33.090> it's

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
getting a big difference in sound it's

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.690 
getting a big difference in sound it's
because<00:06:33.979> when<00:06:34.979> they're<00:06:35.130> not<00:06:35.280> letting<00:06:35.460> go<00:06:35.669> of

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
because when they're not letting go of

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.460 
because when they're not letting go of
the<00:06:35.820> stick<00:06:36.120> they're<00:06:36.510> choking<00:06:36.840> the<00:06:37.110> sound<00:06:37.350> of

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
the stick they're choking the sound of

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.080 
the stick they're choking the sound of
the<00:06:37.590> drum<00:06:37.860> and<00:06:38.040> they're<00:06:38.520> doing<00:06:38.700> this<00:06:38.880> because

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
the drum and they're doing this because

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.920 
the drum and they're doing this because
they're<00:06:39.390> fulcrum<00:06:39.780> is

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
they're fulcrum is

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.230 
they're fulcrum is
not<00:06:40.050> sufficiently<00:06:40.590> developed<00:06:41.580> to<00:06:41.880> actually

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
not sufficiently developed to actually

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.040 
not sufficiently developed to actually
allow<00:06:42.360> proper<00:06:42.930> rebound<00:06:43.500> so<00:06:44.039> if<00:06:44.400> they're<00:06:45.050> not

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
allow proper rebound so if they're not

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.270 
allow proper rebound so if they're not
letting<00:06:46.229> go<00:06:46.320> of<00:06:46.440> the<00:06:46.620> stick<00:06:46.800> they're<00:06:46.979> actually

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
letting go of the stick they're actually

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.490 
letting go of the stick they're actually
pushing<00:06:47.910> the<00:06:48.210> stick<00:06:48.449> into<00:06:48.930> the<00:06:49.169> drum<00:06:49.470> and

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
pushing the stick into the drum and

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.770 
pushing the stick into the drum and
getting<00:06:49.949> that<00:06:50.039> buzzer<00:06:50.310> sound<00:06:50.639> but<00:06:51.240> if<00:06:51.449> we're

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
getting that buzzer sound but if we're

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.420 
getting that buzzer sound but if we're
developed<00:06:52.680> if<00:06:52.860> you've<00:06:53.009> developed<00:06:53.220> the

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
developed if you've developed the

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.400 
developed if you've developed the
fulcrum<00:06:53.759> properly<00:06:54.150> the<00:06:54.930> stick<00:06:55.169> should<00:06:55.320> be

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.410 
fulcrum properly the stick should be

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.490 
fulcrum properly the stick should be
allowed<00:06:55.560> to<00:06:55.620> rebound<00:06:56.419> nicely<00:06:57.419> and<00:06:57.930> it's<00:06:58.350> not

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
allowed to rebound nicely and it's not

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.409 
allowed to rebound nicely and it's not
choking<00:06:58.860> the<00:06:58.979> sound<00:06:59.190> of<00:06:59.340> the<00:06:59.430> drum<00:06:59.669> the

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 
vibration of the stick really is pretty

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.969 
vibration of the stick really is pretty
immaterial<00:07:03.300> it's<00:07:03.479> very<00:07:03.720> soft<00:07:04.050> sort<00:07:04.680> of<00:07:04.770> sound

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 
immaterial it's very soft sort of sound

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.290 
immaterial it's very soft sort of sound
compared<00:07:05.520> to<00:07:05.610> the<00:07:05.699> sound<00:07:05.910> we're<00:07:06.030> going<00:07:06.150> to<00:07:06.210> get

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
compared to the sound we're going to get

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.710 
compared to the sound we're going to get
out<00:07:06.449> of<00:07:06.479> the<00:07:06.720> drum<00:07:06.960> okay<00:07:08.000> and<00:07:09.000> of<00:07:09.210> course<00:07:09.240> if<00:07:09.600> we

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
out of the drum okay and of course if we

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.529 
out of the drum okay and of course if we
do<00:07:09.900> let<00:07:10.440> go<00:07:10.650> of<00:07:10.680> the<00:07:10.919> stick<00:07:11.160> what<00:07:12.150> we're<00:07:12.300> doing

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 
do let go of the stick what we're doing

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:14.990 
do let go of the stick what we're doing
is<00:07:12.630> we're<00:07:12.750> basically<00:07:13.520> wasting<00:07:14.520> all<00:07:14.669> the

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
is we're basically wasting all the

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.300 
is we're basically wasting all the
rebound<00:07:15.389> energy<00:07:15.840> that<00:07:16.050> comes<00:07:16.259> from<00:07:16.830> the<00:07:16.949> drum

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310 
rebound energy that comes from the drum

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.219 
rebound energy that comes from the drum
and<00:07:17.340> let's<00:07:17.669> face<00:07:17.820> it<00:07:18.060> that<00:07:18.240> rebound<00:07:18.660> energy<00:07:19.020> is

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:19.229 
and let's face it that rebound energy is

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:22.700 
and let's face it that rebound energy is
the<00:07:19.440> key<00:07:19.710> to<00:07:19.979> really<00:07:20.759> playing<00:07:21.150> fast<00:07:21.539> on<00:07:22.410> any

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
the key to really playing fast on any

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.909 
the key to really playing fast on any
drum<00:07:23.009> at<00:07:23.280> all<00:07:23.430> so<00:07:24.380> where<00:07:25.380> should<00:07:25.530> we<00:07:25.650> create

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 
drum at all so where should we create

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.820 
drum at all so where should we create
the<00:07:26.070> fulcrum<00:07:26.460> between<00:07:27.030> the<00:07:27.180> thumb<00:07:27.419> and<00:07:27.449> the
