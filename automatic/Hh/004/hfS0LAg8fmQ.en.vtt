 nozzle of Avon which has a tone is well 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.819
 similar to yellowish tone

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.400
 I could not stop recording this video 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.120
 for you if you can understand 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.340
 of course it is so people are bright 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.609
 but then it sits on the skin like the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.549
 people say not on my skin 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.670

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.400
 Sometimes you're watching, I trust. 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.980
 What do we talk about then? 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.230

 with natural brightness it has a good 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.260
 coverage although miccoli does not propose 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.590
 to be a base 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.169
 it has good coverage on my 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.849
 opinion is worth the investment in 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.579
 I try experimenting with the 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.200
 other brands and seeing that it is 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.690
 present for you but you who 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.870
 are there in search of a base with 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.340
 light coverage let's say so for your 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.590
