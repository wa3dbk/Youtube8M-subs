faster - yeah but so far the d 4s means

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.510 
faster - yeah but so far the d 4s means
a<00:01:44.039> couple<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.429> new<00:01:44.640> buttons<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.600> rubber

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.800 
not too shabby
I<00:05:08.370> think<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.490> limit<00:05:09.760> for<00:05:09.910> usable<00:05:10.330> files<00:05:10.570> is

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
I think the limit for usable files is

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.580 
I think the limit for usable files is
that<00:05:10.960> around<00:05:11.260> ISO<00:05:12.240> 51,200<00:05:13.320> anything<00:05:14.320> above

that around ISO 51,200 anything above

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.560 
that around ISO 51,200 anything above
that<00:05:14.800> is<00:05:15.010> for<00:05:15.340> paps<00:05:15.640> pervs

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
that is for paps pervs

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.930 
that is for paps pervs
