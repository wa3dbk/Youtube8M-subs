00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.730

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:28.820

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.860
 Now we go to the desk and open the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.860
 gta 4 live folder 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.540
 and we add these two these two files 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.459
 let's open we wait for it to be added 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.760
 very easy very fast and there would already be 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.049
 goods being the mods installed good 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.180
 so now let's go to what is the 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.010
 gameplay 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.480
 well at least here we are inside 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.790
 of the game as you see on the left 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.939
 below is the creation of the next 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.709
 radar identical to 7 to 5 good 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:19.209
 now what is the lights of the 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.220
 gta 4 paleta san andreas 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.389
 you kill someone other than the lights they 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.479
 will free the money thrown away even 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.150
 when brought gun so its first as 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.820
 will look well see the gun and pulls very 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.470
 realistic the weapon on the floor 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.940
 This is a way to really do 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.220
 I recommend a lot very much already 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.180
 they know but for those who do not know 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.180
 the one that I bring 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.050
 well at night the light behind the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.689
 car that will really look good 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.989
 so far they like that too 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:05:01.129
 What's good because I think that would already be 

00:04:56.989 --> 00:05:03.050
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.400
 but it has not cost the video and the 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.710
 mods 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.169
 I say goodbye where we go until the 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.350
 next you already know about cultural programs 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.830
 it is about expresses better treats them and not 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.310
 there is more 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.310
 goodbye
