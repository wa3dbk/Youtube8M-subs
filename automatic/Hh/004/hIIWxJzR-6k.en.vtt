00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
garden the reason being is that the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.970 
garden the reason being is that the
purple<00:02:58.480> garlic<00:02:58.840> chives<00:02:59.109> come<00:02:59.409> up<00:02:59.500> first<00:02:59.799> in

purple garlic chives come up first in

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.920 
purple garlic chives come up first in
the<00:03:00.069> spring<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.700> they<00:03:01.000> die<00:03:01.180> back<00:03:01.420> earlier<00:03:01.870> in

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
the spring and they die back earlier in

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.410 
the spring and they die back earlier in
the<00:03:02.109> summer<00:03:02.260> whereas<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.489> white<00:03:03.970> flowered

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
the summer whereas the white flowered

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.449 
the summer whereas the white flowered
garlic<00:03:04.750> chives<00:03:04.989> come<00:03:05.319> up<00:03:05.440> in<00:03:05.620> early<00:03:06.190> summer

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
garlic chives come up in early summer

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.009 
garlic chives come up in early summer
and<00:03:06.760> they<00:03:06.940> go<00:03:07.090> through<00:03:07.329> right<00:03:07.450> into<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.810> fall

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
and they go through right into the fall

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.300 
and they go through right into the fall
so<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.290> means<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.620> have<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.799> good<00:03:09.010> steady
