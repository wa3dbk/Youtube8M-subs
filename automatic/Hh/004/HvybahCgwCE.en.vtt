00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.270
 today we will cook a red mullet on 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.270
 grammy 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.929
 cooking red mullet is very simple and very 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.200
 fast is a pleasure 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.849
 let's start by cleaning fish and 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.300
 by the way in some culinary sources 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.750
 I read that the fish are not cleared of 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.560
 scales 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.730
 fries right with the scales but this is only 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.239
 theoretical information that i don't 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.600
 tested by experience can try 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:39.949
 now remove the gills of the fish incised 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.350
 abdomen and remove the insides then fish 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.820
 wash well with cold water and 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.469
 dry thoroughly with paper towels 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.920
 by the way the shelf life of the chilled bar 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.620
 beeches 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.170
 very short therefore for storage 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.000
 little ginger immediately gut and 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.820
 wrap parchment paper on top 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.710
 wrap with cling film and clean 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.079
 in the coldest compartment of the refrigerator 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.860
 in the department of flash but also store 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.149
 accordingly, a day or two not more 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.880
 Now we are preparing marinade for our 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:14.299
 improvements it is very simple but 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.000
 less emphasizes the taste and elegance of this 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.970
 gorgeous big fish 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.950
 parsley we put it in a bowl of them 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.790
 large capacity then maybe container 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.479
 which will be convenient for the amount of order 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.470
 the amount of fish you take 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.850
 sprinkle with salt and pepper on top 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.430
 we stack our red mullet 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.009
 it's salt and pepper and outside and 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.659
 inside the cooks have a common opinion 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.909
 is it worth it 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.490
 salt the fish before cooking before frying 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.240
 or directly after frying with heat 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.579
 the heat is here to choose you because these 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.190
 two opinions are controversial and 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.890
 and 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.540
 there are anise and endless disputes on this 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.620
 score 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.740
 I can say so what I like more 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.420
 salt the fish before frying because it 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.520
 it turns out then moderately spacious and and but 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.160
 at the same time eat and roast on strong 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.130
 fire it does not dry out during cooking and 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.090
 remains moderately succulent is spacious and and 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.160
 very tasty and so with the moment of salting we 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.980
 sorted out back to our 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.900
 pickle water fish olive oil 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.270
 and mix well with parsley 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.820
 the parsley will give up its juice and the swarm will turn out 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.610
 very tender leave marinating on 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.220
 30 minutes or four hours can be a little 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.950
 longer now comes the most 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.390
 crucial moment moment hryvnia ha 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.030
 lubricate the grille with the help of cut 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.220
 halved vegetable oil bulbs and on 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.520
 hot coals lay out our red mullet 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.820
 mind whether they should not be bright orange they 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.440
 should only be torn by ash 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.200
 Spread fish and fry 3 4 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.460
 minutes on each side in order to 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.340
 the fish is well and prepared 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.350
 better make 2 zone and heat zone for 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.840
 of this we put the coals on the left side 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.330
 two layers and on the right we put the coal in 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.100
 one layer as soon as the fish is fried 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.230
 fry us over high heat 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.140
 we printed a crust we did 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.910
 we shift it to the middle fire on 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.940
 average heat and it comes to us 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.880
 readiness but here si excitement behind 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.810
 Our red mullet is ready to serve her with
