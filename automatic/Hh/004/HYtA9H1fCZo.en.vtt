00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
the thing about the triumph is that we

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.530 
the thing about the triumph is that we
have<00:00:51.830> a<00:00:51.860> much<00:00:52.130> broader<00:00:52.400> spread<00:00:52.820> of<00:00:52.940> power<00:00:53.120> than

differences between my eraser and the
standard<00:01:00.200> 675<00:01:00.830> is<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.220> electronics<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:01.910> we

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
standard 675 is the electronics that we

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.240 
standard 675 is the electronics that we
use<00:01:02.240> this<00:01:03.110> can<00:01:03.290> give<00:01:03.410> us<00:01:03.440> things<00:01:03.710> like<00:01:03.860> launch

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
use this can give us things like launch
