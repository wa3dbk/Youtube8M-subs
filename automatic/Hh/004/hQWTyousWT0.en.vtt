 the recipe is very simple but the pie is obtained 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.490
 very tasty and satisfying if you 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.490

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.590

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.160
 a pound of potatoes by the eye at about 6 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.160
 stuff and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:52.590
 minced meat mixed for example pork 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.120
 putting dina and so now i will cut 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.660
 potato slices 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.000
 then i roll out the dough bottom layer yes and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.000
 then we roll the dough top 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.450
 layer to close our pie now 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.920
 cut the potatoes into slices and so 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.920
 proceed for 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.750
 on a baking sheet and always put just such 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.840
 a piece of paper so as not to burn there 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.280
 special then I'm still breading 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.909
 crackers I roll myself onto paper 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.750
 didn't stick to dough so all 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.079
 unfolding potatoes so here i start 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.680
 always off the edge because i have it 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.810
 sometimes it shrinks dough i start 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.110
 since always here hiding put that 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.909
 potatoes and then around now we will 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:49.310
 distribute over the entire surface so here 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:54.190
 potatoes distribute potatoes first 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:59.800
 then salt and then stuffing 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:04.080
 and then a little more pepper it all over 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.850
 throughout and so we have distributed potatoes 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.850
 now we will sprinkle potatoes 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.050
