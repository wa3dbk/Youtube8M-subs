00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello people from oral to concrete today 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.400
 clean up a new video today I'm going 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.280
 explain how to do this 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.240
 glitch effect do observe effect 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.240
 bowls with the intro 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.230
 I sat next so who is watching the mole 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.539
 and I saw an effect you often 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.300
 and that is one 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.490
 anglisch blitz a glitch effect and that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.109
 you can do with twitch as a plug-in 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.510
 but it costs money and we just go there 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.359
 don't deduct without that plugin 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.460
 go and explain how to do that so let's 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.660
 start with step 1 as first we go the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.690
 channels split 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.719
 That actually means you are the artie 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.780
 be layered separately from the video 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.059
 so video has red green and blue 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.739
 and we try to split apart 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.930
 create this effect 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.530
 i have a good what i will imported 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.809
 so first do i go here is a set 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.820
 set up channel then you get here in you 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.329
 effect controls set channels 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.600
 and so what you can do here is this 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.700
 law and the rest on or this poll 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.500
 no so on and then you would see me now 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.930
 just the red colors 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.030
 oh story is very nice but we 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 also want to do that to the others 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.320
 colors 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.290
 simply chain three times and 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.040
 and for clarity we make these 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.470
 just call names red green blue 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.940
 so what we are going to do in the second 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.140
 so set it 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:37.160
 red top or green on green and put here 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.229
 we again or a new team 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.930
 blue and then we all turn it on again 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.550
 and the audio is also on your own 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.490
 because otherwise you get at the end 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.500
 multiple audio low that you do not want and 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.420
 then you set them to blending mode 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.509
 and if you don't see this then you can go on 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.920
 press this button and you will see no 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.830
 difference b back again when finished 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.340
 But the nice thing is that we now go to step 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.930
 two goes with it 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.060
 step 2 the effect becomes real 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.280
 clear and what we are going to do now 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.660
 keyframe test what you do see is 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.420
 you put a crack frame 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.760
 and then first drag this one to the left 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.340
 and then you will see that if you are very far 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.680
 then you really see that you have the channels off 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.959
 get each other we're not going yet 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.260
 really do too intense so we put him ff 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.320
 is 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.660
 and then back again so actually one 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.090
 I also copy the standard animation 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.010
 first keyframe guts to be sure 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.410
 are that we are doing well 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.860
 position at green we do the same 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.280
 just do it when we do that too 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.660
 And then you will see that you are already pretty fast 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.600
 a flash 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.220
 effect creates what you can do then is the 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.079
 Kiefers a bit mixed up 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.299
 move a little and you see men 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.519
 really how intense the glitch effect of the 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:56.230
 have now put the keeper 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.230
 we go to step 3 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.010
 step 3 is to add a region color 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.460
 or add to her turn 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.240
 and that makes the effect just that little 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.730
 more intense 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.130
 what you do is you go to layer new 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.850
 adjustment layer and then you throw here 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.870
 a 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.370
 radial blur and that is a lot at the start 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.780
 too fierce that can put you down 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.910
 throw 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.980
 you can do a bit more and what we will do then 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.110
 for example, we put first 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.420
 starts at zero then of course not yet 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.460
 but then by a bit to 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.270
 5 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:34.810
 then back to zero 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.120
 now defect is not very intense you can 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.920
 make it even more intense but I think so 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.900
 just so beautiful is a bit simple 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.550
 remains and does not become violent 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.080
 and who is the mole used more like 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.830
 transition at the end of the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.390
 video 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.610
 and do you want to know how to do such an iv or 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.350
 Fats is back in can do when you submit 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.670
 click it out on the right to get there 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.600
 to go 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.580
 links are also in the description 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.550
 for mobile viewers and don't forget to 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.050
 subscribe and then I say to the next 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.050
 times bye
