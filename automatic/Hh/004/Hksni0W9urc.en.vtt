00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.789
 very good day very good afternoon very 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.090
 good night everything depends on what 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.090
 they are looking at the present 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.280
 We are here today to reveal who is going to 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.680
 be the champion 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.550
 that is going to take the turner the cup 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:41.330
 of the world Brazil 2014 four 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.160
 possibilities one two three four are 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.560
 those nerd environments you can take 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.960
 the cup on the one hand we have Brazil in 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.660
 the other side we have Spain in the other 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.750
 we have germany and in the other we have 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.510
 Italy for me, I do not understand 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.280
 escape from any of these four 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.160
 possibilities and four possibilities 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.610
 you ask me which of these 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.650
 four 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.470
 in which so he would have to win 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.800
 everything would indicate that Brazil would be because 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.600
 for a matter of being the host 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.530
 why because it is not nor italy in 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.140
 animal in spain 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.500
 and it's a power so the logic 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.970
 would indicate that Brazil would win it but 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.909
 as we are doing here more than dramas 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.250
 who does not understand logic and nobody 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.650
 He wants to come out champions Brazil at least 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.070
 the Argentines hopefully appear 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.930
 something from beyond that will provide strength 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.870
 to the Argentine team so that to 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.690
 achieve 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.530
 break that prediction and that the true 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.810
 winner is how we all have 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.420
 the Argentine team 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.850
 I wish all luck all the successes 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.369
 and I hope we have a joy this 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.509

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.509
