00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.009
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.269
 from me yesterday already briefly on 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.300
 I announced to you twitter 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.250
 Today you show how diverse 17 bugs 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.620
 could fix the jailbreak 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.770
 There are a few possibilities 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.270
 are a bit limiting so the first one 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.860
 I want to show you that limits 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.410
 operating system a little bit 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.120
 because I told him about spot us 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.010
 I already introduced once and me 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.420
 I have no spotlight here anymore 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.890
 you just do not get enticed into 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.390
 to enter something in the spotlight 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.520
 and when you install winter board 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 have krÃ¤h control unit and thereby becomes 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 all this now prevents this 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.130
 you just go to cydia and find 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.110
 then directly no spot if you that 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.390
 whole one is available for free 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.070
 and so you can bring this ries 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.040
 just prevent this crash 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.110
 the next buck in ios through them 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.030
 The jailbreak occurs in the 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.980
 status bar we see all this up here 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.540
 that here the status bar is simply a 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.430
 little in the camera appears something 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.070
 really annoying is ugly 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.930
 looks and just will not be 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.820
 should and i would like you quite 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.770
 show how you could fix it 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.540
 for a short while, of course 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.580
 this bug also for example in the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.280
 Calculator app on fix you can do that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.210
 whole by a fix from cydia I show 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.950
 first of all very briefly 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.420
 what that looks like after you fix this 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.280
 I have installed it now 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.290
 my calculator app you see that that 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.270
 whole now we look reasonable 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.920
 see the normal status bar in here 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.260
 white and the whole thing works 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.220
 of course also in the camera app now 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.920
 the city it was not anymore 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.570
 hold up as it should be 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.400
 you need to fix this error 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.500
 the tweets status bar fixe 2 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.610
 this for free and the source for it 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.290
 you can find below in the video 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.180
 Just add the description 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.580
 then install your device 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.590
 how sprint and already is your status 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.860
 ball again as they are under 17 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.680
 should next like to show how 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.079
 you use the notification center fix 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.759
 means if your springboard crashed and 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.439
 you then have a gray background 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.869
 Everything will come from the notification center 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.610
 shot out weather and everyone else 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.129
 notifications and you have then 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.360
 here just a gray box and 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.650
 here then no further 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.610
 notifications inside the whole 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.530
 would have to be under settings 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.540
 Message 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.250
 everything elaborately add something again 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.930
 pretty annoying and I want you 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.880
 Show how to fix her the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.680
 just after a crash like spring 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.959
 enough and everything is back to normal in 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.270
 Notification Center does not exist 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.340
 you need her iphone to you and then 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.230
 we can already start 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.700
 after we have an open go 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.370
 we were under the following path namely 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.720
 then here under mobile library and then 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.650
 scroll down a bit and search 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.260
 ballet in board this is here and now 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.920
 we see here the following files namely 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.390
 section infopunkt kiel is and this 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.459
 Let's click here to sound like that 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.459
 info button and animal just for that 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.280
 this point bak this is important 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.840
 namely to perform this fix the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.519
 I have already done all you see 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.160
 that with me already is the section 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.780
 info point piel is back and if you are 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.000
 The click on the provided on here 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.739
 ready and you can already your device 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.880
 use it again normally if it is now 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.440
 once crash then all are still 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.450
 notifications at the notification center 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.269
 really very simple and available 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.709
 pretty cool solved as last wishes 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.450
 show you how to fix a bug 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.239
 could make sure that for example 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.040
 the shares app the camera app or the 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.769
 weather app closes directly after we 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.019
 have these open and this bug with 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.120
 apps sync together, with apps 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.430
 Also connected apps you just 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.360
 downloaded cracked and me 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.970
 I would like to have a very short time 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.739
 point out that I in no way 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.480
 support and also rate the apps 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.640
 rather with the developers in the app store 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.299
 to buy exactly the same with cydia 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.739
 tricks and apps 89 cents or 99 cents 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.109
 really are not too much and you 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.430
 should support them 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.560
 But now to the bug I have for you 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.200
 Now once apps are installed you go 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.829
 to go back to cydia look for the whole and 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.280
 then click on the install so 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.829
 Wanted to be told here in version 7 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.500
 the whole we delete then just so 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.539
 remove and you have to target all apps 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.519
 through apps have downloaded 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.720
 So all the cracked apps too 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.849
 delete from your device and afterwards 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.380
 starts the first time your device new 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.310
 I am doing the whole thing here myself too 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.740
 I'll do that once 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.030
 to perform with you more 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.620
 tricks come naturally also like 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.389
 example this here in another 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.480
 video you turn on first now 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:41.510
 once your device turns off after your device 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.460
 you have to start again 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.100
 So in eifel you can do that 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.440
 also download again in cydia 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.139
 and now goes on the following found me was 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.040
 We already had mobile library there 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:57.320
 and then here under caches and here 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.150
 Now we have some files that we have 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.340
 we have to scroll first 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.260
 down and then we find these here 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.380
 once have com point apple point 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.840
 mobile point installation and the whole 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.000
 Let's look for that now 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.040
 here and these delete again at one 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.870
 real here and then dissolved 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.460
 I'll write that to you again, of course 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.020
 below in the video description if 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.660
 you can not find the whole thing right away 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.460
 the next time you can clear it 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.139
 Hot com point apple points long 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.600
 services -0 54 points store and the 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.580
 we will find here and there 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.070
 we'll get back to work 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.860
 here then on this file and delete 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.090
 these and then you can get your device 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.490
 restart once or 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.289
 would have to do this and if yours 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.510
 device the new state is we do with 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.789
 The next step continues after the 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.020
 You can restart apps sync for 17 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.370
 reinstall what you guys 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.169
 Of course, can not recommend 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.760
 but you can install it again 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.440
 and then you've got to be here 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.270
 restart once and if you can 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.970
 All apps should be like 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.070
 for example, the e-mail app or the 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.169
 example the calculator app and so on 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.479
 Run as normal as we do 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.120
 just imagine under 17 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.130
 and if all this whole 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.900
 do not rehearse yours 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.729
 problem makes it all over again 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.250
 just as I have shown here now 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.350
 I have in the video and delete a file 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.240
 again before your app is deleted 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.430
 out to you the whole can namely 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.740
 These errors occur in some 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.000
 I'll show you that again 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.800
 with apps sync clears the first one 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.039
 Then another step was taken 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:39.950
 file I'm looking for a short time here 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:41.990
 in cydia namely a fc and then here two 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.570
 a dd you have that automatically 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.770
 with installed when your apps 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.390
 installed and if so then 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.730
 Do not delete it makes you the whole 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.990
 manually again here and then go 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.390
 the normal steps I just 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.950
 I did it again and then 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.060
 should do the same with you as well 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.910
 function 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.310
 that they were the best known 17 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.170
 jailbreak bugs that are so well known to me now 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.640
 and I showed you as you did 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.650
 I hope I could fix that 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.300
 help you a little bit because there is 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.300
 already many instructions on the internet 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.040
 but all he wrote and little 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.510
 summarized in a complete 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.500
 video and i hope i could you 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.960
 then help 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.490
 get a little adapt and from 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.320
 to fix many bugs 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.460
 if you liked this video 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.020
 I would be glad if you have one 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.550
 thumb would go up can you 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.070
 Write below in the comments 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.620
 if there are more bugs with the 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.730
 17 jailbreak occur and with her the 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.770
 of course you can also know directly 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.450
 I will then write the fix 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.390
 try in another video 

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.620
 because more bugs to fix otherwise
