00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everyone is bon set 27 and welcome 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.350
 in this new good scoop builder 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.510
 Christmas to all since today is the 25th 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.830
 November today I present to you the team of 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.200
 halloween 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.120
 obviously I meant December 25th not 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.190
 I know why he said November you do 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.010
 pretend that I said December 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.510
 taking up the Christmas school is for him 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.340
 succeeded to that of Santa Claus what 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.080
 but here it is not really focused on 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.779
 party about things that have to do with the party 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.369
 but let's go straight to see it first 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.080
 I remind you to put it like this 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.719
 video if you want to see other episodes of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.460
 this series and I remind you to comment 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.930
 here subscribing another team that 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.480
 I should do for a next scott 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.040
 builder I will pull out between a given 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.020
 team that I will choose and extract 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 will win 10,000 credits 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 let's start immediately with the defense because it exists 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.360
 the real star of this team or 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.039
 jesus jesus is close to him we have derbies 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.420
 yes the dragon one because it has something to do with it 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.300
 very much with Christmas 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.010
 no we have baby jesus so it comes 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.739
 baby jesus baby jesus 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.449
 I believe that in English we say so who we are 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.860
 may be the two sides of jesus anyway 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.570
 don't look at the roles because they are 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.659
 we are wrong on one side 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.750
 joseph or joseph coming from 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.540
 create the marinis country never heard of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.140
 and on the other hand madonna nicola 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.049
 Madonna 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.110
 so this is the defense we jesus 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.240
 giuseppe and maria from the other side the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.369
 goalkeeper of this team and gabriele 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.780
 or the angel the archangel gabriele not 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.520
 he knows which one of the two, however, they are not 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.040
 I'm sure you have something to do with Christmas I don't know if 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.869
 it's about Christmas with Easter 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.619
 it should hit with Christmas but not 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.090
 I know 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.159
 the midfield is formed by three 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.680
 players with the same name or three 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.420
 players who call themselves king here 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.189
 king one king 2 and king kong knocking 3 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.920
 here is go tracking because the trekking 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.649
 because they are the three magi even if in 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.950
 English is called wiseman but king 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.909
 King Kings Do nothing let's do it 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.640
 however the team is still called a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.899
 Santa Claus, however, I should change it 9 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.590
 I changed it because it gives me its own 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.159
 nuisance 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.990
 in attack we have inevitable Christmas 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.350
 obviously in this team 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.870
 surrounded by the two 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.150
 angel oh well these here is diego angelo 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.930
 however the surname angel here is this only 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.450
 angel ok 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.490
 here is the two angel around this 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.930
 then the christmas team 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.880
 I still remember putting it like it 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.650
 this video if you want other episodes of 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.610
 this series but now we are going to do 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.290
 the usual game we have against ok 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.500
 it will ruin our Christmas 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.600
 here he is in that job ok al pasta 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.350
 yes yes shot for him 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.780
 come out after only seven minutes of departure 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.460
 great, however, then I'll put them 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.180
 the effect of snow because yesterday's snow 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:50.350
 she's had her pussy so very well again 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.390
 ball in Parma stop it for Christmas 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.010
 I don't know who answers in the door 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:00.640
 madonna trying to be transformed then 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:04.770
 still killer until you stop it stops 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.770
 I have the rule all stopped 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.080
 gabry who complains but everyone should 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.500
 be an angel or something 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.980
 job but how strong is it but what is it 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.800
 the triplet but it is not very strong I knew 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.620
 that he was strong but not so strong but yes 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.140
 for against a team of dead but 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.050
 not even worse banks do anything 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.120
 the first time ends 3 to 0 for me 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.210
 he knows we just lose an impression 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.940
 but today it turns out less for a goal but 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:41.290
 angel is the ball stays there and is 40 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.510
 however I had said that today it would be 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.980
 come out two videos I believe that there is no 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.920
 I re - install that second then 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.250
 only one will come out, only this one then 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.700
 two videos I saw to come out tomorrow 50 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.810
 yes still a little bit of the love that is given 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.000
 my favorite player 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.260
 it is not true and strong but strong 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.260
 I think he has to try it 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.160
 the brain noise this 6 to 0 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.460
 still even death 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.320
 but how it is possible asks so strongly and 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.330
 he who is a bit strong now my team 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.950
 that is too low so I end 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.590
 I keep it in this game, I don't change it 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.560
 but an admiration is a humiliation 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:29.500
 Christmas the summer Grinch has ruined us 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:31.930
 Christmas has not stopped thanks to God 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.560
 this game ended indeed thanks jesus e 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.910
 all the others is over 6 to 0 for 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.610
 the opponent 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.200
 humiliation poor us by force 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.640
 devastated this team one of the most 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.250
 scarce I've ever tried look 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.740
 angola gold globe with jovetic in the middle 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.910
 everyone can therefore be the team of 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.680
 Christmas 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.140
 now I'm going to discard everyone because 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.680
 if they suck or good they were in them 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.770
 wrong positions without agreement 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.330
 piled together without meaningless 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.220
 me who still repeats good halloween a 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.290
 everyone and if you liked videos, I love you 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.780
 like written to my channel and comment 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.780
 from bob size waiting from all bye to all
