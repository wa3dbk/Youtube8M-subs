00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
over the step more time to not but he

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.000 
over the step more time to not but he

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
was always the first one there

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.500 
was always the first one there
I<00:02:50.069> started<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.269> realize<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.680> can<00:02:53.099> still

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
I started to realize that I can still

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.289 
I started to realize that I can still
live<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.870> pretty<00:02:55.200> good<00:02:55.319> life<00:02:55.670> even<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.849> blind

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
live a pretty good life even on blind

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.649 
live a pretty good life even on blind
and<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.560> realization<00:02:59.519> led<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.329> something

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
and that realization led to something

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:06.259 
and that realization led to something

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.199 
came in I think pretty much dead last it
just<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.200> wasn't<00:03:43.440> about<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:44.159> I<00:03:44.190> guess<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:45.030> was

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
just it wasn't about that I guess it was

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.770
