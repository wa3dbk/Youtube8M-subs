00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.270 

all<00:01:53.170> right<00:01:53.289> so<00:01:53.409> I<00:01:53.469> finally<00:01:53.770> installed<00:01:54.100> my

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
all right so I finally installed my

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.099 
all right so I finally installed my
turbo<00:01:54.759> heat<00:01:54.909> shield<00:01:55.179> it<00:01:55.570> would<00:01:55.750> took<00:01:55.869> a<00:01:55.990> little

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
turbo heat shield it would took a little

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:57.779 
turbo heat shield it would took a little
bit<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.590> playing<00:01:57.189> around<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.490> get<00:01:57.609> this

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
bit of playing around to get this

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.550 
bit of playing around to get this
installed<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.450> tried<00:01:59.140> doing<00:01:59.229> this<00:01:59.409> with

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
installed I tried doing this with

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.260 
installed I tried doing this with
without<00:01:59.859> and<00:02:00.130> without<00:02:00.850> removing<00:02:01.179> my

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
without and without removing my

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.419 
without and without removing my
intercooler<00:02:01.719> and<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.530> ended<00:02:02.740> up<00:02:02.829> scratching<00:02:03.130> my

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
intercooler and I ended up scratching my

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.429 
intercooler and I ended up scratching my
heat<00:02:03.729> shield<00:02:03.909> a<00:02:03.939> little<00:02:04.119> bit<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:04.569> one<00:02:05.289> tip

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
heat shield a little bit so one tip

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.410 
heat shield a little bit so one tip
advice<00:02:05.920> is<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.610> definitely<00:02:06.850> remove<00:02:07.299> your

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
advice is to definitely remove your

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.240 
advice is to definitely remove your
intercooler<00:02:07.840> you're<00:02:08.739> not<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.920> take<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.099> whole

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
intercooler you're not to take the whole

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.889 
intercooler you're not to take the whole
thing<00:02:09.429> off<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.789> kind<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.030> just<00:02:10.179> undid<00:02:10.720> these

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
thing off I kind of just undid these

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.960 
thing off I kind of just undid these
bolts<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.530> that<00:02:12.069> bolt<00:02:12.280> there<00:02:12.549> and<00:02:12.760> then<00:02:12.879> the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
bolts and that bolt there and then the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.369 
bolts and that bolt there and then the
whole<00:02:13.000> intercooler<00:02:13.629> could<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:13.930> be<00:02:14.049> lifted

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
whole intercooler could just be lifted

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.410 
whole intercooler could just be lifted
up<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.799> so<00:02:15.489> I<00:02:15.580> lifted<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.060> up<00:02:16.120> enough<00:02:16.390> to

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
up like this so I lifted it up enough to

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.360 
up like this so I lifted it up enough to
kind<00:02:17.049> of<00:02:17.080> slide<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.379> heat<00:02:17.560> shield<00:02:17.769> in<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
kind of slide the heat shield in the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.670 
kind of slide the heat shield in the
heat<00:02:18.910> shields<00:02:19.150> held<00:02:19.360> on<00:02:19.510> by<00:02:19.690> three<00:02:20.230> bolts

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
heat shields held on by three bolts

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.130 
heat shields held on by three bolts
there's<00:02:21.519> one<00:02:21.640> bolt<00:02:21.730> right<00:02:21.910> there<00:02:22.140> there's

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
there's one bolt right there there's

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.449 
there's one bolt right there there's
another<00:02:23.410> bolt<00:02:24.480> right<00:02:25.480> there<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.099> near

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
another bolt right there kind of near

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.020 
another bolt right there kind of near
the<00:02:27.660> counter<00:02:28.660> near<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:28.900> bolt<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:30.030> then

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
the counter near this bolt and then

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.350 
the counter near this bolt and then
there's<00:02:31.660> one<00:02:32.140> bolt<00:02:32.709> that's<00:02:33.670> hard<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:33.970> get<00:02:34.150> to

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
there's one bolt that's hard to get to

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.110 
there's one bolt that's hard to get to
it's<00:02:34.569> all<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.959> way<00:02:35.019> down<00:02:35.200> there<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:37.319> it's

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
it's all the way down there so it's it's

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.030 
it's all the way down there so it's it's
hard<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.209> see<00:02:40.329> but<00:02:40.480> it's<00:02:40.629> basically<00:02:40.989> on<00:02:41.319> the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
hard to see but it's basically on the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.800 
hard to see but it's basically on the
left<00:02:42.489> side<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.790> inner<00:02:42.970> on<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.420> left<00:02:43.629> side

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
left side of the inner on the left side

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.449 
left side of the inner on the left side
of<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.110> server<00:02:44.349> heat<00:02:44.530> shield<00:02:44.769> near<00:02:45.370> the

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
of the server heat shield near the

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:46.710 
of the server heat shield near the
bottom<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:45.940> that's<00:02:46.060> kind<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.360> hard<00:02:46.540> one<00:02:46.569> to

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
bottom and that's kind of a hard one to

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.920 
bottom and that's kind of a hard one to
get<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.900> but<00:02:47.290> after<00:02:47.829> you<00:02:48.400> kind<00:02:48.879> of<00:02:48.910> kind<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.629> get

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
get to but after you kind of kind of get

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.449 
get to but after you kind of kind of get
the<00:02:50.079> first<00:02:50.440> one<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.890> rest<00:02:51.069> are<00:02:51.250> kind<00:02:51.430> of

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
the first one in the rest are kind of

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.129 
the first one in the rest are kind of
easy<00:02:52.110> anyways<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:54.190> install<00:02:54.519> is<00:02:54.670> really<00:02:54.880> easy

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
easy anyways the install is really easy

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.479 
easy anyways the install is really easy
just<00:02:56.139> need<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.410> remove<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.769> intercooler<00:02:57.130> and

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
just need to remove the intercooler and

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.879 
just need to remove the intercooler and
everything<00:02:58.269> went<00:02:58.420> really<00:02:58.569> smoothly<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.620> this

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
everything went really smoothly so this

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.470 
everything went really smoothly so this
is<00:03:00.010> what<00:03:00.130> it<00:03:00.220> looks<00:03:00.370> like<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.819> it<00:03:01.299> looks

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
is what it looks like and it looks

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.000 
is what it looks like and it looks
really<00:03:01.660> nice<00:03:01.780> all<00:03:02.079> nice<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:02.530> polished<00:03:02.650> in<00:03:02.920> my

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
really nice all nice and polished in my

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.650 
really nice all nice and polished in my
engine<00:03:03.310> bay<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:04.150> I'm<00:03:04.239> just<00:03:04.329> going<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.510> put<00:03:04.630> my

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
engine bay so I'm just going to put my

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.720 
engine bay so I'm just going to put my
intercooler<00:03:05.139> back<00:03:05.290> in<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.739> I'm<00:03:06.430> gonna<00:03:06.579> be<00:03:06.639> all

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
intercooler back in and I'm gonna be all

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.849 
intercooler back in and I'm gonna be all
done
