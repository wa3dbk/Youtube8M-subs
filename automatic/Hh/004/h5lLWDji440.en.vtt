00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 one 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.390
 we know exactly what are the particularities of the housing of 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.970
 official protection 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.610
 this question can be answered once we have seen our program of tve 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.700
 country and they still have doubts they already know, they are still a manager of 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.640
 weighing collegiate farms will gladly have 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.710
 welcome one more day the administrator at home 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.400
 look at us so far the characteristic feature of housing 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.240
 official protection 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.320
 it does not have headquarters in the host cities 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 in this area of ​​materials 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720
 in the preceding 20 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.980
 I guess they are cheaper 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.619
 i 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.340
 will be made with 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.760
 between materials in areas that 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.930
 It also has land 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.510
 what's that maracas 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.590
 ellison 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.580
 normalitas finished products of normal shooting sessions 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.970
 little 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.550
 the bloody official housing that are human as massiel 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.550
 limited in construction than normal dinners 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.590
 In campaigns, it sometimes entails a dwelling for its owner 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.290
 official protection 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.980
 I think that in a few years they make us see 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.850
 I do not know if it is because you want to do major works to change many things 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.720
 all right 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.390
 afford it 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.640
 others 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.570
 if not that they can not Venezuelan 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.020
 kennedy that you can not sell during the years not at the beginning 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.500
 limitations on inflation 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.790
 I think they have conditions at the time of hadi good 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.620
 more limited than a 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.030
 Normal construction 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.820
 can you tell me some benefit that entails is the owner of a 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.359
 official protection of living 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:10.140
 the price 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.269
 it is obvious the price is much better than free housing 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.529
 - more than 90 of the purchases that are in front but 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.529
 meanwhile the truth that no 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.599
 the tour another part the precious as who give conditions 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.450
 advantageous mortgages the purchase of 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:33.159
 the benefit is that you have to pay less at the end of the month 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.229
 and that helps a lot today 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.509
 Well, in these cases, I do not know 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:39.470
 with this data 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.369
 all our fellow citizens in their answers 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.369
 we will know after seeing our illustrative report 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.950
 the houses of official protection are promoted 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.210
 Public administrations or city councils also have other 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.830
 driven by cooperatives unions foundations the basic purpose is 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.260
 allocate them to rent with the requirements previously established as the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.870
 duration of the monthly rent contract 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.210
 economic and social requirements to be a beneficiary 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.430
 repercussion for works and improvement and conditions of assignment and subrogation in 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.190
 the case that the houses are owned by private promotion can be 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.470
 request public assistance provided that the conditions indicated in 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.270
 how much of family income maximum construction surface this 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.739
 topic 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.099
 the owners of this type of housing benefit in two aspects 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.849
 one because the floor price fixed by modules that vary according to 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.159
 the province is more affordable than one of the same conditions but of 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.929
 second private promotion also benefit from a project 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:46.809
 tecarian type in better conditions the owner of the housing of 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:51.139
 official protection can sell them and meet a series of requirements the price 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.599
 The sale price is a price if you want to sell it for more money. 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.219
 return the public aid previously received plus interest 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:03.269
 corresponding by this you must request the disqualification as 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.929
 protected housing with which it becomes free housing and its only subject 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:09.490
 to the laws of the market 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.370
 with regard to public protection housing for promotion 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.750
 private rental facilities also has limitations in the section on 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.650
 The amount of the rent is about contracts prior to June 2, 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.279
 1993 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:26.619
 as of this date the price of receipt is free except for the floors 

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:33.649
 which are covered by the royal decree-law 31 com / 1978 can also have an impact on 

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:36.649
 tenant the cost of services and supplies 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.389
 and we are already the second part of our patients 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.099
 the one in which it is you who asked 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.099
 but no 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.840
 between a floor that did not have satellite TV service 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.379
 and now that I can do to have it 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.560
 Any owner that after its installation 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.270
 I want to use the service 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.849
 must pay the amount that would have corresponded at the time of the 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.000
 installation duly updated applying the corresponding interest 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.219
 general 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.820
 is sensed from the community that I know a meeting 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.439
 does not appear yesterday to said meeting 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.580
 what is done

 and if this figure does not exist 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:29.719
 from among the present owners should be elected 1 that presides this 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.409
 meeting 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.409
 one 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.060
 up here and there 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.939
 the administrator at home

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.169
 until the next appointment 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:57.319
 do not
