00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.340 
in just a moment and before we move on
when<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.360> guys<00:01:45.540> think<00:01:45.810> about<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.080> we've

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
when you guys think about what we've

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.290 
when you guys think about what we've
seen<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.590> far<00:01:46.770> from<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.280> Clippers<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.150> I

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
seen so far from the Clippers and I

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.180 
seen so far from the Clippers and I
thought<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> defense<00:01:49.050> was<00:01:49.290> key<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.920> for

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
thought the defense was key here for

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.160 
thought the defense was key here for
this<00:01:50.340> club<00:01:50.580> they<00:01:50.820> really<00:01:51.330> tightened<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
this club they really tightened up and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.560 
this club they really tightened up and
made<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> difficult<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.460> their<00:01:53.610> opponent<00:01:54.060> how

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
made a difficult on their opponent how

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.180 
made a difficult on their opponent how
about<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.990> help<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> drives<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
about the help on the drives and

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.280 
about the help on the drives and
rotations<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.970> mean<00:01:57.149> they've<00:01:57.360> really<00:01:57.869> been<00:01:58.049> in

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
rotations I mean they've really been in

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.039 
rotations I mean they've really been in
sync<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.860> unit<00:01:59.250> in<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.119> moment<00:02:00.420> now<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.570> reset

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
