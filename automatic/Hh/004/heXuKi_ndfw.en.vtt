00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
them to fall apart and then you've got

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
really happy with it and I think it

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.380 
really happy with it and I think it
looks<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.800> lot<00:02:31.160> like<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.640> American<00:02:32.060> Apparel

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
looks a lot like the American Apparel

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.020 
looks a lot like the American Apparel
one<00:02:32.570> but<00:02:33.260> loosely<00:02:33.620> as<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.100> said<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.640> was<00:02:34.760> only<00:02:34.910> a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
one but loosely as I said it was only a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.360 
one but loosely as I said it was only a
fraction<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.870> price<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:37.010> was<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.340> easy

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
fraction of the price this was so easy

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.100 
fraction of the price this was so easy
to<00:02:37.850> do<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.210> I<00:02:38.270> think<00:02:38.450> everybody<00:02:38.900> should<00:02:38.930> get

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
to do so I think everybody should get

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.940 
to do so I think everybody should get
the<00:02:39.260> service<00:02:39.680> year<00:02:39.800> now<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.190> give<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.760> try

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950
