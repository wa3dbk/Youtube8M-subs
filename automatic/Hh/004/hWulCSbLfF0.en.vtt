00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello youtube friends i'm rascal and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.529
 already on the 34th and I come to bring you a new 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.599
 loquendo video which is titled top 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.429
 five the most boring games I've ever 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.559
 played clarified that this is according to my 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.839
 tastes so if you do not like they can 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.940
 insult for comments and give him dislike 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.770
 as I said in my previous video that's not 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.050
 I care good without further delay 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.390
 let's start in the fifth place there is a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.880
 tie between two games which are 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.609
 practically the same are the fifa and pes 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.369
 2013 these games are about playing 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.680
 just that good football but football is not 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.750
 it's nothing boring in real life but in 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.760
 a video game take away all the emotion 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.309
 they take away what is known as 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.500
 passion for sport and take everything away 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.809
 the physical exercise that you do while 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 you have fun putting it on a record 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.860
 made many of those who play these are 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.140
 some lazy people and I do not say all because 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.570
 many of my friends play this game and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.700
 they also play it in real life 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.890
 what these two games are left in fifth 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.710
 place in the fourth place we have to 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.720
 modern warfare 3 is a video game of 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.160
 shots in the first person which does not 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.470
 has a history nothing good to 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.900
 comparison of your previous game modern 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.850
 warfare 2 missions are entertaining 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.860
 but they do not give good follow-up to the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.750
 story but the multiplayer does not 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.670
 it remains behind being compared to the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.220
 others call of duty the worst in what 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.920
 Regarding playability maps modes 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.830
 games and weapons but why is it so bad 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.560
 because it's modern warfare 2 with graphics 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.630
 improved and some new weapons and not 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.670
 I say that the call of duty is bad 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.220
 done the most I like that why 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.520
 I put in fourth place in third place 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.710
 this resident evil 5 this game was a 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.410
 huge disappointment to me after the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.600
 incredible resident evil 4 I thought that 5 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.259
 it would be better but it was just the opposite 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.509
 because for its graphics so pale by 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.520
 their weapons for history and especially 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.350
 for its playability seriously that 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.450
 stupidity of not being able to hit 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.640
 stay motionless if you write and so on 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.990
 only thing that I liked about this game were 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.939
 the characters 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.820
 that's why I leave it in third place 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.860
 second place is for facebook 3 this 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.080
 game has some horrible graphics 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.030
 with a boring story with a 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.580
 disgusting gameplay and missions 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.530
 stupid the first time I played it 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.780
 they had to choose between the princess and the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.489
 prince and I chose the prince at 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.470
 to do this my first goal was 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.330
 choose a suit to what I said this 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.550
 game has to be like minecraft xd 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.200
 after that he had to go with her 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.120
 when I arrived with her my goal was 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.980
 take her by the hand and take her to 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.110
 castle to what I said what kind of 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.850
 person would like this game good 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.430
 I guess the kind of person who 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.380
 created if this game is not in first 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.600
 place is because the first place is what 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.519
 worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.180
 the worst of the worst I've played and the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.370
 first place is for anne payne this 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.650
 game has the worst graphics that 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.720
 I've seen with the worst attempt to copy 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.580
 splinter cell with a story nothing 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.950
 original with weapons that look like 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.959
 toy with stupid missions with 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.209
 boring characters and with levels of 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.250
 difficulty so high and complicated that 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.290
 nobody would like to continue playing it could 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.790
 say thousands of things in this game 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.500
 but I'll leave you a link in the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.109
 description so they see the horrible 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.629
 what is this game if I did not get much 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.909
 information is because these games do not 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.920
 They deserved not a little of my effort but 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:23.299
 Well I hope you liked it and we 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.299
 we see in my next video
