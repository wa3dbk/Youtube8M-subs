00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:19.719
 Ãºbeda all ghana field of criptana and its municipality Castilian-La Mancha of 15 thousand 

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:23.489
 inhabitants that is embedded in the hillside of a prolonged hill 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.769
 their houses are perched by a kind of natural amphitheater until they reach the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.269
 top on which they rest 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.219
 the windmills and from which the La Mancha plain is shown with 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.070
 generosity to the viewer in some places the view only ends where it does not 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.220
 let follow the abnormal curvature of the earth 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.530
 being located in the heart of the region for which cervantes did 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.100
 discover his masterpiece 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 any initiative acquires a character of special relevance 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.500
 this municipality conserves three authentic windmills of the 16th century and all 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.290
 seems to indicate that this place was the one that cervantes had especially in mind 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.589
 when you devised ventures against these if you sing 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.200
 it was the town that more windmills that time 34 according to the cadastre of the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.050
 Marquis of the Cove and the Charge of Felipe Second 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.090
 that is to say as many as the sum of the existing ones that the other populations of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090
 the four provinces of La Mancha 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.540
 Another of its most important heritage elements is the snow well of 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.070
 Holy Christ of Villajos 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.390
 it is a construction of popular architecture dedicated 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.830
 exclusively to the storage and conservation of the sky for its 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.540
 subsequent distribution and sale 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 its primary objective was to guarantee the thermal insulation necessary for 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 conservation of its ice load during most of the year 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.250
 The cryptan field snow pit dates from the 16th century and has been rehabilitated 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 faithfully following its original construction 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.090
 inside it has an interpretive center for snow wells 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.460
 It is currently the only rehabilitated and visitable snow pit in the province 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.460
 of real city 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.249
 the storage of the snow and its transformation into ice was carried out 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.609
 inside these wells 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.609
 where the snow should remain isolated from the ground 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.870
 in the refrigerators this separation between the stone floor and the future ice is 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.800
 maintained with a wooden platform spaced from the ground with blocks of 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.799
 stone 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.709
 with one 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.459
 the first snowfall announced the start of the season 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.389
 work in the snow pit 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.359
 without losing time had to collect the product in the well to keep it in 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.509
 the most optimal conditions 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:57.049
 the work of the ice factory was to prepare small layers 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.049
 of snow that cakes Havana hit of tamper 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.089
 with the continuous pounding of the pri they are made of wood, the snow was compacted and 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.299
 it turned into a solid mass of ice 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.120
 actually the process was very similar to that of natural formation fully in 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.659
 the glaciers where by their own weight the snow is compressed 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.119
 become ice 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.180
 for ice island from the stone walls 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.650
 this date pavano with reeds that like the low have inside 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.780
 small air chambers that act as insulation 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.259
 when the status of the mazado was about 20 or 30 centimeters thick 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.979
 covered with a blanket of leaves or straw that served as insulation during their 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:39.099
 storage and facilitated separation and chopping at the time of 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.099
 take out the ice to market it 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.329
 the cold was very intense during work inside the fridge 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.239
 both to develop in the winter months and to be carried out in 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.949
 direct contact with the frigid massa 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.939
 the workers in the refrigerator had to protect themselves well from the temperature 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.979
 outside as the cold that the ice on the feet produced 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.959
 oo but 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.150
 do not 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.819
 but 4 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:22.800
 stratum by stratum the inner level was increasing according to the 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.490
 intensity of snowfall during winter 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.940
 stop through successive superimposed layers of immaterial snow gestar 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.349
 insulation the fridge was filling up and at the end of the storage season 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.080
 the mass of ice was covered with a blanket and straw that delayed the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.080
 action of high temperatures 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.070
 until a century ago in the height of the refrigerators the ice layer reached almost 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.210
 the top of the well 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.440
 inside the ice was stored until the time came 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.189
 of its distribution from the end of spring to the beginning of autumn 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.199
 before reaching the strong heats of summer began the cut and 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.199
 extraction of ice blocks for marketing 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.350
 but first you had to clean what all the straw and the ferns that they had 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.349
 orders on its surface fraser says product in optimal conditions 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.900
 once the ice fedh pasta to cleaner dust and straw like 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.930
 required in the contracts was to model rectangular blocks with a 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.710
 Special saw of wide teeth with scratching orf little tools 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.360
 appropriate for this cut 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.719
 In this preparatory work we had to try to leave the surfaces 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.059
 completely flat side 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.409
 the extraction of the ice paste was done at the beginning 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.349
 filling a wicker basket and cane that was raised to the window with a 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.349
 rope and a carrucha 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.069
 at sunset 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:04.000
 in the middle of the night or before dawn were the most appropriate hours to load 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.999
 the blocks of ice and transport them to their destination 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.600
 sometimes outside and others in a small house attached to the well 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.330
 they pressed the ice loaves introducing the paste in a tapiales 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.020
 of wood in the form of drawers of different sizes according to the zones and 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.020
 means of transport or use 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.699
 there the sky was compacted with other appropriate minks avoiding any 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.699
 gap that will remain between the tables 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.310
 sometimes ice transport was carried out over long distances during 

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:50.199
 several hours 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.090
 the moderate temperatures of the night on summer days favored 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.430
 the ice will be kept in good condition until the destination or that 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.430
 it will only reduce its volume and weight due to thawing 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.000
 with the rehabilitation of the snow well of the most holy Christ of Villajos in 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.030
 Criptana field 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.320
 it is intended to transmit to future generations a technique 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.990
 traditional that began to fall into oblivion at the beginning of the 20th century with the 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.919
 implementation of industrial methods for the manufacture of 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.050
 ice 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:38.729
 there are 100 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:40.590
 a side 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.979
 all 

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:43.620
 all
