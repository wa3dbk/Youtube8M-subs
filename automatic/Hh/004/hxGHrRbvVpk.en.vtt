00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
because the hooks I previously been

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.650 
because the hooks I previously been
using<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.620> seemed<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.940> when<00:02:59.940> i<00:02:59.970> get<00:03:00.269> snagged

the tip would be if the hook didn't been
somewhere<00:03:05.010> else<00:03:05.069> but<00:03:07.190> carretero<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.489> lot<00:03:08.730> of
