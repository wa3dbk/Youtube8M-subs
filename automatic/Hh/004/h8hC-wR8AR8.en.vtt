00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hi, I'm Milanese and today I 'm going 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.790
 to teach how to make a latex mask 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.790
 hope you like 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.199
 to use as a mold I'm using 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.329
 a plaster head he had done before 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.579
 because it is difficult to do it directly 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.439
 in the face if you do not have one you can 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.660
 use a Styrofoam head as 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.340
 that they sell in the stationery stores 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.599
 making a layer of latex all over the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.460
 area you want to cover 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.680
 remember you can do it the size 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.180
 what you want and with different shapes what 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.180
 important is that you use your creativity 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.829
 to give it a thick layer of skin and the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.379
 shape of the gum on the teeth used 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.390
 toilet paper or kitchen paper and what 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.910
 wets in the latex and gives it the shape 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.980
 Of the face 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.810
 in the part of the chin I did it more 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.670
 I cured this to make a hole with 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.330
 a spatula to give an effect that 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 the bone is seen 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.969
 I made my teeth in a laboratory 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.369
 dentistry but can use some 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.259
 The inserts are filled with latex 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.240
 Let it dry overnight and with a 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.229
 scissors they finish giving the form 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.229
 perfect they want 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.180
 Now we use makeup cotton before 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.040
 we dip them in latex and cut them 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.000
 the way we need to 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.000
 look like the gum 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.170
 in the same way we make strips so that 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.170
 tendons look 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.200
 in a plastic surface we are going to put 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.150
 most cottons covered in latex 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.160
 making a shape similar to a circle 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.020
 that will represent the skin on the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.770
 cheeks that is open and broken to 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.770
 to see what's inside 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.739
 I already have the text because I combine it with 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.720
 base but really do not vote raise 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.280
 doing that I thought I was going to serve 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.280
 for something but it's useless 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.359
 to remove the latex use any 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.560
 type of powder so that when you take them off 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.560
 stick with himself 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.720
 now using more latex we are going to paste the 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.200
 two circular pieces that we made in 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.200
 cheeks 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.250
 the model is now ready only 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.760
 they have to paint it and cover it all with 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.760
 false blood 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.290
 well this was all for today I hope that 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.660
 they liked it and served them a lot 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.360
 yes if you liked please like
