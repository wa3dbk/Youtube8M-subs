brewery<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.340> San<00:00:17.789> Francisco<00:00:17.820> all

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
brewery here in San Francisco all

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.410 
brewery here in San Francisco all
cooking<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.230> kind<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.920> chemistry<00:00:20.160> right<00:00:20.789> but

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
cooking is kind of chemistry right but

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.509 
cooking is kind of chemistry right but
brewing<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.289> find<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.710> especially<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.340> right

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
brewing I find is especially so right

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.179 
brewing I find is especially so right
because<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.420> specific<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.590> precise<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
because it's so specific and precise the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.470 
because it's so specific and precise the
way<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.609> get<00:00:26.730> different<00:00:26.970> beers<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
way you have to get different beers the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.000 
way you have to get different beers the
things<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.930> change<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.470> make<00:00:28.769> things

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
things you have to change to make things

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.429 
things you have to change to make things
work<00:00:29.250> yeah<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.060> say<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> also<00:00:30.869> often<00:00:31.230> say<00:00:31.349> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
work yeah I say I also often say that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.319 
work yeah I say I also often say that
brewing<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> lot<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.340> baking<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.210> they'll

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
brewing is a lot like baking and they'll

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.729 
brewing is a lot like baking and they'll
both<00:00:33.540> involve<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> lot<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.050> fermentation<00:00:34.649> if

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
both involve a lot of fermentation if

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.319 
both involve a lot of fermentation if
your<00:00:34.829> bread<00:00:35.010> making<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.790> sort<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.030> setup

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
your bread making and you sort of setup

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.180 
your bread making and you sort of setup
everything<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.050> then<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.200> sort<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.770> set<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
everything and then you sort of set the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.400 
everything and then you sort of set the
process<00:00:38.640> loose<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:39.960> comes<00:00:40.110> out<00:00:40.260> at

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
process loose and see what comes out at

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.049 
process loose and see what comes out at
the<00:00:40.500> other<00:00:40.620> end<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.550> instead<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.879> like

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the other end and so instead of like

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.490 
the other end and so instead of like
cooking<00:00:42.239> where<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.570> adjust<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.050> cook<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
cooking where you adjust as you cook and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.110 
cooking where you adjust as you cook and
stuff<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.399> beer<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.760> more<00:00:44.940> like

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
stuff like that with beer it's more like

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.340 
stuff like that with beer it's more like
you<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.390> how<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.539> comes<00:00:45.719> out<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.200> go

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
you see how it comes out and then you go

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.510 
you see how it comes out and then you go
back<00:00:46.559> at<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.770> beginning<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.160> make<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> new

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
back at the beginning and make a new

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
back at the beginning and make a new
batch<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.030> tweak<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.480> adjust<00:00:48.539> your<00:00:48.809> process

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
batch and tweak and adjust your process

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.229 
batch and tweak and adjust your process
so<00:00:49.440> tell<00:00:49.710> us<00:00:49.739> about<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.550> main<00:00:50.760> ingredients

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
so tell us about the main ingredients

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.389 
so tell us about the main ingredients
that<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> go<00:00:51.809> into<00:00:52.110> every<00:00:52.559> beer<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that are going to go into every beer and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.610 
that are going to go into every beer and
kind<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.300> purpose<00:00:54.629> they<00:00:54.750> serve<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.350> all

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
kind of what purpose they serve so all

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
kind of what purpose they serve so all
beer<00:00:56.039> by<00:00:56.219> definition<00:00:56.579> contains<00:00:57.270> four

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
beer by definition contains four

and that goes back to a 17th century
German<00:01:03.539> purity<00:01:03.750> law<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.320> said<00:01:04.500> only<00:01:05.010> those

German purity law that said only those

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
ingredients can be made with it at the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.870 
ingredients can be made with it at the
time<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:07.710> didn't<00:01:07.920> say<00:01:08.189> yeast<00:01:08.460> cuz<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> have

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
time they didn't say yeast cuz it have

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.280 
time they didn't say yeast cuz it have
been<00:01:09.030> discovered<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.600> okay<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:09.930> found<00:01:10.110> out

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
been discovered but okay they found out

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.770 
been discovered but okay they found out
there's<00:01:10.680> East<00:01:10.920> they<00:01:11.130> add<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.880> okay<00:01:12.540> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
there's East they add that in okay and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.149 
there's East they add that in okay and
so<00:01:12.930> each<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.110> those<00:01:13.320> ingredients<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.010> can

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
so each of those ingredients and you can

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.830 
so each of those ingredients and you can
vary<00:01:14.460> all<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.000> them<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.240> different<00:01:15.330> ways<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
vary all of them in different ways to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.450 
vary all of them in different ways to
make<00:01:15.930> all<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> different<00:01:16.650> styles<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:17.040> beer

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
make all the different styles of beer

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.120 
make all the different styles of beer
so<00:01:17.729> what<00:01:17.880> makes<00:01:18.060> us<00:01:18.270> adhere<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.350> 17th

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so what makes us adhere to the 17th

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.760 
so what makes us adhere to the 17th
century<00:01:20.340> definition<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.270> opposed<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.810> kind<00:01:22.680> of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
century definition as opposed to kind of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.710 
century definition as opposed to kind of
evolving<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.460> oh<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.240> flaunted

fruit<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.909> added<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.420> yeah<00:01:33.689> other<00:01:33.960> kinds<00:01:34.290> of

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
fruit is added right yeah other kinds of

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
fruit is added right yeah other kinds of
food<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.100> Almanac<00:01:35.579> beer<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:36.030> call<00:01:36.210> ourselves

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
food so Almanac beer we call ourselves

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.480 
food so Almanac beer we call ourselves
soft<00:01:36.689> farm<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> Barrel<00:01:37.259> brewery<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.189> brew

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
soft farm to Barrel brewery so we brew

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.399 
soft farm to Barrel brewery so we brew
we<00:01:39.210> describe<00:01:39.509> our<00:01:39.659> beers<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:39.960> being<00:01:40.140> brewed<00:01:40.320> in

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
we describe our beers as being brewed in

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.319 
we describe our beers as being brewed in
collaboration<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.130> local<00:01:41.250> farms<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
collaboration with local farms so the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.480 
collaboration with local farms so the
idea<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.200> use<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> fancy<00:01:43.829> French<00:01:43.979> term<00:01:44.100> here

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
idea and we use a fancy French term here

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.460 
idea and we use a fancy French term here
is<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.759> infuse<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.060> sense<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.450> terroir<00:01:45.869> into<00:01:46.380> our

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
is to infuse a sense of terroir into our

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.100 
is to infuse a sense of terroir into our
beer<00:01:46.649> because<00:01:47.340> beer<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.180> made<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:48.840> all

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
beer because beer is all made with all

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.690 
beer because beer is all made with all
the<00:01:49.229> ingredients<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.799> beer<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.369> dried<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the ingredients in beer can be dried and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.090 
the ingredients in beer can be dried and
easily<00:01:51.270> transported<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> idea<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.979> go

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
easily transported so the idea is to go

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.770 
easily transported so the idea is to go
to<00:01:53.159> local<00:01:53.430> agriculture<00:01:54.119> systems<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> bring

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
to local agriculture systems and bring

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.300 
to local agriculture systems and bring
in<00:01:54.899> fruits<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.439> vegetables<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.100> local

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
in fruits and vegetables and local

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.980 
in fruits and vegetables and local
ingredients<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.180> infuse<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.600> sense<00:01:57.869> of

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
ingredients to infuse a sense of

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.539 
ingredients to infuse a sense of
California<00:01:58.590> back<00:01:58.860> into<00:01:59.100> our<00:01:59.219> beer

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
California back into our beer

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.620 
California back into our beer
you<00:01:59.670> know<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.880> brew<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.240> lot<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.479> real

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you know we brew with a lot of real

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.719 
you know we brew with a lot of real
fruit<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.740> source<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.130> fruit<00:02:02.310> from<00:02:02.430> local

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
fruit so we source that fruit from local

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.980 
fruit so we source that fruit from local
farms<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.270> stand<00:02:03.479> there<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.869> by

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
farms and then we stand there and by

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.930 
farms and then we stand there and by
hand<00:02:04.290> put<00:02:04.560> all<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.979> fruit<00:02:05.250> into<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> barrel

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
hand put all that fruit into the barrel

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.400 
hand put all that fruit into the barrel
one<00:02:06.060> piece<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.300> the<00:02:06.450> top<00:02:06.630> gotcha<00:02:06.900> so<00:02:07.200> talk<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
one piece of the top gotcha so talk to

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.900 
one piece of the top gotcha so talk to
me<00:02:07.530> about<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.890> chemistry<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.400> what<00:02:08.550> goes<00:02:08.729> on

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
me about the chemistry of what goes on

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.180 
me about the chemistry of what goes on
here<00:02:08.970> when<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.450> throw<00:02:09.720> everything<00:02:10.200> into<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
here when you throw everything into the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.820 
here when you throw everything into the
VAT<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:11.790> happens<00:02:12.210> well<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.260> throw<00:02:13.470> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
VAT what happens well you you throw you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.250 
VAT what happens well you you throw you
start<00:02:14.130> out<00:02:14.220> with<00:02:14.340> your<00:02:14.460> barley<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.630> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
start out with your barley and the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.710 
start out with your barley and the
barley<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.920> malted<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:18.210> that<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.540> that's

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
barley is malted so that and that's

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.240 
barley is malted so that and that's
usually<00:02:19.050> done<00:02:19.200> by<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.440> maltster<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.130> what

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
usually done by a maltster so what

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.680 
usually done by a maltster so what
usually<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.940> brewery<00:02:21.240> won't<00:02:21.450> do<00:02:21.570> that

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
usually a brewery won't do that

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.050 
usually a brewery won't do that
ourselves<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.440> that'll<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:22.980> they<00:02:23.490> sprout<00:02:23.880> it

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
ourselves and that'll can they sprout it

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.820 
ourselves and that'll can they sprout it
and<00:02:24.270> then<00:02:24.420> kiln<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.960> different<00:02:25.260> levels<00:02:25.380> and

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
and then kiln it to different levels and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.770 
and then kiln it to different levels and
actually<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.460> toasting<00:02:27.000> process<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.630> how<00:02:27.720> we

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
actually that toasting process is how we

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.600 
actually that toasting process is how we
make<00:02:28.080> beer<00:02:28.380> or<00:02:28.500> lots<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.890> different<00:02:29.130> colors<00:02:29.400> we

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
make beer or lots of different colors we

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.880 
make beer or lots of different colors we
take<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.450> we<00:02:30.660> soak<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.710> right

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
take that we soak it in just the right

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.040 
take that we soak it in just the right
temperature<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.400> water<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:33.450> extract<00:02:33.660> out

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
temperature of water to extract out

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.600 
temperature of water to extract out
exactly<00:02:34.530> what<00:02:34.710> we<00:02:34.800> want<00:02:35.040> out<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.250> there<00:02:35.460> and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
exactly what we want out of there and

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.250 
exactly what we want out of there and
beer<00:02:36.270> brewing<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.660> one<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.900> those<00:02:36.990> great

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
beer brewing is one of those great

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.380 
beer brewing is one of those great
things<00:02:37.290> where<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.640> process<00:02:39.120> has<00:02:39.300> been

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
things where the process has been

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.880 
things where the process has been
evolved<00:02:39.810> over<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.230> many<00:02:40.320> hundreds<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.830> years

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
evolved over so many hundreds of years

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.860 
evolved over so many hundreds of years
that<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.550> self-contained<00:02:42.240> process

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
that it's like a self-contained process

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.750 
that it's like a self-contained process
so<00:02:43.410> when<00:02:43.500> we<00:02:43.620> melt<00:02:43.950> all<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.340> sugars<00:02:44.640> and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
so when we melt all the sugars and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.300 
so when we melt all the sugars and
starches<00:02:44.910> out<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.810> barley<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.830> husks

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
starches out of the barley the husks

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.560 
starches out of the barley the husks
that<00:02:47.370> are<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.730> there<00:02:47.910> actually<00:02:48.300> become<00:02:48.540> a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
that are in there actually become a

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.110 
that are in there actually become a
natural<00:02:49.080> grain<00:02:49.500> bed<00:02:49.740> that<00:02:50.220> filters<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.820> out<00:02:50.940> so

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
natural grain bed that filters it out so

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.490 
natural grain bed that filters it out so
you<00:02:51.180> get<00:02:51.300> an<00:02:51.420> almost<00:02:51.540> perfectly<00:02:52.170> crystal

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
you get an almost perfectly crystal

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.230 
you get an almost perfectly crystal
clear<00:02:52.800> liquid<00:02:53.190> when<00:02:53.790> you're<00:02:53.940> done<00:02:54.090> with<00:02:54.210> that

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
clear liquid when you're done with that

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.720 
clear liquid when you're done with that
huh<00:02:54.660> then<00:02:55.230> we<00:02:55.320> begin<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.620> boiling<00:02:56.040> process<00:02:56.220> and

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
huh then we begin a boiling process and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.160 
huh then we begin a boiling process and
we<00:02:56.790> add<00:02:56.910> hops<00:02:57.210> during<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.750> boiling<00:02:58.050> process

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
we add hops during the boiling process

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.310 
we add hops during the boiling process
and<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.130> hops<00:02:59.340> act<00:02:59.640> as<00:03:00.080> preservative<00:03:01.080> and

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
and the hops act as preservative and

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.430 
and the hops act as preservative and
delicious<00:03:02.190> delicious<00:03:02.730> flavor<00:03:03.000> agent<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:04.320> we

delicious delicious flavor agent so we

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.320 
delicious delicious flavor agent so we
add<00:03:04.530> hops<00:03:04.770> at<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.040> beginning<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.490> boil<00:03:06.090> and

add hops at the beginning of a boil and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.450 
add hops at the beginning of a boil and
that<00:03:06.360> creates<00:03:07.020> bitterness<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.250> more

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
hops you add at the end of the boil

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.479 
hops you add at the end of the boil
those<00:03:09.900> actually<00:03:10.290> add<00:03:10.410> aroma<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.130> guys<00:03:11.340> are

Germans<00:03:32.070> are<00:03:32.250> about<00:03:32.880> their<00:03:33.060> beer<00:03:33.239> brewing

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
Germans are about their beer brewing

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.330 
Germans are about their beer brewing
process<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:34.380> Belgians<00:03:34.800> are<00:03:34.950> kind<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.250> the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
process the Belgians are kind of the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.280 
process the Belgians are kind of the
opposite<00:03:35.790> okay<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.209> they'll<00:03:36.660> make<00:03:36.810> beers<00:03:37.110> in

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
opposite okay so they'll make beers in

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.420 
opposite okay so they'll make beers in
Belgium<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:37.739> are<00:03:38.010> what<00:03:38.190> are<00:03:38.280> called

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
Belgium that are what are called

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.430 
Belgium that are what are called
spontaneously<00:03:39.090> fermented<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:40.080> that<00:03:40.230> means

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
spontaneously fermented so that means

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.470 
spontaneously fermented so that means
they<00:03:40.680> they<00:03:41.250> make<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.820> sugar<00:03:42.150> water<00:03:42.390> solution

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
they they make the sugar water solution

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.900 
they they make the sugar water solution
called<00:03:43.080> wort<00:03:43.410> okay<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.370> then<00:03:44.519> instead<00:03:44.850> of

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
called wort okay and then instead of

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.030 
called wort okay and then instead of
adding<00:03:45.180> as<00:03:45.510> very<00:03:45.720> specific<00:03:46.200> east<00:03:46.380> strain<00:03:46.620> they

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
adding as very specific east strain they

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.560 
adding as very specific east strain they
actually<00:03:47.400> opened<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.850> windows<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.450> whatever

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
actually opened the windows and whatever

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.449 
actually opened the windows and whatever
drifts<00:03:49.170> in<00:03:49.260> through<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.560> windows<00:03:49.920> will<00:03:50.220> then

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
drifts in through the windows will then

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.250 
drifts in through the windows will then
create<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.060> spontaneously<00:03:51.630> fermented<00:03:51.810> beer

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
create the spontaneously fermented beer

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.860 
create the spontaneously fermented beer
what<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.040> we<00:03:53.459> draw<00:03:53.700> on<00:03:53.850> that<00:03:54.000> tradition<00:03:54.600> for<00:03:54.840> a

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
what so we draw on that tradition for a

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.630 
what so we draw on that tradition for a
lot<00:03:55.019> of<00:03:55.050> our<00:03:55.230> while<00:03:55.440> while<00:03:56.010> we're<00:03:56.130> called<00:03:56.310> wild

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
lot of our while while we're called wild

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.430 
lot of our while while we're called wild
or<00:03:56.760> sour<00:03:56.970> ales<00:03:57.239> okay<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:57.720> there's<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.170> common

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
or sour ales okay so there's a common

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.400 
or sour ales okay so there's a common
one<00:03:59.340> drifts<00:03:59.730> in<00:03:59.910> through<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.209> window<00:04:00.570> well

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
one drifts in through the window well

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.140 
one drifts in through the window well
it's<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.890> mean<00:04:02.010> it's<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.550> just<00:04:02.730> like<00:04:02.940> San

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
it's I mean it's in just like San

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.790 
it's I mean it's in just like San
Francisco<00:04:03.600> sourdough<00:04:03.750> okay<00:04:04.410> so<00:04:04.470> in<00:04:04.650> San

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
Francisco sourdough okay so in San

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.840 
Francisco sourdough okay so in San
Francisco<00:04:05.280> if<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.430> want<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.610> make<00:04:05.700> San

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
Francisco if you want to make San

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.759 
Francisco if you want to make San
Francisco<00:04:06.269> sourdough<00:04:06.420> step<00:04:06.930> one<00:04:07.080> go<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.620> San

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
Francisco sourdough step one go to San

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.590 
Francisco sourdough step one go to San
Francisco<00:04:07.800> okay<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:09.000> then<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.300> just<00:04:09.480> mix

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
Francisco okay and then you just mix

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.180 
Francisco okay and then you just mix
some<00:04:09.810> flour<00:04:10.080> and<00:04:10.350> some<00:04:10.410> water<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.920> put<00:04:11.040> that

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
some flour and some water and put that

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.160 
some flour and some water and put that
out<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.640> it'll<00:04:12.090> naturally<00:04:12.269> inoculate

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
out and it'll naturally inoculate

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.780 
out and it'll naturally inoculate
because<00:04:13.410> we<00:04:13.530> have<00:04:13.739> either<00:04:13.950> wild<00:04:14.490> yeast

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
because we have either wild yeast

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.760 
because we have either wild yeast
there's<00:04:15.030> lactobacillus<00:04:15.660> yeah<00:04:16.200> there's<00:04:16.590> all

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
there's lactobacillus yeah there's all

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.140 
there's lactobacillus yeah there's all
these<00:04:16.950> different<00:04:17.010> bugs<00:04:17.460> are<00:04:17.640> all<00:04:17.760> around<00:04:18.030> us

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
these different bugs are all around us

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.120 
these different bugs are all around us
all<00:04:18.270> the<00:04:18.419> time<00:04:18.600> it's<00:04:18.840> just

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
all the time it's just

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.160 
all the time it's just
of<00:04:19.370> culturing<00:04:19.820> them<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.180> then<00:04:20.780> as<00:04:20.930> you<00:04:21.050> grow

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
of culturing them and then as you grow

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.650 
of culturing them and then as you grow
them<00:04:21.410> up<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:22.370> alcohol<00:04:22.820> tolerant<00:04:23.360> ones<00:04:23.480> will

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
them up the alcohol tolerant ones will

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.990 
them up the alcohol tolerant ones will
naturally<00:04:23.900> weed<00:04:24.650> themselves<00:04:24.890> out<00:04:25.280> okay

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
naturally weed themselves out okay

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000 
naturally weed themselves out okay
and<00:04:26.090> so<00:04:26.270> that's<00:04:26.510> how<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:26.990> we<00:04:27.140> take<00:04:27.410> we<00:04:27.830> use<00:04:27.980> a

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
and so that's how so we take we use a

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.670 
and so that's how so we take we use a
cocktail<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.580> wild<00:04:29.180> Belgian<00:04:29.660> East<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:30.080> some

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
cocktail of wild Belgian East and some

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.140
