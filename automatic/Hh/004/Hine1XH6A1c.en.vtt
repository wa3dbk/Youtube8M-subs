I wasn't planning on going up that high
but<00:03:33.079> originally<00:03:33.829> when<00:03:34.099> I<00:03:34.219> ground<00:03:34.639> this<00:03:34.849> this

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
but originally when I ground this this

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.629 
but originally when I ground this this
blade<00:03:35.510> down<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:36.139> did<00:03:36.650> not<00:03:36.799> have<00:03:36.980> this<00:03:37.189> jig<00:03:37.489> to

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
blade down I did not have this jig to

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.050 
blade down I did not have this jig to
hold<00:03:37.819> it<00:03:37.939> with<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.359> ground<00:03:39.349> it<00:03:39.439> by<00:03:39.560> hand<00:03:39.859> so<00:03:40.069> to

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
hold it with I ground it by hand so to

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.539 
hold it with I ground it by hand so to
get<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.359> to<00:03:41.659> be<00:03:42.049> smooth<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:43.189> get<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.430> to

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
get it to be smooth and to get it to

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.159 
get it to be smooth and to get it to
come<00:03:43.760> down<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:44.439> an<00:03:45.439> edge<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:46.900> had<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:47.989> keep

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169

the both sides the same I end up going

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.250 
the both sides the same I end up going
up<00:04:00.980> a<00:04:01.099> lot<00:04:01.219> higher<00:04:01.430> than<00:04:01.459> I'd<00:04:01.760> like<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:02.959> for

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
this one is going to be my blade this

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.830 
this one is going to be my blade this
one's<00:05:08.780> one<00:05:09.320> I'm<00:05:09.409> going<00:05:09.560> to<00:05:09.620> use<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:10.820> I<00:05:11.180> started

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
one's one I'm going to use so I started

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.570 
one's one I'm going to use so I started
with<00:05:11.930> this<00:05:12.080> one<00:05:12.139> to<00:05:12.500> kind<00:05:12.800> of<00:05:12.830> experiment<00:05:13.280> and

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
with this one to kind of experiment and

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.850 
with this one to kind of experiment and
see<00:05:13.849> what<00:05:13.880> I<00:05:14.090> would<00:05:14.360> have<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:14.570> go<00:05:14.720> through<00:05:14.860> to

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
see what I would have to go through to

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.480 
see what I would have to go through to
to<00:05:16.849> get<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.150> look<00:05:17.300> right<00:05:17.570> so<00:05:18.220> I'm<00:05:19.220> going<00:05:19.460> to

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
to get it to look right so I'm going to

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.909 
to get it to look right so I'm going to
put<00:05:19.729> it<00:05:19.820> back<00:05:19.909> on<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.180> jig<00:05:20.449> I'm<00:05:21.080> gonna<00:05:21.409> do<00:05:21.889> a

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
put it back on the jig I'm gonna do a

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.050 
put it back on the jig I'm gonna do a
