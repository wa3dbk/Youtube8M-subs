food chain in the river this stream is a

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.430 
food chain in the river this stream is a
wonderful<00:03:36.260> trout<00:03:37.070> stream<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.640> has<00:03:37.790> got<00:03:38.780> very

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
wonderful trout stream it has got very

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.310 
wonderful trout stream it has got very
good<00:03:40.040> populations<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:41.060> wild<00:03:41.480> rainbow<00:03:42.019> and

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
good populations of wild rainbow and

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.199 
good populations of wild rainbow and
wild<00:03:42.769> brown<00:03:42.980> trout<00:03:43.310> in<00:03:43.489> here

to<00:04:52.050> add<00:04:52.260> transects<00:04:53.070> further<00:04:53.280> downriver<00:04:53.610> to

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
to add transects further downriver to

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.440 
to add transects further downriver to
see<00:04:55.610> longitudinally<00:04:56.610> have<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:57.090> didymo

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
see longitudinally have the didymo

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:07.430 
see longitudinally have the didymo
spreads<00:04:57.840> in<00:04:58.020> this<00:04:58.140> river<00:04:59.630> we<00:05:00.630> go<00:05:00.750> once<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:01.050> month

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.159 

our<00:05:08.440> final<00:05:08.830> measurement<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.540> this<00:05:10.540> project<00:05:11.110> is

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
our final measurement of this project is

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.080 
our final measurement of this project is
we're<00:05:14.169> going<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.800> measure<00:05:14.980> turbidity<00:05:15.820> which

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
we're going to measure turbidity which

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.659 
we're going to measure turbidity which
is<00:05:16.990> basically<00:05:17.470> a<00:05:17.980> measure<00:05:18.850> of<00:05:19.000> water<00:05:19.270> clarity

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
is basically a measure of water clarity

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.490 
is basically a measure of water clarity
water<00:05:21.669> picks<00:05:22.000> up<00:05:22.180> sediment<00:05:22.540> picks<00:05:23.320> up

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
water picks up sediment picks up

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.050 
water picks up sediment picks up
detritus<00:05:24.250> picks<00:05:24.550> up<00:05:24.730> bits<00:05:24.970> of<00:05:25.150> algae<00:05:25.570> and<00:05:26.530> a

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
detritus picks up bits of algae and a

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.580 
detritus picks up bits of algae and a
turbidity<00:05:28.060> quick<00:05:28.360> turbidity<00:05:28.840> test<00:05:29.110> will<00:05:29.380> tell

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
turbidity quick turbidity test will tell

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.520 
turbidity quick turbidity test will tell
us<00:05:30.300> basically<00:05:31.300> how<00:05:31.450> clear<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.840> water<00:05:31.990> is

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
us basically how clear the water is

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.530 
us basically how clear the water is
we<00:05:33.340> suspect<00:05:33.850> that<00:05:34.000> didymo<00:05:35.490> abundance<00:05:36.490> is<00:05:36.790> is

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
we suspect that didymo abundance is is

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.050 
we suspect that didymo abundance is is
correlated<00:05:38.169> with<00:05:38.250> how<00:05:39.250> clear<00:05:39.550> the<00:05:39.729> water<00:05:39.880> is

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
correlated with how clear the water is

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.450 
correlated with how clear the water is
and<00:05:40.600> over<00:05:41.050> time<00:05:41.290> as<00:05:41.500> we<00:05:41.650> continue<00:05:41.770> to<00:05:42.160> look<00:05:42.280> at

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
and over time as we continue to look at

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.080 
and over time as we continue to look at
this<00:05:42.639> it<00:05:42.820> will<00:05:42.910> give<00:05:43.419> us<00:05:43.510> an<00:05:43.660> answer<00:05:44.070> so<00:05:45.070> I<00:05:45.400> got

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
this it will give us an answer so I got

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.110 
this it will give us an answer so I got
a<00:05:46.120> water<00:05:46.360> sample<00:05:47.610> taking<00:05:48.610> it<00:05:48.669> over<00:05:48.760> to<00:05:49.000> this

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
a water sample taking it over to this

00:05:49.120 --> 00:06:00.290 
a water sample taking it over to this
meter<00:05:52.950> sticking<00:05:53.950> in<00:05:54.100> the<00:05:54.250> chamber<00:05:54.669> here<00:05:57.210> and

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.330 

basically<00:06:01.590> light<00:06:02.590> is<00:06:02.740> shooting<00:06:03.100> across

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
basically light is shooting across

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.880 
basically light is shooting across
inside<00:06:03.940> that<00:06:04.150> chamber<00:06:04.389> and<00:06:05.020> it's<00:06:05.680> going<00:06:05.800> to

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
inside that chamber and it's going to

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.390 
inside that chamber and it's going to
give<00:06:06.010> us<00:06:06.130> a<00:06:07.080> turbidity<00:06:08.080> reading<00:06:08.500> and<00:06:08.650> NT<00:06:09.070> use

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
give us a turbidity reading and NT use

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.310 
give us a turbidity reading and NT use
when<00:06:10.390> it's<00:06:10.900> all<00:06:11.050> said<00:06:11.260> and<00:06:11.289> done<00:06:13.110> one<00:06:14.110> of<00:06:14.229> the

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
when it's all said and done one of the

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.440 
when it's all said and done one of the
problems<00:06:14.860> with<00:06:15.190> didymo<00:06:15.729> is<00:06:16.030> when<00:06:16.300> it's

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
problems with didymo is when it's

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.050 
problems with didymo is when it's
outside<00:06:16.900> of<00:06:16.960> the<00:06:17.200> river<00:06:17.560> when<00:06:18.550> the<00:06:18.580> water<00:06:18.880> gets

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
outside of the river when the water gets

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.770 
outside of the river when the water gets
high<00:06:19.330> it<00:06:19.810> gets<00:06:19.960> caught<00:06:20.229> in<00:06:20.260> the<00:06:21.010> branches

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
high it gets caught in the branches

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.020 
high it gets caught in the branches
streamside<00:06:22.780> vegetation<00:06:22.860> and<00:06:23.860> when<00:06:24.789> it<00:06:24.910> dries

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
streamside vegetation and when it dries

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.080 
streamside vegetation and when it dries
it<00:06:25.570> turns<00:06:26.260> white<00:06:26.440> and<00:06:26.890> tan<00:06:27.100> and<00:06:27.490> often<00:06:27.880> looks

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
it turns white and tan and often looks

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.580 
it turns white and tan and often looks
like<00:06:28.229> toilet<00:06:29.229> paper<00:06:29.490> hanging<00:06:30.490> there<00:06:30.880> and

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
like toilet paper hanging there and

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.730 
like toilet paper hanging there and
Edge's<00:06:31.889> dream<00:06:32.720> well<00:06:33.720> there<00:06:34.230> are<00:06:34.410> several

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
Edge's dream well there are several

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.430 
Edge's dream well there are several
things<00:06:34.889> that<00:06:35.130> you<00:06:35.220> can<00:06:35.430> do<00:06:35.580> to<00:06:36.169> help<00:06:37.169> not

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
things that you can do to help not

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.070 
things that you can do to help not
spread<00:06:38.160> the<00:06:38.610> diddy<00:06:38.820> mode<00:06:39.090> from<00:06:39.300> river<00:06:39.720> system

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
spread the diddy mode from river system

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.790 
spread the diddy mode from river system
to<00:06:40.169> river<00:06:40.380> system<00:06:40.889> and<00:06:42.080> one<00:06:43.080> thing<00:06:43.320> you<00:06:43.440> can<00:06:43.620> do

might find at the river that could

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.370 
might find at the river that could
possibly<00:07:21.630> have<00:07:22.169> a<00:07:22.560> diatom<00:07:23.040> or<00:07:23.250> the<00:07:23.340> algae<00:07:23.669> on
