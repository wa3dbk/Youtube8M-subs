hey guys so I found a pretty amazing

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.530 
hey guys so I found a pretty amazing
concept<00:00:03.899> here<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:05.040> future<00:00:05.520> galaxy<00:00:06.270> device

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
concept here of a future galaxy device

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.070 
concept here of a future galaxy device
and<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> concept<00:00:07.950> by<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.940> be<00:00:09.090> us<00:00:09.269> horn

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
and this is a concept by to be us horn

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.080 
and this is a concept by to be us horn
off<00:00:11.690> H<00:00:12.690> 0<00:00:13.230> RN<00:00:14.009> o<00:00:14.429> f<00:00:15.350> last<00:00:16.350> name<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.490> thought

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
off H 0 RN o f last name and I thought

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.300 
off H 0 RN o f last name and I thought
that<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.420> concept<00:00:18.869> was<00:00:19.050> one<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> better

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
that this concept was one of the better

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.040 
that this concept was one of the better
looking<00:00:20.609> concepts<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.480> I've<00:00:21.630> been<00:00:21.810> seeing

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
looking concepts that I've been seeing

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.310 
looking concepts that I've been seeing
of<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.800> future<00:00:23.250> galaxy<00:00:23.760> device<00:00:24.109> because<00:00:25.109> I'm

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
of the future galaxy device because I'm

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.500 
of the future galaxy device because I'm
currently<00:00:25.949> holding<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.519> galaxy<00:00:26.880> alpha<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.359> my

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
currently holding the galaxy alpha in my

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.470 
currently holding the galaxy alpha in my
hand<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.099> that<00:00:29.099> was<00:00:29.220> some<00:00:29.820> things<00:00:30.060> first<00:00:30.269> like

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
hand and that was some things first like

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.930 
hand and that was some things first like
premium<00:00:31.080> device<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.980> real<00:00:32.219> premium<00:00:32.700> here

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
premium device like real premium here

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.030 
premium device like real premium here
with<00:00:33.120> metal<00:00:33.570> design<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.890> also

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
with metal design and this is also

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.110 
with metal design and this is also
something<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.489> we're<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
something that we're going to see in the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.000 
something that we're going to see in the
galaxy<00:00:36.480> note<00:00:36.510> 4<00:00:36.960> when<00:00:37.260> once<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
galaxy note 4 when once it's going to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
galaxy note 4 when once it's going to
come<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.520> October<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.120> feels<00:00:42.270> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
come out in October and it just feels so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.180 
come out in October and it just feels so
much<00:00:42.780> quality<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.350> galaxy<00:00:43.710> alpha<00:00:43.829> when

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
much quality the galaxy alpha when

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.369 
much quality the galaxy alpha when
you're<00:00:44.309> holding<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> hand<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.510> count

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
you're holding it in the hand so count

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
you're holding it in the hand so count
feels<00:00:46.590> obvious<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.579> Sampson<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.030> just

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
feels obvious that the Sampson is just

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.840 
feels obvious that the Sampson is just
going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> continue<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.020> build<00:00:49.350> upon<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.100> in

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
going to continue to build upon that in

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.319 
going to continue to build upon that in
2015<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> next<00:00:52.410> galaxy<00:00:53.250> device<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
2015 with the next galaxy device and the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.410 
2015 with the next galaxy device and the
galaxy<00:00:54.840> s5<00:00:55.350> device<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.489> didn't<00:00:56.879> really<00:00:57.059> feel

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
galaxy s5 device it didn't really feel

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
galaxy s5 device it didn't really feel
that<00:00:57.829> exclusive<00:00:58.829> felt<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> toy<00:01:00.199> and<00:01:01.199> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that exclusive felt like a toy and that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.529 
that exclusive felt like a toy and that
was<00:01:01.530> big<00:01:01.890> failure<00:01:02.460> compared<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.300> out

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
was big failure compared to like out

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.179 
was big failure compared to like out
phones<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:03.989> issues<00:01:04.290> when<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> made<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
phones like issues when I made and you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.880 
phones like issues when I made and you
are<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.580> your<00:01:05.729> iphone<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:07.680> was

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
are and your iphone right now it was

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.859 
are and your iphone right now it was
cool<00:01:08.130> there<00:01:08.369> was<00:01:08.549> water<00:01:08.850> assistant<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.659> dutch

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
cool there was water assistant in dutch

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.010 
cool there was water assistant in dutch
assistant<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.979> felt<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> toy<00:01:12.020> with

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
assistant but it felt like a toy with

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.469 
assistant but it felt like a toy with
the<00:01:13.049> plastic<00:01:13.320> back<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.119> stuff<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.270> but

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the plastic back and stuff like that but

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.380 
the plastic back and stuff like that but
this<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.869> looks<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:18.030> concept

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
this one looks like it this concept

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.760 
this one looks like it this concept
definitely<00:01:18.780> looks<00:01:18.900> amazing<00:01:19.290> because<00:01:19.500> first

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
definitely looks amazing because first

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.940 
definitely looks amazing because first
not<00:01:20.250> only<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.820> doesn't<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.439> very

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
not only it doesn't have like a very

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.609 
not only it doesn't have like a very
small<00:01:23.340> slim<00:01:23.790> bezels<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.420> front<00:01:24.720> side<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.470> it's

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
small slim bezels on front side but it's

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.609 
small slim bezels on front side but it's
also<00:01:25.830> super<00:01:26.580> super<00:01:27.119> thin<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.810> seems<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.530> be

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
also super super thin and seems to be

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.710 
also super super thin and seems to be
adopting<00:01:29.100> even<00:01:29.430> more<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.880> metal<00:01:30.180> design

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
adopting even more of that metal design

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.069 
adopting even more of that metal design
on<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> back<00:01:31.610> with<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> full<00:01:33.119> metal<00:01:33.750> back

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
on the back with like a full metal back

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.710 
on the back with like a full metal back
maybe<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.740> well<00:01:34.979> something<00:01:35.670> aluminum<00:01:36.240> back<00:01:36.420> or

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
maybe as well something aluminum back or

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.020 
maybe as well something aluminum back or
you<00:01:37.320> know<00:01:37.439> something<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you know something like that and the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.120 
you know something like that and the
sign<00:01:39.270> looks<00:01:39.540> also<00:01:39.720> very<00:01:40.020> similar<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
sign looks also very similar to the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399 
sign looks also very similar to the
Galaxy<00:01:41.520> alpha<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.720> thinner<00:01:43.020> device

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
Galaxy alpha but just a thinner device

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.510 
Galaxy alpha but just a thinner device
in<00:01:43.619> general<00:01:44.060> more<00:01:45.060> rounded<00:01:45.479> off<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.960> then

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
in general more rounded off and then

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.039 
in general more rounded off and then
especially<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.909> edge<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.329> edge<00:01:48.420> screen<00:01:48.600> on

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
especially that edge to edge screen on

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.510 
especially that edge to edge screen on
the<00:01:49.229> front<00:01:49.259> side<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.979> would<00:01:50.070> definitely<00:01:50.250> be

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the front side that would definitely be

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.580 
the front side that would definitely be
pretty<00:01:50.729> cool<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.689> still<00:01:51.869> see<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.409> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
pretty cool you can still see on this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.280 
pretty cool you can still see on this
concept<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.220> still<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.720> real<00:01:54.720> hardware

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
concept you still have a real hardware

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.370 
concept you still have a real hardware
button<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:57.450> something<00:01:58.020> would<00:01:58.140> keep

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
button in that something would keep

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.130 
button in that something would keep
doing<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.270> then<00:02:00.270> I've<00:02:00.719> already<00:02:00.899> going

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
doing that and then I've already going

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.289 
doing that and then I've already going
to<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.320> something<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.740> lame<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.729> epic

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
to see something this lame this epic

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.620 
to see something this lame this epic
next<00:02:03.719> year<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.799> don't<00:02:04.979> know<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:06.149> does

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
next year I really don't know but does

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.900 
next year I really don't know but does
feel<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> little<00:02:08.039> bit<00:02:08.399> who<00:02:08.700> much

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
feel like this is a little bit who much

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.700 
feel like this is a little bit who much
in<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.270> future<00:02:09.690> maybe<00:02:09.840> two<00:02:10.289> years

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
in the future maybe two years

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.520 
in the future maybe two years
down<00:02:10.890> three<00:02:11.730> years<00:02:11.970> down<00:02:12.240> but<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.990> still<00:02:13.500> looks

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
down three years down but it still looks

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.220 
down three years down but it still looks
pretty<00:02:13.740> epic<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.570> then<00:02:15.570> we<00:02:15.990> can<00:02:16.020> only

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
pretty epic and then we can only

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.900 
pretty epic and then we can only
speculate<00:02:16.560> about<00:02:16.770> specs<00:02:17.220> like<00:02:17.400> Snapdragon

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
speculate about specs like Snapdragon

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.440 
speculate about specs like Snapdragon
810<00:02:18.830> perhaps<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.490> 29<00:02:20.940> pixel<00:02:21.210> camera

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
810 perhaps and like a 29 pixel camera

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.840 
810 perhaps and like a 29 pixel camera
that<00:02:21.870> would<00:02:21.960> definitely<00:02:22.110> be<00:02:22.380> nice<00:02:22.850> and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
that would definitely be nice and

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.940 
that would definitely be nice and
hopefully<00:02:24.420> they<00:02:24.810> can<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:25.050> some<00:02:25.290> improvements

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
hopefully they can do some improvements

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.590 
hopefully they can do some improvements
to<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.400> current<00:02:26.610> battery<00:02:26.850> technology

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
to the current battery technology

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.660 
to the current battery technology
because<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.740> devices<00:02:29.130> are<00:02:29.220> going<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.430> keep

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
because if the devices are going to keep

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.670 
because if the devices are going to keep
getting<00:02:29.880> thinner<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.420> battery<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.380> going<00:02:31.590> to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
getting thinner and battery is going to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.700 
getting thinner and battery is going to
keep<00:02:31.830> getting<00:02:32.190> worse<00:02:33.170> but<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.650> are

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
keep getting worse but they are

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.290 
keep getting worse but they are
continuously<00:02:35.160> making<00:02:35.400> improvement<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.120> new

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
continuously making improvement with new

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.950 
continuously making improvement with new
chip<00:02:36.570> sets<00:02:37.130> which<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.910> more<00:02:39.270> efficient<00:02:39.660> so

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
chip sets which is more efficient so

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.960 
chip sets which is more efficient so
that<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.320> definitely<00:02:40.350> pretty<00:02:40.950> cool<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:41.640> then

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
that is definitely pretty cool but then

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.250 
that is definitely pretty cool but then
yeah<00:02:42.360> we<00:02:42.510> started<00:02:42.720> wait<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.050> see<00:02:43.140> what

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
yeah we started wait and see what

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260 
yeah we started wait and see what
something<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.710> going<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.460> do<00:02:44.610> next<00:02:44.820> year<00:02:45.120> with

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
something is going to do next year with

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.450 
something is going to do next year with
samsung<00:02:45.690> galaxy<00:02:46.110> s6<00:02:46.410> but<00:02:46.710> definitely<00:02:47.250> cool

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
samsung galaxy s6 but definitely cool

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.170 
samsung galaxy s6 but definitely cool
concept<00:02:48.030> here<00:02:48.150> from<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.900> be<00:02:49.050> as<00:02:49.200> horn<00:02:49.920> off<00:02:50.180> yeah

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
concept here from to be as horn off yeah

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.060 
concept here from to be as horn off yeah
I<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:52.140> this<00:02:53.060> bezel
