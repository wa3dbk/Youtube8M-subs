00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.030
 hello good afternoon my name is carla 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.830
 marcela gonzález gonzález and the day of 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.760
 today I am going to talk to you about the 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.490
 water pollution they knew that 783 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.099
 millions of people do not have access to 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.369
 potable water water is indispensable 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.440
 for our body and many people 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.690
 not only do they not have access to water 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.020
 drinking water but the little water that 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.240
 they get contaminated is important 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.480
 reflect what's in the world there 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.970
 many people in need and that 3.5 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.220
 millions of people die from drinking 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.640
 contaminated water but as they say that 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.420
 Every problem has a solution 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.579
 every minute a child dies by 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.579
 drink contaminated water and this is caused 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.120
 for different reasons almost one fifth of 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.930
 the world population lives in places with 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.330
 scarce water resources day by day more 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.920
 people suffer from it given the 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.360
 growth of the population or 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.420
 economic decline also 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.420
 many people what they do is spend and 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.120
 use water in different ways like 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.210
 in agriculture households or use 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.610
 own 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.430
 Besides these ways there are others 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.000
 uses and what some people do is 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.280
 throw it without having any water consumption 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 it is important for our consumption and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.150
 that we are made of it by 70% and 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.810
 only 3 percent of the water in the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.700
 world is clean and it is drinkable and this is 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.230
 found in glaciers and in cover 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.200
 of snow 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.620
 we can also find water in the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.750
 rivers in lakes or in aquifers by 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.850
 place of rope these bodies of water 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.490
 What we do is to contaminate 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.950
 causing not only access 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.340
 to drinking water but to have water but 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.190
 that it is contaminated drinking water 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.310
 contaminated can cause different 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.650
 bad consequences like diseases 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.000
 that some could be deadly 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:16.260
 Examples include diarrhea , malaria's 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.880
 cholera and salmonellosis the shigellosis and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.890
 anemia to mention some names 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.580
 approximately one million people 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.740
 dies a year from contracting malaria and 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.310
 4 percent of deaths in the 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.590
 world is caused by diarrhea because 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.300
 5 percent brings losses from the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.040
 health or disability 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.730
 you have to be aware of the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.060
 symptoms such as nausea , vomiting the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.580
 dehydration colic diarrhea 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.550
 very liquid fever or cramps 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.290
 there is always a way to help and not 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.510
 we necessarily have to be there 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.750
 present 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.450
 is an organization that provides water 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.910
 drinking to different people who are 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.400
 needed in the world and each country 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.620
 has its own problem but this 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.350
 organization has a solution for 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.290
 each of those problems have been 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.870
 helped more than 20 countries and what is 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.270
 it is that they are given clean water 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.460
 with some resource without having the need 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.330
 to be well present we can 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.000
 help entering their website and 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.970
 donating any amount you want 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.640
 on the other hand there is a brand of 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.180
 clothes that are called two flags which 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.400
 It was founded in 2011 in the city of 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.530
 monterrey and what this clothing brand 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.080
 is that he uses part of his income 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.150
 to buy filter purifiers 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.140
 water and donate them in communities 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.170
 needy 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.140
 The main objective is to donate a filter 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.660
 for every shirt they sell and these 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.110
 filters are called the extra and are brought 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.500
 from Swiss lausanne 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.580
 the magazine forbes mentioned the extra is 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.950
 one of the 10 things that can change the 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.870
 way we live as these 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.120
 cycles will increase the conditions of 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.750
 life of many families and 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.810
 these regions need 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.090
 filters are reviewable and can be very 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.330
 cheap since they cost approximately 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.780
 between 3 and 4 dollars the goal 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.640
 main of these filters is to clean and 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.760
 remove bacteria from the water 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.289
 contaminated since it can cause 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.919
 mortal diseases 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:44.110
 In short there are many reasons 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.500
 cause people not to have 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.320
 access to drinking water 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.170
 but nevertheless 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.320
 we must take care of the water that we 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:57.770
 we already have these problems of not 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.450
 Having clean water creates even more 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.910
 problems in the most regions 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.760
 needed and this causes many 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.090
 deaths we must take care of the little water that 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.300
 we have and in some way help for 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.850
 to be able to solve and have a better future 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:17.350
 the solution can start with a drop 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.740
 but this will eventually create an ocean 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.740
 thank you
