anybody who wants to watch blu-ray
movies<00:00:21.539> HD<00:00:21.900> DVD<00:00:22.289> movies<00:00:22.650> that's<00:00:23.160> its<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.699> DVD

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
movies HD DVD movies that's its you DVD

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.509 
movies HD DVD movies that's its you DVD
so<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> has<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> unified<00:00:25.680> video<00:00:25.859> decoder<00:00:26.160> on

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
so it has a unified video decoder on

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.790 
so it has a unified video decoder on
board<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.090> removes<00:00:27.570> virtually<00:00:28.109> all<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
board it removes virtually all of the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.730 
board it removes virtually all of the
stress<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.340> decoding<00:00:29.880> those<00:00:30.119> files<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.380> those

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
stress of decoding those files and those

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.280 
stress of decoding those files and those
movies<00:00:32.430> from<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.090> cpu<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.719> puts<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.050> right

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
movies from the cpu and it puts it right

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.030 
movies from the cpu and it puts it right
here<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.800> got<00:00:34.920> its<00:00:35.040> own<00:00:35.149> 725<00:00:36.149> megahert<00:00:37.040> core

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
here it's got its own 725 megahert core

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.600 
here it's got its own 725 megahert core
clock<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.820> also<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.329> 128-bit<00:00:40.110> card<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.649> this

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
clock it also it's 128-bit card and this

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.959 
clock it also it's 128-bit card and this
one<00:00:41.820> has<00:00:42.000> 512<00:00:42.629> megabytes<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.230> memory<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.730> well

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
one has 512 megabytes of memory as well

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.260 
one has 512 megabytes of memory as well
and<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.719> runs<00:00:45.960> at<00:00:46.140> 1600<00:00:46.739> megahertz<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> as

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
and that runs at 1600 megahertz so as

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.420 
and that runs at 1600 megahertz so as
you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.510> see<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.410> very<00:00:49.770> small

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
you can see here it's a very small

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.549 
you can see here it's a very small
simple<00:00:50.760> card<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.300> two<00:00:51.539> DVI<00:00:52.020> ports<00:00:52.440> on

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
simple card you have two DVI ports on

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.110 
simple card you have two DVI ports on
this<00:00:52.680> side<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.489> nice<00:00:53.610> thing<00:00:53.640> about<00:00:53.879> these

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
this side and the nice thing about these

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.850 
this side and the nice thing about these
ports<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.629> supports<00:00:54.989> hdmi<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.770> an

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
ports is it supports hdmi with an
