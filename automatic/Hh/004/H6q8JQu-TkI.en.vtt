00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
this is another good one

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.780 
this is another good one
the<00:01:31.110> next<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.620> the<00:01:31.800> back<00:01:31.950> spawn<00:01:32.280> by

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
the next one is in the back spawn by

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.440 
the next one is in the back spawn by
this<00:01:33.030> dinner<00:01:33.330> roll<00:01:33.630> looking<00:01:34.020> rock<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:36.300> can

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this dinner roll looking rock you can

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.640 
this dinner roll looking rock you can
look<00:01:36.600> through<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.840> again<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.380> kind<00:01:37.560> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
look through it again it's kind of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.920 
look through it again it's kind of
pointless<00:01:37.800> because<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.820> stupid<00:01:39.180> it's

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
pointless because it's in a stupid it's

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.410 
pointless because it's in a stupid it's
in<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:41.010> in<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.190> very<00:01:41.310> good<00:01:41.430> spot<00:01:41.580> but<00:01:42.119> once

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
in it's not in a very good spot but once

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.030 
in it's not in a very good spot but once
again<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.840> look<00:01:42.990> through<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.770> cannot

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
again you can look through it you cannot

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.030 
again you can look through it you cannot
shoot<00:01:44.280> through<00:01:44.580> it<00:01:45.350> which<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.500> unfortunate

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
shoot through it which is unfortunate

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.430 
shoot through it which is unfortunate
but<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:48.060> okay<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.410> a

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
but that's okay because it's a not a

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.820 
but that's okay because it's a not a
good<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.740> anyway<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:54.509> there<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.720> go<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
good one anyway and there you go the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.550 
good one anyway and there you go the

last one is over here this is another
good<00:01:58.800> one<00:02:01.280> by<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.490> broken-down<00:02:02.850> airplane

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
good one by this broken-down airplane

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.509 
good one by this broken-down airplane
type<00:02:04.710> part<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:07.200> can<00:02:07.440> lay<00:02:07.860> down<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.489> you

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
type part you can lay down in it and you

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.340 
type part you can lay down in it and you
can<00:02:08.880> actually<00:02:09.030> shoot<00:02:09.330> through<00:02:09.570> it<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:09.840> you

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
can actually shoot through it if you

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.740 
can actually shoot through it if you
position<00:02:10.619> yourself<00:02:10.860> correctly<00:02:11.570> so<00:02:12.570> if<00:02:12.660> you

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
position yourself correctly so if you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.920 
position yourself correctly so if you
see<00:02:12.900> an<00:02:13.019> enemy's<00:02:13.320> coming<00:02:13.530> through<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:18.780> can

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
see an enemy's coming through you can

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.979 
see an enemy's coming through you can
shoot<00:02:19.110> through<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.620> kill<00:02:20.040> them<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.870> had<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
shoot through it and kill them I had to

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.360 
shoot through it and kill them I had to
move<00:02:22.110> around<00:02:22.260> before<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.739> could<00:02:22.920> shoot<00:02:23.070> them

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
move around before I could shoot them

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.460 
move around before I could shoot them
shoot<00:02:23.610> through<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:25.200> might<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.410> to

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
shoot through it so you might have to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.190 
shoot through it so you might have to
position<00:02:25.739> yourself<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.720> there<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.050> go

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
position yourself and there you go

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.509 
position yourself and there you go
