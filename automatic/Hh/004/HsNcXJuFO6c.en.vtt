00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
 It is a law of nature where there is much light 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.790
 shadow is also this week 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello together with the film factory it is 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.580
 again speed date time I have 120 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.280
 seconds 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.960
 the possibility you all kinostarts the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.850
 week is a few beautiful 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.650
 a couple of things do not do that 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.560
 nice and there is my ranking in 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.750
 120 seconds from now on place 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.279
 I have four tarzan is a new one 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.250
 filming so not the disney 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.080
 but a new one in 3d has me honest 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.140
 said I did not like at all 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.180
 when the environment animations like the world 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.190
 There looks that looks very nice 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.440
 I do not like the characters at all 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.780
 style and the story is just completely 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.610
 desolate back and tossed it works 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.870
 not at all and provided these elements 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.430
 I think that's easy 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.030
 I was very unhelpful 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.820
 disappointed 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.160
 and that's why this week on my four 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.690
 in third place another disappointment 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.480
 I did not expect that 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.500
 monuments men of the new movie of and with 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 george clooney 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.940
 The story is very interesting 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.640
 also cool to know that 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.049
 at that time in the second world war 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.119
 American soldiers here were around 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.070
 to protect European works of art and 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.040
 to save the whole but degenerates more 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.640
 to posse than ultimately in cool movie 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.020
 close 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.970
 He just can not do it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.740
 I would like to enter 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.170
 make entertainment films 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.060
 But at the same time I am very serious 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.100
 on the way this does not work here and 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.430
 that's why I'm in third place 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.439
 second place is a bit more surprising 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.390
 maniac a i'm not the biggest burden 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.549
 trier of cases but here this has on 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.430
 every case managed a very extreme 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.810
 story to tell something special too 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.850
 sometimes he does something about it 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.200
 the goal shoots out but it brings 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.729
 Definitely fresh wind in the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.220
 Cinemas and if you like that 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.899
 look at newspaper reports then he brings 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.670
 also fresh wind in the press can 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.240
 So I just leads from trier fans 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.399
 recommend 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.079
 And I also got my first place 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.600
 did not count when I got the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.110
 Stromberg has seen the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 Movie 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.520
 he has become so strong that this 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.700
 series has been adapted incredibly great 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.640
 is full of cool sayings and it 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.470
 just became the flair of the television program 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.240
 put on the screen it is despite 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.290
 in the movie too, because I'm in the end 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.090
 a little bit more about the characters 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.400
 I could only say people had learned 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.380
 which this week in the cinema then want 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.510
 Look at Stromberg in any case 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.710
 the papa who made who the two 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.330
 Top you want again in the review 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.910
 want to see I can down here 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.380
 Stromberg and right here takes maniac 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.170
 recommend you get a few more 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.820
 info and the trailer is also normal 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.530
 but then we like to see each other 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.390
 again either down here already or 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.220
 with a new film criticism here the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.220
 film factory with me the domenik
