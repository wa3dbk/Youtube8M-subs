00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.970
 well and also she has an official 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.460
 VKontakte page just drive in 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.110
 Margo crayfish luggage on oganyan and can 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.600
 subscribe to her group where to find out 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.840
 some different news and there in general 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.520
 to consult such a plan well, what do you want 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.619
 say I know some people I 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.140
 advised Margo well naturally 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.060
 a close relative of mom dad and here 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.329
 I was surprised when someone from earlier 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.540
 kinda look a little bit tell me ign 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.590
 tricky 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.329
 not always so amazed because 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.369
 I personally listened with great pleasure 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.370
 lectures and if someone can say that 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.920
 there is no time then actually 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.360
 how would anyone want that one can find well 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.610
 frankly clean even 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.010
 household ironing allow laundry 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.520
 turn next listen look there 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.650
 let's say 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.450
 tidying up in the kitchen or somewhere else too 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.940
 turn the volume up on the laptop 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.400
 seamlessly listen in the car pump 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.020
 but how would anyone want that time find here 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.230
 we personally watch lectures when 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.830
 in the evening, the children have already invested everything 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.450
 peace what is called and tablet with you 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.550
 include lecture lecture can be general 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.410
 more than two hours not we minutes 20 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.270
 We'll see later we fall asleep to the next one. 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.570
 day just continue therefore as it were 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.860
 time you can always find someone it seems 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.570
 what is it nudovato 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.580
 know margo she's all her advice all 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.480
 what do you do here like that 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.140
 it justifies necessarily physiology 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.330
 of the body 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.850
 which she thoroughly studied and she 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.260
 just don't say so do it and everything will be 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.260
 okay no she explains that here 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.210
 the body works this way and that 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.760
 so here it is necessary either so or so 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.980
 even know not lazy at their lectures 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.870
 run to the blackboard and constantly draw like 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.790
 look like amino acids 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.080
 interaction happens like 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.850
 whole intestine 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.860
 that's why if a person starts 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.840
 listen and my as tedious as not 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.150
 interesting is it just he knows perfectly 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.930
 human anatomy and physiology therefore 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.340
 need in this case let's say arm 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.780
 textbook for grade 8 in biology there as 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.580
 once a person is traversed and at least 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.209
 slightly raise knowledge and then already 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.730
 will it all look differently 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.709
 so such a person to me she is very 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.739
 I like and respect what she does 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.750
 just with that age dangle not 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.680
 Russia only for other countries and 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.920
 carry people light what's called it 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.840
 of course a great thing that's why 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.890
 look download read on this i 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.890
 wishing happiness to all bye
