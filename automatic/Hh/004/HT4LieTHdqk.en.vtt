 there was a need to purchase a network 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.570
 filter with lots of sockets and 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 cord length and since i'm big 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.870
 lover of technological and functional 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.029
 devices just just can not afford 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.800
 allow to buy ordinary filters for 200 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.470
 rubles which are sold in any household 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.939
 store this product is shipped to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.890
 large box made of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.990
 quality cardboard they are in bags 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.359
 like cheap line filters 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.520
 on the back of the box are presented 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.989
 all the main features of the model and 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.270
 also comparative table 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.700
 characteristics of various network models 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.410
 filter pilot given surge protector 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.350
 is one of the top products 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.300
 among all the models of the company in general, even 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.920
 the box turned out bright informative 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.890
 quality that emphasizes status 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.899
 product network filters pilot pro 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.780
 Available with different cord lengths in 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.780
 versions meter eighty 3 5 7 and 10 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.670
 meters besides the network filter itself in 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.859
 the box also contains the product passport 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.670
 warranty card and certificate 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.619
 insurance 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.600
 This device is made of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.520
 combinations of black and white plastic and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.140
 contains 5 sockets for grounding 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.150
 contacts and one for 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.189
 connect the old-style sockets 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.470
 there is also a button on the body 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.000
 turn on power off with blue 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.390
 backlit as well as special removable 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.860
 wiring element on the back 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.229
 side of the case is a button 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.700
 thermal breaker that I immediately 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.159
 caught my eye so it dimensions 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.159
 device itself compared to 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.960
 ordinary filters, this is just a giant well 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.490
 I will try to tell you in more detail 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.500
 about the main features and benefits 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.829
 given network filter which 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.299
 set it apart from cheaper counterparts 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.579
 the first advantage is protection when 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.350
 lightning discharges products contain 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.060
 protective elements capable of russia 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.310
 voltage pulse arising 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.049
 mains when lightning is discharged near 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.850
 outdoor wiring and exclude 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.509
 destructive effects of gas 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.500
 discharge on connected to or equipment 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.450
 overload protection 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.470
 overload protection used 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.850
 thermo king 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.220
 automatic fuse 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.050
 which is triggered when exceeding 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.440
 allowable values ​​and power off 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.490
 outlets to re-enable 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.220
 fuse just need this 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.290
 button also has overheating protection 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.680
 inside the body protection from short 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.210
 circuit filter high frequency interference 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.770
 this filter also contained networked 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.320
 special diagnostic system 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.180
 which determines the position of the phase and 0 in 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.310
 sockets for correct orientation of the plug 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.410
 when connected this allows the most 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.110
 make full use of protective features and 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.490
 increase operational safety for 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.440
 display correct connection 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.480
 sockets used special 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.600
 indicator light which is located 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.790
 next to the power button also 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.680
 the product has a control function 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.940
 grounding 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.100
 an orange indicator light indicates 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.840
 to a mismatch behind 0 or 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.940
 ground fault 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.520
 in this case, you need to deploy 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.130
 180 degree outlet and try 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.170
 again if in this case the indicator is on 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.690
 orange means you are faulty 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.190
 ground circuit green glow 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.260
 indicator shows the optimal 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.610
 plug orientation and good condition 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.620
 ground circuit 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.620
 This is especially important when connecting 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.420
 gas heating boilers with such a network 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.670
 filter you can be sure that yours 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.310
 expensive equipment will not burn when 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.920
 lightning discharges or overvoltage to 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.920
 Network Thank you all for your attention and bye
