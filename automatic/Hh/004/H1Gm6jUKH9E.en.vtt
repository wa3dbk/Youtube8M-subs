00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
 What do you think of Czech? 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.940
 Complex 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.180
 During the Ice Hockey World Championship 2015 in Prague ... 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.220
 We wanted to show the beauty of the Czech language to foreigners. 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.180
 And here's what happened! 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.840
 Don't forget to test yourself too! 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.020
 Do you know any Czech words? 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200
 Bohemia is the best! 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.574
 Mosta! 

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:20.703
 Krušovice! 

00:00:20.703 --> 00:00:21.677
 Jágr! 

00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:22.700
 Beer! 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.696
 TO****! 

00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:24.718
 Pěkný no. 

00:00:24.718 --> 00:00:26.077
 And cheers! 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.800
 This is offside! 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.840
 In our language these are "breasts" 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.860
 Where are the vowels? 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.720
 What is this... 

00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:23.538
 Good, correct pronunciation is: 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.400
 That's what we said 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.940
 All right, thank you very much! 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.340
 Thanks! 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.380
 Thanks to you! 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.880
 Captain America Approves! 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.180
 Thanks for watching 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180
 We hope you remember how Latvian will say "breasts"! 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.220
