00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.959 

I<00:00:32.800> try<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:33.829> extend<00:00:34.129> the<00:00:34.219> winter<00:00:34.399> season<00:00:34.850> as

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
I try to extend the winter season as

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.490 
I try to extend the winter season as
long<00:00:35.149> as<00:00:35.270> I<00:00:35.329> can<00:00:35.390> I'm<00:00:35.690> always<00:00:35.870> chasing<00:00:36.230> the

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
long as I can I'm always chasing the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.319 
long as I can I'm always chasing the
snow<00:00:36.739> instead<00:00:37.040> of<00:00:37.100> chasing<00:00:37.309> my<00:00:37.550> dirt<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:39.940> I

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
snow instead of chasing my dirt and I

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.150 
snow instead of chasing my dirt and I
I<00:00:41.360> don't<00:00:41.840> next<00:00:42.110> ten<00:00:42.350> or<00:00:42.379> fifteen<00:00:42.800> years<00:00:43.010> you

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
I don't next ten or fifteen years you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.189 
I don't next ten or fifteen years you
could<00:00:43.340> see<00:00:43.610> as<00:00:43.910> many<00:00:44.210> snow<00:00:44.540> bikers<00:00:44.930> in<00:00:45.110> the

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
could see as many snow bikers in the

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.649 
could see as many snow bikers in the
mountains<00:00:45.500> as<00:00:45.620> you<00:00:45.739> do<00:00:45.890> sliders<00:00:46.579> I<00:00:46.820> truly

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
mountains as you do sliders I truly

00:00:47.659 --> 00:02:00.470 
mountains as you do sliders I truly
believe<00:00:48.019> that

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.440 

well<00:02:01.480> I<00:02:01.510> mean<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.840> basic<00:02:02.020> definition<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.220> a

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
well I mean the basic definition is a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.930 
well I mean the basic definition is a
ski<00:02:04.450> track<00:02:05.080> driven<00:02:05.650> conversion<00:02:06.490> for<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> dirt

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
ski track driven conversion for a dirt

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.120 
ski track driven conversion for a dirt
bike<00:02:07.120> right<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.660> pretty<00:02:08.259> much<00:02:08.500> anything<00:02:08.920> that

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
bike right so pretty much anything that

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.130 
bike right so pretty much anything that
you<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:09.550> take<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.790> dirt<00:02:10.090> bike<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.600> convert<00:02:10.990> it

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
you can take a dirt bike and convert it

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.290 
you can take a dirt bike and convert it
with<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.320> ski<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.800> track<00:02:12.070> is<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.730> considered<00:02:13.210> a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
with a ski and track is is considered a

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.430 
with a ski and track is is considered a
snow<00:02:13.510> bike<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.580> theoretically<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:17.260> know<00:02:17.380> you

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
snow bike so theoretically you know you

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.430 
snow bike so theoretically you know you
drop<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.950> tires<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.490> you<00:02:18.580> had<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> front<00:02:19.030> ski

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
drop the tires and you had a front ski

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.960 
drop the tires and you had a front ski
and<00:02:20.440> then<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.650> track<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.340> back<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.820> there's

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
and then a track to the back and there's

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.400 
and then a track to the back and there's
been<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.210> lot<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.480> different<00:02:22.780> attempts<00:02:23.110> at<00:02:23.230> that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
been a lot of different attempts at that

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.710 
been a lot of different attempts at that
I<00:02:23.770> guess<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.460> reason<00:02:24.610> I'm<00:02:24.820> trying<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.270> keep

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
I guess the reason I'm trying to keep

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.330 
I guess the reason I'm trying to keep
promoting<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.350> pushing<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.770> sport<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.160> just

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
promoting and pushing the sport is just

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.560 
promoting and pushing the sport is just
because<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.880> newness<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.540> I

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
because of the newness of it and I

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.210 
because of the newness of it and I
really<00:02:28.780> feel<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:28.960> it's<00:02:29.680> really<00:02:29.860> hard<00:02:30.070> in

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
really feel like it's really hard in

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.620 
really feel like it's really hard in
life<00:02:30.370> anymore<00:02:30.640> with<00:02:30.940> technology<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.540> get

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
life anymore with technology to get

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.090 
life anymore with technology to get
ahead<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.870> anything<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:32.950> pretty

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
ahead of anything and and it's pretty

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.000 
ahead of anything and and it's pretty
cool<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.400> be<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.700> first<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:35.200> doing<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.890> know

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
cool to be the first of doing you know

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.190 
cool to be the first of doing you know
whatever<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.730> might<00:02:36.850> be<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.750> really

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
whatever it might be and so I really

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.710 
whatever it might be and so I really
like<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.530> from<00:02:38.740> a<00:02:38.830> competitive<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.760> kind<00:02:40.690> of

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
like that from a competitive and kind of

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.350 
like that from a competitive and kind of
internal<00:02:41.110> desire<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.740> keep<00:02:42.220> pushing<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.850> kind

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
internal desire to keep pushing and kind

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.330 
internal desire to keep pushing and kind
of<00:02:43.390> keep<00:02:43.570> trying<00:02:43.810> new<00:02:43.990> things<00:02:44.020> I<00:02:44.680> guess<00:02:45.190> I've

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
of keep trying new things I guess I've

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.520 
of keep trying new things I guess I've
always<00:02:45.459> said<00:02:45.820> I<00:02:45.850> I<00:02:46.300> remember<00:02:46.600> because<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.380> was

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.290

it's something new it's something
different<00:03:54.990> I<00:03:55.560> think<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.190> always<00:03:56.910> have<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.240> be

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
different I think you always have to be

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.180 
different I think you always have to be
bringing<00:03:57.990> something<00:03:58.260> new<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.620> scene<00:03:58.920> to

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
bringing something new to the scene to

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.600

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
keep the attention of everybody the the

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.690 
keep the attention of everybody the the
spectators<00:04:03.180> sponsors<00:04:04.400> whatever<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.520> case

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
spectators sponsors whatever the case

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.210 
spectators sponsors whatever the case
might<00:04:05.880> be<00:04:06.090> in<00:04:06.240> so<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.660> just<00:04:07.080> think<00:04:07.319> people

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
should be enthusiastic with it because

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.580 
should be enthusiastic with it because
it<00:04:11.610> literally<00:04:12.000> could<00:04:12.239> be<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.750> next<00:04:13.020> next<00:04:13.350> big

jumping<00:04:47.640> from<00:04:47.850> cloud<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.090> cloud<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.419> you<00:04:49.080> can

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
jumping from cloud to cloud and you can

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.810 
jumping from cloud to cloud and you can
see<00:04:49.350> all<00:04:49.440> these<00:04:49.560> jumps<00:04:49.979> in<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.190> cloud<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.669> be

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
see all these jumps in the cloud and be

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.430
