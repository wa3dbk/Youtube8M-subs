okay so I downloaded Windows 8 beta last

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.120 
okay so I downloaded Windows 8 beta last
night<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:04.259> was<00:00:04.380> actually<00:00:04.529> looking<00:00:04.770> for<00:00:04.950> a

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
night and I was actually looking for a

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.050 
night and I was actually looking for a
way<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.279> shut<00:00:05.490> it<00:00:05.640> down

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
way to shut it down

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.179 
way to shut it down
now<00:00:06.990> if<00:00:07.049> you<00:00:07.140> go<00:00:07.259> into<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.529> Start<00:00:07.770> menu<00:00:08.010> here

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
now if you go into the Start menu here

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.110 
now if you go into the Start menu here
you<00:00:08.220> don't<00:00:08.460> see<00:00:08.580> any<00:00:09.860> new<00:00:10.860> options<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.730> shut<00:00:12.000> it

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
you don't see any new options to shut it

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.169 
you don't see any new options to shut it
down<00:00:12.150> like<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.509> would<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.429> Windows<00:00:14.429> 7<00:00:14.670> we<00:00:14.940> have

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
down like you would in Windows 7 we have

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.720 
down like you would in Windows 7 we have
the<00:00:15.269> Start<00:00:15.509> menu<00:00:15.750> over<00:00:16.020> here<00:00:16.460> now<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.609> you

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
the Start menu over here now if you

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.220 
the Start menu over here now if you
scroll<00:00:18.150> around

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
scroll around

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.650 
scroll around
it's<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:20.330> icon<00:00:21.330> Solange<00:00:21.779> Apps<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:23.660> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it's just icon Solange Apps and the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.650 
it's just icon Solange Apps and the
different<00:00:25.019> folders<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.820> programs<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.570> we'll

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
different folders and programs so we'll

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.259 
different folders and programs so we'll
go<00:00:27.750> back<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> desktop<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.179> probably<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
go back to the desktop and probably the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.720 
go back to the desktop and probably the
easiest<00:00:30.660> way<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.160> move<00:00:32.309> your<00:00:32.520> cursor

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
easiest way is if you move your cursor

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.200 
easiest way is if you move your cursor
and<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> lower<00:00:34.739> right<00:00:35.070> hand<00:00:35.100> corner<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
and to the lower right hand corner you

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.000 
and to the lower right hand corner you
can<00:00:36.239> see<00:00:36.480> these<00:00:36.600> icons<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:37.200> here<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.890> you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
can see these icons up here if you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.350 
can see these icons up here if you
scroll<00:00:38.309> over<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> little<00:00:39.270> bit

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
scroll over them and get a little bit

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.229 
scroll over them and get a little bit
more<00:00:39.480> information<00:00:40.020> go<00:00:40.559> into<00:00:40.770> settings<00:00:41.239> power

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
more information go into settings power

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.940 
more information go into settings power
and<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.260> your<00:00:43.379> options<00:00:43.770> right

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and then you have your options right

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.299 
and then you have your options right
there<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> shut<00:00:44.460> down<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.360> that's<00:00:45.450> kind<00:00:45.780> of

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
there to shut down but that's kind of

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.220 
there to shut down but that's kind of
cumbersome<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.550> annoying<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> actually

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
cumbersome and annoying so I actually

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.380 
cumbersome and annoying so I actually
found<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:50.160> thing<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> Internet

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
found this thing on the Internet

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.860 
found this thing on the Internet
and<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.079> thought<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.320> would<00:00:52.500> try<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.660> just<00:00:54.660> a

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
up on on the Internet but so I thought

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.090 
up on on the Internet but so I thought
this<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.909> very<00:02:03.149> interesting<00:02:03.829> very<00:02:04.829> easy
