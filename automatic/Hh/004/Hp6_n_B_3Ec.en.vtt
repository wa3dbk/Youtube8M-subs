00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.640
Feed is essential, specially in herbivores.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.359
A feed has to be 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:21.199
rich,

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.589
it has to be

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:23.810
suitable,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.789
has to be diverse

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.980
and has to be of a good quality.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.949
The most important

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.750
in the rabbit feed is a good hay quality.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.000
Hay has to always be available and at free disposition for the animal.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.200
There are many brands in the market

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.990
and the ones we recommend are those brands

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.000
that offer a wide variety,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.679
in other words, hays that are from multifloral medows.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.130
They are fields where you can find a lot of different types of herbs,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.810
and also

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.890
we should also try to give them a variety 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.630
of all these possible types of hay

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.230
so you should offer them at least once a week, one type of hay flower and another week

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.329
another type of hay flower

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:10.490
this way

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.270
you will enrichen their diet.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.350
Also,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.020
apart from hay,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.560
you have to also add to the standard feed, special feeds that these have to be

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.070
the same quality or more, specially for the small ones that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.520
are growing.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.370
What type of feeds do we find in the market? Well

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.149
normally

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.620
we will always find

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.450
baby feeds

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.550
and feeds

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.180
for adult animals.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.690
The baby feeds have to be fed up to

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.440
the year of age.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.460
The adult feeds will be left to those animals that are

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.090
over one year.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.009
When do we have to feed them?

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.460
How and how many?

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.219
Well first, hay has to always be available and at free disposition.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.560
We will always have a bowl available in the cage

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.780
or even on the floor of the cage because they love making their nest with

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.939
the hay. The hay is basically dry herbs or grass.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.120
The administration of the feed would be ideal to be done

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.389
in the evenings,

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.209
at arount six or seven up to

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.560
midnight, whatever they can eat

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.029
during these hours.

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:30.849
If our rabbit is a little chubby, we can control his feed

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.529
weighing the animal.

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.129
We pick 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.219
the adult up,

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.889
and see how much he weighs

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:45.689
so we have for example, that this animal weighs one kilo,

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.049
one kilo 60 gramms.

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.169
For animals weighing one kilo

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.459
we will feed them,

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.560
the manufacturer will give you the exact amount, but aproximately the amount of feed

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.469
is around 50 gramms.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.739
Then

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.289
we open the bag of feed

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.909
and will give them 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.389
aproximately a quantity of 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.899
 50 gramms. If you have more than a rabbit, its a good idea

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:17.089
to feed them separately,

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:21.519
because if they are hungry, they will not fight, like this case 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.799
that you can see here.

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.380
You can see that when

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.309
we give them their feed,

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:32.339
as its new, fresh, then its much more tastier.

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:36.429
Come one mate, luch time!

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.309
Very good, so here during our luch time

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:43.229
we say goodbye to you all and hope that you have enjoyed and learned

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.499
many things about feed.
