00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
realization is that an airport is a

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.829 
realization is that an airport is a
small<00:00:56.670> city<00:00:56.940> unto<00:00:57.269> itself

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.930 
happened a month ago paper entry in the
logbook<00:03:23.290> we'd<00:03:23.680> have<00:03:23.800> to<00:03:23.920> page<00:03:24.130> through<00:03:24.640> a

number<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.810> entries<00:03:26.400> where<00:03:27.400> as<00:03:27.610> in<00:03:28.090> city<00:03:28.360> works

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
number of entries where as in city works

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.140 
number of entries where as in city works
we<00:03:28.960> just<00:03:28.990> pull<00:03:29.320> up<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.560> date<00:03:29.770> if<00:03:30.070> we<00:03:30.880> know<00:03:31.000> the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
we just pull up the date if we know the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.410 
we just pull up the date if we know the
incident<00:03:32.400> number<00:03:33.400> we<00:03:33.850> would<00:03:33.940> just<00:03:34.090> pull<00:03:34.270> it<00:03:34.360> up

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
incident number we would just pull it up

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.990 
incident number we would just pull it up
by<00:03:34.600> number<00:03:35.020> it<00:03:35.260> just<00:03:35.650> makes<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.460> lot<00:03:36.670> easier

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
by number it just makes it a lot easier

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.120 
by number it just makes it a lot easier
to<00:03:37.510> pull<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:37.930> up<00:03:38.050> that<00:03:38.290> way<00:03:38.440> then<00:03:38.650> they<00:03:38.770> have<00:03:38.920> to

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
to pull it up that way then they have to

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.320 
to pull it up that way then they have to
flip<00:03:39.370> through<00:03:39.640> paper<00:03:40.540> pages<00:03:40.960> of<00:03:41.320> log<00:03:41.560> entries

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
flip through paper pages of log entries

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.270 
flip through paper pages of log entries
but<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.450> biggest<00:03:43.630> thing<00:03:43.960> was<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.530> capability

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
but the biggest thing was the capability

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.490 
but the biggest thing was the capability
of<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.790> asset<00:03:46.270> management<00:03:46.630> in<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.900> attribute

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
of the asset management in the attribute

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.950 
of the asset management in the attribute
management<00:03:48.130> side<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.580> all<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.880> our<00:03:49.000> assets<00:03:49.540> so

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
management side of all of our assets so

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.360 
management side of all of our assets so
now<00:03:50.170> we<00:03:50.230> had<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.590> maintenance<00:03:50.980> management

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
now we had a maintenance management

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.420 
now we had a maintenance management
system<00:03:51.990> that<00:03:52.990> allowed<00:03:53.260> our<00:03:53.470> end-users<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:54.250> see

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
system that allowed our end-users to see

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.130 
system that allowed our end-users to see
all<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.760> information<00:03:55.030> about<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.720> assets

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
all the information about the assets

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.260 
all the information about the assets
that<00:03:56.290> was<00:03:56.590> attractive<00:03:57.250> it's<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.730> centralized

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
that was attractive it's a centralized

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.900 
that was attractive it's a centralized
storage<00:03:58.720> database<00:03:59.190> so<00:04:00.190> now<00:04:00.280> everybody<00:04:00.730> can

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
storage database so now everybody can

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.610

access<00:04:01.150> all<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.630> information<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.380> we<00:04:02.440> can

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
access all that information and we can

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.170 
access all that information and we can

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
feed that information back out to

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.630 
feed that information back out to
