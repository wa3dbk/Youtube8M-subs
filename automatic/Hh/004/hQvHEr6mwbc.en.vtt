a lot of it in between now and the first

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.060 
a lot of it in between now and the first
game<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:48.360> being<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.960> good<00:00:49.070> situational

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
game and being a good situational

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.209 
game and being a good situational
offense<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.059> defense<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.750> special<00:00:52.440> teams<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
offense and defense and special teams is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.590 
offense and defense and special teams is
so<00:00:53.520> important<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.270> usually<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
so important and it's usually the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.450 
so important and it's usually the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
difference in for football games I think

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.220 
difference in for football games I think

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
SEC games that were played last year

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.750 
SEC games that were played last year
we're<00:01:04.350> within<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.650> touchdown<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
we're within a touchdown going in the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
we're within a touchdown going in the
fourth<00:01:06.000> quarter<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.020> ought<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> tell<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
confident in those other two games and

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.860 
confident in those other two games and
we<00:01:32.520> had<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> mental<00:01:33.390> break<00:01:33.630> ups

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.000 
the defensive line meaning they're
really<00:02:02.970> not<00:02:03.950> stout<00:02:04.950> enough<00:02:05.450> from<00:02:06.450> tackle<00:02:07.010> but

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
really not stout enough from tackle but

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.400 
really not stout enough from tackle but
when<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.310> move<00:02:08.520> them<00:02:08.700> out<00:02:08.820> a<00:02:08.850> little<00:02:09.090> bit

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
when you move them out a little bit

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.270 
when you move them out a little bit
there<00:02:10.410> they<00:02:10.770> got<00:02:10.950> pretty<00:02:11.220> good<00:02:11.280> girth<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.140> so

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
there they got pretty good girth and so

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.310 
there they got pretty good girth and so
they're<00:02:14.280> really<00:02:14.490> more<00:02:14.820> in<00:02:15.150> body<00:02:15.480> types<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.200> we

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
they're really more in body types but we

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.000 
they're really more in body types but we
don't<00:02:16.500> have<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.710> lover<00:02:17.720> tackle<00:02:18.720> tight<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.320> we

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
don't have a lover tackle tight so we

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.300 
don't have a lover tackle tight so we
gotta<00:02:20.220> keep<00:02:21.060> impersonal<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.110> also<00:02:22.290> we<00:02:23.280> can

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
gotta keep impersonal and it also we can

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.920 
gotta keep impersonal and it also we can
kind<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.730> move<00:02:23.880> them<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.239> between<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.750> at

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
kind of move them in between that at

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.750 
kind of move them in between that at
five<00:02:25.140> technique<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> little<00:02:26.250> slanted

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
five technique and do a little slanted

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.360 
five technique and do a little slanted
moving

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
moving

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.119 
moving
so<00:02:28.209> we<00:02:28.360> got<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.510> lot<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:28.810> options<00:02:29.409> because<00:02:29.980> our

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
so we got a lot of options because our

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.940 
so we got a lot of options because our
linemen<00:02:30.510> are<00:02:31.510> just<00:02:31.780> not<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.319> prototype

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
linemen are just not the prototype

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.520 
linemen are just not the prototype
defensive<00:02:33.580> tackle<00:02:34.030> mold<00:02:34.299> and<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.290> we're<00:02:35.440> going

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
defensive tackle mold and so we're going

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.690 
defensive tackle mold and so we're going
to<00:02:35.620> have<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.890> use<00:02:36.099> them<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.430> lot<00:02:36.459> of<00:02:36.610> different

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
to have to use them a lot of different

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.339 
to have to use them a lot of different
ways<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.599> another<00:02:37.900> thing<00:02:38.170> that's

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
ways is this another thing that's

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.479 
ways is this another thing that's
relatively<00:02:39.159> a<00:02:39.370> new<00:02:39.849> concept<00:02:40.450> for<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:42.340> be

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
relatively a new concept for you to be

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.300 
relatively a new concept for you to be
always<00:02:42.819> seeing<00:02:43.690> spring<00:02:43.989> is<00:02:44.140> awaited<00:02:44.590> know

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
always seeing spring is awaited know

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.890 
always seeing spring is awaited know
that's<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.760> spring<00:02:46.269> is<00:02:46.390> great<00:02:46.629> for<00:02:46.870> that

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
that's a spring is great for that

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.920 
that's a spring is great for that
because<00:02:47.459> you're<00:02:48.459> it's<00:02:48.970> your<00:02:49.209> time<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.510> really

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
because you're it's your time to really

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.949 
because you're it's your time to really
see<00:02:50.590> as<00:02:50.920> much<00:02:51.420> evaluate<00:02:52.420> what<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.720> players

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
see as much evaluate what the players

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.289 
see as much evaluate what the players
can<00:02:53.260> do<00:02:53.379> in<00:02:53.560> multiple<00:02:54.069> roles<00:02:54.280> we're<00:02:55.000> doing<00:02:55.239> it

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
can do in multiple roles we're doing it

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.000 
can do in multiple roles we're doing it
on<00:02:55.420> offense<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.079> know<00:02:56.110> whether<00:02:56.409> the<00:02:56.620> guy<00:02:56.769> can

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
on offense you know whether the guy can

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.550 
on offense you know whether the guy can
play<00:02:57.129> slot<00:02:57.610> or<00:02:57.849> not<00:02:58.090> we<00:02:58.720> do<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.049> lot<00:02:59.230> with<00:02:59.440> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
play slot or not we do it a lot with the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.140 
play slot or not we do it a lot with the
runners<00:02:59.920> see<00:03:00.129> how<00:03:00.250> much<00:03:00.459> we<00:03:00.640> can<00:03:00.670> use<00:03:00.970> them

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
runners see how much we can use them

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.839 
runners see how much we can use them
outside<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.840> perimeter<00:03:02.079> game<00:03:02.489> we<00:03:03.489> see<00:03:03.700> who
