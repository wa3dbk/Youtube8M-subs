00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
that's about it as far as the difference

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.629 
that's about it as far as the difference
between<00:05:05.969> this<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.360> regular<00:05:06.839> Android<00:05:07.639> casts

for the perform to the phone it's

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:14.169 
for the perform to the phone it's
actually<00:05:11.909> pretty<00:05:12.089> good<00:05:12.270> it's<00:05:12.689> very<00:05:12.990> quick

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:14.179

of the motor elec z71 inclusion

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.370 
of the motor elec z71 inclusion
basically<00:06:52.400> if<00:06:53.390> you<00:06:53.510> have<00:06:53.630> a<00:06:53.720> tea<00:06:53.780> and<00:06:54.290> you're

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
basically if you have a tea and you're

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.830 
basically if you have a tea and you're
using<00:06:54.530> 3g<00:06:55.090> and<00:06:56.090> you<00:06:56.180> want<00:06:56.360> something<00:06:56.510> similar

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
using 3g and you want something similar

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.390 
using 3g and you want something similar
to<00:06:56.900> android<00:06:57.230> but<00:06:57.380> you<00:06:57.530> don't<00:06:57.710> mind<00:06:58.160> not<00:06:58.370> having

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
to android but you don't mind not having

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.460 
to android but you don't mind not having
a<00:06:58.730> qwerty<00:06:58.970> keyboard<00:06:59.420> this<00:06:59.990> is<00:07:00.110> not<00:07:00.230> a<00:07:00.290> bad

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
a qwerty keyboard this is not a bad

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.740 
a qwerty keyboard this is not a bad
choice<00:07:00.710> at<00:07:00.920> all<00:07:01.150> the<00:07:02.150> other<00:07:02.300> one<00:07:02.450> that<00:07:02.540> i<00:07:02.600> would

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
choice at all the other one that i would

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.180 
choice at all the other one that i would
suggest<00:07:02.960> as<00:07:03.290> close<00:07:03.500> to<00:07:03.590> this<00:07:03.680> is<00:07:03.830> the<00:07:03.920> nexus

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
suggest as close to this is the nexus

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.470 
suggest as close to this is the nexus
one<00:07:04.430> but<00:07:04.640> this<00:07:04.760> is<00:07:04.880> actually<00:07:05.150> a<00:07:05.210> little<00:07:05.300> bit

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480 
one but this is actually a little bit

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.630 
one but this is actually a little bit
cheaper<00:07:05.690> than<00:07:05.900> the<00:07:05.990> nexus<00:07:06.230> one<00:07:06.440> so<00:07:07.370> that's<00:07:07.520> not

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:07.640 
cheaper than the nexus one so that's not

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.100 
cheaper than the nexus one so that's not
too<00:07:07.760> bad<00:07:07.790> also<00:07:08.540> if<00:07:08.600> you're<00:07:08.690> using<00:07:08.840> t-mobile

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
too bad also if you're using t-mobile

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.680 
too bad also if you're using t-mobile
and<00:07:09.560> you<00:07:09.620> don't<00:07:09.800> use<00:07:09.980> the<00:07:10.130> data<00:07:10.310> plan<00:07:10.580> and<00:07:11.060> you

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.690 
and you don't use the data plan and you

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.900 
and you don't use the data plan and you
just<00:07:11.840> want<00:07:12.020> to<00:07:12.080> use<00:07:12.200> Wi-Fi<00:07:12.410> again<00:07:13.130> not<00:07:13.640> to<00:07:13.790> bed

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 
just want to use Wi-Fi again not to bed

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.010 
just want to use Wi-Fi again not to bed
of<00:07:14.000> a<00:07:14.060> choice<00:07:14.180> considering<00:07:14.600> it<00:07:14.780> is<00:07:14.870> a<00:07:14.900> little

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
of a choice considering it is a little

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.750 
of a choice considering it is a little
bit<00:07:15.140> cheaper<00:07:15.410> than<00:07:15.500> the<00:07:15.560> nexus<00:07:15.860> one<00:07:16.100> I<00:07:16.310> would

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
bit cheaper than the nexus one I would

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.360 
bit cheaper than the nexus one I would
very<00:07:17.060> similar<00:07:17.480> features<00:07:18.100> so<00:07:19.100> there<00:07:19.250> you<00:07:19.280> have

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370 
very similar features so there you have

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.460 
very similar features so there you have
it
