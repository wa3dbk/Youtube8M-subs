00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:06.528
 The key to understanding art is the ability to describe what you see. 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.303
 Some may wonder, why do we need half of what we see? 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:12.637
 It's the perfect way to start understanding art, 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.399
 Any work of art, or any landscape that we see at all! 

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:20.618
 let us try! 

00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:27.337
 I ask you to stop the video and to meditate and record what you see. 

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:36.634
 Landscape, at night, stars in the sky, and a large mobile shape in the background! 

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:42.418
 The sky occupies most of the painting, the painting predominates blue, friendly and yellow colors. 

00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:44.820
 Look down, we see a small town, 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.287
 Simple houses, winding around a church, 

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:54.697
 The town lies in a valley surrounded by hills, 

00:00:57.732 --> 00:01:00.532
 There seem to be some lighted houses in town, 

00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:08.623
 The sky is full of stars that shine through the darkness. 

00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:13.525
 There is a golden moon radiating like the sun, 

00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:20.950
 There is a cypress tree, dominating the front of the painting, 

00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:22.981
 Above the landscape, 

00:01:25.183 --> 00:01:28.167
 The town is located between this dark shape at the left of the back, 

00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:30.962
 And the bright moon at the top right. 

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:41.959
 In many places, the feathers look like curved lines, 

00:01:42.098 --> 00:01:46.797
 Everything in nature seems alive and moving! 

00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:54.841
 Even the cypress tree looks like a flame to us, 

00:02:00.497 --> 00:02:05.429
 The church tower is the only thing - except the cypress tree - which rises from the mountains, 

00:02:11.894 --> 00:02:15.551
 What does all this mean? 

00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:21.578
 When it comes to modern art, there often is not one meaning, but many meanings. 

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:26.187
 In previous artistic periods, ie before modern art - before the year 1800 AD, 

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:28.269
 The works of art had more specific objectives, 

00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:30.860
 Often, to teach us something specific, or inspire us to faith, 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.395
 Art was also used as a means of supporting or challenging political power, 

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:46.929
 - knowing that we are still using it to that end - 

00:02:49.108 --> 00:02:54.983
 Art can help us remember someone we love, 

00:02:57.272 --> 00:03:01.269
 It may help us to remember ourselves, or to think about our situation. 

00:03:04.202 --> 00:03:07.849
 In modern times, art may mean many things, 

00:03:07.941 --> 00:03:12.171
 Sometimes, things are very personal and special to the artist. 

00:03:13.984 --> 00:03:19.176
 But, almost always, art tells us a lot about the true meaning of being human! 

00:03:22.225 --> 00:03:25.925
 It also tells us a lot about the time in which the artist lived, 

00:03:26.017 --> 00:03:30.034
 And may tell us about what we expect from art itself, 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.398
 Have you been prompted to describe this painting to think about what it means?
