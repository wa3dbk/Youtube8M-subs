00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:12.690
 the power system of an engine 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:16.109
 diesel 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.580
 of the materials to be used with a 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.580
 key number 14 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.310
 we also have steam today 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:33.290
 we need a charged battery 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.860
 next and the fuel that 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.860
 understand 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.699
 The high and low pressure system 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.449
 Low pressure system starts at 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:52.949
 foreigner filtering the bowler through 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:55.500
 from another would be more expensive than returning to the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.540
 pump is here where the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.320
 high pressure system that grants a 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.320
 next pipe 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.230
 good as a next photo then we should 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.100
 organize the system player 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:32.570
 feeding 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:32.570
 for others 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.229
 then once and for all 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.620
 once finished 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.500
 we have the ability to strong 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.180
 the next step of the high system 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.750
 pressure is playing some starts 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.790
 giving boot in the system we proceed 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.420
 to loosen the doors leading to the 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.420
 entry of him 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.570
 we proceed to loosen number 19 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.380
 the directors to proceed to boot 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.180
 as we can see we already have 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.180
 practically 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.060
 high pressure players for which 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.590
 We need to give you some small 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.440
 starts as you observe that 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.040
 we periodically perform each of 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.040
 the directors 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.320
 with this he also analyzed the practice of 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.320
 purging the feeding system 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.500
 well then we have a model 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.169
 which details the cutting of a 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.840
 injection pump online 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.719
 here we have the bomb shell that 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.990
 it would be the main part 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:40.889
 We have a speed regulator 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.030
 the low depression pump 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:48.180
 and here we would have the side covers of 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.330
 the injection pump then 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.949
 we have a plug of o in the pump 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.919
 followed by a camshaft which 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:05:00.499
 Operates the rollers so that these 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.499
 action on a firefighter elements 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.210
 good below we have what is 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.100
 the zipper which is activated when 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.650
 we accelerate 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.720
 in this part we have when 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.009
 activated to also trigger the 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.869
 plunger of the pump and we have here 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.869
 this is going to have a turn 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.370
 and which will produce the input and 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.160
 fuel output below 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.370
 we have the dosing valves the 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:36.420
 which open when the pressure of the 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.000
 diesel increases due due to plunger 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.860
 of the pump which is moving and 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.860
 this allows the passage of the pipes 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.220
 and this would be all we can give them 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.020
 present about the pump 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.020
 injection thank you thank you
