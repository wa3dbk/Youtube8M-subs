00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.290
 the smallest is gongs 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.630
 ah I work in a company where I 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:43.330
 I'm a revolver pilot. 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:48.040
 I am 37 years old and would get the 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:51.460
 buy a a scooter right from the dafra 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.400
 reliability that I have for it 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.500
 agility for the economy, what I 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.650
 I can carry it on the banks. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:05.019
 put a chest where even carry the 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:08.790
 cell phone in a compartment is tight 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.790
 where it will not damage my anything 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.000
 well the biggest advantage was in the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:25.220
 economy with the other spent monthly 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:31.310
 on average a band of 400 reais with this 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:33.970
 hence I like $ 100 the absurd economy 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.740
 I saw many videos on youtube internet 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.570
 mainly speaking of the pros and 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.380
 cons of listening to the cityclass and did 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.520
 compared to Honda and other brands and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.520
 Dafra stood out 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 it has larger wheels than the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.980
 that competitors is very little too 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.740
 positive 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:05.360
 the size of the bike or standard color 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:15.290
 makes it possible to place some accessories 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:20.810
 it 's all I have of 100% 80% eu 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:23.959
 I listen to the speed and to the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.360
 so I can load 80% into it or 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.110
 of what I need to do in my day to 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.270
 day I do with listening but the detail 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.860
 sculpture 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.500
 I feel even more protected 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:42.650
 because the legs do not the leg gets too much 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.709
 exposed but relatively between different 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.440
 lots of driver driver but up 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.060
 by the size of the personal bike to 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.230
 about a little more a little more 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.340
 passage 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.280
 the channel so it is very comfortable 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.060
 the seat is very comfortable to the wide block 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.080
 and soft and that brake really good 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.629
 Fantastic 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.739
 throwing some of the front force 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.599
 rear and vice versa then it is a brake 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.400
 very good the brake to 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.640
 drive on two wheels or talking 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.959
 majority of the competition is not 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.959
 has a disc brake on the rear wheel 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.180
 uai 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.180
 I 'm not going 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150
 O
