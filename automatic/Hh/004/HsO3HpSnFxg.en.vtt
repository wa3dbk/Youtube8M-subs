detail about how to identify them so if
you're<00:00:37.680> unsure<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.340> suggest<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.120> do<00:00:39.239> some

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
you're unsure I suggest that you do some

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.930 
you're unsure I suggest that you do some
research<00:00:40.160> now<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> common<00:00:41.670> misconception

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
research now a common misconception

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.119 
research now a common misconception
about<00:00:42.540> wild<00:00:42.989> apples<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.860> they<00:00:44.010> are

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
about wild apples is that they are

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.810 
about wild apples is that they are
bitter<00:00:44.399> tasting<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.320> therefore<00:00:46.320> unpalatable

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
bitter tasting and therefore unpalatable

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.729 
bitter tasting and therefore unpalatable
but<00:00:47.820> wild<00:00:48.300> apples<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:49.440> sweet<00:00:49.590> as

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
but wild apples can be just as sweet as

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.860 
but wild apples can be just as sweet as
an<00:00:50.160> apple<00:00:50.520> from<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:50.850> local<00:00:51.059> grocery<00:00:51.600> store

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
an apple from your local grocery store

an apple from your local grocery store
now<00:00:52.860> crab<00:00:53.190> apples<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.000> other<00:00:54.149> hand<00:00:54.420> are

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
now crab apples on the other hand are

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.260 
now crab apples on the other hand are
known<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.260> being<00:00:55.320> bitter<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.149> can

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
known for being bitter but as you can

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090 
known for being bitter but as you can
see<00:00:57.329> they<00:00:57.989> look<00:00:58.170> quite<00:00:58.469> different<00:00:58.649> from<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
see they look quite different from a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.049 
see they look quite different from a
regular<00:00:59.250> while<00:00:59.699> Apple<00:01:00.980> anyway<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.190> found<00:01:02.910> a

other with red apples I shook the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.260 
other with red apples I shook the
branches<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.350> both<00:01:10.830> trees<00:01:11.159> causing<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.090> ripe

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
branches on both trees causing the ripe

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.149 
branches on both trees causing the ripe
apples<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.869> fall<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> ground<00:01:13.350> where<00:01:14.130> I

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
apples to fall to the ground where I

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.999 
apples to fall to the ground where I
collected<00:01:14.700> them<00:01:14.790> into<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> five-gallon<00:01:15.960> pail

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.130 

if<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.250> Apple<00:01:20.549> had<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> hole<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.509> threw<00:01:22.049> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
if the Apple had a hole in it I threw it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.570 
if the Apple had a hole in it I threw it
aside<00:01:22.640> if<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.060> apple<00:01:24.420> had<00:01:24.740> only<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.890> bruise<00:01:26.220> or

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
aside if the apple had only a bruise or

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
aside if the apple had only a bruise or
some<00:01:26.820> spots<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.630> kept<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
some spots on it I kept it because it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.789 
some spots on it I kept it because it
was<00:01:28.650> still<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> good<00:01:29.040> apple<00:01:29.430> i<00:01:30.590> rinsed<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> good

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
was still a good apple i rinsed the good

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.720 
was still a good apple i rinsed the good
apples<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.430> container<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.939> water

after<00:01:38.730> that<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.090> clean<00:01:39.360> my<00:01:39.540> axe<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:40.050> and<00:01:40.260> I<00:01:40.470> used

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
after that I clean my axe up and I used

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:55.609 
after that I clean my axe up and I used
it<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.160> mash<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.640> apples<00:01:42.090> into<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.510> mush

once<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.799> mash<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.220> apples<00:01:57.580> up<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:57.909> added<00:01:58.330> the

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
once I mash the apples up I added the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.210 
once I mash the apples up I added the
rest<00:01:58.659> of<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.900> apples<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.439> mixture<00:01:59.770> and<00:01:59.979> I

rest of the apples to the mixture and I

rest of the apples to the mixture and I
mash<00:02:00.460> them<00:02:00.729> in<00:02:00.909> as<00:02:01.090> well<00:02:01.860> now<00:02:02.860> since<00:02:03.580> I<00:02:03.759> don't

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
mash them in as well now since I don't

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.390 
mash them in as well now since I don't

I<00:02:15.069> took<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.340> block<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.760> wood<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.720> cut<00:02:16.959> it<00:02:16.989> I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
I took a block of wood and I cut it I

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.250 
I took a block of wood and I cut it I
cut<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.280> fit<00:02:18.760> perfectly<00:02:19.270> inside<00:02:19.569> my<00:02:19.989> five

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
cut it to fit perfectly inside my five

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.010 
cut it to fit perfectly inside my five
gallon<00:02:20.620> bin<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.670> cut<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:21.970> into<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.900> know

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
gallon bin and I cut it into a you know

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.059 
gallon bin and I cut it into a you know
a<00:02:23.290> bit<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.709> cork<00:02:23.950> shape<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:25.230> placed<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.410> garbage

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
a bit of a cork shape I placed a garbage

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.009 
a bit of a cork shape I placed a garbage
bag<00:02:27.280> over<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.880> pail<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.390> keep<00:02:28.569> dirt<00:02:28.810> from

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
bag over the pail to keep dirt from

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.759 
bag over the pail to keep dirt from
getting<00:02:29.080> into<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.160> apple<00:02:30.489> mash<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.769> next

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
getting into the apple mash and next

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:40.860 
getting into the apple mash and next
comes<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.100> cork<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.489> I<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:33.819> made<00:02:39.540> now<00:02:40.540> all

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
comes the cork that I just made now all

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.660 
comes the cork that I just made now all
that<00:02:41.019> is<00:02:41.080> needed<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.709> good<00:02:42.010> steady<00:02:42.400> weight

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
that is needed is a good steady weight

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.750 
that is needed is a good steady weight
to<00:02:42.910> press<00:02:43.180> down<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.019> cork<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.440> so<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.430> stood

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
to press down on the cork and so I stood

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.000 
to press down on the cork and so I stood
on<00:02:45.910> top<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.480> strongly<00:02:47.380> recommend<00:02:47.650> having

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
on top I strongly recommend having

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.250 
on top I strongly recommend having
something<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.760> hang<00:02:48.970> on<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.180> when<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:49.870> do<00:02:50.080> this

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
something to hang on to when you do this

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.949 
something to hang on to when you do this
because<00:02:50.500> well<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:52.120> pretty<00:02:52.299> easy<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.720> fall

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
because well it's pretty easy to fall

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:05.580 
because well it's pretty easy to fall
off<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:53.319> hurt<00:02:53.410> yourself

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.110 

after<00:03:06.590> I've<00:03:06.709> stomped<00:03:07.130> on<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.340> cork<00:03:07.640> for<00:03:07.910> about

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
after I've stomped on the cork for about

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.449 
after I've stomped on the cork for about
a<00:03:08.150> minute<00:03:08.510> or<00:03:08.569> so<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.560> was<00:03:09.739> time<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.010> drain<00:03:10.340> the

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
a minute or so it was time to drain the

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.390 
a minute or so it was time to drain the
juice<00:03:10.870> holding<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.959> cork<00:03:12.260> in<00:03:12.470> place<00:03:12.739> I<00:03:13.040> held

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
juice holding the cork in place I held

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.699 
juice holding the cork in place I held
the<00:03:13.520> bucket<00:03:13.849> upside<00:03:14.300> down<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.780> let<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.500> juice

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
the bucket upside down and let the juice

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.080 
the bucket upside down and let the juice
drain<00:03:16.069> into<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.430> pot<00:03:17.800> from<00:03:18.800> a<00:03:18.890> five-gallon<00:03:19.819> pail

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
drain into a pot from a five-gallon pail

drain into a pot from a five-gallon pail
of<00:03:20.780> apples<00:03:21.349> I<00:03:21.560> was<00:03:21.830> able<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.190> extract<00:03:22.610> one

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
of apples I was able to extract one

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.140 
of apples I was able to extract one
pitcher<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.750> juice<00:03:23.989> which<00:03:24.920> equaled<00:03:25.519> about<00:03:25.610> two

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
pitcher of juice which equaled about two

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.300 
pitcher of juice which equaled about two
and<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.420> half<00:03:26.599> liters

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
and a half liters

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.400 
and a half liters
now<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.370> mashed<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.849> second<00:03:29.239> batch<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.840> apples

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
now I mashed a second batch of apples

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.130 
now I mashed a second batch of apples
into<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.920> finer<00:03:31.310> mush<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:32.540> was<00:03:32.720> able<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:32.989> get

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
into a finer mush and I was able to get

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.170 
into a finer mush and I was able to get
about<00:03:33.349> three<00:03:33.769> liters<00:03:33.920> out<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.550> batch<00:03:34.790> I

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
about three liters out of that batch I

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.309 
about three liters out of that batch I
strained<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.269> juice<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.810> remove<00:03:39.080> any

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
strained the juice to remove any

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:46.750 
strained the juice to remove any
leftover<00:03:39.530> apple<00:03:40.220> chunks<00:03:45.130> then<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.430> put<00:03:46.670> the

leftover apple chunks then I put the

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.050 
leftover apple chunks then I put the
juice<00:03:47.030> onto<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.780> stove<00:03:48.049> as<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:49.280> can<00:03:49.400> see<00:03:49.610> here

the moment the juice comes to a boil

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.729 
the moment the juice comes to a boil
there's<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.910> thick<00:03:53.299> froth<00:03:53.690> that<00:03:54.080> forms<00:03:54.470> on<00:03:54.650> the
