00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.000
 welcome all motorists 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:13.170
 I think many owners of irbis ttr250 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.750
 faced with such problems as 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.050
 weak traction on bottoms and failure during a sharp 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.220
 opening the throttle me this is also not 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.250
 cost a party 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.650
 Well, I decided to try at least something 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.939
 do with this do not given trial and 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.180
 mistakes the first thing i have done is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.940
 adjusted the valve clearance now 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.899
 decided to completely disassemble clean 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.820
 blow the carburetor first thing to me 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.910
 I caught my eye when I disconnected it 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.489
 here's the air nozzle that's what's 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.219
 there was such a thin layer of dust 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.500
 fine fine dust see this faceted 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.289
 filter god all the same or sucks 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.770
 somewhere and stupidly passes dust through itself 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.850
 and not everything is delaying I donâ€™t see 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.110
 the future will have it too 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.110
 upgrade in some way 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:16.200
 considering that there are such tiny 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:20.189
 metering holes for example here at 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.869
 us idle is located i think even 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.780
 small particles are fatally easy for 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.780
 this system and can just score 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.430
 carburetor i already have that carburetor 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.100
 This option for 30 I have it 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.479
 fully disassembled assembled back washed 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.630
 all liquid vd-40 blew through the compressor 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.479
 As an experiment, I decided the needle 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.479
 raise it to the maximum raise the game 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.479
 as far as it allows 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.210
 risks because the candle to how it turned out 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:04.510
 me not 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:09.190
 like a candle like as a deposit enough 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:18.010
 as white as a mixture of poor y 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:20.530
 I'm coming here so that this dust is not 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.870
 hit the carburetor I decided to do 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.640
 so here is from the usual household dishes 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.070
 powerful sponge cut such a round 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.200
 sponge stuff 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.459
 I breathe well enough 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.350
 I think will not create any 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.890
 additional resistance and and put 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.890
 here here 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.459
 like that right before 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:05.269
 carburetor try to collect all that 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.680
 regards the carburetor now what 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.480
 concerns this inlet 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.549
 Chinese Krivorukov made so 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.799
 the hole here is this liner was 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.890
 offset from on the relatively hole 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.109
 the pipe itself but this problem was solved 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.349
 just file it here it all 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.659
 dragged also drove a file 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.370
 did here a chamfer were burrs 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:32.709
 because from this side also did 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.709
 chamfer removed burrs 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.730
 let's see now let's try 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:49.569
 put and get see how he 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:52.129
 will behave so I collected everything set 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:56.030
 the carburetor has its place normally 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.650
 sponge is also so cold mattress 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.319
 I did not want to start therefore 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.019
 I had to light it from the car 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.829
 battery 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.829
 by the way that is an incomprehensible problem 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.659
 cold student he does not want to indulge 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.840
 at least you pull this lever though you 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.699
 there closing this diffuser do not close 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.680
 no matter to him therefore I am specifically for 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.840
 such goals made such a conclusion directly 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.400
 from the battery specifically so that you can 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.930
 It was not removing Seats quickly 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.900
 light this car 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:31.460
 battery 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:34.630
 as soon as connected to it wound up with 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.630
 half a spear 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:05.400
 so after all the above 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:08.430
 I started to manipulate him but he worked 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:13.240
 refused because now was black 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.200
 overflowed in the end the needle had to be shifted 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.420
 at one risk 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:23.410
 up and from the idea with this sponge too 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.190
 I had to give up for now because 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.890
 amount this is the first time so leap chat 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.140
 respectively and there and squeezed the flap 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:36.930
 and the air in general stopped doing so 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:41.190
 that while this idea I will leave for later 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:44.490
 now I have screw quality twisted on 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:47.020
 twisted out a half turn 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.410
 at the same time now only examined 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.400
 she's a candle 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.400
 excellent brown 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.030
 those. if the throttle 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:30.800
 quite straight sharply open more than 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:32.900
 half of its course failure is 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.570
 perceptible, he just wants to stall if 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:41.720
 smoother jerk to do that basically 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:46.190
 failure no another important point for 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.930
 he started to kick me up with a kickstarter 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.800
 before that I have it with a kickstarter 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.800
 didn't start 

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:26.819
 but it's on a warm engine see how 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.819
 he will behave in the cold
