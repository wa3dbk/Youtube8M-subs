other task reaction grazing material

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.399 
other task reaction grazing material
with<00:01:12.039> a<00:01:12.070> pummel<00:01:12.490> of<00:01:12.549> your<00:01:12.670> knife<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.960> course<00:01:14.289> we

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
with a pummel of your knife of course we

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.410 
with a pummel of your knife of course we
have<00:01:14.530> three<00:01:14.710> Halep<00:01:14.979> in<00:01:15.159> there<00:01:15.369> three<00:01:16.240> hollow

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
have three Halep in there three hollow

have three Halep in there three hollow
pins<00:01:16.749> in<00:01:16.899> this<00:01:17.049> version<00:01:17.259> so<00:01:17.619> i<00:01:17.649> guess<00:01:17.950> if<00:01:18.100> you

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
pins in this version so i guess if you

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.980 
pins in this version so i guess if you
wanted<00:01:18.399> to<00:01:18.490> lash<00:01:18.700> on<00:01:18.999> to<00:01:19.179> something<00:01:19.539> that

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
wanted to lash on to something that

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.080 
wanted to lash on to something that
would<00:01:20.200> be<00:01:20.320> possible<00:01:20.920> in<00:01:21.100> regards<00:01:21.819> to<00:01:21.909> making

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
would be possible in regards to making

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.489 
would be possible in regards to making
some<00:01:22.299> kind<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.479> spear<00:01:22.899> if<00:01:22.990> you<00:01:23.079> had<00:01:23.200> some<00:01:23.380> kind

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:23.499 
some kind of spear if you had some kind

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:25.679 
some kind of spear if you had some kind
of<00:01:23.590> shelf<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:24.039> put<00:01:24.069> this<00:01:24.310> on<00:01:24.520> because<00:01:25.420> the

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
of shelf to put this on because the

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.929 
of shelf to put this on because the
roundness<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.469> the<00:01:26.920> handle<00:01:27.399> would<00:01:27.520> probably

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
roundness of the handle would probably

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.849 
roundness of the handle would probably
be<00:01:28.390> a<00:01:28.420> little<00:01:28.539> bit<00:01:28.749> difficult<00:01:28.899> in<00:01:29.380> regards<00:01:29.799> to

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
be a little bit difficult in regards to

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.620 
be a little bit difficult in regards to
that<00:01:29.890> but<00:01:30.189> if<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.429> needed<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.819> could<00:01:30.939> but

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
that but if you needed to you could but

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.639 
that but if you needed to you could but
i<00:01:31.659> don't<00:01:31.840> know<00:01:31.899> if<00:01:31.960> i<00:01:32.140> would<00:01:32.200> do<00:01:32.350> that<00:01:32.469> with<00:01:32.619> my

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
i don't know if i would do that with my

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.349 
i don't know if i would do that with my
primary<00:01:33.159> tool<00:01:33.340> unless<00:01:33.579> absolutely<00:01:33.789> necessary

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
primary tool unless absolutely necessary

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.709 
primary tool unless absolutely necessary
but<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.920> in<00:01:36.219> all<00:01:36.310> I<00:01:36.490> was<00:01:36.700> amazed<00:01:37.509> with<00:01:37.659> the

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
but all in all I was amazed with the

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.149 
but all in all I was amazed with the
performance<00:01:38.200> of<00:01:38.229> this<00:01:38.350> this<00:01:38.649> thing<00:01:38.859> was<00:01:39.009> a

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
performance of this this thing was a

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.340 
performance of this this thing was a
slicer<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:39.939> was<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.479> know<00:01:40.569> just<00:01:40.600> going

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350

that<00:02:29.290> was<00:02:29.410> one<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.710> impressive<00:02:30.070> things

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
that was one of the impressive things

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.160 
that was one of the impressive things
with<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.760> there<00:02:31.240> wasn't<00:02:31.630> much<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.990> learning

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
with it there wasn't much of a learning

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.960 
with it there wasn't much of a learning
curve<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.740> all<00:02:32.890> than<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.700> do<00:02:33.760> think

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
curve of all than that and I do think

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.790 
curve of all than that and I do think
that's<00:02:34.150> kind<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.360> important<00:02:34.930> not<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.350> say<00:02:35.590> that

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
that's kind of important not to say that

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.260 
that's kind of important not to say that
you<00:02:35.980> know<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.160> can't<00:02:36.460> take<00:02:36.730> another<00:02:36.850> blade

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.420 
you know you can't take another blade
and<00:02:37.450> learn<00:02:37.660> how<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.870> use<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.200> well<00:02:38.770> but<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.100> think

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
and learn how to use it well but I think

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.070 
and learn how to use it well but I think
it<00:02:39.520> speaks<00:02:39.850> volumes<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.540> fact<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.960> can

bush crafting type situation so this I
think<00:04:46.550> would<00:04:47.000> be<00:04:47.150> very<00:04:47.330> well<00:04:47.600> as<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:47.840> survival

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
important in a survival situation if I'm

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.440 
important in a survival situation if I'm
fighting<00:05:10.610> with<00:05:10.639> my<00:05:10.820> tool<00:05:11.060> because<00:05:11.240> it's<00:05:11.360> not

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
fighting with my tool because it's not

as effective as something like this well

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.710 
as effective as something like this well
then<00:05:13.460> I<00:05:13.520> think<00:05:13.550> that<00:05:13.790> constitutes<00:05:14.000> a<00:05:14.330> problem

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
then I think that constitutes a problem

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.180 
then I think that constitutes a problem
you<00:05:14.810> know<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.169> this<00:05:15.470> needs<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:15.770> be<00:05:15.860> able<00:05:16.100> to

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
you know it this needs to be able to

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.909 
you know it this needs to be able to
picked<00:05:16.430> up<00:05:16.610> easily<00:05:16.880> use<00:05:17.389> to<00:05:18.020> complete<00:05:18.620> all<00:05:18.889> the

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
picked up easily use to complete all the

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.500 
picked up easily use to complete all the
task<00:05:19.280> at<00:05:19.490> hand<00:05:19.520> so<00:05:19.970> that's<00:05:20.120> something<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.450> think

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
task at hand so that's something I think

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.719 
task at hand so that's something I think
a<00:05:20.660> lot<00:05:20.690> of<00:05:20.840> people<00:05:21.040> overlook<00:05:22.040> in<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:22.460> survival

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
a lot of people overlook in a survival

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.270 
a lot of people overlook in a survival
item<00:05:23.300> because<00:05:23.930> of<00:05:24.080> course<00:05:24.289> you<00:05:24.740> know<00:05:24.889> when<00:05:25.160> it

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
item because of course you know when it

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.980 
item because of course you know when it
comes<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:25.669> survival<00:05:26.300> in<00:05:26.330> general<00:05:26.690> it's<00:05:26.810> all

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
comes to survival in general it's all

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.570 
comes to survival in general it's all
about<00:05:27.260> the<00:05:27.380> economy<00:05:27.830> of<00:05:27.860> resources<00:05:28.370> you<00:05:28.460> don't

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
about the economy of resources you don't

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.740 
about the economy of resources you don't
want<00:05:28.700> to<00:05:28.760> burn<00:05:28.910> up<00:05:29.000> your<00:05:29.060> calories<00:05:29.539> you<00:05:29.630> want
