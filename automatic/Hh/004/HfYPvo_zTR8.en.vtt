00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.250
 1000 ps I have visitors again today 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.380
 Patrick has left me for a short time 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.880
 I'm soliciting the novelties alone 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.580
 to introduce hjc 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.379
 Last year we had the success 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.070
 our new flip-up helmet presents in the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.680
 year before 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.869
 because rather forgiven and now we have 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.939
 two new experiences speaks a lot 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.890
 impact-resistant helmets with low weight 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.900
 the drv ickx and the faz we have with 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.320
 The sparkle technology of the machine is one 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.480
 Motor large creates the requirements 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.790
 the modern off-road use requires 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.280
 Of course I contest the lower one 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.260
 Shelving bar is for our whole 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.070
 neck protection systems no matter what their name is 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.260
 we would like to have the rv iks 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.870
 also seen on a lot of ventilation 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.309
 we see here in the upper shell 2 below 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.699
 the one for then bends one more 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.519
 in the set of 3 sets of ventilation in front 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.869
 some ventilation where we have this one 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.610
 can dismantle with a 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.400
 we only need screwdrivers for this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.619
 then lift off the plastic part 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.600
 a cross-foam seen something 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.890
 screw down and clean that 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.390
 neither screen is 100% unbreakable 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.340
 demonstrates the short and the weight 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.030
 will be in europe version 1100 grams 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.700
 be 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.640
 and yes, fix becomes the top hellmann 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.680
 tell the offroad and you in the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.119
 Price clearly below 400 euro 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.880
 be located 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.810
 the second case we will bring 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.150
 it in jet helmet 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.090
 we have that here, of course, will 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.009
 under 1000 grams own with long in the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.439
 visor the visor is unbreakable and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.079
 Impact-resistant thereby we spare ourselves here 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.479
 to set up in a child's hoop 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.890
 Well, we have the same head here 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.890
 Ventilations as with the whole 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.460
 experience the ventilation of 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.560
 machine and collmex lining like it all 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.700

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.459
 comfortable helmet 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.379
 he also has a noise here 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.920
 for people who like it a bit 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.020
 quieter both are helmets from 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.420

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.800
 add to the color palette and we 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.430
 have it in the middle segment a very 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.150
 beautiful new polycarbonate helmet the animal 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.519
 17 417 will be distinguished by this 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.530
 that in his category he is one of the 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.440
 will represent the lightest helmets 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.390
 we have a very dynamic form here 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.050
 with strong head vents and 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.050
 vents 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.049
 of course we have here again 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.230
 our sun dazzles us in the three 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.450
 we can adjust the levels here 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.280
 rest or fully open 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.280
 depending on how you like it 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.170
 in this category also put only times 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.640

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.590
 we have a double here 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.420
 if you want to go with the in foil 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.109

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.019
 which is 100% fog free on the helmet 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:14.389
 taken out of the faz rail here 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:20.060
 the mechanism and the visor 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:21.829
 to be able to in the lowest box and 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.129
 then here the full three recording with 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.079
 The sunshade we said as 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.639
 can set multi-level 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.409
 We also have a graphic design 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.530
 that you 17 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:36.590
 with mirror so far the visor can be 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.900
 at the 417 liberal hcl one very easily 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.120
 I can still show you that 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.159
 and here would be even a device and 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.930
 the margin between slice better 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.930
 to be able to adjust and if necessary 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.669
 even for people leaving 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.530
 would like to mount this on the plane 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.329
 okay as she did not change before 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.299
 has addressed so one works 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.940
 do it completely for her then have 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.620
 here you put a lever on and 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.419
 can already with a finger the visor 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.819
 undress and right in the opposite direction 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.709
 happens again assemble to 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.239
 But I have to take two hands with it 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.870
 one on the other side not shut 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.870
