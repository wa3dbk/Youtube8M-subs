00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
at the picture his suit so apparently

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.800 
at the picture his suit so apparently
you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.489> customize<00:01:05.970> your<00:01:06.119> suit<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.510> year

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
pick between different types of suits so

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.950

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.719 
thing that was mentioned in the dress
and<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> actual<00:01:40.740> message<00:01:41.130> was<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.640> be

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
drafted number one overall for the first

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.550 
drafted number one overall for the first
time<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.659> i<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> be

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
time so i think that is going to be

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
time so i think that is going to be
amazing<00:01:46.829> there's<00:01:47.250> gonna<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.000> variety

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
amazing there's gonna be just a variety

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.899 
amazing there's gonna be just a variety
of<00:01:48.479> different<00:01:48.740> my<00:01:49.740> players<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.399> i<00:01:50.460> think<00:01:50.729> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
of different my players and i think it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.399 
of different my players and i think it
could<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.210> based<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> specific

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
could be based on like a specific

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.960 
could be based on like a specific
position<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.189> may<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.399> drafted<00:01:53.880> number
