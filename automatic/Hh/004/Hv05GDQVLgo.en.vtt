 quad-core cpu their cores with a 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.840

 version 4.2 point 2 is a highlight 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.269
 that you have the smartphone with you

 the on and off switch was at 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.870
 xperia ultra processed better than the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:50.980
 xperia z and does not ask that far anymore 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:52.720
 also because the display is so big 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.940
 it's in upright mode for one
