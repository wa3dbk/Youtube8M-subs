00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
the perfect hack so to change these out

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.030 
the perfect hack so to change these out
it's<00:00:06.629> pretty<00:00:06.870> simple<00:00:07.319> you'll<00:00:07.710> need<00:00:07.919> your

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
it's pretty simple you'll need your

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.759 
it's pretty simple you'll need your
thread<00:00:08.340> your<00:00:08.880> scissors<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:10.230> needle<00:00:10.260> that's

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
thread your scissors and a needle that's

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.230 
thread your scissors and a needle that's
appropriate<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.460> your<00:00:11.580> thread<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.030> if<00:00:12.120> you're

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
appropriate to your thread so if you're

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.820 
appropriate to your thread so if you're
using<00:00:12.420> embroidery<00:00:13.080> floss<00:00:13.230> or<00:00:13.559> something

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
using embroidery floss or something

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.790 
using embroidery floss or something
larger<00:00:14.250> use<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> larger<00:00:15.120> needle<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.590> first

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
larger use a larger needle and the first

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.670 
larger use a larger needle and the first
step<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.609> cut<00:00:18.270> your<00:00:18.980> doubles<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.220> half<00:00:21.680> that

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
step is to cut your doubles in half that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.189 
step is to cut your doubles in half that
obviously<00:00:23.279> creates<00:00:23.850> your<00:00:24.000> singles<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.810> only

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
obviously creates your singles the only

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.810 
obviously creates your singles the only
thing<00:00:25.439> that's<00:00:25.590> making<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.070> not<00:00:26.519> really<00:00:26.670> a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
thing that's making this not really a

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.480 
thing that's making this not really a
single<00:00:27.240> ender<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.019> telltale<00:00:28.710> loop<00:00:29.130> that

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
single ender is that telltale loop that

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.220 
single ender is that telltale loop that
all<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.880> singles<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.109> that

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
all the singles have and that so that

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.410 
all the singles have and that so that
they<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.619> installed<00:00:31.890> right<00:00:32.640> now<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.180> one

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
they can be installed right now this one

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.940 
they can be installed right now this one
wouldn't<00:00:33.930> be<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> good<00:00:34.260> candidate<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:34.739> our

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
wouldn't be a good candidate for our

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.100 
wouldn't be a good candidate for our
installation<00:00:35.579> unless<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:36.000> were<00:00:36.120> doing<00:00:36.420> like

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
installation unless you were doing like

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.380 
installation unless you were doing like
a<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.290> large<00:00:37.890> fusionbond<00:00:38.700> or<00:00:39.059> something

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
a really large fusionbond or something

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.010 
a really large fusionbond or something
so<00:00:39.930> we're<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.320> take<00:00:40.530> our<00:00:40.770> needle<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:42.020> go

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
so we're going to take our needle and go

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.389 
so we're going to take our needle and go
down<00:00:43.469> into<00:00:44.399> our<00:00:44.760> dreadlock<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.950> idea<00:00:47.280> is

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
down into our dreadlock and the idea is

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.650 
down into our dreadlock and the idea is
that<00:00:47.489> we're<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.660> try<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.289> pick<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:49.680> some

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
that we're going to try to pick up some

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.740 
that we're going to try to pick up some
of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> back<00:00:51.960> combed<00:00:52.410> hair<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.449> try<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> give

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
of the back combed hair and try to give

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.200 
of the back combed hair and try to give
it<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.930> good<00:00:55.079> anchor<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.280> I'm<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.789> leaving<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it a good anchor so I'm just leaving the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.389 
it a good anchor so I'm just leaving the
tail<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.660> my<00:00:57.809> thread<00:00:58.079> out<00:00:58.320> because<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:00:59.280> going

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
tail of my thread out because I'm going

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.119 
tail of my thread out because I'm going
to<00:00:59.489> come<00:00:59.670> back<00:00:59.850> through<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.829> put<00:01:01.829> my<00:01:01.949> needle

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
to come back through and put my needle

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.479 
to come back through and put my needle
through<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.730> loop<00:01:03.650> okay<00:01:04.650> that's<00:01:05.220> really

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
through that loop okay that's really

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.980 
through that loop okay that's really
just<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.850> anchor<00:01:06.360> our<00:01:07.490> thread<00:01:08.490> into<00:01:09.000> our<00:01:09.780> dread

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
just to anchor our thread into our dread

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.929 
just to anchor our thread into our dread
now<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.439> it's<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.770> anchored<00:01:11.280> after<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> first

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
now if it's not anchored after the first

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.609 
now if it's not anchored after the first
pass<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.540> pull<00:01:12.780> too<00:01:12.930> hard<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
pass don't pull too hard just do it a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.890 
pass don't pull too hard just do it a
few<00:01:13.799> more<00:01:13.979> times<00:01:14.250> until<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.729> get<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.150> really

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
few more times until you get a really

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.499 
few more times until you get a really
good<00:01:16.080> secure<00:01:16.619> spot<00:01:16.950> now<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.700> next<00:01:18.299> thing<00:01:18.450> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
good secure spot now the next thing that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.240 
good secure spot now the next thing that
we're<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.560> we're<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> try

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
we're going to do is we're going to try

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.840 
we're going to do is we're going to try
to<00:01:20.509> give<00:01:21.509> our<00:01:21.960> top<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.159> cut<00:01:23.460> some

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
to give our top that we cut some

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.249 
to give our top that we cut some
stability<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:25.229> we're<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:25.979> back<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
stability so we're going to go back and

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.950 
stability so we're going to go back and
forth<00:01:29.990> through<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:32.390> each<00:01:33.390> time<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.810> go

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
forth through it and each time we go

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.330 
forth through it and each time we go
back<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.320> forth<00:01:34.530> we're<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.189> go

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
back and forth we're just going to go

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.340 
back and forth we're just going to go
around<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.299> little<00:01:36.540> bit<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:37.020> hair<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.570> we're

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
around a little bit more hair and we're

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.530 
around a little bit more hair and we're
trying<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.920> pull<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.549> all<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.030> these<00:01:42.180> pieces

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
trying to pull in all of these pieces

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.050 
trying to pull in all of these pieces
that<00:01:42.750> are<00:01:42.960> kind<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.320> hanging<00:01:43.710> off<00:01:43.829> here<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that are kind of hanging off here and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.920 
that are kind of hanging off here and
make<00:01:45.299> those<00:01:45.570> part<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.649> new<00:01:46.950> more<00:01:47.520> stable<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
make those part of a new more stable to

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.319 
make those part of a new more stable to
those<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.229> come<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.490> side<00:01:53.759> grabbing<00:01:54.240> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
those in come to this side grabbing a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.890 
those in come to this side grabbing a
little<00:01:54.450> more

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.840 

so<00:01:58.440> you'll<00:01:58.560> kind<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:58.890> ended<00:01:59.190> up<00:01:59.250> with<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.610> like

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
so you'll kind of ended up with it like

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.240 
so you'll kind of ended up with it like
found<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.660> you<00:02:00.930> could<00:02:01.170> always<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.860> wrap

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
found you you could always you know wrap

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.920 
found you you could always you know wrap
around<00:02:02.550> like<00:02:02.760> this<00:02:02.940> and<00:02:03.210> stitch<00:02:03.480> around<00:02:03.750> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
around like this and stitch around that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.200 
around like this and stitch around that
a<00:02:03.960> few<00:02:04.230> times<00:02:04.260> I<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:05.040> particularly<00:02:05.940> think

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
a few times I don't particularly think

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.620 
a few times I don't particularly think
that<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.660> makes<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:08.000> stable<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.510> you

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
that that makes it as stable but you

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.610 
that that makes it as stable but you
could<00:02:11.210> keep<00:02:12.210> pulling<00:02:12.720> at<00:02:12.930> your<00:02:13.050> sides<00:02:13.320> in

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
could keep pulling at your sides in

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.970 
could keep pulling at your sides in
until<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.610> something<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.110> secure

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
until you have something that is secure

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.850 
until you have something that is secure
and<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.400> your<00:02:18.270> piece<00:02:18.570> looks<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.710> has

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
and that your piece looks like it has

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.400 
and that your piece looks like it has
kind<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.310> binding<00:02:21.270> around<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.780> top<00:02:24.410> once

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
kind of binding around the top once

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.310 
kind of binding around the top once
you've<00:02:25.590> got<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.900> then<00:02:27.900> you're<00:02:28.080> ready<00:02:28.260> to

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
you've got that then you're ready to

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.060 
you've got that then you're ready to
create<00:02:28.650> your<00:02:28.740> loop<00:02:29.480> okay<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:30.540> from<00:02:31.020> here<00:02:31.470> what

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
create your loop okay so from here what

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.020 
create your loop okay so from here what
we're<00:02:32.190> going<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.430> do<00:02:32.520> is<00:02:32.640> I'm<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:32.760> going<00:02:33.000> to

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
we're going to do is I'm just going to

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.140 
we're going to do is I'm just going to
put<00:02:33.210> my<00:02:33.330> finger<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.930> top<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:35.100> I'm<00:02:35.820> going<00:02:35.970> to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
put my finger on top and I'm going to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.560 
put my finger on top and I'm going to
sew<00:02:36.420> around<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:38.090> stability<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.120> I've<00:02:39.330> put

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
sew around the stability that I've put

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.480 
sew around the stability that I've put
in<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.670> I'm<00:02:41.790> almost<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.480> sew<00:02:42.750> my<00:02:42.990> finger

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
in and I'm almost going to sew my finger

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.370 
in and I'm almost going to sew my finger
to<00:02:44.490> my<00:02:44.820> dread<00:02:46.220> not<00:02:47.220> actually<00:02:48.000> but<00:02:48.660> it's<00:02:49.170> going

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
to my dread not actually but it's going

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.140 
to my dread not actually but it's going
to<00:02:49.470> create<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:49.830> little<00:02:50.100> loop<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.550> top<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:51.000> it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
to create a little loop on top of it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.890 
to create a little loop on top of it
that<00:02:51.510> we're<00:02:51.660> going<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.020> use<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:56.690> pushing<00:02:57.690> my

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
that we're going to use so pushing my

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:06.380 
that we're going to use so pushing my
needle<00:02:58.200> below<00:02:58.710> my<00:02:59.310> stitches<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:06.209> want

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
needle below my stitches and you want

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.240 
needle below my stitches and you want
this<00:03:06.600> loop<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.170> be<00:03:07.850> fairly<00:03:08.850> thick<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:10.860> you

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
this loop to be fairly thick so that you

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.850 
this loop to be fairly thick so that you
have<00:03:11.520> some<00:03:12.480> stability<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.470> only<00:03:13.650> go

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
have some stability to it if you only go

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.229 
have some stability to it if you only go
through<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> few<00:03:14.730> passes<00:03:15.209> then<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:17.850> might<00:03:18.090> be

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
through a few passes then it might be

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.699 
through a few passes then it might be
too<00:03:18.780> weak<00:03:19.730> okay<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.420> I'm<00:03:21.780> just<00:03:21.840> going<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.260> slide

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
too weak okay so I'm just going to slide

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.830 
too weak okay so I'm just going to slide
my<00:03:22.739> finger<00:03:23.250> out<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:24.239> I'm<00:03:24.420> going<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.570> show<00:03:24.780> you

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
my finger out and I'm going to show you

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.890 
my finger out and I'm going to show you
we<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.560> loop<00:03:25.860> here<00:03:26.100> now<00:03:26.300> okay<00:03:27.300> now<00:03:27.630> I'm

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
we have this loop here now okay now I'm

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.110 
we have this loop here now okay now I'm
going<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.140> take<00:03:28.380> my<00:03:28.590> needle<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:29.700> I'm<00:03:29.880> going<00:03:29.910> to

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
going to take my needle and I'm going to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.340 
going to take my needle and I'm going to
go<00:03:30.270> around

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.250 

what<00:03:39.350> I'm<00:03:39.440> doing<00:03:39.800> is<00:03:39.950> I'm<00:03:40.100> actually<00:03:40.130> kind<00:03:41.060> of

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
what I'm doing is I'm actually kind of

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.960 
what I'm doing is I'm actually kind of
binding<00:03:42.260> all<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.620> these<00:03:42.830> threads<00:03:43.990> together<00:03:45.970> so

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
binding all of these threads together so

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.490 
binding all of these threads together so
that<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.750> loop<00:03:48.050> doesn't<00:03:49.690> fall<00:03:50.690> into<00:03:50.990> you

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
that that loop doesn't fall into you

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.650 
that that loop doesn't fall into you
know<00:03:51.620> several<00:03:52.430> different<00:03:52.580> strands<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.480> kind

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
know several different strands it kind

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.100 
know several different strands it kind
of<00:03:53.720> folds<00:03:54.020> together<00:03:54.470> as<00:03:54.830> a<00:03:55.130> single<00:03:56.110> strand

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
of folds together as a single strand

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.760 
of folds together as a single strand
loop<00:03:57.440> instead<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:57.950> kind<00:03:58.340> of<00:03:58.400> playing<00:03:58.910> apart

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
loop instead of kind of playing apart

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.410 
loop instead of kind of playing apart
okay<00:04:00.770> so<00:04:01.430> now<00:04:01.670> we<00:04:01.730> have<00:04:02.090> our<00:04:02.840> loop<00:04:04.270> we're<00:04:05.270> just

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
okay so now we have our loop we're just

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.190 
okay so now we have our loop we're just
going<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:06.190> go<00:04:07.190> back<00:04:07.520> in<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:08.030> out<00:04:08.240> of<00:04:08.540> this<00:04:08.870> top

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
going to go back in and out of this top

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:22.720 
going to go back in and out of this top
fiber<00:04:20.770> and<00:04:21.770> we're<00:04:21.860> just<00:04:22.040> doing<00:04:22.160> this<00:04:22.430> we're

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
fiber and we're just doing this we're

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:30.150 
fiber and we're just doing this we're
securing<00:04:23.330> our<00:04:23.600> loop<00:04:24.610> into<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.700> top<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:29.720> also

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
securing our loop into the top and also

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.480 
securing our loop into the top and also
strengthening<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:31.970> entire<00:04:32.450> piece<00:04:36.490> just

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
strengthening that entire piece just

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.850 
strengthening that entire piece just
checking<00:04:38.210> my<00:04:38.360> loop<00:04:38.600> making<00:04:39.200> sure<00:04:39.440> that<00:04:39.650> all<00:04:39.830> my

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
checking my loop making sure that all my

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.770 
checking my loop making sure that all my
strands<00:04:40.430> are<00:04:41.080> nice<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.350> together<00:04:42.910> okay<00:04:43.910> next

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
strands are nice and together okay next

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.300 
strands are nice and together okay next
thing<00:04:44.960> I'm<00:04:45.080> going<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.230> do<00:04:45.380> is<00:04:45.680> I'm<00:04:45.920> just<00:04:45.980> going

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
thing I'm going to do is I'm just going

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.740 
thing I'm going to do is I'm just going
to<00:04:46.370> tie<00:04:46.640> it<00:04:46.700> off<00:04:48.970> so<00:04:49.970> I'm<00:04:50.180> going<00:04:50.360> to<00:04:50.390> put<00:04:50.630> my

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
to tie it off so I'm going to put my

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.850 
to tie it off so I'm going to put my
needle<00:04:50.810> through<00:04:51.410> the<00:04:51.470> dread<00:04:53.470> going<00:04:54.470> in<00:04:54.590> on<00:04:54.680> the

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
needle through the dread going in on the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.290 
needle through the dread going in on the
side<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:55.490> you're<00:04:55.580> just<00:04:55.670> gonna<00:04:55.910> give<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.120> a

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
side and you're just gonna give it a

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.670 
side and you're just gonna give it a
simple<00:04:56.690> knot<00:04:58.630> I'm<00:04:59.630> not<00:04:59.780> actually<00:04:59.960> tying<00:05:00.440> my

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
simple knot I'm not actually tying my

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.880 
simple knot I'm not actually tying my
loop<00:05:00.920> down

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.250 

hey<00:05:07.890> why<00:05:08.400> not<00:05:08.610> I'm<00:05:09.240> going<00:05:09.420> to<00:05:09.510> cut<00:05:09.750> my<00:05:09.900> needle

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
hey why not I'm going to cut my needle

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.130 
hey why not I'm going to cut my needle
away<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:12.360> I'm<00:05:12.450> going<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:12.660> do<00:05:12.750> a<00:05:12.780> couple<00:05:13.110> of

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
away and I'm going to do a couple of

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:27.290 
away and I'm going to do a couple of
simple<00:05:13.350> ties<00:05:25.370> okay<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.610> that<00:05:26.790> creates<00:05:27.210> our

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
simple ties okay and that creates our

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.690 
simple ties okay and that creates our
loop<00:05:27.630> at<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.050> top<00:05:28.290> now<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.070> next<00:05:29.460> thing<00:05:29.580> I'm

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
loop at the top now the next thing I'm

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.430 
loop at the top now the next thing I'm
going<00:05:29.790> to<00:05:29.850> do<00:05:30.000> is<00:05:30.240> just<00:05:30.450> some<00:05:30.660> simple<00:05:31.050> surgery

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
going to do is just some simple surgery

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.260 
going to do is just some simple surgery
to<00:05:31.680> make<00:05:31.890> it<00:05:32.040> clean<00:05:33.470> so<00:05:34.470> I've<00:05:34.620> got<00:05:34.910> the<00:05:35.910> threads

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
to make it clean so I've got the threads

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.570 
to make it clean so I've got the threads
cut<00:05:36.570> away<00:05:36.780> I'm<00:05:37.230> gonna<00:05:37.410> move<00:05:37.560> this<00:05:37.830> loop<00:05:38.160> out<00:05:38.400> of

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
cut away I'm gonna move this loop out of

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.390 
cut away I'm gonna move this loop out of
the<00:05:38.640> way<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:39.810> I'm<00:05:40.470> just<00:05:40.680> going<00:05:40.830> to<00:05:40.860> clean<00:05:41.190> this

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
the way and I'm just going to clean this

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.570 
the way and I'm just going to clean this
up

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.340 

you<00:05:44.580> can<00:05:44.790> leave<00:05:44.970> yours<00:05:45.210> longer<00:05:45.630> if<00:05:45.750> you<00:05:45.870> want<00:05:46.110> I

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
you can leave yours longer if you want I

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.900 
you can leave yours longer if you want I
think<00:05:46.470> that<00:05:46.920> the<00:05:47.070> install<00:05:47.460> is<00:05:47.640> a<00:05:47.670> little

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
think that the install is a little

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.870 
think that the install is a little
cleaner<00:05:48.150> if<00:05:48.720> he's<00:05:48.930> gone<00:05:50.510> but<00:05:52.460> that<00:05:53.460> creates

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
cleaner if he's gone but that creates

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.240 
cleaner if he's gone but that creates
your<00:05:53.970> loop<00:05:54.300> for<00:05:54.540> installation<00:05:55.140> and<00:05:55.620> that<00:05:55.950> is

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
your loop for installation and that is

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.760 
your loop for installation and that is
