00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.870 
another cool thing that I love in the
80s<00:03:48.990> is<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.530> they<00:03:50.100> didn't<00:03:50.310> follow<00:03:50.490> the<00:03:50.700> rules

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
80s is that they didn't follow the rules

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.699 
80s is that they didn't follow the rules
which<00:03:51.300> is<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.510> kind<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:51.750> person<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.140> am<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.680> a

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
which is the kind of person I am so a

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:53.900 
which is the kind of person I am so a
lot<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.100> times<00:03:53.310> they<00:03:53.580> would<00:03:53.670> wear

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
lot of the times they would wear

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.060 
lot of the times they would wear
earrings<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.810> don't<00:03:55.080> match<00:03:55.290> or<00:03:55.620> even<00:03:55.650> just

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070
