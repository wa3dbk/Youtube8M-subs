is as an all road is a synergy of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.920 
is as an all road is a synergy of
different<00:00:56.810> cars<00:00:57.290> underneath<00:00:57.770> an<00:00:58.040> a5<00:00:59.030> gives<00:00:59.810> it

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
different cars underneath an a5 gives it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.110 
different cars underneath an a5 gives it
a<00:00:59.989> wider<00:01:00.200> track<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:00.860> allows<00:01:01.430> them<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.700> lift<00:01:01.970> it

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
a wider track and allows them to lift it

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.689 
a wider track and allows them to lift it
over<00:01:02.270> instead<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.780> inches<00:01:03.020> yeah<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:04.339> maybe

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
over instead of inches yeah so maybe

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.850 
over instead of inches yeah so maybe
it's<00:01:05.480> a<00:01:05.630> little<00:01:05.690> bit<00:01:05.840> taller<00:01:06.110> of<00:01:06.410> an<00:01:06.500> a4<00:01:06.620> Avant

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
it's a little bit taller of an a4 Avant

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.090 
it's a little bit taller of an a4 Avant
but<00:01:07.250> here<00:01:07.490> where<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:07.760> counts<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:08.240> exact<00:01:08.660> same

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
but here where it counts it's exact same

same<00:02:20.110> size<00:02:20.190> only<00:02:21.190> minor<00:02:21.400> differences<00:02:21.670> but

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
same size only minor differences but

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.370 
same size only minor differences but
here's<00:02:22.240> something<00:02:22.480> interesting<00:02:22.690> directly

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
here's something interesting directly

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.280 
here's something interesting directly
from<00:02:23.470> Audi<00:02:23.710> they<00:02:24.370> say<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:25.270> car<00:02:25.570> gets<00:02:26.050> better

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
from Audi they say this car gets better

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.380 
from Audi they say this car gets better
mileage<00:02:26.560> yet<00:02:27.160> it's<00:02:27.400> faster<00:02:27.880> than<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.240> old

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
mileage yet it's faster than the old

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.810 
mileage yet it's faster than the old
Allroad<00:02:28.959> that's<00:02:29.410> really<00:02:29.890> cool<00:02:30.160> because<00:02:30.340> this

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
Allroad that's really cool because this

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.510 
Allroad that's really cool because this
one<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.330> based<00:02:31.660> on<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.260> a4<00:02:32.500> Avant<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.400> that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
one is based on the a4 Avant and that

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.300 
one is based on the a4 Avant and that
one<00:02:33.670> was<00:02:33.850> based<00:02:34.060> on<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.360> a6<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:36.100> like<00:02:36.220> the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
one was based on the a6 it's like the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.580 
one was based on the a6 it's like the
previous<00:02:36.640> Allroad<00:02:37.300> there's<00:02:38.230> not<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.410> lot<00:02:38.560> of

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
previous Allroad there's not a lot of

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.990 
previous Allroad there's not a lot of
space<00:02:38.800> back<00:02:39.040> here<00:02:39.070> this<00:02:39.520> is<00:02:39.700> where<00:02:39.850> Nathan

drives this is where my feet go and then

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.860 
drives this is where my feet go and then
ed<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:48.550> know<00:02:48.580> what<00:02:48.850> his<00:02:48.970> legs<00:02:49.239> are<00:02:49.450> considered

ed you know what his legs are considered

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.110 
ed you know what his legs are considered
too<00:02:49.959> long<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.290> most<00:02:50.470> humans<00:02:50.800> look<00:02:51.520> it's<00:02:51.850> a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
too long for most humans look it's a

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.850 
too long for most humans look it's a
small<00:02:52.360> cart<00:02:52.660> don't<00:02:53.110> think<00:02:53.320> it's<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.500> big<00:02:53.650> cart
