00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.660
 friends in this episode we will prepare 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.880
 very easy crepes with 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.579
 radicchio and above all casatella 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.110
 Treviso of Opi and it is for this 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.600
 recipe we will need a speedy 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.500
 chef in which we will put 3 eggs of 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.809
 about 250 ml milk is a pinch of salt 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.580
 at this point thanks to speedy chef 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.620
 we mix everything at this point 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.129
 add the sifted flour with 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.040
 measure and spread tupper we mix again 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.769
 cosmi of chef and prepare the pan it 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.750
 heat on the fire and put a thread 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.970
 of oil in it then we hope 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.729
 with the help of a silicone brush 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.740
 and we eliminate excess fat with a 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.260
 small piece of absorbent paper 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.869
 then with a tekna ladle 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.330
 tupperware we're going to pour inside 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.090
 of the pan chef the dough of ours 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.100
 crepes let cook from both 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.650
 sides for about two minutes and when 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.110
 we are golden and crisp the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.299
 put to rest in a large dish 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.840
 service then we can put them from 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.149
 part 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.429
 now all we have to do is prepare 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.880
 the dough is very simple 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.590
 now we cut the radicchio into small pieces 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.749
 quite large 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.140
 we coarsely chop it up as a chef 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:42.640
 and we cook it together with the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.939
 chopped onion in turbo short 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.819
 tupperware then a very fine onion 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.340
 in a casserole chef does not put oil 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.920
 because in this case it is a recipe is 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.289
 already very fat and therefore not 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.389
 I would like to weigh it down too much we cover with 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.520
 a lid after putting a drop 

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:04.149
 of water and a pinch of salt and leave 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.159
 cook for 10 minutes and then remove 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.289
 the radicchio cooked by the casserole lo 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.539
 we put in picture again and 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.150
 add the casatella trevigiana dop 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.160
 of eyes designation of origin 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.020
 protected is a perfect cheese for 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.240
 this type of preparation because one 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.870
 time he felt the heat will melt 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.520
 creating a magical cream really after 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.490
 having put the casatella in big pieces 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.740
 we chop well with quick chef e 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.600
 we are preparing to fill our own 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.090
 crepes 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.130
 we put the crepes one by one on a 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.250
 we cover the tupperware cutting board 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.310
 completely with the compound of 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.060
 stuffing and then fold them in three a 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.250
 we place the handkerchief in an ultrà pro 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.400
 average and in this case I have 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.830
 prepare 5 the appropriate quantity for one 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.610
 average family of four or three 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.400
 people 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.810
 the average Italian family after which a 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.670
 this point we take some bechamel 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.710
 which we prepared with the pitcher 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.650
 micro plus in microwave oven 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.160
 mixing milk, salt and walnut flour 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.680
 Muscat and clé we sprinkle just with 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.050
 our very soft béchamel is 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.200
 important that it be liquid otherwise 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.200
 oven would dry out too we cook or 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.950
 in conventional oven in static oven 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.350
 at 180 degrees for 20 minutes or as I have 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.360
 made myself in the microwave for 8 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.180
 minutes at 750 watts 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.940
 after which we can extract ours 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.990
 ultrà between from the oven and plate the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.440
 our shoulders 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.440
 enjoy your meal
