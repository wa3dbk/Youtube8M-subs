exposed a little bit and know what was

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:20.010 
exposed a little bit and know what was
exposed<00:06:18.460> was<00:06:18.880> the<00:06:19.120> fact<00:06:19.360> that<00:06:19.539> he<00:06:19.750> looked

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
exposed was the fact that he looked

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.050 
exposed was the fact that he looked
beyond<00:06:20.380> the<00:06:20.560> game<00:06:20.860> and<00:06:21.160> is<00:06:21.280> pretty<00:06:21.520> sure<00:06:21.789> I

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
beyond the game and is pretty sure I

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.850 
beyond the game and is pretty sure I
love<00:06:22.539> how<00:06:22.690> he<00:06:22.870> was<00:06:22.960> a<00:06:22.990> really<00:06:23.289> nice<00:06:23.530> kid<00:06:23.830> I

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
love how he was a really nice kid I

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.080 
love how he was a really nice kid I
loved<00:06:24.099> his<00:06:24.250> families<00:06:24.610> are<00:06:24.699> really<00:06:24.940> nice

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
loved his families are really nice

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.909 
loved his families are really nice
people<00:06:25.150> I<00:06:25.690> think<00:06:26.050> he<00:06:26.110> took<00:06:26.259> his<00:06:26.320> eye<00:06:26.560> off<00:06:26.590> the

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
people I think he took his eye off the

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.060 
people I think he took his eye off the
ball<00:06:27.099> he<00:06:27.340> was<00:06:27.460> looking<00:06:27.699> beyond<00:06:28.710> Peterson<00:06:29.710> and

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
ball he was looking beyond Peterson and

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.129 
ball he was looking beyond Peterson and
I<00:06:30.280> think<00:06:30.520> Peterson<00:06:31.060> for<00:06:31.539> the<00:06:31.720> right<00:06:31.900> fight

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
I think Peterson for the right fight

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:33.930 
I think Peterson for the right fight
tactically<00:06:32.740> was<00:06:32.889> very<00:06:33.099> close<00:06:33.400> and<00:06:33.669> I<00:06:33.759> thought

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
tactically was very close and I thought

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.610 
tactically was very close and I thought
with<00:06:34.419> the<00:06:34.479> judgment<00:06:35.139> against<00:06:35.380> him<00:06:35.530> for

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
with the judgment against him for

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.189 
with the judgment against him for
hitting<00:06:35.919> low<00:06:36.099> or<00:06:36.400> pushing<00:06:37.090> the<00:06:37.180> guy<00:06:37.300> down<00:06:37.570> that

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
hitting low or pushing the guy down that

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.320 
hitting low or pushing the guy down that
he<00:06:38.680> definitely<00:06:39.130> didn't<00:06:39.610> deserve<00:06:39.910> to<00:06:39.940> win<00:06:40.090> the

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
he definitely didn't deserve to win the

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.510 
he definitely didn't deserve to win the
fight<00:06:40.509> they<00:06:40.960> made<00:06:41.139> a<00:06:41.260> big<00:06:41.289> hullabaloo<00:06:41.740> averted

when the guys are too long in the tooth
as<00:07:21.560> it<00:07:21.710> were<00:07:21.860> there's<00:07:22.610> every<00:07:22.880> chance<00:07:22.910> that

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.270 
as it were there's every chance that

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.530 
as it were there's every chance that
will<00:07:23.479> happen<00:07:23.510> this<00:07:23.960> year<00:07:24.020> I<00:07:24.530> think<00:07:25.010> and<00:07:25.669> that

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.540 
will happen this year I think and that

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.719 
will happen this year I think and that
you've<00:07:27.020> got<00:07:27.229> to<00:07:27.350> make<00:07:27.470> me<00:07:27.860> whether<00:07:28.130> a<00:07:28.250> favorite

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:28.729 
you've got to make me whether a favorite

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:30.550 
you've got to make me whether a favorite
what<00:07:29.150> styles<00:07:29.600> make<00:07:29.750> fights<00:07:29.810> and<00:07:30.229> I<00:07:30.290> think

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 
what styles make fights and I think

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.100 
what styles make fights and I think
Pacquiao<00:07:30.830> has<00:07:31.250> the<00:07:31.669> style<00:07:31.910> to<00:07:32.540> make<00:07:32.720> it<00:07:32.840> a<00:07:32.900> very

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.110 
Pacquiao has the style to make it a very

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.290 
Pacquiao has the style to make it a very
close<00:07:33.470> fight<00:07:33.710> if<00:07:34.010> not<00:07:34.250> winning<00:07:34.850> the<00:07:34.970> fight<00:07:35.150> the

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300 
close fight if not winning the fight the

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.240 
close fight if not winning the fight the
lots<00:07:35.479> of<00:07:35.630> bold<00:07:35.810> prediction<00:07:36.350> me<00:07:36.889> whether<00:07:37.160> it's
