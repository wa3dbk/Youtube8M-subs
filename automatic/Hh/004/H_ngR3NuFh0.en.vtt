00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.580 

like<00:00:37.380> these<00:00:37.710> things<00:00:38.700> which<00:00:38.940> are<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.590> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
like these things which are on the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.740 
like these things which are on the
structure<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:42.840> bridge<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:44.750> metal

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
structure of the bridge of the metal

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.410 
structure of the bridge of the metal
part<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.200> bridge<00:00:46.550> obviously<00:00:47.550> Victorian<00:00:48.149> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
part of the bridge obviously Victorian I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.119 
part of the bridge obviously Victorian I
would<00:00:48.930> think<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:50.010> also<00:00:50.340> we've<00:00:50.670> got<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.390> signs

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
would think and also we've got the signs

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.380 
would think and also we've got the signs
I'm<00:00:53.129> gonna<00:00:53.309> put<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.820> because<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.210> might

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
I'm gonna put this in because I might

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.910 
I'm gonna put this in because I might
use<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.110> painting<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> rather

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
use this in the painting it's a rather

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.779 
use this in the painting it's a rather
than<00:00:56.160> saying<00:00:56.460> note<00:00:58.910> of<00:00:59.910> three<00:01:00.539> red<00:01:01.789> circles

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
than saying note of three red circles

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.770 
than saying note of three red circles
there<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.809> I'm<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:05.299> I'm<00:01:06.299> sure<00:01:06.360> we'll

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
there which I'm going to I'm sure we'll

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.500 
there which I'm going to I'm sure we'll
be<00:01:06.930> able<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.140> use<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.619> painting<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:09.479> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
be able to use in the painting so I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.450 
be able to use in the painting so I
started<00:01:10.380> drawing<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:12.720> seemed<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.460> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
started drawing here and it seemed to to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.410 
started drawing here and it seemed to to
lead<00:01:15.360> me<00:01:15.540> into<00:01:16.369> several<00:01:17.369> drawings<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.390> I

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
lead me into several drawings and then I

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.330 
lead me into several drawings and then I
was<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:18.990> two<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.470> three<00:01:19.500> weeks<00:01:19.680> actually

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
was here for two to three weeks actually

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.330 
was here for two to three weeks actually
drawing<00:01:20.610> down<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.409> from<00:01:22.409> both<00:01:22.590> sides<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
drawing down here from both sides and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.429 
drawing down here from both sides and
from<00:01:24.119> over<00:01:24.390> there<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.049> from<00:01:25.290> different

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
from over there and from different

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.240 
from over there and from different
positions<00:01:26.960> once<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.110> had<00:01:28.320> decided<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.890> I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
positions once I had decided that I

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.569 
positions once I had decided that I
wanted<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> paint<00:01:30.479> London<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.380> had<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.430> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
wanted to paint London I had to think of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.969 
wanted to paint London I had to think of
where<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.880> begin<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:34.200> was<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> bead

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
where this begin it was at the bead

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.760 
where this begin it was at the bead
leading<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.060> Queen's<00:01:36.299> Jubilee<00:01:36.770> thing

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
leading up to the Queen's Jubilee thing

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
leading up to the Queen's Jubilee thing
and<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.280> river<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.729> getting<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.240> bit<00:01:39.360> of

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and that the river was getting a bit of

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.170 
and that the river was getting a bit of
attention<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.990> thought<00:01:40.200> well<00:01:40.759> let's<00:01:41.759> start<00:01:42.060> at

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
attention I thought well let's start at

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.780 
attention I thought well let's start at
the<00:01:42.270> river<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> got<00:01:43.500> off<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> bus<00:01:44.310> at<00:01:44.490> London

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the river so I got off the bus at London

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.240 
the river so I got off the bus at London
Bridge<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.840> began<00:01:46.170> drawing<00:01:46.439> immediately

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
Bridge and I began drawing immediately

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.249 
Bridge and I began drawing immediately
from<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.820> side<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.270> river<00:01:48.509> looking

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
from the side of the river looking

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.880 
across to Billingsgate marker all
buildings<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.350> market<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.640> Lloyds<00:01:54.030> building

buildings get market the Lloyds building

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.880 
buildings get market the Lloyds building
then<00:01:55.890> moved<00:01:56.189> along<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.670> river<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.890> HMS

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
across Tower Bridge up the other side I

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.910 
across Tower Bridge up the other side I
just<00:02:04.259> kind<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:06.270> daily<00:02:06.600> location<00:02:07.369> drawing

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.449 

you<00:02:11.490> actually<00:02:11.849> get<00:02:12.180> more<00:02:12.209> information<00:02:12.780> down

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
you actually get more information down

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.280 
you actually get more information down
than<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.610> need<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.690> extract

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
than you need and then you can extract

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.530 
than you need and then you can extract
from<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.910> know<00:02:18.030> with<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.360> power

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
from it and you know with the power

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.620 
from it and you know with the power
station<00:02:19.190> you're<00:02:20.190> dealing<00:02:20.640> with<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.090> whole<00:02:21.180> lot

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
station you're dealing with a whole lot

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.030 
station you're dealing with a whole lot
of<00:02:21.660> things<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.140> mean<00:02:22.260> it's<00:02:22.380> question<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:22.800> an

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
of things I mean it's question like an

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.210 
of things I mean it's question like an
iconic<00:02:23.550> structure<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:25.560> wanted<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.040> do

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
iconic structure and I wanted to do

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.440 
iconic structure and I wanted to do
something<00:02:26.520> with<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.790> as<00:02:26.910> well<00:02:27.090> because<00:02:27.420> I

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
something with that as well because I

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.340 
something with that as well because I
think<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.780> contributed<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.709> rest<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.670> the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
think it contributed to the rest of the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:52.910 
think it contributed to the rest of the

some adjustment here because I feel this
is<00:03:10.840> degree<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.680> begin<00:03:12.430> by<00:03:12.930> getting<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.020> drawing

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
is degree I begin by getting the drawing

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.280 
is degree I begin by getting the drawing
onto<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.100> canvas<00:03:15.520> that<00:03:15.730> gives<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.870> basic

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
onto the canvas that gives you the basic

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.220 
onto the canvas that gives you the basic
structure

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
structure

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.130 
structure
the<00:03:19.860> proportion<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.460> this<00:03:20.610> drawing<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.330> as<00:03:22.020> you

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
the proportion of this drawing is as you

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.730 
the proportion of this drawing is as you
see<00:03:22.380> is<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.650> sort<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.040> long<00:03:23.310> landscape

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
see is a sort of long landscape

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.740 
see is a sort of long landscape
proportion<00:03:25.740> but<00:03:26.010> I've<00:03:26.459> changed<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:27.420> the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
proportion but I've changed it on the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.199 
proportion but I've changed it on the
I've<00:03:28.590> changed<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:29.069> long<00:03:29.400> format<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.180> a

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
I've changed this long format to a

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.270 
I've changed this long format to a
square<00:03:30.510> format<00:03:31.020> because<00:03:31.319> I<00:03:31.440> felt<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.800> needed

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
square format because I felt it needed

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.740 
square format because I felt it needed
another<00:03:34.130> section<00:03:35.130> down<00:03:35.340> below<00:03:35.580> here<00:03:36.150> because

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
another section down below here because

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.750 
another section down below here because
I<00:03:36.840> wanted<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.170> develop<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:38.040> foreground

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
I wanted to develop the foreground

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.510 
I wanted to develop the foreground
it<00:03:39.209> was<00:03:39.360> interesting<00:03:40.100> in<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.250> actual

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
it was interesting in the actual

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.310 
it was interesting in the actual
location<00:03:42.410> and<00:03:43.410> I've<00:03:43.620> been<00:03:43.800> trying<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.220> retain

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
location and I've been trying to retain

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.559 
location and I've been trying to retain
this<00:03:46.320> interest<00:03:47.010> in<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:48.000> heap<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.300> sand

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
this interest in this is a heap of sand

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.690 
this interest in this is a heap of sand
here<00:03:48.959> but<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.290> there's<00:03:49.830> something<00:03:50.069> about<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
here but it there's something about the

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.370 
here but it there's something about the
shape<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.390> triangular<00:03:51.840> shape<00:03:52.050> of<00:03:52.200> that

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
shape of the triangular shape of that

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.760 
shape of the triangular shape of that
and<00:03:52.560> these<00:03:52.670> shapes<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:55.080> buildings<00:03:55.500> here

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
and these shapes of the buildings here

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.430 
and these shapes of the buildings here
which<00:03:56.060> kind<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.209> struck<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.630> chord<00:03:58.019> with<00:03:58.080> me<00:03:58.230> and

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
which kind of struck a chord with me and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.270 
which kind of struck a chord with me and
I<00:03:58.470> thought<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.800> might<00:03:58.980> be<00:03:59.070> quite

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
I thought that might be quite

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.430 
I thought that might be quite
interesting<00:03:59.310> very<00:04:00.300> industrial<00:04:01.019> kind<00:04:01.260> of

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
interesting very industrial kind of

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:19.430 
interesting very industrial kind of
landscape<00:04:02.070> as<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.640> were<00:04:17.930> this<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.140> group<00:04:19.410> of

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
landscape as it were this is a group of

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.560 
landscape as it were this is a group of
large<00:04:19.799> canvases<00:04:20.459> because<00:04:20.669> I<00:04:20.760> felt<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.269> couldn't

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
large canvases because I felt I couldn't

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.290 
large canvases because I felt I couldn't
paint<00:04:22.200> these<00:04:22.530> things<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.040> small<00:04:23.400> scale<00:04:23.760> it's

situations of spatial things normally my
work<00:04:44.940> is<00:04:45.350> looking<00:04:46.350> at<00:04:46.560> things<00:04:46.740> fairly<00:04:46.979> close

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
work is looking at things fairly close

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.560 
work is looking at things fairly close
up<00:04:47.630> these<00:04:48.630> are<00:04:48.900> vistas<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.790> River<00:04:50.790> you<00:04:51.330> know<00:04:51.450> of

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.100 
up these are vistas of River you know of
looking<00:04:51.960> up<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.200> river<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:54.300> that<00:04:54.870> was<00:04:55.080> a

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
looking up the river and that was a

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.950 
looking up the river and that was a
problem<00:04:55.440> for<00:04:55.740> me<00:04:55.890> so<00:04:56.340> I've<00:04:56.490> had<00:04:56.729> to<00:04:56.760> evolve<00:04:57.150> for

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
problem for me so I've had to evolve for

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.580 
problem for me so I've had to evolve for
myself

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
myself

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.130 
myself
a<00:04:58.620> kind<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:58.979> language<00:04:59.660> for<00:05:00.660> this<00:05:00.780> group<00:05:00.990> of

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
a kind of language for this group of

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.850 
a kind of language for this group of
