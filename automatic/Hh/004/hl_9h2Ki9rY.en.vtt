 t 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.630
 hi everyone knows how to capture a life 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.010
 who is talking to you I hope you go 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.360
 well anyway for me it's okay 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.700
 super so today we find ourselves 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.529
 on my iphone 4 white and i'll get you 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.240
 present two applications the first 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.189
 is called top chrono and it's a web 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.480
 app and the second is called to that 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.369
 board she is available in the app 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.230
 store for free so these two 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.760
 applications you allow yourself to have 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.510
 apps from the app store 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.830
 free 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.199
 I will show you that I had 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.360
 really not bad including this one which is 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.059
 installed here it's tweetbot which costs 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
 I do not know how much but it's enough 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.340
 expensive 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.720
 so here I managed to get full 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.370
 of applications I'm going to show you the 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.250
 are not all installed on my on 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.510
 my iphone but they allowed me 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.160
 to have paid apps from 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.140
 the app store so the first is called 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.450
 dÃ´ng thap chrono so you go go 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.370

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.140
 and when you go to register and 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.329
 well you they will ask you a code 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.460
 and this code it is displayed right now on 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.170

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.560
 well you already have points in advance 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.240
 since me here you see that g6950 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.220
 points so these are points that you 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.410
 will trade account amazon cards from 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.000
 apps from the app store or other I 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.470
 will show you that right after and the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.300
 operation is really very simple 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.100
 you will have to download these 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.600
 applications that scroll so it's 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.360
 free apps from the app store 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.729
 for example this one that was right here 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.840
 you will earn 150 points you see it 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.520
 here at the top left 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.440
 well if you download it you 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.179
 report 150 points so I'm going to 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.429
 to do here we will click on I 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.319
 download the application and that we 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.640
 automatically redirects to the app 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.690
 store and so here is once we are 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.459
 in the app store you go the 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.050
 so download me they will not me 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.869
 ask for a code since I already have it 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.910
 downloaded with other apps and 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.569
 we'll be right after 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.770
 download this app there 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.020
 and so here is once the application 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.910
 and download you have to open it and 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.830
 stay indoors for 30 seconds 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.270
 so it'll be that every time soon 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.619
 we're going to have to win points he's going 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.280
 have to stay thirty seconds in 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.380
 application 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.209
 I'm going to click the ok button you 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.190
 can of course uninstall it by 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.780
 so here you go for a walk in 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.400
 the app me i'm going to stay thirty 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.560
 seconds in it we'll end up just 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.180
 after and so here's once you 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.219
 have been in the app for thirty 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.950
 seconds you can go back in safari 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.500
 you update them your date page 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.720

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.140
 in the top right and once it's 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.190
 does your points will arrive roughly in 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.170
 24 hours I know it's pretty slow 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.340
 for this application there and in 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.870
 waiting you can always do 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.460
 those who are not intoxicated 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.020
 of applications so there are those that are 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.600
 targeted know is that I already did 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.770
 and I still have some left you see if this 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.810
 that they can still bring them 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.790
 a lot of points so here we will go 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.690
 now choose our gift so he 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.430
 there really are a lot 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.720
 there are a lot of applications that are 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.550
 normally pay for the app store 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.130
 we can withdraw against 900 points 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.110
 you see here when we go down more 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.000
 down there are still plenty of others and 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.489
 you can also have good ones 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.239
 Amazon's purchase of xbox cards 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.880
 itunes cards 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.220
 again to have your 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.790
 free applications of the games of the cases 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.160
 what helmets beats ipad mini 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.630
 a xbox one and even an iphone 5 is this 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.980
 so you really have to have a lot of 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.920
 points you see there it's still 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.540
 500 1000 points for this iphone 5s and 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.670
 know that it really works for you 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.100
 receive there in you go in my 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.880
 account and you enter your information 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.920
 personal 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.180
 so that's why do not forget that when you 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.320
 you must enter the code 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.269
 to have extra points 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.370
 so the coach I'll give it to you again 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.049
 once on your screen and now 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.700
 we go to the second application that's 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.070
 the one that brought me the most is the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.870
 more profitable I find it this cover 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.760
 available in the app store for free 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.560
 and you see my number of points 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.700
 awarded up I'll get you all from 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.010
 following you show all the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.200
 applications that I was able to remove in 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.209
 my earnings you will see all these 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.040
 applications there well I have them 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.820
 downloaded normally the are paying 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:01.620
 you see that I used 10.20 30 26 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:04.620
 70 10 10 12 and you see that when the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.930
 button and in pink here to get and 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.060
 well you download the application so 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.549
 well on these points we have them in 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.290
 responding to polls and I saw that 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.150
 this morning they pulled out three and 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.859
 during the holidays do not hesitate to 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.570
 see every day they come out pretty much 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.229
 close to 3 so that roughly corresponds to 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.570
 30 points 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.250
 it's really huge so there I go 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.110
 do it first so when it's red 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.030
 like that we have already done so 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.670
 all this I've already done that it's a 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.590
 little 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.450
 about at the three months that I'm 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.460
 on this app there and I was able 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.090
 really remove a lot of applications 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.160
 on the app store 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.670
 so this is for example this application 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.530
 there we will have to click on start and 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.450
 we click on download and we will 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.260
 have to be on the app again 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.260
 store to download 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.660
 and so here we go now 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.250
 click on free installed for 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.810
 install this app me i you 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.490

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.340
 this application there we find ourselves so 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.990
 right after and so here's once he 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.760
 is installed you're going to click on the 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.590
 open button and you still go one 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.240
 once stayed in for 30 seconds 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.920
 so I'll find you right after 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.440
 once I have passed thirty 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.910
 seconds in this application here here 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.160
 ask you certain things I 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.640
 refuses and after 30 seconds 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.080
 we find ourselves so here I am since 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.690
 thirty seconds in this application 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.180
 there we will now return to our 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.220
 haskovo application required vigilante and 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.630
 you see that our survey is validated 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.060
 we will click on reply to the survey 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.560
 you see that I have eight points we note 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.420
 the application and you click on 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.540
 answer the survey and the points you 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.340
 increase you see 1 point so I 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.810
 will still make one for you 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.460

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.830
 our application so I'm going to do 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.690
 again this one and I you 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.690
 found once I download them 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.760
 here you see now that I had 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.020
 an additional point I validated the 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.730
 second poll I have left 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.710
 unavailable i'm going to do it right 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.170
 after and we will now go get 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.640

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.440

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.230
 to lower the applications 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.750
 so all those there you can 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.700
 withdraw after having to have everything 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.620

 directly our application 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.370
 so there are some applications that we 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.740
 can get directly if not others 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.630
 will be distributed after 48 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.630
 hours I know I waited for a 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:41.630
 time long enough for the dabbing 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.940

 wait for the page to appear and we will 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.960
 use our code to use 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.180
 the application we see you we have a 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.920
 code that's the license code of
