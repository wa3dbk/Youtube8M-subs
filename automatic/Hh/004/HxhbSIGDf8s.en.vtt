greetings today we will be testing this

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.970 
greetings today we will be testing this
armor<00:00:04.200> which<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.990> chainmail<00:00:06.990> it's<00:00:07.440> not<00:00:07.680> done

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
armor which is chainmail it's not done

yet

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.070

but<00:00:08.580> it's<00:00:08.910> done<00:00:09.150> enough<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.660> can<00:00:09.809> actually

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
but it's done enough that I can actually

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.310 
but it's done enough that I can actually
test<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.500> it's<00:00:11.309> an<00:00:11.880> 8<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.450> 1<00:00:12.750> weave<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:14.040> 16<00:00:14.730> gauge

I'm<00:00:22.949> not<00:00:23.130> sure<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> outer<00:00:23.789> diameter<00:00:24.000> is

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.580 

my<00:01:17.700> arrow<00:01:17.939> will<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.929> fired<00:01:19.200> from<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:20.460> bow

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.289 

which<00:01:25.590> gives<00:01:25.829> its<00:01:25.950> ink<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.340> significant<00:01:27.060> amount

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
which gives its ink a significant amount

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:56.830 
which gives its ink a significant amount
of<00:01:27.359> power<00:01:28.609> so<00:01:29.630> let's<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.869> testing<00:01:54.110> all<00:01:55.110> right

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
of power so let's get testing all right

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.399 
of power so let's get testing all right
three<00:01:57.890> two<00:01:58.969> one<00:01:59.969> oh<00:02:01.310> we<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.429> penetration<00:02:03.409> but

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
three two one oh we have penetration but

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.089 
three two one oh we have penetration but
it<00:02:04.560> didn't<00:02:05.009> stay<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:06.289> that's<00:02:07.289> a<00:02:07.379> very<00:02:07.679> small

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
it didn't stay in that's a very small

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.880 
it didn't stay in that's a very small
hole<00:02:08.429> only<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> few<00:02:09.299> of<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:10.289> Rings<00:02:10.560> are

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
hole only a few of the Rings are

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.750 
hole only a few of the Rings are
irreparably<00:02:11.340> mangled<00:02:12.650> most<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.920> them<00:02:14.129> I<00:02:14.160> think

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
irreparably mangled most of them I think

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.250 
irreparably mangled most of them I think
will<00:02:15.090> survive<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.690> I'll<00:02:15.750> be<00:02:15.840> able<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.019> fix

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
will survive and I'll be able to fix

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.770 
will survive and I'll be able to fix
this<00:02:16.349> with<00:02:16.650> relative<00:02:17.069> ease<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.540> good

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
this with relative ease that's a good

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.379 
this with relative ease that's a good
thing<00:02:19.220> cuz<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.459> don't<00:02:20.639> want<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.880> spend<00:02:21.120> ages

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:21.389 
thing cuz I don't want to spend ages

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:28.430 
thing cuz I don't want to spend ages
fixing<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:25.970> can<00:02:26.970> fit<00:02:27.269> my<00:02:27.810> thumb<00:02:28.139> through

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
fixing this I can fit my thumb through

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:37.660 
fixing this I can fit my thumb through
there<00:02:31.849> that's<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:35.209> might<00:02:36.260> might<00:02:37.260> kill

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
there that's that might might kill

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.330 
there that's that might might kill
probably<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:38.970> hurt<00:02:39.359> a<00:02:39.599> lot<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.010> didn't

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
probably just hurt a lot and it didn't

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.349 
probably just hurt a lot and it didn't
damage<00:02:41.639> the<00:02:41.970> tip<00:02:42.180> too<00:02:42.420> much<00:02:42.920> which<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.099> nice

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.400 

alright<00:02:48.560> now<00:02:50.389> shall<00:02:51.389> we<00:02:51.540> test<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.290> other

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
alright now shall we test the other

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.120 
alright now shall we test the other
girls<00:02:53.180> try<00:02:55.040> let's<00:02:56.040> try<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.700> one<00:02:57.540> again

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
girls try let's try this one again

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.640 
girls try let's try this one again
alright<00:02:59.130> then<00:02:59.430> I<00:03:00.019> prefer<00:03:01.019> not<00:03:01.169> to<00:03:01.230> shoot<00:03:01.440> with

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
alright then I prefer not to shoot with

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.379 
alright then I prefer not to shoot with
this<00:03:01.769> one<00:03:01.919> too<00:03:02.069> many<00:03:02.220> times<00:03:02.489> because<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.239> don't

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
this one too many times because I don't

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.890 
this one too many times because I don't
want<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.569> fix<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:03.900> much<00:03:05.540> let's<00:03:06.540> have

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
want to fix it that much let's have

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.000 
want to fix it that much let's have
another<00:03:07.079> go

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.240 

and<00:03:12.010> it's<00:03:12.129> flicking<00:03:12.459> he's<00:03:12.580> gonna<00:03:12.670> remind<00:03:13.000> you

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
and it's flicking he's gonna remind you

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:29.580 
and it's flicking he's gonna remind you
every<00:03:15.250> time<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.430> let<00:03:15.670> go<00:03:15.849> with<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.060> string<00:03:28.590> same

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
every time I let go with a string same

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.860 
every time I let go with a string same
basic<00:03:30.280> result<00:03:30.700> maybe<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.269> little<00:03:31.450> bit<00:03:31.569> smaller

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
basic result maybe a little bit smaller

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.559 
basic result maybe a little bit smaller
hole<00:03:32.140> here<00:03:34.920> let's<00:03:35.920> see<00:03:36.280> let's<00:03:37.060> get<00:03:37.239> some<00:03:37.480> of

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
hole here let's see let's get some of

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.339 
hole here let's see let's get some of
these<00:03:37.659> stead<00:03:38.109> rings<00:03:38.440> out<00:03:39.720> at<00:03:40.720> force<00:03:41.109> these

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
these stead rings out at force these

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.190 
these stead rings out at force these
guys<00:03:41.590> wide<00:03:41.920> open<00:03:42.280> that's<00:03:43.180> because<00:03:43.959> these

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
guys wide open that's because these

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.289 
guys wide open that's because these
rings<00:03:44.560> were<00:03:44.709> only<00:03:44.859> butted<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.549> not<00:03:45.700> riveted

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
rings were only butted and not riveted

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.229 
rings were only butted and not riveted
or<00:03:46.569> welded<00:03:47.470> if<00:03:47.709> this<00:03:48.579> had<00:03:48.730> been<00:03:48.760> riveted<00:03:49.000> or

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
or welded if this had been riveted or

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.670 
or welded if this had been riveted or
welded<00:03:49.659> I<00:03:49.870> don't<00:03:50.200> know<00:03:50.260> how<00:03:50.409> it<00:03:50.530> would<00:03:50.650> have

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
welded I don't know how it would have

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.890 
welded I don't know how it would have
held<00:03:50.889> up<00:03:51.040> against<00:03:51.310> these<00:03:51.780> probably<00:03:52.780> much

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
held up against these probably much

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.720 
held up against these probably much
better<00:03:53.250> because<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.370> would<00:03:54.459> have<00:03:54.519> had<00:03:54.639> to

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
better because it would have had to

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.839 
better because it would have had to
actually<00:03:54.819> break<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.569> metal<00:03:55.840> itself<00:03:56.730> which<00:03:57.730> it

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
actually break the metal itself which it

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.970 
actually break the metal itself which it
doesn't<00:03:58.120> seem<00:03:58.329> to<00:03:58.480> have<00:03:58.540> done<00:03:58.750> for<00:03:59.590> any<00:03:59.799> of

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
doesn't seem to have done for any of

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.369 
doesn't seem to have done for any of
these<00:04:00.659> now<00:04:01.659> let's<00:04:01.840> give<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:01.989> a<00:04:02.079> try<00:04:02.170> with<00:04:02.349> a

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
these now let's give it a try with a

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:13.290 
these now let's give it a try with a
smaller<00:04:02.680> bow<00:04:02.889> shall<00:04:03.129> we<00:04:03.250> all<00:04:04.060> right

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:21.360 

it's<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:13.870> pure<00:04:18.870> battle<00:04:19.870> hurt<00:04:20.290> but<00:04:20.680> we<00:04:20.920> looks

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
it's a pure battle hurt but we looks

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.500 
it's a pure battle hurt but we looks
like<00:04:21.850> we<00:04:22.030> have<00:04:22.210> zero<00:04:22.570> penetration<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:24.510> can't

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
like we have zero penetration I can't

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:51.120 
like we have zero penetration I can't
stick<00:04:25.840> anything<00:04:26.380> through<00:04:26.590> there<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:50.010> hit<00:04:51.010> the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
stick anything through there I hit the

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.080 
stick anything through there I hit the
stand<00:04:51.430> oh<00:04:52.920> but<00:04:53.920> I<00:04:53.950> saw<00:04:54.190> some<00:04:54.340> every<00:04:54.550> lady's

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
stand oh but I saw some every lady's

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.440 
stand oh but I saw some every lady's
over<00:04:55.330> here<00:04:56.430> damn<00:04:57.430> it<00:04:57.640> yeah<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.030> think<00:04:58.150> I'm

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
over here damn it yeah I think I'm

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.680 
over here damn it yeah I think I'm
pretty<00:04:58.600> little<00:04:58.870> home<00:04:59.490> this<00:05:00.490> is<00:05:00.760> actually<00:05:01.300> this

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
pretty little home this is actually this

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.390 
pretty little home this is actually this
part<00:05:02.080> under<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.470> armpits<00:05:02.830> is<00:05:02.980> a<00:05:03.010> different

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
part under the armpits is a different

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.000 
part under the armpits is a different
weave<00:05:03.520> it's<00:05:03.760> 6<00:05:04.030> in<00:05:04.180> 1<00:05:04.330> versus<00:05:04.750> 8<00:05:04.930> in<00:05:05.050> 1<00:05:05.230> because

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
weave it's 6 in 1 versus 8 in 1 because

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.670 
weave it's 6 in 1 versus 8 in 1 because
the<00:05:06.520> eight<00:05:06.670> in<00:05:06.820> one<00:05:06.850> is<00:05:07.300> very<00:05:07.870> strong<00:05:08.320> but

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
the eight in one is very strong but

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.650 
the eight in one is very strong but
doesn't<00:05:08.980> give<00:05:09.100> me<00:05:09.220> enough<00:05:09.880> flexibility<00:05:10.480> for

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
doesn't give me enough flexibility for

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.200 
doesn't give me enough flexibility for
the<00:05:10.720> joints<00:05:11.110> but<00:05:11.800> six<00:05:12.100> in<00:05:12.250> one<00:05:12.280> is<00:05:12.880> still

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
the joints but six in one is still

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.490 
the joints but six in one is still
decently<00:05:13.630> strong<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.140> gives<00:05:14.260> me<00:05:14.380> enough

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
decently strong and gives me enough

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:23.550 
decently strong and gives me enough
flexibility<00:05:15.070> it's<00:05:15.970> like<00:05:16.150> cloth<00:05:22.290> I'm<00:05:23.290> saying

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
flexibility it's like cloth I'm saying

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.370 
flexibility it's like cloth I'm saying
that<00:05:23.710> a<00:05:23.740> lot<00:05:23.800> today<00:05:24.690> well<00:05:25.690> let's<00:05:25.960> give<00:05:26.200> this
