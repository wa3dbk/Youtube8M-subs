00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.819
 the on the cup 2015 started for psv with a 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.130
 match against FC Barcelona 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.500
 beautiful poster and beautiful weather 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.150
 many spectators in the stands and those 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.570
 and eager to see the psv in the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.720
 opening phase filip rommens with the ball 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.570
 to the outside to Matthew Fred 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.189
 owner back to a th van der moot 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.050
 chooses position but he is not 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.050
 reaches corner for PSV 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.380
 this man makes forward captain 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.450
 a pijnenburg the stairs are from rommens de 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.130
 header thereof dani van der moot and such 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.350
 so the first big chance in this 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.910
 competition for the geert team 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.969
 brusselers then it's barca's turn 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.559
 this is striker by s but his shot is one 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.559
 simple prey for you not from us 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 rate very sloppy 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.199
 So Barcelona can take over the boss again 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 good 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.910
 peijnenburg you are completely wrong there 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.680
 great opportunity for barcelona and a zero 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.409
 is it then via caresse peres aiol and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.150
 that's a damper for psv sat 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.010
 nice in the match crisis that too 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.680
 good chance via dani van der moot true 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.070
 here there goes a lot of wrong rate with the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.820
 wrong pass Pijnenburg and miss the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.500
 a 0 for fc barcelona 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.720
 lift and competitor course carefully 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.060
 spectator at the and barcelona past 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.250
 And they see it for PSV in the second 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.200
 half goes completely wrong this is then 3 far 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.360
 it already had yellow 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.040
 look here are two and so must psv 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.439
 ten more 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.360
 the first card was what seems questionable 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.509
 crash this rightly 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.850
 so a red card for catan 3 far and 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.939
 what can psv than with 10 men 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.829
 it certainly turns on 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.570
 a corner kick of this ball deepens here 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.079
 all the way over the back line 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.060
 been 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.340
 Peijnenburg again forward the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.659
 corner kick is taken quickly and briefly and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.119
 well taken rommens 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.670
 well we are just about mean this was the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.759
 chance for psv 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.569
 to fight back in that match 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.659
 cabri he trainer of barcelona 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.069
 in the final phase he sees his men 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.950
 score again 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.900
 PSV attacks barcelona and comes 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.810
 at 2 0 and thus decides the match 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.709
 goal made by tai chi and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.019
 Barcelona 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.590
 it is wind this first match in the 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.870
 battle for the rotten can with 2 0 of psv 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.910
 Saturday new round for new opportunities 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.139
