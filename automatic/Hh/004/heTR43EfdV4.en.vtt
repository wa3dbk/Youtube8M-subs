00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
in Levi Stadium and I think that last

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060

year<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.540> were<00:01:54.570> riddled<00:01:55.290> with<00:01:55.500> complaints

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
year they were riddled with complaints

year they were riddled with complaints
about<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.820> way<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.090> stadium<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> field

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
about the way the stadium in the field

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
about the way the stadium in the field
was<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.469> put<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.040> much<00:01:59.189> into<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:01:59.759> sure
