00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
carries of their team but sneaky hasn't

really showed up and deft has I mean

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.170

both<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.590> these<00:01:34.829> ad<00:01:35.579> carries<00:01:35.909> aren't

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
particularly good in TV too but I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.810 
particularly good in TV too but I

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.960 
definitely think deft holds that
advantage<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.450> also<00:01:40.020> sneaky<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:41.040> really

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
advantage and also sneaky is just really

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.179 
advantage and also sneaky is just really
up<00:01:42.270> worst<00:01:43.079> version<00:01:43.500> than<00:01:43.619> deft<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.950> almost

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
up worst version than deft in almost

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.859 
up worst version than deft in almost
every<00:01:44.460> way<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:45.299> me<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.479> interesting<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
every way for me it's interesting to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.109 
every way for me it's interesting to
talk<00:01:45.960> about<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.259> ad<00:01:46.380> carry's<00:01:46.829> because<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.970> me

I'm<00:02:18.329> very<00:02:18.540> interested<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.109> how<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.409> is<00:02:19.500> going

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
I'm very interested in how this is going

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.470 
I'm very interested in how this is going
to<00:02:19.829> go<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.310> because<00:02:20.430> da<00:02:20.939> day<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.239> very

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
to go just because da day is a very

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.479 
to go just because da day is a very
conservative<00:02:21.840> lehner<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.560> high<00:02:22.920> kind<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.400> as

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
conservative lehner and high kind of as

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.339 
conservative lehner and high kind of as
a<00:02:23.519> weakness<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.969> the<00:02:24.060> laning<00:02:24.239> phase<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:25.200> we

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
a weakness in the laning phase so if we

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.259 
a weakness in the laning phase so if we
get<00:02:25.469> the<00:02:25.560> 2<00:02:25.709> V<00:02:25.859> 2<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.189> bot<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:26.579> we<00:02:26.760> get<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:26.969> 1v1

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
get the 2 V 2 in bot if we get the 1v1

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.789 
get the 2 V 2 in bot if we get the 1v1
in<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.569> mid<00:02:27.719> lane<00:02:27.930> then<00:02:28.379> we're<00:02:28.500> probably<00:02:28.620> just

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
in the mid lane then we're probably just

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.559 
in the mid lane then we're probably just
going<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.099> see<00:02:29.219> a<00:02:29.250> lot<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.459> farming<00:02:29.909> early<00:02:30.329> now

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
going to see a lot of farming early now

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.500 
going to see a lot of farming early now
I<00:02:30.840> think<00:02:31.709> that<00:02:32.040> there<00:02:32.609> is<00:02:32.730> an<00:02:32.849> advantage<00:02:33.150> here

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
I think that there is an advantage here

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.240 
I think that there is an advantage here
for<00:02:33.540> height<00:02:33.870> since<00:02:34.260> he<00:02:34.379> tends<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.650> split<00:02:35.040> push

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
for height since he tends to split push

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.250 
for height since he tends to split push
a<00:02:35.280> lot<00:02:35.519> more<00:02:35.760> than<00:02:36.090> dot<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.299> does<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.959> may

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
a lot more than dot I does and that may

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.670 
a lot more than dot I does and that may
be<00:02:37.290> what<00:02:37.859> allows<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:39.209> know<00:02:39.329> cloud9<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.530> do

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
be what allows you know cloud9 to to do

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.470 
be what allows you know cloud9 to to do
well<00:02:40.829> here<00:02:41.069> grandpa<00:02:41.519> one<00:02:41.700> final<00:02:42.090> full<00:02:42.329> we've

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
already side how difficult is this going

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:48.890 
already side how difficult is this going
to<00:02:47.579> be<00:02:47.700> for<00:02:47.849> them<00:02:47.909> in<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.120> matchup<00:02:48.419> well

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
to be for them in the matchup well

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.119 
to be for them in the matchup well
they've<00:02:49.200> had<00:02:49.319> time<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.680> look<00:02:49.799> over<00:02:49.950> the

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
they've had time to look over the

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.289 
they've had time to look over the
matches<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.609> see<00:02:50.730> what<00:02:50.849> they<00:02:50.970> did<00:02:51.030> wrong

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
matches and see what they did wrong

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.909

already<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:51.989> hopefully<00:02:52.319> they<00:02:52.409> learn<00:02:52.769> their

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
already so hopefully they learn their

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.110 
already so hopefully they learn their
lessons<00:02:53.250> but<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.489> definitely<00:02:53.639> definitely

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
lessons but it's definitely definitely

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.550 
lessons but it's definitely definitely

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.979 
they're gonna struggle along and with
that<00:03:02.189> what<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:02.549> your<00:03:02.700> prediction<00:03:02.939> fold<00:03:03.780> this

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
that what is your prediction fold this

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.170 
that what is your prediction fold this
series<00:03:04.409> and<00:03:04.590> why<00:03:04.919> I<00:03:05.219> think<00:03:05.609> both<00:03:05.760> teams<00:03:05.790> as

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
series and why I think both teams as

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.699 
series and why I think both teams as
Monty<00:03:06.480> pointed<00:03:06.750> out<00:03:06.840> are<00:03:06.930> very<00:03:07.079> similar<00:03:07.409> in

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
Monty pointed out are very similar in

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.470 
Monty pointed out are very similar in
that<00:03:07.799> regard<00:03:08.040> will<00:03:08.310> see<00:03:08.430> slow<00:03:08.669> games<00:03:08.909> but<00:03:09.450> I

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
that regard will see slow games but I

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.000 
that regard will see slow games but I
think<00:03:09.780> blue<00:03:10.139> will<00:03:10.260> take<00:03:10.409> it<00:03:10.530> three<00:03:10.709> two<00:03:10.799> one

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
think blue will take it three two one

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.830 
think blue will take it three two one
cloud<00:03:11.669> line<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.909> basically<00:03:12.239> just<00:03:12.359> an<00:03:12.480> inferior

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
cloud line is basically just an inferior

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.509 
cloud line is basically just an inferior
version<00:03:13.200> but<00:03:13.379> with<00:03:13.680> using<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.099> split<00:03:14.370> push

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
version but with using the split push

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.099 
version but with using the split push
that<00:03:14.639> Monty<00:03:14.939> highlighted<00:03:15.359> that's<00:03:15.750> one<00:03:15.989> way

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
that Monty highlighted that's one way

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.449 
that Monty highlighted that's one way
they<00:03:16.260> can<00:03:16.379> break<00:03:16.530> open<00:03:16.709> these<00:03:16.919> games<00:03:17.189> and<00:03:17.370> that

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
they can break open these games and that

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.640 
they can break open these games and that
might<00:03:17.639> be<00:03:17.760> enough<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:17.970> win<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.180> game<00:03:18.419> but<00:03:18.959> not

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
might be enough to win a game but not

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.710 
might be enough to win a game but not
more<00:03:19.799> than<00:03:19.859> one<00:03:20.069> yeah<00:03:20.699> i'm<00:03:20.879> gonna<00:03:20.970> go<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.180> 31

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
more than one yeah i'm gonna go with 31

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.659 
more than one yeah i'm gonna go with 31

much<00:03:23.790> out<00:03:24.030> match<00:03:24.239> cloud<00:03:24.690> on<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:24.989> every<00:03:25.349> single

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
much out match cloud on in every single

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.170 
much out match cloud on in every single
lane<00:03:25.919> but<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.400> saw<00:03:26.579> how<00:03:26.609> well<00:03:26.819> cloud<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.150> i

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
lane but you saw how well cloud and i

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.520 
lane but you saw how well cloud and i
played<00:03:27.389> from<00:03:27.510> behind<00:03:27.810> against<00:03:28.109> najin<00:03:28.409> my

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
played from behind against najin my

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.500 
played from behind against najin my
children<00:03:28.979> down<00:03:29.129> so<00:03:29.549> much<00:03:29.760> gold<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:30.449> they

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
children down so much gold but they

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.969 
children down so much gold but they
still<00:03:30.659> manages<00:03:31.019> will<00:03:31.229> push<00:03:31.409> their<00:03:31.590> way<00:03:31.620> into<00:03:31.829> a

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
still manages will push their way into a

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.439 
still manages will push their way into a
win<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.400> don't<00:03:32.849> think<00:03:32.909> they<00:03:33.090> can<00:03:33.180> take<00:03:33.329> the

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
win I don't think they can take the

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:34.520 
win I don't think they can take the
series<00:03:33.659> but<00:03:33.900> they<00:03:33.959> should<00:03:34.109> be<00:03:34.169> able<00:03:34.229> to<00:03:34.379> take<00:03:34.500> a

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
series but they should be able to take a

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.710 
series but they should be able to take a
game<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.979> agree<00:03:35.699> with<00:03:35.729> you<00:03:35.849> guys<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.269> do<00:03:36.329> think<00:03:36.659> it

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
game I agree with you guys I do think it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.449 
game I agree with you guys I do think it
is<00:03:36.780> going<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:36.989> be<00:03:37.019> samsung<00:03:37.500> blue<00:03:37.709> 31<00:03:38.189> and<00:03:38.400> I

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
is going to be samsung blue 31 and I

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.189 
is going to be samsung blue 31 and I
also<00:03:38.579> agree<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.909> cloud<00:03:39.239> 9<00:03:39.479> has<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.780> lot<00:03:40.169> of

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
also agree that cloud 9 has a lot of

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.189 
also agree that cloud 9 has a lot of
interesting<00:03:40.680> edges<00:03:41.010> here<00:03:41.280> uh<00:03:41.729> they<00:03:42.479> could<00:03:42.810> win

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
interesting edges here uh they could win

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.449 
interesting edges here uh they could win
the<00:03:43.319> matchup<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.799> wouldn't<00:03:44.099> be<00:03:44.189> wholly

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
the matchup I wouldn't be wholly

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.580 
the matchup I wouldn't be wholly
surprised<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.569> could<00:03:45.840> see<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.109> going<00:03:46.229> anywhere

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
surprised I could see it going anywhere

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.619 
surprised I could see it going anywhere
from<00:03:46.799> like<00:03:46.889> 30<00:03:47.220> one<00:03:47.579> way<00:03:47.699> to<00:03:47.759> like<00:03:48.000> 31<00:03:48.389> cloud

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
from like 30 one way to like 31 cloud

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.030 
from like 30 one way to like 31 cloud
nine<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:49.079> kind<00:03:49.259> of<00:03:49.319> average<00:03:49.409> out<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.739> probably

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
nine I kind of average out to probably

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.699 
nine I kind of average out to probably
31<00:03:50.549> samsung<00:03:51.000> blue<00:03:51.239> but<00:03:51.959> really<00:03:52.439> it<00:03:52.500> could<00:03:52.620> go

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
31 samsung blue but really it could go

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.080 
31 samsung blue but really it could go
either<00:03:52.739> way<00:03:52.949> I<00:03:53.069> do<00:03:53.189> feel<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.489> final<00:03:53.939> thoughts

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
either way I do feel that final thoughts

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.789 
either way I do feel that final thoughts
Monte<00:03:54.389> I<00:03:54.540> agree<00:03:54.900> with<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.109> guys<00:03:55.259> I<00:03:55.290> do<00:03:55.470> think

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
Monte I agree with you guys I do think

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.740 
Monte I agree with you guys I do think
it's<00:03:55.919> going<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.159> be<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.430> 31<00:03:57.000> for<00:03:57.269> samsung

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
it's going to be that 31 for samsung

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.929 
it's going to be that 31 for samsung
blue<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.199> really<00:03:58.829> was<00:03:59.069> quite<00:03:59.340> impressed<00:03:59.759> with

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
blue I really was quite impressed with

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.909 
blue I really was quite impressed with
the<00:04:00.030> play<00:04:00.239> that<00:04:00.389> we<00:04:00.509> saw<00:04:00.780> from<00:04:01.109> cloud<00:04:01.650> nine

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
the play that we saw from cloud nine

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.490 
the play that we saw from cloud nine
though<00:04:02.099> against<00:04:02.400> najin<00:04:02.729> white<00:04:02.970> shield<00:04:03.500> blue

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
though against najin white shield blue

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.770 
though against najin white shield blue
tends<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:04.919> be<00:04:05.009> a<00:04:05.040> more<00:04:05.250> 5v5<00:04:05.639> oriented<00:04:06.389> team<00:04:06.540> if

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
tends to be a more 5v5 oriented team if

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.719 
tends to be a more 5v5 oriented team if
a<00:04:06.989> split<00:04:07.290> pusher<00:04:07.650> on<00:04:07.799> cloud<00:04:08.040> nine<00:04:08.280> gets<00:04:08.519> out<00:04:08.639> of

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729 
a split pusher on cloud nine gets out of

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.610 
a split pusher on cloud nine gets out of
control<00:04:08.819> if<00:04:09.209> they<00:04:09.389> come<00:04:09.569> in<00:04:09.720> with<00:04:09.870> some<00:04:10.049> 131

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
control if they come in with some 131

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.140 
control if they come in with some 131
split<00:04:10.889> pushing<00:04:11.099> strats<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.639> think<00:04:11.909> they<00:04:12.030> can

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
split pushing strats I think they can

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.789 
split pushing strats I think they can
take<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.329> game<00:04:12.509> well<00:04:12.989> there<00:04:13.229> we<00:04:13.319> go<00:04:13.349> another

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
take a game well there we go another

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.129 
take a game well there we go another

just a couple of days away from seeing

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.340 
just a couple of days away from seeing
