has been the missing link between

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.080 
has been the missing link between

Windows machine compared to on OS X and
this<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> work<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.290> has<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> happen<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
this is the work that has to happen to

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.609 
this is the work that has to happen to
manage<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.210> communication<00:01:28.170> between<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
manage that communication between the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.740 
manage that communication between the
hardware<00:01:29.009> device<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.939> application<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
hardware device and the application that

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.690 
hardware device and the application that
it's<00:01:30.900> controlling<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.890> we're<00:01:32.280> working

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
it's controlling so we're working

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.200 
it's controlling so we're working
towards<00:01:33.860> implementing<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.369> hopefully

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
towards implementing that and hopefully

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.950 
towards implementing that and hopefully
we'll<00:01:36.540> see<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.869> soon<00:01:37.400> but<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.490> don't<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.880> a

deadline<00:01:39.960> no<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.650> technology<00:01:41.009> preview<00:01:41.490> so

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
deadline no it's a technology preview so

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.190 
deadline no it's a technology preview so
at<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.000> point<00:01:42.180> we<00:01:42.360> don't<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> release

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
at this point we don't have a release

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.859
