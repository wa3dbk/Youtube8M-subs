00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.719
 curtis and talk tur fair attraction that I liked to climb small but 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.719
 that today has lost all its magic 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.220
 the txu-txu train 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.580
 the train that the chou was at all the fairs 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.990
 it was a witness by a circular circuit 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.570
 and it would be to get inside a tunnel 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.580
 inside which there were drawings showed his 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.000
 something like the three ghosts 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.820
 the wagons of the train used to have track drawings and illegally 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.820
 But that was not important 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.820
 two in tables enjoying circling 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.670
 then we passed the dusters 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.190
 if climb to the top of the locomotive 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.770
 and before reaching the tunnel, it would go through a window of the station 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.660
 from the window I was trying to give the comarths and to be the head 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.370
 and then the contest will start 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.960
 if you can remove the pallars a feather duster if this trip with the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.420
 giants 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.900
 today the txu-txu train still circulates 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.190
 but he has already lost all his magic 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.160
 the station no longer exists nor the clown 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.920
 has been replaced by a giant and in other versions by a transvestite but 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 still always remembered the east I had it 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.420
 any place that can hold a fair may have the train txu-txu 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.990
 Here is a list of the sites that you have cast 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.799
