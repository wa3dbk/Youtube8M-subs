00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
going to do just take off the reservoir

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.600 
going to do just take off the reservoir
cap<00:00:45.020> that<00:00:46.020> way<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.530> will<00:00:46.710> help<00:00:46.860> our<00:00:47.160> cool

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610

cap that way that will help our cool
little<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.690> drain<00:00:48.930> plug<00:00:50.180> aside<00:00:51.199> next

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
little out the drain plug aside next

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.200 
little out the drain plug aside next
we'll<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.559> over<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.160> radiator<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.030> there

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
we'll go over to the radiator so there

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.119 
we'll go over to the radiator so there
is<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> drain<00:00:54.870> hose<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.770> particular

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
is a drain hose on this particular

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.389 
is a drain hose on this particular
Escalade<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:58.620> hose<00:00:58.859> needs<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> get

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
Escalade here and this hose needs to get

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.319 
Escalade here and this hose needs to get
pointed<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.440> into<00:01:01.440> your<00:01:01.590> drain<00:01:01.920> pan<00:01:02.329> so

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
pointed down into your drain pan so

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.719 
pointed down into your drain pan so
we're<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.629> turn<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.260> around<00:01:04.729> point

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
we're going to turn it around point

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.070 
we're going to turn it around point
pointed<00:01:06.450> down<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> bottom<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> then

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
pointed down to the bottom here and then

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.109 
pointed down to the bottom here and then
we<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.290> open<00:01:10.500> our<00:01:10.979> drain<00:01:11.580> plug<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:12.090> is

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
we can open our drain plug which is

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.530 
we can open our drain plug which is
right<00:01:12.479> here<00:01:12.510> at<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> bottom<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:14.540> Plataea

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
right here at the bottom and Plataea

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.350 
right here at the bottom and Plataea
coolants<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.530> flowing<00:01:17.070> down

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:43.149

you want to you can just if you have a

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.660 
you want to you can just if you have a
second<00:03:41.330> gallon<00:03:41.659> jug<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.620> can<00:03:42.890> put<00:03:43.430> half<00:03:43.610> the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
second gallon jug you can put half the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.490 
second gallon jug you can put half the
coolant<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:44.390> jug<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.900> then<00:03:45.049> fill<00:03:45.319> them

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
coolant in that jug and then fill them

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.530 
coolant in that jug and then fill them
both<00:03:45.680> up<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.129> rest<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.489> way<00:03:46.549> of<00:03:46.670> water<00:03:46.940> and

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
both up the rest of the way of water and

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.210 
both up the rest of the way of water and
you'll<00:03:47.690> have<00:03:47.810> your<00:03:47.989> coolant<00:03:48.500> pretty<00:03:48.739> mixed<00:03:48.920> if

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
you'll have your coolant pretty mixed if

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.930 
you'll have your coolant pretty mixed if
your<00:03:49.489> if<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:49.910> have<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.290> concentrated<00:03:51.290> stuff

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
your if you have the concentrated stuff

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.479 
your if you have the concentrated stuff
and<00:03:52.940> then<00:03:53.299> but<00:03:53.480> once<00:03:54.379> we<00:03:54.590> had<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:55.099> reservoir

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
and then but once we had the reservoir

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.610 
and then but once we had the reservoir
filled<00:03:55.670> up<00:03:55.909> we<00:03:56.540> turned<00:03:57.260> on<00:03:57.379> the<00:03:57.409> engine

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
filled up we turned on the engine

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.280 
filled up we turned on the engine
ramming<00:03:58.459> it<00:03:58.610> sucked<00:03:59.150> a<00:03:59.390> lot<00:03:59.660> of<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.900> coolant

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
ramming it sucked a lot of that coolant

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.680 
ramming it sucked a lot of that coolant
in<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:00.799> so<00:04:01.459> then<00:04:01.640> we<00:04:01.730> continued<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.299> fill<00:04:02.510> it

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
in and so then we continued to fill it

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.319 
in and so then we continued to fill it
ran<00:04:03.170> until<00:04:03.500> it<00:04:03.680> was<00:04:03.769> hot<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.849> be<00:04:04.879> on<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.120> safe

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
ran until it was hot to be on the safe

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.900 
ran until it was hot to be on the safe
side<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:05.660> they<00:04:05.720> turn<00:04:05.900> on<00:04:06.049> here<00:04:06.579> to<00:04:07.579> make<00:04:07.760> sure

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
side and they turn on here to make sure

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.190 
side and they turn on here to make sure
that<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.150> coolant<00:04:08.390> is<00:04:08.510> flowing<00:04:08.540> all<00:04:08.989> through

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
that the coolant is flowing all through

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.520 
that the coolant is flowing all through
the<00:04:09.319> system<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:09.920> then<00:04:10.819> when<00:04:11.239> it's<00:04:11.390> warm<00:04:11.750> just

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
the system and then when it's warm just

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.809 
the system and then when it's warm just
make<00:04:12.709> sure<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.069> you're<00:04:13.220> at<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.370> right<00:04:13.489> level

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
make sure that you're at the right level

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.629 
make sure that you're at the right level
in<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.030> reservoir<00:04:14.480> tank<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.200> then<00:04:16.039> should<00:04:16.549> be

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
in the reservoir tank and then should be

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.000 
in the reservoir tank and then should be
good<00:04:16.789> to<00:04:16.880> go
