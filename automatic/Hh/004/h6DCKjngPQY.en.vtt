00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.700
 hello welcome this is the space 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.280
 natural sciences for school 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.160
 secondary the previous classes we saw 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.049
 that biodiversity is to say the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.810
 variety of living beings that live in 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.100
 the planet is classified in five 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.610
 kingdoms we have already seen three of those kingdoms 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.770
 we saw currency the kingdom of bacteria 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.680
 protists the kingdom of protozoa and 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.870
 fuji the kingdom of fungi in this 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.360
 class let's see the two kingdoms that we 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.329
 animals are missing and the kingdom of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.769
 animals and plant the rabbi of the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.420
 vegetables 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.999
 surely they are the kingdoms that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.819
 you know because every day you see animals and 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:50.460
 vegetables to be able to study them better 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:54.030
 let's analyze on the one hand the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.429
 similarities is to say that they have in common 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.649
 animals and vegetables and on the other hand 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.649
 let's point out the differences 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.320
 and let's see now what are the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.670
 similarities we can say that they are 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.390
 macroscopic is to say that we can 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.130
 see at a glance are multicellular or 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.950
 be that they are formed by many 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.340
 cells and something else that at this height and 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.700
 we know is that they are eukaryotes 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.860
 that your cells have a nucleus 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.829
 both animals and vegetables have 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.869
 eukaryotic cells there are some 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.600
 differences in its structure 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.920
 mobile 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.920
 the plant cells have outside 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 of the plasma membrane another membrane 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.800
 that membrane is the cell wall is 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.470
 for the cell phone is formed by 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.920
 cellulose and gives the vegetables 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.439
 certain rigidity 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.909
 another difference is that the cells 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.399
 vegetables have an organ called 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.130
 chloroplast the chloroplast is very 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.000
 important because this is where it takes 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.300
 out the process of photosynthesis 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.450
 thanks to this process the vegetables 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.860
 they make their own food what they brand 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:29.550
 another difference the way of feeding 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.310
 the vegetables are autotrophic that is 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.820
 who make their own food while 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.920
 that the animals are hetero chunks is 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.400
 say that they feed on others being 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.370
 alive the vegetables also have in the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.590
 cytoplasm a large central vacuole that 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.770
 it serves as a water reserve and other 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.250
 substances we can also say that the 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.770
 vegetables have unlimited growth 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.930
 instead in the animal kingdom and the 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.590
 growth comes to a certain point and 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.590
 it stops 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.950
 let's review now what are the 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.830
 similarities and differences that we saw 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:18.010
 in this class in the similarities we have 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.489
 that are multicellular is to say that 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.989
 they are made up of many cells 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.470
 macroscopic that we can see them 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.230
 simple sight and eukaryotes is to say that 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.930
 your cells or are core let's see now 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.900
 the differences one of the differences 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.500
 it was the way of feeding nutrition 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.130
 the vegetables are autotrophic and the 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.450
 animal ether other two other difference 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.989
 It is the growth in vegetables is 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.120
 unlimited and in limited animals 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.610
 we also had differences in terms of 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.799
 the cellular structure where we had 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.750
 pointed out certain organelles that were 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.030
 present only in vegetables 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.430
 as for example the chloroplasts 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.709
 in this way we finish analyzing 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.450
 the five kingdoms in which 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:14.610
 classify living beings 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:18.400
 we saw the kingdom coin protest fanning and 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.519
 in today's class animals and plants 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.310
 the biodiversity of the planet is very 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.840
 abundant 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.419
 researchers have studied 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.520
 1,750,000 species currently but 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.300
 it is estimated that the real number varies 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.380
 between 3 and 80 million so still 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.260
 Much remains to be explored and discovered 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.540
 to finish this class I propose that 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.330
 perform a comparison table between the 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.720
 two kingdoms that we saw today animalia and 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.240
 planting indicating the characteristics 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.850
 that we saw and also highlighting the 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.490
 cellular structures you can also 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.980
 draw a picture of animal cell and other 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.020
 of plant cell highlighting the 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.320
 cellular structures that are only 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.010
 present in a cell type until the 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.010
 next class
