looked<00:01:52.320> darker<00:01:52.649> than<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> others<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.340> didn't

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
looked darker than the others I didn't

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.730 
looked darker than the others I didn't
do<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.360> regret<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.869> because<00:01:55.200> there

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
do that and I regret it because there

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.030 
do that and I regret it because there
was<00:01:55.860> an<00:01:56.009> area<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.490> my<00:01:56.670> thighs<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:58.140> looked<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
was an area on my thighs that looked a

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.770 
was an area on my thighs that looked a
lot<00:01:59.250> darker<00:01:59.610> than<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.030> rest<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.329> my<00:02:00.420> body<00:02:00.630> and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
lot darker than the rest of my body and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.539 
lot darker than the rest of my body and
actually<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.259> was<00:02:01.350> pretty<00:02:01.710> embarrassing<00:02:02.399> I'm

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
actually it was pretty embarrassing I'm

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.039 
actually it was pretty embarrassing I'm
just<00:02:02.729> happy<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.060> my<00:02:03.119> shorts<00:02:03.540> covered<00:02:03.899> that

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
just happy that my shorts covered that

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.039 
just happy that my shorts covered that
up<00:02:04.579> so<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.610> would<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.420> suggest<00:02:06.570> going

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
up so I would I would just suggest going

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.229 
up so I would I would just suggest going
back<00:02:07.350> over<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.009> really<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:09.090> like

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
back over and really just like

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.999 
back over and really just like
fine-tuning<00:02:09.869> your<00:02:10.020> tan<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.470> making<00:02:10.739> sure<00:02:10.890> it

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
fine-tuning your tan and making sure it

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.400 
fine-tuning your tan and making sure it
all<00:02:11.039> looks<00:02:11.640> even

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
all looks even

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.110 
all looks even
because<00:02:13.190> it's<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.610> hard<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
because it's just so hard to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.150 
because it's just so hard to
consistently<00:02:15.020> hold<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.500> at<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.710> same

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
consistently hold it at the same

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.120 
consistently hold it at the same
distance<00:02:16.460> away<00:02:16.910> over<00:02:17.810> all<00:02:17.960> your<00:02:18.110> body<00:02:18.350> so

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
distance away over all your body so

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.800 
distance away over all your body so
that's<00:02:19.310> my<00:02:19.490> recommendation<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:20.360> do<00:02:20.570> use<00:02:20.780> a

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
that's my recommendation is do use a

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.530 
that's my recommendation is do use a
tanning<00:02:21.140> mitt<00:02:21.350> with<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:21.680> one<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.820> took<00:02:23.300> about

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
tanning mitt with this one it took about

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.020 
tanning mitt with this one it took about
40<00:02:24.080> minutes<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.590> dry<00:02:24.890> completely<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.850> was

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
40 minutes to dry completely and I was

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.310 
40 minutes to dry completely and I was
kind<00:02:26.240> of<00:02:26.330> surprised<00:02:26.750> by<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.080> because

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
kind of surprised by that because

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.650 
kind of surprised by that because
usually<00:02:27.470> aerosol<00:02:28.040> myths<00:02:28.310> dry<00:02:28.940> pretty<00:02:29.360> quickly

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
usually aerosol myths dry pretty quickly

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.390 
usually aerosol myths dry pretty quickly
because<00:02:30.080> they're<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.470> fine<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.010> lightweight

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
because they're so fine and lightweight

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.000 
because they're so fine and lightweight
but<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:32.210> one<00:02:32.450> took<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:33.020> long<00:02:33.320> time<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.860> took

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
but this one took a long time it took

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.820 
but this one took a long time it took
about<00:02:34.220> 40<00:02:34.730> minutes<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:35.150> total<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:36.650> was

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
about 40 minutes in total and I was

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.390 
about 40 minutes in total and I was
extremely<00:02:37.490> sticky<00:02:38.390> while<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.200> dried<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.040> since

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
extremely sticky while I dried and since

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.010 
extremely sticky while I dried and since
there<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.670> dark<00:02:41.030> guy<00:02:41.210> you<00:02:41.510> just<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.900> be

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
there is a dark guy you just have to be

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.900 
there is a dark guy you just have to be
very<00:02:42.260> careful<00:02:42.680> as<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:42.950> what<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.400> touch<00:02:43.640> while

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
very careful as to what you touch while

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.640 
very careful as to what you touch while
it's<00:02:44.090> drying<00:02:44.390> because<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.290> has<00:02:45.410> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
it's drying because it has the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.940 
it's drying because it has the
possibility<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.730> stain<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:48.380> next<00:02:48.740> day

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
possibility to stain that the next day

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.630 
possibility to stain that the next day
when<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.250> woke<00:02:49.490> up<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.820> did<00:02:50.090> smell<00:02:50.510> some<00:02:50.780> DHA

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
when I woke up I did smell some DHA

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.490 
when I woke up I did smell some DHA
before<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.670> showered<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.210> off<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:54.080> light

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
before I showered it off so that light

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.860 
before I showered it off so that light
scent<00:02:54.830> was<00:02:55.040> gone<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:55.700> could<00:02:55.970> smell<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.240> DHA

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
scent was gone and I could smell the DHA

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.110 
scent was gone and I could smell the DHA
but<00:02:57.500> once<00:02:57.710> I<00:02:57.860> showered<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.370> off<00:02:58.520> it<00:02:58.790> was<00:02:58.910> gone

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
but once I showered it off it was gone

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.440 
but once I showered it off it was gone
completely<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.840> I<00:02:59.870> couldn't<00:03:00.170> smell<00:03:00.410> anything

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
completely and I couldn't smell anything

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.000 
completely and I couldn't smell anything
I'm<00:03:02.450> like<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.930> said<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.260> product<00:03:03.500> can<00:03:03.770> get<00:03:03.980> a

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
I'm like I said this product can get a

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.530 
I'm like I said this product can get a
little<00:03:04.190> messy<00:03:04.610> so<00:03:04.640> make<00:03:04.970> sure<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.330> apply

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
little messy so make sure you apply

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.080 
little messy so make sure you apply
either<00:03:05.840> in<00:03:06.020> your<00:03:06.110> bathtub<00:03:06.380> or<00:03:07.040> on<00:03:07.400> on<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.760> towel

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
either in your bathtub or on on a towel

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.220 
either in your bathtub or on on a towel
that<00:03:08.270> you<00:03:08.390> don't<00:03:08.540> mind<00:03:08.660> getting<00:03:08.930> dirty

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
that you don't mind getting dirty

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.940 
that you don't mind getting dirty
because<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.760> guide<00:03:11.390> will<00:03:12.200> drop<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:12.830> floor

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
because the guide will drop to the floor

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.230 
because the guide will drop to the floor
and<00:03:13.100> then<00:03:13.310> you'll<00:03:13.430> either<00:03:13.550> have<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.820> Swiffer

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
and then you'll either have to Swiffer

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.140 
and then you'll either have to Swiffer
it<00:03:14.540> or<00:03:14.810> just<00:03:15.080> mop<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.440> up<00:03:15.560> which<00:03:16.490> can<00:03:16.670> be<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.850> pain

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
it or just mop it up which can be a pain

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.750 
it or just mop it up which can be a pain
as<00:03:17.810> far<00:03:18.500> as<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.770> color<00:03:18.980> produced<00:03:19.220> goes<00:03:19.580> on

as far as the color produced goes on

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.670 
as far as the color produced goes on
this<00:03:19.910> one<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.270> actually<00:03:20.540> liked<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.380> color<00:03:21.590> a

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
this one I actually liked the color a

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.120 
this one I actually liked the color a
lot<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:22.280> was<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.460> nice<00:03:22.820> medium<00:03:23.600> shade<00:03:24.010> however<00:03:25.010> I

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
lot it was a nice medium shade however I

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.980 
lot it was a nice medium shade however I
turned<00:03:25.580> out<00:03:25.730> splotchy<00:03:26.150> because<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.540> didn't<00:03:26.930> use

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
turned out splotchy because I didn't use

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.690 
turned out splotchy because I didn't use
a<00:03:27.140> tanning<00:03:27.650> mitt<00:03:27.800> so<00:03:27.830> there<00:03:28.130> were<00:03:28.220> some<00:03:28.460> areas

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
a tanning mitt so there were some areas

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.280 
a tanning mitt so there were some areas
of<00:03:28.880> my<00:03:29.120> body<00:03:29.330> that<00:03:29.600> were<00:03:29.720> darker<00:03:30.110> than<00:03:30.260> others

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
of my body that were darker than others

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.990 
of my body that were darker than others
