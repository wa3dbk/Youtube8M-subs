on the shallow read feed beds it seems
this<00:02:16.360> one<00:02:16.540> here<00:02:16.720> might<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:17.080> little<00:02:17.350> bit

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
this one here might be a little bit

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.410 
this one here might be a little bit
different<00:02:17.680> we've<00:02:17.950> got<00:02:18.130> 10<00:02:18.610> 12<00:02:18.970> foot<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.270> water

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
different we've got 10 12 foot of water

different we've got 10 12 foot of water
cuts<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.840> lot<00:02:20.020> tighter<00:02:20.260> into<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.830> edge<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.130> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
cuts a lot tighter into the edge of the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.920 
cuts a lot tighter into the edge of the
reeds<00:02:21.460> here<00:02:21.850> yeah<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.330> sounds<00:02:22.630> good<00:02:22.750> they're

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
reeds here yeah it sounds good they're

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.540 
reeds here yeah it sounds good they're
not<00:02:23.080> up<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:23.530> real<00:02:23.710> shallow<00:02:23.950> stuff<00:02:24.340> and

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
not up in that real shallow stuff and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.280 
not up in that real shallow stuff and
the<00:02:24.610> numbers<00:02:24.910> they<00:02:25.030> should<00:02:25.240> be<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
the numbers they should be so the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.750 
the numbers they should be so the
steeper<00:02:26.680> water<00:02:26.890> might<00:02:27.310> be<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.490> little<00:02:27.670> more

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
steeper water might be a little more

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.490 
steeper water might be a little more
stable<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.360> might<00:02:28.480> hold<00:02:28.630> some<00:02:28.720> more<00:02:28.960> fish

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500
