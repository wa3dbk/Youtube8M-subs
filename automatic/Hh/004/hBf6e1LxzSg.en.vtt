this intake here so what we got here is

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.800 
this intake here so what we got here is
we<00:01:13.230> got<00:01:13.440> our<00:01:13.470> intercooler<00:01:14.130> sits<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:14.820> below

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
we got our intercooler sits right below

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.750 
we got our intercooler sits right below
the<00:01:16.020> vent<00:01:16.230> on<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> hood<00:01:16.920> we've<00:01:17.250> got<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> fan

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
the vent on the hood we've got a fan

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.570 
the vent on the hood we've got a fan
that<00:01:18.300> draws<00:01:18.600> air<00:01:18.900> through<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.560> vent<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.490> it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
that draws air through the vent so it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.710 
that draws air through the vent so it
doesn't<00:01:20.820> matter<00:01:20.970> what<00:01:21.150> speed<00:01:21.420> you're<00:01:21.570> at

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
doesn't matter what speed you're at
we're<00:01:22.110> gonna<00:01:22.230> have<00:01:22.470> lots<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.950> air<00:01:23.040> movement

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
we're gonna have lots of air movement

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.250 
we're gonna have lots of air movement
which<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:23.909> keep<00:01:24.120> our<00:01:24.360> charged<00:01:24.659> air<00:01:24.900> temps

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
which will keep our charged air temps

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.980 
which will keep our charged air temps
really<00:01:25.890> low<00:01:26.300> now<00:01:27.300> that<00:01:27.450> we've<00:01:27.570> cooled<00:01:27.840> our

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
really low now that we've cooled our

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.210 
really low now that we've cooled our
charger<00:01:28.440> we're<00:01:28.560> gonna<00:01:28.650> move<00:01:28.800> over<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.070> to

highly technical mechanics of the sled
let's<00:02:04.260> move<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.650> our<00:02:04.830> electronics<00:02:05.520> what

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
let's move on to our electronics what

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.190 
let's move on to our electronics what
we've<00:02:06.090> got<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.690> boondock<00:02:07.020> or

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
we've got here is the boondock or

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.459 
we've got here is the boondock or
control<00:02:07.590> box<00:02:07.830> it's<00:02:08.549> 3d<00:02:09.170> programming<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.259> what

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:10.469 
control box it's 3d programming is what

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:12.949 
control box it's 3d programming is what
allows<00:02:10.979> us<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.939> the<00:02:12.029> drivability<00:02:12.779> and<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
allows us to get the drivability and the

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.240 
allows us to get the drivability and the
tunability<00:02:13.319> out<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.769> this<00:02:13.889> a

tunability out of this a

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.760 
tunability out of this a
detect<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.300> what<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.540> 3d<00:02:15.870> programming<00:02:16.410> does

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
detect so what the 3d programming does

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.760 
detect so what the 3d programming does
is<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.280> takes<00:02:17.550> into<00:02:17.790> consideration<00:02:18.140> RPM<00:02:19.140> boost

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
is it takes into consideration RPM boost

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.980 
is it takes into consideration RPM boost
throttle<00:02:20.640> position<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.210> charge<00:02:21.480> air<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:21.900> we

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
throttle position and charge air so we

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.350 
throttle position and charge air so we
have<00:02:22.110> precise<00:02:22.680> fueling<00:02:23.370> with<00:02:23.520> varying

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360

TPS has now allowed us to control our
boost<00:02:44.010> based<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.580> throttle<00:02:44.820> position<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.110> we

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
boost based on throttle position so we

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.740 
boost based on throttle position so we
get<00:02:46.380> super<00:02:46.950> smooth<00:02:47.250> drivability<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.300> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
get super smooth drivability in the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.940 
get super smooth drivability in the
mid-range<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.800> at<00:02:50.640> 50%<00:02:51.260> throttle<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.380> get<00:02:52.470> 50%

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
mid-range so at 50% throttle you get 50%

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.400 
mid-range so at 50% throttle you get 50%
of<00:02:53.160> your<00:02:53.310> set<00:02:53.550> point<00:02:53.580> which<00:02:54.030> allows<00:02:54.330> us<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.870> go

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
of your set point which allows us to go

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.199 
of your set point which allows us to go
down<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.770> trails<00:02:56.100> without<00:02:56.430> over<00:02:56.700> boosting

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
down the trails without over boosting

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.140
