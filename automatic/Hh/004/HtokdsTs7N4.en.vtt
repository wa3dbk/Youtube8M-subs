centers<00:00:34.559> completed<00:00:34.890> looks<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.610> he<00:00:35.730> may<00:00:35.850> be

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
centers completed looks like he may be

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.100 
centers completed looks like he may be
able<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:36.750> there's<00:00:36.930> another

turret<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.620> destructive<00:00:38.340> nearby<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.660> he's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
turret or destructive nearby so he's

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.180 
turret or destructive nearby so he's
only<00:00:40.020> able<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.320> slash<00:00:40.590> at<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.800> command<00:00:41.070> center

alright<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.890> g5<00:01:37.890> has<00:01:38.189> got<00:01:38.369> an<00:01:38.460> empty<00:01:38.640> shuttle

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
alright so g5 has got an empty shuttle

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.910 
alright so g5 has got an empty shuttle
maybe<00:01:39.240> he'll<00:01:39.420> pick<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:39.720> some<00:01:39.930> more<00:01:40.140> units<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
maybe he'll pick up some more units and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.289 
maybe he'll pick up some more units and
just<00:01:41.159> continue<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> rest<00:01:41.850> meant<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
just continue the rest meant just to

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.380 
just continue the rest meant just to
solidify<00:01:42.540> his<00:01:42.990> advantage<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.310> who<00:01:45.270> knows

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
solidify his advantage but who knows

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.999 
solidify his advantage but who knows
he's<00:01:45.630> got<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> few<00:01:46.110> different<00:01:46.229> options<00:01:46.500> at<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
he's got a few different options at the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.560 
he's got a few different options at the
point<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.549> hang<00:01:47.790> back<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
point you can just hang back and and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.510 
point you can just hang back and and
make<00:01:49.200> heaps<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.560> units<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.009> bases<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.430> he

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
make heaps of units and bases if he

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.460 
make heaps of units and bases if he
wants<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.939> or<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.450> keep<00:01:51.689> keep

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
wants to or you can just keep keep

few different things and at the moment

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.539 
few different things and at the moment
he's<00:02:01.229> got<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.829> single<00:02:02.159> doctor<00:02:02.340> by

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
does it wasn't even taken out I mean

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.580 
does it wasn't even taken out I mean
that<00:02:26.550> scan<00:02:26.849> went<00:02:27.090> off<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:27.510> not<00:02:28.110> happening<00:02:28.500> and

that scan went off but not happening and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.559 
that scan went off but not happening and

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
got another exchange on the bottom left

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.110 
got another exchange on the bottom left
for<00:02:30.840> g5<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:31.560> it's<00:02:31.680> going<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.830> have<00:02:31.890> 33<00:02:32.670> Nexus<00:02:33.030> is

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120

up before long a toast is still on the
just<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.630> base<00:02:36.870> he's<00:02:37.530> got<00:02:37.760> Scott<00:02:38.760> some

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
just the one base he's got Scott some

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.540 
just the one base he's got Scott some
factories<00:02:39.239> there<00:02:40.069> so<00:02:41.069> it's<00:02:41.190> going<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.340> be<00:02:41.400> able

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
factories there so it's going to be able

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.680 
factories there so it's going to be able
to<00:02:41.610> pump<00:02:41.790> out<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.090> number<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.360> units<00:02:42.599> I'm

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
to pump out a number of units I'm

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.030 
to pump out a number of units I'm
surprised<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.170> chief<00:02:43.380> I've<00:02:43.530> hasn't<00:02:43.830> really

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
surprised the chief I've hasn't really

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.780 
surprised the chief I've hasn't really
taken<00:02:44.250> over<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:45.470> ptosis<00:02:46.470> by<00:02:46.650> such<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> such<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> big

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
taken over I ptosis by such a such a big

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.910 
taken over I ptosis by such a such a big
margin<00:02:48.060> like<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:48.930> big<00:02:48.989> imagine<00:02:49.530> as<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.709> would

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
margin like as big imagine as I would

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.400 
margin like as big imagine as I would
have<00:02:49.950> thought<00:02:50.630> with<00:02:51.630> his<00:02:51.720> units<00:02:52.019> but<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:52.350> as

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
have thought with his units but just as

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.500 
have thought with his units but just as
he<00:02:52.470> could<00:02:52.560> have<00:02:52.680> done<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:52.830> but<00:02:53.819> before<00:02:54.269> long

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
he could have done that but before long

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.259 
he could have done that but before long
he<00:02:54.720> will<00:02:54.870> I'll<00:02:55.170> look<00:02:55.290> high<00:02:55.709> templars<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.340> yeah

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
he will I'll look high templars so yeah

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.759 
he will I'll look high templars so yeah
I<00:02:57.299> think<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:57.900> expected<00:02:58.140> some<00:02:58.410> support

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
I think we can be expected some support

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.820 
I think we can be expected some support

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
point so he's going to be fairly safe

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.910 
point so he's going to be fairly safe
from<00:03:09.120> any<00:03:09.269> future<00:03:09.480> her<00:03:09.720> ass<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.590> looks<00:03:10.799> like

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
from any future her ass and looks like

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.740 
from any future her ass and looks like
what<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.099> stop<00:03:11.370> what<00:03:11.580> they're<00:03:11.750> building

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
what to stop what they're building

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.099 
what to stop what they're building
something<00:03:13.400> seems<00:03:14.400> like<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:15.060> funny<00:03:15.870> choice

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
something seems like a funny choice

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.370 
something seems like a funny choice
maybe<00:03:17.209> dosis<00:03:18.209> wants<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.480> put<00:03:18.630> on<00:03:18.750> some<00:03:18.930> counter

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
maybe dosis wants to put on some counter

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.530 
maybe dosis wants to put on some counter
dropship<00:03:20.070> harassment<00:03:20.609> and<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.209> might<00:03:21.420> not

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
dropship harassment and that might not

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.030 
dropship harassment and that might not
be<00:03:21.600> such<00:03:21.720> about<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.079> distance<00:03:22.500> these<00:03:22.680> behind

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
be such about a distance these behind

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.949 
be such about a distance these behind
just<00:03:23.790> building<00:03:24.120> their<00:03:24.239> starboard<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.750> try

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
just building their starboard and try

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.780 
just building their starboard and try
and<00:03:25.019> just<00:03:25.290> take<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.920> pressure<00:03:26.100> off<00:03:26.250> him<00:03:26.579> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
and just take the pressure off him and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.130 
and just take the pressure off him and
give<00:03:27.209> him<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.359> chance<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.720> get<00:03:27.840> back<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.109> this

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
give him a chance to get back in this

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.289 
give him a chance to get back in this
game<00:03:28.380> yeah<00:03:29.280> there's<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.549> dropship<00:03:29.880> there<00:03:30.060> looks

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
game yeah there's a dropship there looks

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.059 
game yeah there's a dropship there looks
like<00:03:30.329> yeah<00:03:30.840> putting<00:03:31.230> something<00:03:31.470> else<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.859> drop

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
like yeah putting something else to drop

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.500 
like yeah putting something else to drop
ships<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:32.430> that's<00:03:32.579> going<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.760> be<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:32.910> pretty

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
ships so that's going to be a pretty

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.140 
ships so that's going to be a pretty
serious<00:03:33.840> arrest<00:03:34.319> minh<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:35.459> fair<00:03:35.760> enough<00:03:36.000> if

TSL building a lot of drop ships and

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.819 
TSL building a lot of drop ships and

from from a distance and that could be

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.920 
from from a distance and that could be
cool<00:03:48.810> we'll<00:03:49.319> see<00:03:49.410> how<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.530> goes<00:03:50.870> plenty<00:03:51.870> of

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
cool we'll see how that goes plenty of

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.210 
cool we'll see how that goes plenty of
SUVs<00:03:52.319> at<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:53.519> natural<00:03:54.150> expansion<00:03:54.420> which

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
SUVs at the natural expansion which

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.800 
SUVs at the natural expansion which
depended<00:03:56.220> i<00:03:56.519> live<00:03:57.299> in<00:03:57.359> transferred<00:03:57.720> across

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.599 
depended i live in transferred across
recently<00:03:58.139> obviously<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:58.829> there's<00:03:59.010> plenty<00:03:59.400> of

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
recently obviously so there's plenty of

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.910 
recently obviously so there's plenty of
minerals<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.000> are<00:04:00.060> harvest<00:04:00.739> we<00:04:01.739> really

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
minerals that are harvest we really

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.990 
minerals that are harvest we really
going<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.100> get<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.310> lot<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.489> mileage<00:04:02.700> out<00:04:02.940> of

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
going to get a lot of mileage out of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.129 
going to get a lot of mileage out of
this<00:04:03.090> expansion<00:04:03.480> though<00:04:03.690> because<00:04:03.840> he<00:04:04.019> is

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
this expansion though because he is

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.620 
this expansion though because he is
behind<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:04.889> we'll<00:04:05.010> see<00:04:05.130> how<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.220> goes<00:04:05.630> looks

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
behind so we'll see how that goes looks

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.569 
behind so we'll see how that goes looks
