00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
memory unit and let download and I'm

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.130 
memory unit and let download and I'm
going<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.580> keep<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.880> on<00:02:52.000> here<00:02:52.300> or<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.780> gets<00:02:52.930> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
going to keep it on here or it gets a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.910 
going to keep it on here or it gets a
couple<00:02:53.320> percent<00:02:55.200> everybody<00:02:56.200> does<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.680> I

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
couple percent everybody does and I

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.949 
couple percent everybody does and I
don't<00:02:57.370> know<00:02:57.489> why<00:02:57.670> cameras<00:02:58.150> just<00:02:58.330> hate<00:02:58.600> like

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
don't know why cameras just hate like

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.850 
don't know why cameras just hate like
the<00:02:59.230> old<00:02:59.500> TVs<00:03:00.070> like<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.730> tubes

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
the old TVs like the tubes

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.220 
the old TVs like the tubes
and<00:03:02.860> this<00:03:03.670> might<00:03:03.850> take<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.120> while<00:03:04.240> with<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.840> USB

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
and this might take a while with the USB

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.650 
and this might take a while with the USB
so<00:03:06.220> there's<00:03:06.670> one<00:03:06.820> percent<00:03:09.210> did<00:03:10.210> swap<00:03:10.540> it

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
so there's one percent did swap it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.190 
so there's one percent did swap it
that's<00:03:10.870> enough<00:03:11.140> all<00:03:11.320> right<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:12.210> I<00:03:13.210> recommend

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
that's enough all right and I recommend

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.860 
that's enough all right and I recommend
when<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.410> take<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.770> apart<00:03:15.100> not<00:03:15.520> to<00:03:15.850> take<00:03:16.660> off

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
when you take it apart not to take off

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
when you take it apart not to take off

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.070 
the faceplate there's a little wire from
the<00:03:23.950> for<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.400> touch<00:03:24.610> sensors<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:26.020> I

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
the for the touch sensors and I

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.050 
the for the touch sensors and I
recommend<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.770> keep<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.250> on<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.730> have<00:03:27.880> to
