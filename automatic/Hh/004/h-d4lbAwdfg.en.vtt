00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.670
 a deluxe edition that contains the yes 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.859
 virtual items, of course, too 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 this time again are with it 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.920
 you can see here so beautiful and although there is 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.079
 there among other things a diablo 3 ghosts 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:40.530

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.149
 So a ghost and and diverse 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.670
 ornaments you can do his 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.129
 equipment e trans music there is 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.960
 then a set of weapons and three 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.930
 timeless hilman and their appearance 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.239
 was installed by malta are new 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.760
 angel tuesday then gives as said that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.670
 sweetheart couple pet and the cruiser 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.409
 so the portraits and decors get that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.210
 her if you like the digital version 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.439
 it is ordered but then of course 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.270
 unlocked if you the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.270
 physical version posed and there 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.090
 it goes on almost by itself and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.619
 you can not touch them already 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.159
 ask for a bit out this 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.810
 deco almost like stucco yes so all sorts of 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.920
 on the outside it looks better than some 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.350
 We like to ventilate others correctly 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.140
 I would say that with the scope 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.100
 right here with this device that is 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.360
 an artbook that you know 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.790
 We do not want to be fully there 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.799
 a few fat spoiler urgently 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.210
 bit by if you like this kind of 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.759
 the lightning blaster collector's edition 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.970
 I love that kind of text 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.050
 there 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.380
 look so short here 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:06.520
 sometimes simply the thick about as accurate 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:09.690
 to the country before her beautiful to 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.560
 anka zinc stain left 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.320
 had there is no protection and 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:20.890
 so always succeeds finger was yes 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:23.710
 very nice to play so one 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.470
 of course this album then as 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.380
 next one from bold and with 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:33.190
 malta ellwangen on it diablo 3 on st 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.590
 The mouse pad can be seen here 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.030
 that is quite thin so it's more like that 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.890
 For the short corner I would say now 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.060
 So ego shooter games that a lot 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.590
 want to have cheap money 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.730
 it's probably not for them 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.730
 but a disco 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.200
 then a look behind the scenes of 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.599
 development of diablo 3 resource yes 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.730
 sometimes a blu ray disc is that too 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:02.489
 he is fully inside a dvd and a 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:06.810
 blu ray disc thinks should be lying down 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:10.950
 on top of each other so both for the blu 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.680
 ray player as well as for your dvd 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.090
 player you have a doku or come 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.280
 keep the developers to word 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.750
 and the people who made art in 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.790
 game and music and so far 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.980
 actually learns very well this documentary 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.959
 you have loads of backgrounds about the game 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.720
 a very nice thing and for me too 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.239
 So the heart of the club is this 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.810
 next little thing in it is the 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.200
 soundtrack to the game and here comes too 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:41.280
 already probably the songliste out 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.139
 they are the makers 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.129
 the musicians have to produce 22 songs 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.590
 stand on the back 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.959
 So you see a nice digipak so 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.199
 no cheap case or something 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.510
 but really well done 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:58.379
 pop soul session a track crusader so 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.129
 to kusej I believe different 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:06.030
 So things this music may like to keep 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:11.970
 I then well sunk a core of the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:15.610
 all played both from pc mac 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.989
 usable and what you'll be here 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:24.670
 moment just for you right yes three 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.230
 a-aston car packs are so cool 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.580
 Also a very nice story for 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.470
 all hsv players out there 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.160
 We can continue to do that 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.380
 As always, we tried version of one 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.130
 short quick guide correct from world of 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.380
 warcraft and diablo 3 and here is one 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.450
 hiding for luck Indian of 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.660
 Plant then unlocks I believe that 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.210
 So that 's what it was a collector's 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.800
 edition now without real highlight 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.320
 I want to say so it somehow lacks 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.200
 cool usb stick or something we have 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.430
 there was, for example, or me 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.400
 believe in the first years u3 between 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.950
 need and fat diablo head usb-stick 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.220
 moser so to speak it is one 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.800
 extension is important and beautiful for that 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.360
 the pack is beautiful and everything is fine and 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.460
 high quality that can be synonymous completely 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.800
 Hold right 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.070
 So you have to know exactly if I have the 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.479
 20 euros surcharge to the digital 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.150
 the collector's edition is worth it 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.900
 and yes we say when we code 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.150
 redeem here and I have the one for you 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.890
 that and will start playing 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.890
 the diablo 3 collector's edition
