00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.279 

here's<00:00:01.910> another<00:00:02.000> thing<00:00:02.570> that<00:00:02.779> I<00:00:02.810> run<00:00:03.110> into

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:03.289 
here's another thing that I run into

00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:05.680 
here's another thing that I run into
every<00:00:03.769> once<00:00:03.949> in<00:00:04.130> a<00:00:04.190> while<00:00:04.400> and<00:00:04.730> it's<00:00:05.450> probably

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
every once in a while and it's probably

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.470 
every once in a while and it's probably
more<00:00:06.370> often<00:00:07.370> than<00:00:07.730> you<00:00:07.970> could<00:00:08.149> ever<00:00:08.299> imagine

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
more often than you could ever imagine

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.850 
more often than you could ever imagine
and<00:00:09.349> most<00:00:10.339> buildings<00:00:10.999> today<00:00:11.360> need<00:00:12.079> some<00:00:12.589> type

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
and most buildings today need some type

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.140 
and most buildings today need some type
of<00:00:12.889> handicap<00:00:13.820> ramp<00:00:14.480> or<00:00:14.839> access<00:00:15.530> if<00:00:16.160> they<00:00:16.820> are

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
of handicap ramp or access if they are

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.420 
of handicap ramp or access if they are
raised<00:00:18.400> their<00:00:19.400> doorways<00:00:19.790> or<00:00:21.070> entrance<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.310> the

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
raised their doorways or entrance to the

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.330 
raised their doorways or entrance to the
building<00:00:22.610> are<00:00:23.000> raised<00:00:23.300> in<00:00:23.570> any<00:00:23.870> way<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:24.980> again

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
building are raised in any way so again

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.070 
building are raised in any way so again
I<00:00:25.520> don't<00:00:25.640> think<00:00:26.060> you<00:00:26.180> need<00:00:26.360> more<00:00:26.600> than<00:00:26.660> one

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
I don't think you need more than one

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.710 
I don't think you need more than one
access<00:00:27.590> but<00:00:28.160> you<00:00:28.280> do<00:00:28.490> need<00:00:28.670> at<00:00:28.880> least<00:00:28.910> one

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
access but you do need at least one

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.220 
access but you do need at least one
access<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:31.090> this<00:00:32.090> is<00:00:32.329> in<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:32.750> back<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:33.140> the

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
access and this is in the back of the

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.190 
access and this is in the back of the
building<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:33.920> they<00:00:34.910> actually<00:00:35.120> have<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:35.870> sign

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
building and they actually have the sign

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.640 
building and they actually have the sign
which<00:00:36.740> is<00:00:36.950> good<00:00:37.190> you<00:00:38.030> need<00:00:38.360> a<00:00:38.390> sign<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:39.110> tell

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
which is good you need a sign to tell

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.170 
which is good you need a sign to tell
everyone<00:00:39.950> that<00:00:40.100> you<00:00:40.400> can<00:00:40.730> get<00:00:41.120> in<00:00:41.480> here<00:00:41.870> but

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
everyone that you can get in here but

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.300 
everyone that you can get in here but
there<00:00:44.180> are<00:00:44.360> some<00:00:44.600> other<00:00:44.780> problems<00:00:45.380> that<00:00:45.710> might

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
there are some other problems that might

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.410 
there are some other problems that might
not<00:00:47.050> be<00:00:48.050> working<00:00:48.260> well<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:49.220> one<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.149> them<00:00:50.270> is

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
not be working well and one of them is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.569 
not be working well and one of them is
the<00:00:50.600> door<00:00:50.960> I<00:00:51.230> don't<00:00:51.530> think<00:00:51.770> the<00:00:51.890> door<00:00:52.130> the<00:00:52.370> door

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
the door I don't think the door the door

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.049 
the door I don't think the door the door
has<00:00:52.790> to<00:00:52.970> have<00:00:53.149> at<00:00:53.329> least<00:00:53.360> a<00:00:53.750> 36<00:00:54.320> inch<00:00:55.059> opening

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
has to have at least a 36 inch opening

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.030 
has to have at least a 36 inch opening
so<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:56.720> means<00:00:57.110> that<00:00:57.380> the<00:00:57.500> door<00:00:57.710> would<00:00:57.890> need

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
so that means that the door would need

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.580 
so that means that the door would need
to<00:00:58.160> be<00:00:58.280> 36<00:00:58.880> inches<00:00:59.239> wide<00:00:59.510> and<00:00:59.840> that<00:01:00.079> didn't

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
to be 36 inches wide and that didn't

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.770 
to be 36 inches wide and that didn't
look<00:01:00.739> like<00:01:00.800> it<00:01:01.010> was<00:01:01.280> 36<00:01:01.910> inches<00:01:02.300> wide<00:01:04.780> okay

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
look like it was 36 inches wide okay

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.719 
look like it was 36 inches wide okay
they<00:01:05.930> have<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.290> handicap<00:01:06.830> signs<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:07.640> then

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
they have the handicap signs and then

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.610 
they have the handicap signs and then
got<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:07.909> couple<00:01:08.180> other<00:01:08.450> things<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.260> they<00:01:09.350> even

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
got a couple other things and they even

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.730 
got a couple other things and they even
have<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:09.799> handrail<00:01:10.520> there<00:01:11.290> they<00:01:12.290> have<00:01:12.409> a<00:01:12.440> guard

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
have a handrail there they have a guard

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.160 
have a handrail there they have a guard
rail<00:01:12.979> which<00:01:13.250> I'm<00:01:13.430> sure<00:01:13.640> isn't<00:01:13.880> 42<00:01:14.570> inches<00:01:14.960> but

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
rail which I'm sure isn't 42 inches but

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.770 
rail which I'm sure isn't 42 inches but
it<00:01:15.320> could<00:01:15.530> be<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.159> know<00:01:16.340> 42<00:01:17.330> inches<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
it could be you know 42 inches is the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.750 
it could be you know 42 inches is the
minimum<00:01:18.200> height<00:01:18.380> for<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:18.710> guard<00:01:18.979> railing<00:01:19.460> but

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
minimum height for a guard railing but

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.930 
minimum height for a guard railing but
it<00:01:20.150> that<00:01:20.840> wouldn't<00:01:21.229> be<00:01:21.320> required<00:01:22.010> because<00:01:22.520> you

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
it that wouldn't be required because you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.210 
it that wouldn't be required because you
need<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.150> be<00:01:23.450> in<00:01:24.350> order<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.740> have<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:24.890> guard

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
need to be in order to have a guard

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.550 
need to be in order to have a guard
railing<00:01:25.729> you<00:01:27.040> by<00:01:28.040> code<00:01:28.580> I'm<00:01:28.939> saying<00:01:29.689> not<00:01:30.229> just

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
railing you by code I'm saying not just

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.260 
railing you by code I'm saying not just
to<00:01:30.680> happen<00:01:30.979> anybody<00:01:31.310> can<00:01:31.460> build<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.760> guard<00:01:32.030> rail

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
to happen anybody can build a guard rail

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.710 
to happen anybody can build a guard rail
but<00:01:32.960> building<00:01:33.590> codes<00:01:33.860> would<00:01:34.640> require<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.390> guard

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
but building codes would require a guard

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.710 
but building codes would require a guard
rail<00:01:35.990> if<00:01:36.260> you<00:01:36.920> were<00:01:37.189> 30<00:01:37.880> inches<00:01:38.330> from<00:01:38.600> the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
rail if you were 30 inches from the

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.539 
rail if you were 30 inches from the
ground<00:01:38.810> do<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.380> see<00:01:39.590> we're<00:01:39.770> about<00:01:39.950> six<00:01:40.340> inches

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
ground do you see we're about six inches

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.450 
ground do you see we're about six inches
here<00:01:40.939> so<00:01:41.150> this<00:01:41.360> guardrail<00:01:41.720> was<00:01:42.140> built<00:01:42.500> to

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
here so this guardrail was built to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.380 
here so this guardrail was built to
actually<00:01:44.420> divert<00:01:44.869> traffic<00:01:45.170> in<00:01:45.799> one<00:01:46.100> direction

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
actually divert traffic in one direction

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.580 
actually divert traffic in one direction
they<00:01:47.390> obviously<00:01:47.509> didn't<00:01:48.080> want<00:01:48.290> someone

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
they obviously didn't want someone

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.530 
they obviously didn't want someone
stepping<00:01:49.130> off<00:01:49.430> that<00:01:50.420> side<00:01:50.869> of<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.700> landing<00:01:52.700> so

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
stepping off that side of the landing so

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
stepping off that side of the landing so
and<00:01:54.080> if<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.619> notice<00:01:54.799> too<00:01:55.159> they<00:01:55.520> have<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:56.060> pole

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
and if you notice too they have a pole

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.719 
and if you notice too they have a pole
that<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.860> attached<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:59.750> side<00:02:00.079> of<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
that is attached to the side of the

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.819 
that is attached to the side of the
guard<00:02:01.729> railing<00:02:02.210> or<00:02:02.390> handrail<00:02:02.900> there<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.320> that

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
guard railing or handrail there and that

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.520 
guard railing or handrail there and that
is<00:02:04.040> used<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.520> help<00:02:04.700> people<00:02:05.150> that<00:02:05.869> need

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
is used to help people that need

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.160 
is used to help people that need
something<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.250> hold<00:02:07.430> on<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.700> while<00:02:08.450> entering

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
something to hold on to while entering

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.920 
something to hold on to while entering
the<00:02:10.009> building<00:02:10.520> now<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.940> next<00:02:11.090> thing<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.720> want

this<00:02:13.909> ramp<00:02:14.450> here<00:02:14.959> this<00:02:15.409> definitely<00:02:16.190> isn't<00:02:16.909> to

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
this ramp here this definitely isn't to

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.520 
this ramp here this definitely isn't to

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
require a quarter inch per foot slope so

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.220 
require a quarter inch per foot slope so
for<00:02:26.030> every<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:27.530> foot<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.730> maximum<00:02:29.690> slope

for every one foot the maximum slope

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.710 
for every one foot the maximum slope
that<00:02:30.769> you're<00:02:31.519> allowed<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.970> have<00:02:32.209> is<00:02:32.450> one

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
that you're allowed to have is one

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.410 
that you're allowed to have is one
quarter<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.319> an<00:02:33.470> inch<00:02:33.620> per<00:02:34.610> foot<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:35.299> this

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
quarter of an inch per foot and this

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.020 
quarter of an inch per foot and this
looks<00:02:35.629> like<00:02:35.810> it's<00:02:36.019> at<00:02:36.170> least<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:37.099> three<00:02:37.849> inch

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
looks like it's at least a three inch

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.300 
looks like it's at least a three inch
drop<00:02:38.390> which<00:02:38.930> means<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.620> would<00:02:39.920> need<00:02:40.069> to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
drop which means that you would need to

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.729 
drop which means that you would need to
go<00:02:40.489> out<00:02:42.129> about<00:02:43.129> 12<00:02:43.610> feet<00:02:43.970> in<00:02:44.299> order<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.810> have

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
go out about 12 feet in order to have

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.339 
go out about 12 feet in order to have
this<00:02:46.040> as<00:02:46.430> an<00:02:46.670> acceptable<00:02:47.269> ramp<00:02:47.599> so<00:02:47.870> even<00:02:48.200> if

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
this as an acceptable ramp so even if

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.349 
this as an acceptable ramp so even if
we're<00:02:48.500> only<00:02:48.620> talking<00:02:48.920> two<00:02:49.370> inches<00:02:49.879> this<00:02:50.060> ramp

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
we're only talking two inches this ramp

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.210 
we're only talking two inches this ramp
would<00:02:50.540> still<00:02:50.810> need<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.170> go<00:02:51.319> out<00:02:51.590> eight<00:02:52.489> feet<00:02:53.299> so

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
would still need to go out eight feet so

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.500 
would still need to go out eight feet so
just<00:02:55.220> something<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:55.640> think<00:02:55.760> about<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.480> know

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
just something to think about you know

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.500 
just something to think about you know
whenever<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.079> run<00:02:57.260> into<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.849> situation<00:02:58.849> like

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
whenever you run into a situation like

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.839 
whenever you run into a situation like
this<00:02:59.750> where<00:02:59.989> you<00:03:00.140> see<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.409> sign<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:01.370> building's

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
this where you see a sign the building's

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.390 
this where you see a sign the building's
painted<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.540> they<00:03:02.599> got<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.810> ramp<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.680> maybe<00:03:04.310> a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
painted and they got a ramp and maybe a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.210 
painted and they got a ramp and maybe a
little<00:03:04.579> safety<00:03:05.000> rail<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:06.109> know<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:07.010> this

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
little safety rail you know a this this

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.000 
little safety rail you know a this this
is<00:03:07.370> perfect<00:03:07.879> but<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.599> might<00:03:08.870> not<00:03:09.140> meet<00:03:09.560> local

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
is perfect but it might not meet local

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.949 
is perfect but it might not meet local
building<00:03:10.430> codes<00:03:11.590> last<00:03:12.590> but<00:03:12.980> not<00:03:13.010> least<00:03:13.959> the

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
building codes last but not least the

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.259 
building codes last but not least the
measurement<00:03:15.920> between<00:03:16.159> the<00:03:16.519> landing<00:03:17.000> there

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
measurement between the landing there

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.470 
measurement between the landing there
and<00:03:17.859> I<00:03:18.859> believe<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.609> you<00:03:19.669> can't<00:03:19.970> don't<00:03:20.239> quote

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
and I believe and you can't don't quote

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.449 
and I believe and you can't don't quote
me<00:03:20.720> on<00:03:20.750> this<00:03:20.900> but<00:03:21.200> when<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.620> was<00:03:21.859> doing<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.250> lot<00:03:22.400> of

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
me on this but when I was doing a lot of

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.030 
me on this but when I was doing a lot of
bathrooms<00:03:23.120> we<00:03:23.359> need<00:03:23.569> it<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:24.230> these<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.919> these

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
bathrooms we need it and these and these

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.659 
bathrooms we need it and these and these
ramps<00:03:25.730> actually<00:03:26.269> they<00:03:27.109> needed<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.829> five-foot

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
ramps actually they needed a five-foot

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.849 
ramps actually they needed a five-foot
minimum<00:03:29.359> width<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:30.620> front<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.069> a<00:03:31.129> doorway<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:32.239> I

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
minimum width in front of a doorway so I

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.559 
minimum width in front of a doorway so I
don't<00:03:33.859> think<00:03:34.069> they<00:03:34.250> have<00:03:34.459> five<00:03:34.790> feet<00:03:35.120> here<00:03:35.389> and

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
don't think they have five feet here and

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.129 
don't think they have five feet here and
again<00:03:35.810> do<00:03:36.109> not<00:03:36.410> quote<00:03:36.769> me<00:03:36.829> on<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:38.299> we've

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
again do not quote me on that so we've

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.539 
again do not quote me on that so we've
already<00:03:39.319> pointed<00:03:39.739> out<00:03:39.829> a<00:03:39.889> couple<00:03:40.129> of<00:03:40.280> problems

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
already pointed out a couple of problems

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.939 
already pointed out a couple of problems
with<00:03:40.790> landing<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:41.810> might<00:03:42.109> just<00:03:42.139> be<00:03:42.470> another

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
with landing this might just be another

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.259 
with landing this might just be another
problem<00:03:43.549> so<00:03:44.299> it<00:03:44.629> looks<00:03:44.660> like<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.199> doors<00:03:45.440> not

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
problem so it looks like the doors not

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.379 
problem so it looks like the doors not
acceptable<00:03:47.269> for<00:03:47.599> handicapped<00:03:48.819> use<00:03:49.819> got<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.299> be

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
acceptable for handicapped use got to be

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.990 
acceptable for handicapped use got to be
a<00:03:50.419> minimum<00:03:50.959> of<00:03:51.079> 36<00:03:51.680> inches<00:03:52.129> the<00:03:52.400> ramp<00:03:52.730> is

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
a minimum of 36 inches the ramp is

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.159 
a minimum of 36 inches the ramp is
definitely<00:03:53.989> not<00:03:54.970> going<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.090> work<00:03:56.419> and<00:03:56.780> the

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
definitely not going to work and the

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.720 
definitely not going to work and the
width<00:03:57.470> could<00:03:58.310> also<00:03:58.519> be<00:03:58.819> a<00:03:58.849> problem<00:03:59.180> here
