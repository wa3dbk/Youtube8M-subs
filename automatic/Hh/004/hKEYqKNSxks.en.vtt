that'd<00:03:04.040> be<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.190> terrible<00:03:04.459> idea<00:03:04.790> for<00:03:05.090> call<00:03:05.209> of

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
that'd be a terrible idea for call of

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.880 
that'd be a terrible idea for call of
duty<00:03:05.480> because<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.050> is<00:03:06.140> not<00:03:06.230> counter<00:03:06.650> strike

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
duty because this is not counter strike

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.229 
duty because this is not counter strike
counter-strike<00:03:07.489> from<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.790> game<00:03:07.940> for<00:03:08.090> like

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
counter-strike from the game for like

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.900 
counter-strike from the game for like
ten<00:03:09.020> plus<00:03:09.410> years<00:03:09.470> aren't<00:03:09.920> even<00:03:10.130> know<00:03:10.250> but<00:03:10.790> we

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
ten plus years aren't even know but we

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.220 
ten plus years aren't even know but we
should<00:03:11.060> not<00:03:11.180> do<00:03:11.330> hasn't<00:03:11.600> he<00:03:11.660> only<00:03:11.810> this<00:03:12.019> game

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
should not do hasn't he only this game

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.630 
should not do hasn't he only this game
would<00:03:12.320> be<00:03:12.380> awful<00:03:12.860> with<00:03:12.950> his<00:03:13.070> ass<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.250> he<00:03:13.430> only

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
would be awful with his ass and he only

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.729 
would be awful with his ass and he only
call<00:03:14.209> daddy<00:03:14.420> would<00:03:14.570> die<00:03:14.750> if<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:15.080> was<00:03:15.170> snd<00:03:15.500> only

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
call daddy would die if it was snd only

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.530 
call daddy would die if it was snd only
so<00:03:15.950> we<00:03:16.370> need<00:03:16.549> respawn<00:03:16.880> game<00:03:17.060> time<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.330> keep<00:03:17.450> the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
so we need respawn game time to keep the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.390 
so we need respawn game time to keep the
game<00:03:17.600> interesting<00:03:17.780> because<00:03:18.590> call<00:03:18.950> duty<00:03:19.130> gets

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
game interesting because call duty gets

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.789 
game interesting because call duty gets
boring<00:03:19.700> at<00:03:19.790> times<00:03:19.820> watching<00:03:20.440> three<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.590> four
