00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello guys welcome to a video 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.340
 unboxing but today we have no model 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.360
 but something much better than a console 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.340
 sony ps4 playstation 4 released today 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.279
 in the shops a little while ago I went to 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.199
 pick it up we do unboxing together 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.600
 because also for me the first time 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:28.890
 so it will be a double emotion then 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:32.640
 we open the console to that is all 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:42.770
 what you will always find if there is 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:42.770
 we do and we did it 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.559
 then a double over 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:01:07.150
 here it is here, please here 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.110
 very small much smaller than that 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.170
 what I expected 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.610
 what's in the console box 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.520
 obviously dualshock 4 pad new 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.180
 generation and I anticipate that later 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.050
 you will find a substantial comparison between the 24th 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:34.240
 and the old 2a soc 3 then we have that 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:36.550
 what is the guide of the song we know 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.710
 this small cable compartment of 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:45.039
 power here it is, this is a mon 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.440
 earphone there is a headset for chat 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.729
 when you play cute simple but 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.830
 no way we move on to something 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:01.600
 fundamental this is without shadow of 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:04.149
 doubt the cable to charge the 24 is 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.390
 this is a very trivial when 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.390
 very cheap hdmi cable 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:20.470
 here it is new to play pad 284 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.810
 let's take a look at this as a box 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.879
 in the fully in real time 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.230
 so what you see you see it 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:32.459
 me fucking too 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.980
 sorry indeed fuck why 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:40.390
 absurd ergonomics 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.890
 my mother how absurd it is very light 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.510
 very light 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.690
 I remind you of the special features 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.360
 of this pact including trackpad that 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.030
 remember that of the life ps 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.660
 the rear triggers that finally 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.720
 have serious feedback and not like i 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.540
 old hoc paddocks 3 and we have a 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.030
 small small indeed it is a led of 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.709
 notify when when you can when 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.750
 you play for example you get hit 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.069
 turns red or green if the energy at 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.160
 maximum and it will be interesting to see the 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.710
 correct functioning of this trust 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.080
 this is also a speaker then 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.930
 the old classic is very interesting 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.310
 them button extended the analogs that 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.690
 they are a little strange to see there is a 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:36.290
 mix very different from the classic 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.870
 3 that actually eye 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.660
 it would seem to be more delicate 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.430
 converge my exceptional I remember you 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.800
 which I will later publish a comparison 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.850
 between this here two under 4 and 2 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:55.280
 software we go to the main course is the 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:58.580
 the console certainly small 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.980
 smaller when than one 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:09.340
 could make you imagine weight open 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:13.700
 content certainly contained beauty 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.320
 hired very very much much more 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.720
 nice of what i expected fucking 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.400
 the plastics look of excellent quality 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:26.240
 certainly on video the video seemed 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:30.880
 definitely less than quality 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:35.240
 then glossy plastic opaque plastic 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.160
 certainly nice logo comparison 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.590
 mirror chrome playstation 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.580
 beautiful I remind you that the console can 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.180
 be placed both vertically and in 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.090
 horizontal 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.320
 this is a very interesting led of 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.600
 notification that we will see later, however 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.919
 because I will make a video in which you 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.979
 I will present the console 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:02.960
 its working options and everything 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:05.360
 the necessary to have fun so there 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.820
 will also be comparisons on video games 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.979
 I recommend you don't miss them I remind you 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.750
 that this unboxing is exclusive to 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.370
 beecroft games 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.919
 I also remember the excellent store 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.130
 roberto therefore betrayed dot it where 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:21.710
 you can find both the console and i 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:26.260
 games I appreciate excellent and therefore 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:29.890
 take a ride and you won't regret it 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.850
 for now it closes I only present you instead 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:36.840
 I show the last thing that is the 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:41.950
 external sockets for hdmi lan cable 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.960
 there is the cable for the usb camera indeed 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.330
 with usb the owner is wrong yes 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.370
 then it is the classic power cable 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:52.750
 as you see behind the console ventilated in 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.850
 definitely appropriate way at least to 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.310
 eye looks so then we hope not 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.810
 have nasty surprises 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.330
 so this is the beautiful backside the 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.210
 ps4 logo slightly to the touch then the 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.880
 live plastic is much more beautiful than that 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.760
 which at least seemed like a plastic 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.800
 it is not cheaper 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.420
 this is the ps4 this is the video 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.790
 unboxing for bit world games 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.740
 a greeting and see you very much 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.740
 soon follow us bye bye guys
