I think could win the Royal Rumble and
yo<00:00:21.000> just<00:00:21.300> get<00:00:21.449> straight<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.930> what<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> guess

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.350 
matches recently against CM Punk and Men
events<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.309> peer<00:01:05.519> reviews<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.030> stuff<00:01:06.119> like

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
events in peer reviews and stuff like

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.640 
events in peer reviews and stuff like
that<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:07.590> he<00:01:08.130> could<00:01:08.600> finally<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:10.020> his<00:01:10.229> big

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that that he could finally have his big

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.590 
that that he could finally have his big
break<00:01:11.010> by<00:01:11.340> winning<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.909> Royal<00:01:12.090> Rumble<00:01:12.180> which

break by winning the Royal Rumble which

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.140 
break by winning the Royal Rumble which
I<00:01:12.840> hope<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.170> doesn't<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:13.860> that's<00:01:14.790> been<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> big

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
I hope it doesn't but that's been a big

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.179 
I hope it doesn't but that's been a big
possibility<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.110> that's<00:01:16.320> wise<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.159> number

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
possibility and that's wise in at number

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.770 
possibility and that's wise in at number
five<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:17.700> my<00:01:18.090> list<00:01:18.590> no<00:01:19.590> number<00:01:19.830> four<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.780> Randy

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
five for my list no number four is Randy

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.770 
five for my list no number four is Randy
Orton<00:01:21.830> he<00:01:22.830> could<00:01:23.009> return<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:24.630> know<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
Orton he could return and you know you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.300 
Orton he could return and you know you
could<00:01:24.990> come<00:01:25.140> back<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> heel<00:01:25.650> which<00:01:25.860> OB<00:01:26.100> does

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
could come back as a heel which OB does

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.630 
could come back as a heel which OB does
and<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.710> know<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:28.950> he<00:01:29.070> they'll

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and you know then you know if he they'll

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
and you know then you know if he they'll
be<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> surprise<00:01:30.240> return<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:31.229> well<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.619> i'm

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
be like a surprise return as well so i'm

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.530 
be like a surprise return as well so i'm
guessing<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.280> Randy<00:01:32.700> Orton<00:01:32.970> wasn't<00:01:33.360> he

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
guessing that if Randy Orton wasn't he

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.080 
guessing that if Randy Orton wasn't he
would<00:01:33.689> come<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.960> quite<00:01:34.229> late<00:01:34.500> maybe<00:01:34.920> at<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> 25

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
would come in quite late maybe at the 25

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.469 
would come in quite late maybe at the 25
or<00:01:36.450> later<00:01:36.720> mark<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:38.009> if<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.850> was<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.360> happen

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
or later mark so if that was to happen

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.899 
or later mark so if that was to happen
then<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.110> know<00:01:40.200> he<00:01:40.320> could<00:01:40.500> go<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.799> win<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
then you know he could go on win it and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.510 
then you know he could go on win it and
then<00:01:42.150> cash<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.689> no<00:01:43.590> cash<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
then cash in no cash in it's not the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.399 
then cash in no cash in it's not the
money<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> bank<00:01:45.090> he<00:01:45.960> could<00:01:46.140> go<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
money in the bank he could go on to

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.780 
money in the bank he could go on to
Wrestlemania<00:01:46.710> against<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> World

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
Wrestlemania against the World

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.220 
straightaway I think people might boom
maybe<00:02:31.800> but<00:02:32.550> if<00:02:32.700> he<00:02:33.270> was<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.600> come<00:02:33.660> back<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.080> feel

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
maybe but if he was to come back I feel

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.900 
maybe but if he was to come back I feel
like<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.500> got<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> reaction<00:02:35.070> either<00:02:35.460> way<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
like you got a reaction either way and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.910 
like you got a reaction either way and
him<00:02:36.450> coming<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:36.960> when<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> Royal<00:02:37.830> Rumble

him coming on when the Royal Rumble

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.280 
him coming on when the Royal Rumble

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
rumble so that it makes it a triple

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.400 
rumble so that it makes it a triple
threat<00:03:39.810> match<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:42.180> know<00:03:42.330> that's<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.260> know

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
threat match so you know that's you know

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.700 
threat match so you know that's you know
one<00:03:43.710> of<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:43.920> more<00:03:45.230> reasons<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.410> think

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
one of the more reasons that I think

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.000 
one of the more reasons that I think
could<00:03:46.860> happen<00:03:47.070> like<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.970> seems<00:03:48.300> alright<00:03:49.010> if

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
could happen like it seems alright if

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.600 
could happen like it seems alright if
say<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.060> rock<00:03:51.270> won<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:52.590> championship<00:03:53.370> so

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
say the rock won the championship so

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.550 
say the rock won the championship so
simple<00:03:54.090> get<00:03:54.240> his<00:03:54.390> rematch<00:03:54.750> at<00:03:54.990> WrestleMania

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
simple get his rematch at WrestleMania

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.590 
simple get his rematch at WrestleMania
but<00:03:55.770> Johnson<00:03:56.640> also<00:03:56.880> winter<00:03:57.210> while<00:03:57.330> Rumble

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
but Johnson also winter while Rumble
