00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
well the actual fabric is different from

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.270 
well the actual fabric is different from
the<00:00:54.840> waterproofing<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> waterproofing<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the waterproofing the waterproofing is a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.650 
the waterproofing the waterproofing is a
laminate<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.030> laminated<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> the

underside<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> fabric<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.789> can

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
underside of the fabric so we can

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.520 
underside of the fabric so we can
control<00:01:00.300> how<00:01:00.539> waterproof<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.199> make<00:01:01.350> each

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
control how waterproof we make each

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.920 
control how waterproof we make each
fabric<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.940> about<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.449> breathability

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
fabric so what about the breathability

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.410 
fabric so what about the breathability
of<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.379> coat<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.129> still<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> 20,000<00:01:06.299> for

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
of the coat it's still at the 20,000 for

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
of the coat it's still at the 20,000 for
breathability<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:07.170> well<00:01:07.409> because<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.010> your

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
breathability as well because of your

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.750 
breathability as well because of your
laminate<00:01:08.700> okay<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:11.010> inside<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.490> the

really really quickly they use it in a
lot<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.189> different<00:01:29.220> applications<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.180> we

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
lot of different applications but we

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.460 
lot of different applications but we
like<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> use<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.869> inside<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.259> our

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
jacket where we feel the breathability

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.899 
jacket where we feel the breathability
and<00:01:33.119> drying<00:01:34.110> quickly<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.490> where<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.880> need
