00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.009
 with Stefan our body would be 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.550
 language specialist and with basti 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:12.730
 cooked now I see there are already lying 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.010
 three salmon pieces as if in front of him 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.480
 exactly well they schmidt I've herrchen 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.310
 even that brings a fridge that is 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.779
 A silicone back math is simply one 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.820
 Variant to a baking paper melts 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.119
 I am heat resistant up to 230 degrees 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.980
 which gives the even higher temperature 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.199
 endure the right on the 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.699
 home use was completely out 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.920
 animals come here 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.449
 then you can throw away baking paper 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.979
 once thrown away after that and the thing 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.999
 I only need to buy paper once 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:45.699
 I still have to buy but 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:48.909
 baking paper tools perfect so good 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.039
 So silicone underlay klacks beans 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.959
 I see what we do exactly how to do it 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.519
 beautiful call dax that just means 

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:56.079
 the salmon are now sharing a bit 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.819
 pepper salt spice up a bit 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.309
 basil and oil over it and push the 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:02.829
 whole story at 160 to 180 degrees in the 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.590
 and let them just ten 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.030
 minutes and then have 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.299
 beautiful salmon otherwise I have 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.770
 here in a few fresh garden soil the 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.390
 I already cleaned that a bit 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.689
 means they are cut off 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.929
 pulled the strings and do you have this 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.729
 ladies yes they have recognized one 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.929
 notch where they usually feud in there 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.369
 I already have that and I already have it 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:28.780
 better that way 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.299
 angeber with the upper with her 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.219
 single bad so kaplan here that 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.770
 means a few short hot water 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.359
 cooked and the give was with afterwards 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.859
 fried so I diced it 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.130
 potatoes and tastes together a 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.130
 banner 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:50.380
 the one in Austria 8 1 rumored yes too 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.789
 home 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.710
 very good one of you two 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.520
 Key figures like the potatoes just 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:10.550
 to roll the dice that means you just 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:12.560
 halve and and those and you dig 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.250
 Can not you be my onion? 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.730
 bisect 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.019
 there and only so in herd 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.060
 distinguish between stripes 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.680
 the good but there are the last tips 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.150
 you always ask but there is 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.970
 against watery eyes when 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.530
 I really like to cut onion 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.940
 businesslike sharp knife is 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.069
 in any case ever advantageous 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.330
 because you make the onion more tailor 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.870
 It is considered that you are the essential oils 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.840
 express the then afterwards on the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.090
 tear glands express I say 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:47.060
 and otherwise simply eyes to and through 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.160
 you have to stop the Swiss goalkeeper 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.310
 then you have to just listen through it 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.640
 then as I said half way 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.310
 wild 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.660
 stefan how is it in general if 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.160
 Some people want to come to you 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:12.220
 also like to change your body language 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:12.220
 yes I'm glad that 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.850
 People always want to change 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.320
 but I think that's what it's about 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.990
 they want to know how I am on the 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.160
 other actually that is but that 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.570
 much more important than the better 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.760
 know what the body language means 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:53.220
 the others were threatened by steve 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.320
 others disassemble but read 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.940
 probably is very deep down 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.770
 the desire to recognize how do I get 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.140
 the other because it's all 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.550
 such a basic idea nicky on the 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.020
 others as I like it 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.459
 really would like to work 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.070
 But of course there are all these 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.520
 from that one game that this is a 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.050
 anti-attitude does not determine that 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.730
 They are so prejudices where I am then 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.560
 also say because you have to have to also 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.370
 cleaning up so long does not mean yes 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.640
 that of ge is one is just tired 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.740
 and that is a credo of mine thus 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.960
 a half way because it is 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.500
 something scientific and above such 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.150
 I speak not as easy 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.980
 Unfortunately there are no assignable signals 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.169
 the desire of the people yes they want 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:44.220
 know what that means when the markets 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:46.200
 That's how classics come 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.910
 what they know and say somehow 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.560
 that would be three converse market 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.540
 triangle is down or something 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.100
 that's a nonsense it's not like that 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.660
 durable closed 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.030
 I do not know but I do not know 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.860
 At some point he must have said yes here 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.080
 Just on all photos that was it 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.500
 little do you guess what's going on 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.270
 is 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.760
 it is definitely the case 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.410
 markets and now head 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.550
 what does that mean ? 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.330
 you should look like they were before 30 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.050
 years been moved by people stood 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.130
 I have to say that is one 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.110
 peace offer 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.000
 I would never travel that means 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.770
 to stand it always better 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.840
 and the second is sometimes imagined 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.970
 with lehman too easy his 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.470
 holding fingertips together and in front of you 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.130
 There are 500 journalists from all over 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.920
 world 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.260
 most of us would 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.460
 would do something like that at the moment if you did it 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.600
 at the moment, the 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.770
 fingertips very easily 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.940
 hold together 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.790
 then it is already certain 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.040
 sovereignty and saw and heard the 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.540
 whole german series of this signal 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.460
 forward to and believe make it well worth the 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.930
 head over this one just like that 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.390
 rightly, maybe she has simple too 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.320
 I have to ride with mine there has one 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.320
 said makes 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.660
 we have with him with the bacon 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.790
 recognized 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.900
 told with the potatoes on 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.280
 betrayed stabbing 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.810
 moderate double nature just let the 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.210
 quietly stepped on that looks it in 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.360
 get color 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:18.380
 our soil and our onions relatively 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.580
 which are very up front placed right 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.870
 if you go with Kaiser now 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.450
 So it would be with this debt 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.490
 flyers high the one from the asians know 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.860
 score this time I saw the industry 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.600
 with the before after their hobbies easy 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.160
 made it so, too, because I totally like that 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.710
 connection to is because it comes in the 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.880
 pan 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.170
 The same conclusion will be made 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:43.610
 pivoted come bit off 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:46.490
 pepper salt card give birth to the 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:50.000
 numerous smoke flavor and the whole 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:53.330
 there's then up over it I find 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.450
 just pretty cool because of that 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.860
 inhospitable funny Quite to the contrary so 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.440
 We look forward to the food and will be 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.530
 the times in life 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.270
 I disassemble again as well 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:08.400
 Dry year, the world dive their 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.400
 body language income is involved
