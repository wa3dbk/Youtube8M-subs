and then you can get down here you guys
don't<00:03:04.380> think<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.800> all<00:03:04.920> sweet<00:03:05.220> under<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.550> well

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
don't think it all sweet under that well

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.480 
don't think it all sweet under that well
not<00:03:07.080> really<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.560> do<00:03:07.710> something<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:08.160> watch

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
not really to do something that's watch

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.760 
not really to do something that's watch
you<00:03:08.730> every<00:03:08.880> time<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.360> really<00:03:09.960> am<00:03:10.050> welcome<00:03:10.560> what

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
you every time I really am welcome what

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.720 
you every time I really am welcome what
it<00:03:10.860> really<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:12.380> um<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:14.040> probably<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.460> very

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
it really is um this probably is very

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.930 
it really is um this probably is very
your<00:03:14.970> interior<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:17.220> they're<00:03:17.400> really<00:03:17.640> hard<00:03:17.880> to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
your interior and they're really hard to

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.910 
your interior and they're really hard to
get<00:03:18.090> around<00:03:18.210> i<00:03:18.570> mean<00:03:18.750> i<00:03:19.020> don't<00:03:19.710> think<00:03:19.860> i've

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
get around i mean i don't think i've

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.790 
get around i mean i don't think i've
ever<00:03:20.010> been<00:03:20.250> under<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:20.850> map<00:03:21.090> before<00:03:21.800> except

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
ever been under this map before except

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.130 
ever been under this map before except
for<00:03:22.830> this<00:03:23.160> what<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.580> was<00:03:23.790> calm<00:03:24.030> doing<00:03:24.300> it<00:03:24.390> now

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.240 

then<00:03:31.140> eventually<00:03:31.350> if<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.740> just<00:03:31.920> keep<00:03:32.040> going

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
then eventually if you just keep going

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.060 
then eventually if you just keep going
out<00:03:32.520> there<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.240> fall<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:33.990> just<00:03:34.530> endlessly<00:03:37.070> so

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
out there you fall and just endlessly so

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.970 
out there you fall and just endlessly so
it's<00:03:38.570> kind<00:03:39.570> of<00:03:39.630> pointless<00:03:39.810> going<00:03:40.380> on<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.770> map

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
it's kind of pointless going on the map

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.950 
it's kind of pointless going on the map
that<00:03:41.250> I'll<00:03:41.460> explain<00:03:41.880> our<00:03:42.120> top<00:03:42.390> of<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.600> village

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
that I'll explain our top of the village

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.350 
that I'll explain our top of the village
I<00:03:45.890> mean<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.070> can<00:03:47.310> try<00:03:47.520> to<00:03:47.580> find<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.940> way<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.120> get

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
I mean you can try to find a way to get

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.800 
I mean you can try to find a way to get
back<00:03:48.930> inside<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:50.010> math<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.880> don't<00:03:51.690> think

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
back inside the math but I don't think

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:00.690 
back inside the math but I don't think
it's<00:03:51.990> possible

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.390 

ok<00:04:01.420> I'd<00:04:01.720> like<00:04:01.780> explored<00:04:02.650> this<00:04:02.830> so<00:04:03.099> many<00:04:03.280> times

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
ok I'd like explored this so many times

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:15.820 
ok I'd like explored this so many times
I<00:04:07.950> am<00:04:08.950> I'm<00:04:09.310> like<00:04:09.489> that<00:04:09.700> even<00:04:09.790> sure

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.130 

yeah<00:04:16.459> I'm<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:17.239> like<00:04:17.420> going<00:04:17.750> around<00:04:17.870> in

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
yeah I'm just like going around in

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:29.650 
yeah I'm just like going around in
circles<00:04:18.170> right<00:04:18.739> now<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:25.370> that's<00:04:25.580> that

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.550 

well<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.290> can't<00:04:30.890> get<00:04:31.130> back<00:04:31.310> up<00:04:31.550> there<00:04:31.760> so<00:04:32.560> that's

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
well I can't get back up there so that's

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.720 
well I can't get back up there so that's
bear<00:04:33.920> with<00:04:34.100> me

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:53.820 

accidentally<00:04:42.730> put<00:04:42.940> it<00:04:43.030> on<00:04:43.120> their<00:04:43.360> soul<00:04:48.900> okay

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:17.119 

go<00:04:54.340> back<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.730> that<00:04:54.850> building<00:04:55.120> right<00:04:55.390> there

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:26.820 

and<00:05:17.639> this<00:05:17.849> pool<00:05:18.209> on<00:05:18.449> down<00:05:18.779> here

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:45.970 

run

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:59.950 

ok<00:05:46.760> around<00:05:47.510> next<00:05:47.780> week

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.170 

and<00:06:00.500> then<00:06:00.680> you<00:06:00.800> get<00:06:00.889> some<00:06:01.069> years<00:06:01.280> and<00:06:01.729> you<00:06:02.060> can

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
and then you get some years and you can

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.890 
and then you get some years and you can
go<00:06:02.330> onto<00:06:02.449> the<00:06:02.539> map<00:06:02.720> again<00:06:02.960> but<00:06:03.740> you<00:06:03.979> know

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
go onto the map again but you know

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.850 
go onto the map again but you know
whether<00:06:05.900> I<00:06:05.990> don't<00:06:06.229> have<00:06:06.350> to<00:06:06.470> get<00:06:06.620> all<00:06:06.680> that

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
whether I don't have to get all that

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:15.530 
whether I don't have to get all that
great<00:06:07.160> so<00:06:07.430> just<00:06:07.580> remember<00:06:07.699> that

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
boom boom boom right I'll go on a map

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.970 
boom boom boom right I'll go on a map
