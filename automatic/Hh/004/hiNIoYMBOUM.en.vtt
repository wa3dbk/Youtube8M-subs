00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
early game like perfectly like we had a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.830 
early game like perfectly like we had a
huge<00:00:26.070> lead<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.849> mean<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> team<00:00:27.359> comp<00:00:27.599> was

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
huge lead but I mean the team comp was

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.870 
huge lead but I mean the team comp was
kind<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.109> like<00:00:28.289> really<00:00:29.160> hard<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.519> close<00:00:29.670> out

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
kind of like really hard to close out

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.150 
kind of like really hard to close out
again<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.449> with<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> KLT<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
again so with like the KLT like the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.490 
again so with like the KLT like the
Draven<00:00:32.579> damage<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.120> ridiculous<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.989> mean<00:00:34.350> in

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
Draven damage is ridiculous so I mean in

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.720 
Draven damage is ridiculous so I mean in
the<00:00:34.620> end<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.829> might<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.219> managed<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.520> pull<00:00:35.670> it

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the end we might we managed to pull it

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.620 
the end we might we managed to pull it
out<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.090> definitely<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.390> hard-fought

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630

going to be down there for a while

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.760 
going to be down there for a while
velocity<00:00:54.870> by<00:00:55.020> no<00:00:55.230> means<00:00:55.440> should<00:00:55.649> be

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
velocity by no means should be

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.560 
velocity by no means should be
classified<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.879> bottom<00:00:57.270> team<00:00:57.449> like

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570

time in the LCS like we've managed like

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.870 
time in the LCS like we've managed like

I<00:01:17.070> mean<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.880> due<00:01:17.970> time<00:01:18.150> velocity<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.750> like

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I mean with due time velocity is like

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.210 
I mean with due time velocity is like
gonna<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:19.350> with<00:01:19.560> everyone<00:01:20.100> else

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220

a different experience at the very least

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.850 
a different experience at the very least
because<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.689> are<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.140> part<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> LCS

so<00:02:52.830> yeah<00:02:53.010> i<00:02:53.280> probably<00:02:53.850> could<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.540> played<00:02:54.750> a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
so yeah i probably could have played a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.520 
so yeah i probably could have played a
lot<00:02:54.990> better<00:02:55.020> but<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:56.310> mean<00:02:57.300> that's<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.260> that's

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
lot better but I mean that's just that's

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.830

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
to cope with it well I mean I put on the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.700 
to cope with it well I mean I put on the
best<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.150> could<00:03:03.210> have<00:03:03.420> done<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.590> that

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
best I could have done that in that

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.980 
best I could have done that in that
