 new video good I ask you and great 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.440
 for the snap chat section that as 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.429
 you know, nobody is a network 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.220
 social to send photographs 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.050
 among other friends but the good or bad 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.279
 of this is that they can only last 10 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.810
 seconds and they have to be taken 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.250
 during the moment you are going to send it 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.109
 and with this tweet we will be able to send 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.000
 photographs that we have on the reel 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.349
 at that time or also put some 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.570
 color texts change what is the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.890
 letter to put the text and also it 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.809
 they could save the photographs that they do not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.190
 himself his friends among other things 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.079
 but good now I will show you how 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.149
 it works the week simply enter 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.230
 thinking snap sets as you see now we 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.670
 puts what is a little happiness that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.040
 it has been taken up that there 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.629
 We can choose photos or videos from 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.370
 our reel for example me here 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.329
 I will direct what is this photography and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.340
 now he gives us what is an excellent 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.719
 editor to edit them from there 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.910
 same for example that I can add 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.649
 some filter I can put some text 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.600
 a sticker change what is the brightness 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.430
 the contrast the contrast forgiveness 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.379
 the focus what size to cut it 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.210
 and anything else and once done 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.379
 all that we simply give to ready and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.659
 will conform that already puts us what is the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.429
 edited photo to be able to add some 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.979
 and also something that can be changed what 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:12.569
 which is the font of the letter of the text or 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.069
 the color the size and all that 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.140
 we simply arrive when one says 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.670
 text effects and there would be the options 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.170
 for example to change what is the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.729
 font size for one I put the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.289
 bigger and that could change what 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.149
 is the color for example in this blue 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.640
 yellow or in this organism that are 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.099
 many colors and that is what the source is 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.990
 of our quality in a different way 

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:33.509
 I started flying and how it changed me around 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.880
 what is the source the color and the size and 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.259

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.539
