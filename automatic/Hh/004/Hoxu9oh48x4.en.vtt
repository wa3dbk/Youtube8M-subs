too it's too difficult to get like the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.810 
too it's too difficult to get like the
overall<00:01:48.180> feel<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> game<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.470> early<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.670> we

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
overall feel of the game so early so we

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.010 
overall feel of the game so early so we
don't<00:01:50.909> want<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.210> go<00:01:51.360> make<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.930> he<00:01:51.990> changes

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
don't want to go make in and he changes

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.649 
don't want to go make in and he changes
on<00:01:52.799> balancing<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.700> whatnot<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.299> it's

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
on balancing and whatnot because it's

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.889 
on balancing and whatnot because it's
just<00:01:54.750> too<00:01:54.930> early<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:56.119> they<00:01:57.119> go<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.570> nerf

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
just too early and then they go in nerf

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.240 
just too early and then they go in nerf

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
turnabout mode assist his press the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.059 
turnabout mode assist his press the
witness<00:02:08.369> there<00:02:09.119> was<00:02:09.330> an

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
witness there was an

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.420 
witness there was an
ssible<00:02:10.399> before<00:02:10.909> no<00:02:11.269> invincibility<00:02:11.780> anymore

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
ssible before no invincibility anymore

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.390 
ssible before no invincibility anymore
so<00:02:13.810> yeah<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:15.290> was<00:02:15.439> like<00:02:15.590> ninety<00:02:16.010> percent<00:02:16.159> of

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
so yeah that was like ninety percent of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.069 
so yeah that was like ninety percent of
the<00:02:16.489> reason<00:02:16.849> people<00:02:16.999> picked<00:02:17.480> Phoenix<00:02:17.930> right

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
the reason people picked Phoenix right

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.059 
the reason people picked Phoenix right
in<00:02:18.139> the<00:02:18.200> first<00:02:18.409> place<00:02:18.499> not<00:02:18.769> that<00:02:18.889> many<00:02:18.980> people

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
in the first place not that many people

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.190 
in the first place not that many people
work<00:02:19.400> but<00:02:20.329> that<00:02:20.480> was<00:02:20.599> pretty<00:02:20.749> much<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.959> reason

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
work but that was pretty much the reason

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.220 
work but that was pretty much the reason
why<00:02:21.469> and<00:02:21.799> now<00:02:22.219> that's<00:02:22.430> gone<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.959> believe

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
why and now that's gone and I believe

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.959 
why and now that's gone and I believe
the<00:02:24.319> only<00:02:24.469> thing<00:02:24.889> they<00:02:25.099> got<00:02:25.249> back<00:02:25.489> for<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.849> is

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:25.969 
the only thing they got back for it is

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.789 
the only thing they got back for it is
that<00:02:25.999> Maya<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.719> Maya<00:02:26.989> shield<00:02:27.349> comes<00:02:27.590> out<00:02:27.769> a

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
that Maya the Maya shield comes out a

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.830 
that Maya the Maya shield comes out a
little<00:02:27.920> bit<00:02:28.159> faster<00:02:28.599> from<00:02:29.599> what<00:02:29.719> I've<00:02:29.810> heard

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
little bit faster from what I've heard

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.440 
little bit faster from what I've heard
that's<00:02:30.139> an<00:02:30.379> alleged<00:02:31.010> changed<00:02:31.939> I<00:02:32.030> mean<00:02:32.180> every

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
that's an alleged changed I mean every

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.819 
that's an alleged changed I mean every
single<00:02:32.689> time<00:02:32.870> somebody<00:02:33.230> said<00:02:33.409> all<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.620> feels

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
single time somebody said all this feels

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.500 
single time somebody said all this feels
slower<00:02:34.189> this<00:02:34.489> feels<00:02:34.730> faster<00:02:35.209> they're<00:02:35.329> almost

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
slower this feels faster they're almost

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.089 
slower this feels faster they're almost
it's<00:02:35.840> almost<00:02:35.959> always<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.439> same<00:02:36.799> and<00:02:36.829> they're

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099
