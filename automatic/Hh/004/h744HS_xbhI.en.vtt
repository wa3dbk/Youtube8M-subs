all<00:00:05.580> right<00:00:05.730> so<00:00:05.940> now<00:00:06.029> we're<00:00:06.210> going<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.390> show<00:00:06.569> you

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
all right so now we're going to show you

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.970 
all right so now we're going to show you
how<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.930> remove<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.099> spring<00:00:08.400> from<00:00:08.790> your<00:00:08.849> shot

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
how to remove the spring from your shot

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.669 
how to remove the spring from your shot
so<00:00:10.980> first<00:00:11.639> step<00:00:11.820> would<00:00:12.000> be<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.240> remove<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
so first step would be to remove the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.330 
so first step would be to remove the
lower<00:00:14.480> hardware<00:00:15.480> out<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> eyelet<00:00:16.230> if<00:00:17.070> it's

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
lower hardware out of the eyelet if it's

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.220 
lower hardware out of the eyelet if it's
narrow<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.060> won't<00:00:18.390> need<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.779> something

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
narrow you won't need to something

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.109 
narrow you won't need to something
around<00:00:19.410> 22<00:00:19.859> millimeters<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.580> good<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
around 22 millimeters is good for the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.810 
around 22 millimeters is good for the
spring<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.570> pass<00:00:21.779> but<00:00:22.529> anything<00:00:22.800> wider<00:00:23.130> you're

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
spring to pass but anything wider you're

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.859 
spring to pass but anything wider you're
going<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.029> need<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.210> remove<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.600> out<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
going to need to remove it out of the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.410 
going to need to remove it out of the
eyelet<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:26.369> allow<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.670> spring<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.240> pass

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
eyelet to allow the spring to pass

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.950 
eyelet to allow the spring to pass
through<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.439> eyelet<00:00:28.880> or<00:00:29.880> over<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> eyelid<00:00:30.840> if

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
through the eyelet or over the eyelid if

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.760 
through the eyelet or over the eyelid if
you<00:00:31.050> will<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:33.390> once<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.960> done<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.620> will

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
you will so once that is done we will

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.240 
you will so once that is done we will
now<00:00:34.890> take<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.840> preload<00:00:36.840> collar<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.380> going

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
now take the preload collar and going

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.619 
now take the preload collar and going
counterclockwise<00:00:39.200> if<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.980> collar<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.149> snug
