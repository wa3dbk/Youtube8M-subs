00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 very long and welcome to one 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.050
 short mod presentation and also i say 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:17.180
 now mood barometer and two 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:20.010
 new modification means better moment 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.109
 weather color map toll and that 's it 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.960
 basically the thought that one 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:30.240
 the terra map you like the color code of the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.550
 political card shows through 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 think it 's pretty cool that you have 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.750
 in other couples play already 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.610
 but I like it 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.800
 I think well I just wanted to 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.500
 ask you how it is for you like that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.480
 Friends space wanted like that 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.070
 looks with the clarity 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.670
 table opinion that it is you for 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.440
 he is less practical if displays 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.820
 one sees worse where which nations 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.230
 the whole thing should follow this 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.770
 And that's how everything makes a difference 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.270
 darker ones tend to print where relative 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.580
 So you have little problems like I have since 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.760
 I think that's pretty cool 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.310
 But I have the optics behind it 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.920
 grades feeling that so in the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.380
 small-scale state of Germany in particular 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.409
 the clarity here a bit 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.939
 Unfortunately it is not lost 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.939
 is possible or 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.810
 maybe just awkward too 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.150
 exactly who with the models do not look out of it 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.430
 is not your own card really needs 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.920
 Simple diplomatic card mode over 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.160
 so unfortunately you can not 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.390
 to admit 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.920
 I might even try me in the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.720
 to read files when I look 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.720
 I can put some cards 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.960
 give him more user so I sat finds 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.850
 visually cool but will be 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.290
 I can now over the small states 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.570
 that's just fine 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.110
 clarity lost 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.110
 Personally, I find it very quiet 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.930
 By the way, the limits are also at least 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:18.130
 is simple incredibly simple map orders 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.660
 Just motti the borders a bit 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.920
 I think that is clearer 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:30.200
 actually quite ok and one 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.050
 kart wii user i am many 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.760
 cards mo di mi 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.690
 what the hell is a sphere of influence 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.690
 cards mode 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:55.190
 traffic reaches the mode why's there 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.240
 namely a cadmus by I know I 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.240
 never used it 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.720
 you should really do some things 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.670
 I still use not only 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.190
 in individual worth was playing cards 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.870
 mode because the yes for whom anyway 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.900
 Everything but I gave that you can not do so 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.879
 just override that with precision 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.700
 also do not modify 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.319
 used follow garden mode but me 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.930
 had as much opportunity as new 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.349
 politics hard i find optically relative 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.700
 cool the clarity, sorry something 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:37.319
 see below is for displays 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.970
 probably a little less sensible 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.079
 otherwise they are playing at home 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.750
 definitely want 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:46.489
 Looks at you definitely 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.489
 what's going on
