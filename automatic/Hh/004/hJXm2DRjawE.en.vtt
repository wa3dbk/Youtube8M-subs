00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.560 
this looks really cool so last minute I
decided<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.739> spray-paint<00:02:44.340> my<00:02:44.700> turkey<00:02:45.330> sign

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
decided to spray-paint my turkey sign

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.420 
decided to spray-paint my turkey sign
for<00:02:45.870> my<00:02:45.989> room<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.410> wanted<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.860> gold<00:02:47.160> just

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
for my room and I wanted this gold just

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.009 
for my room and I wanted this gold just
to<00:02:47.549> match<00:02:47.700> him<00:02:47.940> with<00:02:48.090> some<00:02:48.239> other<00:02:48.390> things<00:02:48.690> and

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
to match him with some other things and

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.130 
to match him with some other things and
I<00:02:49.709> sprayed<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.280> with<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:51.090> original<00:02:51.720> gold

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
I sprayed this with the original gold

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.990 
I sprayed this with the original gold
spray<00:02:52.410> paint<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.860> then<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.400> doesn't<00:02:53.580> like<00:02:53.820> how

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
spray paint and then it doesn't like how

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.120 
spray paint and then it doesn't like how
that<00:02:54.060> looked<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:54.870> got<00:02:55.350> some<00:02:55.530> super<00:02:55.920> gold

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
that looked so I got some super gold

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.130 
that looked so I got some super gold
metallic<00:02:56.730> spray<00:02:56.940> paint<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.480> then<00:02:57.690> went<00:02:57.870> over

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
metallic spray paint and then went over

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:06.740 
metallic spray paint and then went over
and<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> was<00:02:58.500> amazing<00:03:04.970> then<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.150> decided<00:03:06.540> I

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
and it was amazing then I decided I

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.039 
and it was amazing then I decided I
would<00:03:06.810> spray-paint<00:03:07.380> my<00:03:07.769> phaz<00:03:08.489> white<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.510> I

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
would spray-paint my phaz white and I

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.050 
would spray-paint my phaz white and I
didn't<00:03:10.290> actually<00:03:10.410> film<00:03:10.769> this<00:03:10.980> but<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:11.790> did
