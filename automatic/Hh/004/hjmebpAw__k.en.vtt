00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.890
 Welcome to Austria as it knows 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.350
 Today I want to show you how 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.809
 I use my tablet with my laptop 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.760
 connecting is actually the same 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.370
 even if I now with a pc 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.340
 I should connect like that 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.470
 this can already be connected 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.630
 this is the course 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:28.350
 and here i have my tablet i think 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.820
 that church down on start I had to 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.560
 for hours any software 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.260
 install the complete computer 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.089
 So I really just have to get infected 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.039
 connect devices together and it can 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.379
 I'll go and watch it here 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:44.280
 down to start 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.129
 the on computer and then stop 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.499
 directly access my device 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.999
 at the xp system who is now so me 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:55.199
 go to start and then on 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:57.389
 workplace portable devices portable 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.329
 media playback device is called that 

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:01.920
 in German 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.280
 and I have daniele the SD card 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.590
 and there the internal memory 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.320
 that is a very cool feature with the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.750
 sd card because if you are more from now 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.719
 I should go from a tablet 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.219
 remove the SD card and now to 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.640
 insert example in my mobile phone 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:23.130
 to edit the file further 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.960
 but I could now synonymous sd card 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.020
 away and in my laptop 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.479
 just plug in the slots 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.560
 my data are right on 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.869
 to edit 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.299
 that's not the case with other manufacturers 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.950
 possible if the battery then goes empty the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.759
 really does not last long in mine 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.189
 eyes then the files are also from 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.679
 then until the battery is full again that 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.009
 it is not so with the operating systems 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:52.170
 given so I go now in the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.640
 Aesthetic but a bit full 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.829
 I will probably have a seat 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.420
 I'll go to the SD card like this 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.930
 he sends down nice free time 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.280
 surface 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.550
 can now right here 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.970
 But mouse button I press to go 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.540
 I'm on new folder and I already have 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:20.030
 created a new folder there is the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.750
 I could if I call now time calls 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.750
 the folder 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.970
 it took it takes a bit far 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.970
 takes over 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.709
 Of course, the place 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.510
 since I have just created and indeed 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.980
 if this case should happen that 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.209
 to the complete surface to halt 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.060
 besides, the files just minimize the 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.269
 you want to copy with the right one 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:02.689
 click mouse button 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:03.889
 copy the file back to the 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.200
 access folder 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:12.709
 from the temple then right again 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:16.010
 mouse button and empathize and the file like that 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.829
 simply absolutely ingenious system 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.709
 I do not want to say now 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:24.519
 idiot-proof but it is very good 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.609
 succeeded and when it comes to work 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:31.669
 that makes a lot of people absolutely absolute 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.150
 Thank you very much and see you 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.150
 next time
