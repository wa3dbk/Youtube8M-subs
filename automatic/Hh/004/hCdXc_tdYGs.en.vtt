00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 emma watson will be back in october 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.580
 as a main actress in a thriller 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.080
 to see in german cinemas and 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.760
 With that we would be at first sight 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.760
 teaser to migration 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.039
 i am detective blues connoisseur and i am 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.500
 the fourteenth october 1990 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.079
 it is very important that all 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.419
 tells the be me that is their 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:31.719
 no one hurt anymore after yours 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.870
 head completely free behind the pendulum what 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:36.550
 are you watching? 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.550
 There is a knock on the door 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.460
 she has such a strange smile in her face 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 face 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.250
 they can all wear black me 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.970
 vestments 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.970
 black invest 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:58.930
 now they will be performed at this 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.190
 case I have the feeling it is 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.190
 much more behind it 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.210
 if I have a really good teaser and 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.380
 also does exactly the job the anti sun 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.880
 should not do too much of that 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.070
 story betrayed but by the mood 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.329
 first attract the audience 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.250
 that means a little bit of taste and 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.810
 I want to do more and it will 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.429
 really scary and scary 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.780
 end of me almost in some moments so 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.490
 a bit of singles at that 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.409
 not a horror movie should be here 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.090
 but already a thriller regression 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.610
 will probably take off and tobis film 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.750
 the first october 2015 in the german 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.520
 Cinemas tells the story of one 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.469
 Police officers played bruce Keller 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.390
 by ethan hawke and he investigates in that 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.819
 case of a girl who is 17 years old 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.799
 played by emma watson her name is angel 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.929
 but she seems to at least what i am in 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.759
 one of her dreams is told 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.439
 to have become atheistic ritual 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.060
 and above all, she also believes that you 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.170
 Father had nothing to do with that 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.689
 only mistreatment of a minor 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.700
 is thoughts and traumatic, yes or 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.349
 leaving a trauma over it 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.329
 addition to very deep into a cult him 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.979
 The cruel and, above all, can descend 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.269
 can show human abysses yes 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.200
 that should be the core topic in 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.700
 be regression 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.500
 and there I find in the ten times in the 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.450
 occupation with emma watson and above all 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.680
 left a total of two absolute 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.299
 Character mines also relatively 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.560
 unequal but hopefully are tense 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.510
 that fit together a really fine one 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.280
 that 's why I'm looking forward to the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.720
 first october on which feeling have 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.310
 that he will be such a small fine film 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.600
 not necessarily see the mainstream 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.220
 But that's exactly what keeps Emma 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.420
 watson pick up a lot 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.980
 who else might see the movies 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.480
 I would think that's something I can do 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.650
 am at least curious what says 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.239
 you like this treasure in the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.069
 comments and like to read a thumb there 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.870
 if this video was made let it 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.370
 we do not stay that way otherwise 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.690
 There are still a few left and me 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.519
 around and tomorrow 15 clock of course 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.440
 at the latest a new video 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.569
 I hope to be with you again 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.569
 of course at 3
