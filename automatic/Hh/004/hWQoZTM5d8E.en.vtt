 which secret room is located 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:34.240
 here you need to pass here the lever over the first 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.400
 blocks and go through 10 iron isolt and 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.050

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.320
 the very last room 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:47.890
 this is a laboratory with sewage 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:54.070
 but itâ€™s just like there in theory should 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:57.640
 live live giant rats which 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:01.330
 the idea came from the fact that in the kitchen 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.600
 someone litters and they appeared here 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.760
 this is their kind of lab where you can 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.700
 remember your subordinate 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.750

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:19.320

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:21.910
 there is a pipe which is a dirty lake and 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.900
 hiding place in this lake 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.720

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.790
 you can already finish with you 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.920
