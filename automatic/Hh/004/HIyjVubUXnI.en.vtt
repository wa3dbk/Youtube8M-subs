figured out what trick steps were and
then<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:12.950> wanted<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.880> know<00:02:13.940> explore<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.750> a

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
then I wanted to you know explore that a

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.020 
then I wanted to you know explore that a
little<00:02:14.930> bit<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:16.010> really<00:02:16.460> put<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> lot<00:02:16.790> of

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
little bit and I really put a lot of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.300 
little bit and I really put a lot of
time<00:02:17.210> into<00:02:17.510> learning<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:18.020> remember<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:19.010> first

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
time into learning I remember the first

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.180 
time into learning I remember the first
time<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:20.260> learned<00:02:21.260> about<00:02:21.380> trick<00:02:21.770> steps<00:02:22.010> I

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
time I I learned about trick steps I

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.820 
time I I learned about trick steps I
went<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.460> two<00:02:22.640> four<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:24.230> sat<00:02:24.530> in<00:02:24.560> the

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
went to two four and I sat in the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.620 
went to two four and I sat in the
tunnels<00:02:25.190> all<00:02:25.400> day<00:02:25.640> long<00:02:25.880> just<00:02:26.180> trying<00:02:26.510> to

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
tunnels all day long just trying to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.870 
tunnels all day long just trying to
figure<00:02:27.440> out<00:02:27.620> if<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:27.890> could<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> corner<00:02:28.490> stab

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
figure out if I could do a corner stab

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.870 
figure out if I could do a corner stab
if<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.390> could<00:02:29.570> actually<00:02:29.660> get<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.680> down<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.250> you

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
if I could actually get it down and you

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.420 
if I could actually get it down and you
know<00:02:31.970> just<00:02:32.270> having<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.990> bit<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.560> dedication<00:02:33.740> to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
know just having a bit of dedication to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.850 
know just having a bit of dedication to
actually<00:02:34.820> getting<00:02:35.150> better<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.600> improving<00:02:36.020> is

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
actually getting better and improving is

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.800 
actually getting better and improving is
what<00:02:37.100> really<00:02:37.280> helped<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.330> there's<00:02:38.510> something

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
what really helped and there's something

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.990 
what really helped and there's something
that<00:02:38.870> really<00:02:38.960> bothers<00:02:39.530> me<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.830> bit<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.580> that<00:02:40.610> a

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
that really bothers me a bit is that a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.290 
that really bothers me a bit is that a
lot<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.420> spies<00:02:41.720> just<00:02:42.170> use<00:02:42.350> one<00:02:42.740> set<00:02:43.580> they<00:02:44.060> just

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
lot of spies just use one set they just

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.620 
lot of spies just use one set they just
use<00:02:44.480> one<00:02:44.870> set<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:46.820> know<00:02:46.940> there's<00:02:47.180> there's

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
use one set you know there's there's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.420 
use one set you know there's there's
spies<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.350> use<00:02:48.500> just<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:49.040> dead<00:02:49.220> ringer

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
spies that use just a dead ringer

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.790 
spies that use just a dead ringer
ambassador<00:02:50.330> butterfly<00:02:51.170> knife<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.590> that's

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
ambassador butterfly knife and that's

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.980 
ambassador butterfly knife and that's
like<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:53.090> know<00:02:53.120> they<00:02:53.330> don't<00:02:53.360> switch<00:02:53.780> they're

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
like you know they don't switch they're

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.080 
like you know they don't switch they're

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
really good you have to know when to

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.530 
really good you have to know when to
switch<00:03:00.230> your<00:03:00.470> sets<00:03:00.770> a<00:03:01.010> lot<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.640> switch<00:03:02.120> my<00:03:02.270> sets

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
switch your sets a lot I switch my sets

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.840 
switch your sets a lot I switch my sets
all<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.020> time<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.560> might<00:03:04.280> switch<00:03:04.459> my<00:03:04.610> sets

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
all the time I might switch my sets

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.630 
all the time I might switch my sets
three<00:03:05.090> or<00:03:05.209> four<00:03:05.420> times<00:03:05.660> during<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.990> match<00:03:06.640> and

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
three or four times during a match and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.610 
three or four times during a match and
that's<00:03:07.940> not<00:03:08.180> even<00:03:08.420> that's<00:03:08.959> not<00:03:09.140> even<00:03:09.230> out<00:03:09.530> of

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
that's not even that's not even out of

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.470 
that's not even that's not even out of
the<00:03:09.680> ordinary<00:03:10.070> because<00:03:10.370> once<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.300> know<00:03:11.330> how

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
the ordinary because once you know how

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.780 
the ordinary because once you know how
to<00:03:11.570> use<00:03:11.810> everything<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.470> know<00:03:12.680> which<00:03:13.070> sets

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
to use everything you know which sets

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.520 
to use everything you know which sets
are<00:03:14.000> better<00:03:14.150> for<00:03:14.390> which<00:03:14.510> situations<00:03:15.170> it's

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
are better for which situations it's

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.810 
are better for which situations it's
going<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:15.800> make<00:03:15.950> spying<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.489> lot<00:03:16.700> easier<00:03:18.790> so<00:03:19.790> I

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
going to make spying a lot easier so I

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.100 
going to make spying a lot easier so I
think<00:03:20.060> it's<00:03:20.150> really<00:03:20.300> silly<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.870> limit

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
think it's really silly to limit

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.110 
think it's really silly to limit
yourself<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.530> just<00:03:21.620> one<00:03:21.860> set<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.940> think

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
yourself to just one set and I think

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.550 
yourself to just one set and I think
that's<00:03:23.300> holding<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.900> lot<00:03:24.080> of<00:03:24.110> people<00:03:24.350> back<00:03:24.530> from

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
that's holding a lot of people back from

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.000 
that's holding a lot of people back from
getting<00:03:25.070> really<00:03:25.280> good<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:27.590> know<00:03:27.709> so<00:03:27.860> that's

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
getting really good you know so that's

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.590 
getting really good you know so that's
basically<00:03:28.519> what<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:28.790> think<00:03:29.090> about<00:03:29.180> spy

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
basically what I think about spy

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.940 
basically what I think about spy
plateaus<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.350> how<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:30.980> can<00:03:31.400> pass<00:03:31.610> them<00:03:32.950> just

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
plateaus and how you can pass them just

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.250 
plateaus and how you can pass them just
learn<00:03:34.280> all<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.790> weapons<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.390> best<00:03:35.630> as<00:03:35.930> you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
learn all the weapons the best as you

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.960 
learn all the weapons the best as you
can<00:03:36.500> try<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.070> get<00:03:37.160> really<00:03:37.400> good<00:03:37.610> at<00:03:37.760> all<00:03:37.940> of

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
can try and get really good at all of

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.050 
can try and get really good at all of
them<00:03:38.420> find<00:03:39.170> out<00:03:39.320> what<00:03:39.380> they're<00:03:39.800> good<00:03:39.980> for<00:03:40.060> and

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
them find out what they're good for and

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.570 
them find out what they're good for and
yeah<00:03:41.930> practice<00:03:42.440> trick<00:03:42.680> stabs<00:03:42.980> really<00:03:43.370> well

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
yeah practice trick stabs really well

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.790 
yeah practice trick stabs really well
one<00:03:44.570> thing<00:03:44.720> about<00:03:44.870> practicing<00:03:45.410> trick<00:03:45.560> stabs

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
one thing about practicing trick stabs

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.490 
one thing about practicing trick stabs
is<00:03:46.010> you're<00:03:46.280> more<00:03:46.780> practicing<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.959> movement

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
is you're more practicing the movement

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.320 
is you're more practicing the movement
of<00:03:48.590> people<00:03:48.769> in<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.370> actual<00:03:49.489> trick<00:03:49.880> steps<00:03:50.090> once

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
of people in the actual trick steps once

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.070 
of people in the actual trick steps once
you<00:03:50.450> get<00:03:50.570> familiar<00:03:50.959> with<00:03:51.290> how<00:03:51.769> people<00:03:52.130> move

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
you get familiar with how people move

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.740 
you get familiar with how people move
generally<00:03:54.080> you<00:03:54.860> know<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.940> alone<00:03:56.300> is<00:03:56.450> unit

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
generally you know that alone is unit

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.590 
generally you know that alone is unit
