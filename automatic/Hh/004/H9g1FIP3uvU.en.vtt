think<00:03:04.819> that<00:03:05.150> kind<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.450> sucks<00:03:05.750> about<00:03:05.959> this<00:03:06.290> game

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
think that kind of sucks about this game

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.369 
think that kind of sucks about this game
is<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.889> don't<00:03:06.950> think<00:03:07.870> it's<00:03:08.870> basically<00:03:09.290> just

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
is I don't think it's basically just

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.680 
is I don't think it's basically just
lines<00:03:09.889> like<00:03:10.370> if<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:10.579> get<00:03:10.730> four<00:03:10.970> corners<00:03:11.510> or

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
lines like if you get four corners or

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.190 
lines like if you get four corners or
something<00:03:12.079> like<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.409> bingo<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.629> know<00:03:14.750> get

something like in bingo you you know get
some<00:03:15.409> sort<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.739> prize<00:03:15.950> which<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.430> actually

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
some sort of prize which is actually

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.280 
some sort of prize which is actually
really<00:03:16.970> good<00:03:17.090> it's<00:03:17.599> one<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.840> like<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.019> best

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
really good it's one of like the best

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.129 
really good it's one of like the best
things<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.650> get<00:03:18.889> the<00:03:19.699> bingo<00:03:20.030> version<00:03:20.540> of

45 which we do not have 56 which we do

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.599 
45 which we do not have 56 which we do
not<00:04:10.519> have<00:04:11.739> so<00:04:12.739> many<00:04:12.859> one<00:04:13.099> which<00:04:13.280> we<00:04:13.430> do<00:04:13.579> not

not have so many one which we do not
have<00:04:13.940> I<00:04:14.319> stuck<00:04:15.319> out<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.530> few<00:04:16.010> chances<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.609> win

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:16.909 
have I stuck out a few chances to win

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:21.780 
have I stuck out a few chances to win
something<00:04:17.239> there<00:04:17.979> we<00:04:18.979> do<00:04:19.130> not<00:04:19.250> have<00:04:19.310> 11<00:04:20.030> either

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
something there we do not have 11 either

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:30.910 
something there we do not have 11 either
17<00:04:23.800> which<00:04:24.800> we<00:04:25.040> do<00:04:25.190> not<00:04:25.340> have<00:04:28.270> 31<00:04:29.710> it's<00:04:30.710> kind<00:04:30.800> of

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
17 which we do not have 31 it's kind of

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.250 
17 which we do not have 31 it's kind of
nice<00:04:31.100> because<00:04:31.310> we<00:04:31.490> got<00:04:31.610> free<00:04:31.850> spaces<00:04:32.420> here<00:04:33.080> on

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
nice because we got free spaces here on

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.230 
nice because we got free spaces here on
here<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:34.040> there's<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.400> good<00:04:34.550> possibility<00:04:35.180> if

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
here so there's the good possibility if

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.850 
here so there's the good possibility if
we<00:04:35.360> match<00:04:35.540> two<00:04:35.840> lines<00:04:36.080> we<00:04:36.320> could<00:04:36.440> win<00:04:36.590> five

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
we match two lines we could win five

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.700 
we match two lines we could win five
dollars<00:04:37.630> which<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.930> mean<00:04:39.170> it's<00:04:39.320> nothing<00:04:39.680> great

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
dollars which I mean it's nothing great

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.540 
dollars which I mean it's nothing great
but<00:04:40.160> you<00:04:40.520> know<00:04:40.550> keeps<00:04:40.910> playing<00:04:41.360> games<00:04:41.660> longer

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
but you know keeps playing games longer

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.500 
but you know keeps playing games longer
and<00:04:43.550> keeps<00:04:44.000> me<00:04:44.180> making<00:04:44.540> videos<00:04:44.960> longer<00:04:46.510> all

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
and keeps me making videos longer all

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.980 
and keeps me making videos longer all
right<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.380> there's<00:04:48.590> how<00:04:48.890> we're<00:04:49.750> looking<00:04:50.750> so

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
right so there's how we're looking so

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.080 
right so there's how we're looking so
far<00:04:51.260> 46<00:04:52.220> which<00:04:52.460> we<00:04:52.670> do<00:04:52.820> not<00:04:52.970> have<00:04:54.610> 65<00:04:55.610> which<00:04:55.940> we

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
far 46 which we do not have 65 which we

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.320 
far 46 which we do not have 65 which we
don't<00:04:56.240> have<00:04:58.930> 123456<00:05:00.310> so<00:05:01.310> now<00:05:01.730> we're<00:05:01.910> on<00:05:02.000> spin

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
don't have 123456 so now we're on spin

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:10.090 
don't have 123456 so now we're on spin
number<00:05:03.160> 73<00:05:04.160> which<00:05:04.370> we<00:05:04.550> have<00:05:08.320> 19<00:05:09.320> which<00:05:09.680> we<00:05:09.860> have

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
number 73 which we have 19 which we have

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.750 
number 73 which we have 19 which we have
wow<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:10.880> if<00:05:10.970> we<00:05:11.060> got<00:05:11.210> 51<00:05:11.660> we'd<00:05:12.050> get<00:05:12.230> line<00:05:13.070> here

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
wow so if we got 51 we'd get line here

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.740 
wow so if we got 51 we'd get line here
and<00:05:13.970> here<00:05:15.100> so<00:05:16.100> we<00:05:16.760> get<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.060> right<00:05:17.180> numbers<00:05:17.570> we

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
and here so we get the right numbers we

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.470 
and here so we get the right numbers we
could<00:05:17.870> actually<00:05:18.080> want<00:05:18.530> a<00:05:18.590> few<00:05:18.940> decent<00:05:19.940> prizes

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
could actually want a few decent prizes

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.000 
could actually want a few decent prizes
but<00:05:23.480> we<00:05:23.630> probably<00:05:23.870> won't<00:05:24.700> knowing<00:05:25.700> my<00:05:25.850> luck<00:05:27.010> 49

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
but we probably won't knowing my luck 49

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.670 
but we probably won't knowing my luck 49
which<00:05:28.610> we<00:05:28.790> do<00:05:28.970> have<00:05:30.520> 72<00:05:31.520> which<00:05:31.730> we<00:05:31.880> have<00:05:32.320> so<00:05:33.320> as

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
which we do have 72 which we have so as

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.100 
which we do have 72 which we have so as
of<00:05:33.950> right<00:05:34.010> now<00:05:34.220> we<00:05:34.430> have<00:05:35.680> looks<00:05:36.680> like<00:05:37.960> we<00:05:38.960> get<00:05:39.050> a

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
of right now we have looks like we get a

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.980 
of right now we have looks like we get a
5<00:05:39.440> on<00:05:39.920> a<00:05:40.070> 63<00:05:40.550> would<00:05:41.000> be<00:05:41.150> in<00:05:41.240> good<00:05:41.420> shape<00:05:41.480> that

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
5 on a 63 would be in good shape that

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.840 
5 on a 63 would be in good shape that
beat<00:05:42.220> three<00:05:43.220> lines<00:05:45.220> but<00:05:46.220> we<00:05:46.370> have<00:05:46.490> lots<00:05:46.730> of

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
beat three lines but we have lots of

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.720 
beat three lines but we have lots of
