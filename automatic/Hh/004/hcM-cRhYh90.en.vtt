00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
taking a quick look at the mini-map that

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.710 
taking a quick look at the mini-map that
there<00:00:17.010> has<00:00:17.160> been<00:00:17.400> some<00:00:17.609> significant<00:00:18.539> changes

there has been some significant changes
to<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.109> map<00:00:19.380> spawn<00:00:19.980> points<00:00:20.279> are<00:00:20.369> still<00:00:20.430> in

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
to this map spawn points are still in

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.230 
to this map spawn points are still in
the<00:00:20.910> same<00:00:21.180> location<00:00:21.510> spawn<00:00:22.140> points<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
the same location spawn points and the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.000 
the same location spawn points and the
capture<00:00:24.240> points<00:00:24.630> first<00:00:25.350> things<00:00:25.619> first<00:00:25.710> though

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
capture points first things first though

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.320 
capture points first things first though
would<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> try<00:00:26.400> there's<00:00:26.730> quite<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> lot<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.210> look

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
would a try there's quite a lot of look

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.670 
would a try there's quite a lot of look
at<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.750> map<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.289> we're<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> try

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
at on this map but we're going to try

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.480 
at on this map but we're going to try
and<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:28.859> through<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:29.130> quickly<00:00:29.160> as

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and get through it as quickly as

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.200 
and get through it as quickly as
possible<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.810> whilst<00:00:31.019> giving<00:00:31.199> in-depth

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
possible but whilst giving in-depth

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.910 
possible but whilst giving in-depth
ideas<00:00:33.210> whilst<00:00:33.480> doing<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.110> we're<00:00:34.500> try<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.829> do

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
ideas whilst doing it we're try and do

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.250 
ideas whilst doing it we're try and do
it<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.100> some<00:00:35.489> kind<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.210> route<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.989> makes

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it in some kind of route that makes

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.020 
it in some kind of route that makes
sense<00:00:37.559> as<00:00:37.860> well<00:00:38.129> first<00:00:38.489> thing<00:00:38.730> you'll<00:00:38.879> notice

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
sense as well first thing you'll notice

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.380 
sense as well first thing you'll notice
here<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:40.200> lovely<00:00:40.680> elevated<00:00:41.670> region<00:00:42.090> here

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
here is this lovely elevated region here

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.510 
here is this lovely elevated region here
and<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.050> obviously<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:44.100> tank

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and this is obviously for tank

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.740 
and this is obviously for tank
destroyers<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.120> maybe<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.539> get<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
destroyers and maybe we can get the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.360 
destroyers and maybe we can get the
artillery<00:00:46.020> snook<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.770> could<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.160> hauled

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
artillery snook in that could be hauled

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.369 
artillery snook in that could be hauled
just<00:00:47.640> there<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.600> obviously<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.200> play

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
just there and this is obviously to play

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.220 
just there and this is obviously to play
a<00:00:49.410> counter<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> elevated<00:00:51.539> region<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
a counter to the elevated region that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.459 
a counter to the elevated region that
the<00:00:52.379> enemy<00:00:52.649> team<00:00:53.010> has<00:00:53.840> sorry<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.930> will<00:00:55.289> be

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the enemy team has sorry I will be

the enemy team has sorry I will be
calling<00:00:55.649> them<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> southern<00:00:56.730> team<00:00:57.949> after<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
calling them the southern team after the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.270 
calling them the southern team after the
duration<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.609> video<00:01:00.829> excuse<00:01:01.829> me<00:01:02.039> just

duration of this video excuse me just

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.770 
duration of this video excuse me just
because<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.640> could<00:01:02.789> spawn<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.149> either<00:01:03.329> side

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
because you could spawn on either side

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.020 
because you could spawn on either side
obviously<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.700> see<00:01:05.880> this

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
obviously so as you can see this

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.399 
obviously so as you can see this
elevated<00:01:06.420> regions<00:01:06.840> obviously<00:01:07.290> they

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
elevated regions obviously they

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.840 
elevated regions obviously they
counteract<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.950> elevated<00:01:08.310> region<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
counteract the elevated region that the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630 
counteract the elevated region that the
other<00:01:09.030> team<00:01:09.330> has<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.810> light<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.159> massive

changes that have happened to the center
of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.670> map<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.560> well<00:01:16.560> talking<00:01:17.070> about<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
of the map so well talking about the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.170 
of the map so well talking about the
center<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.210> map<00:01:18.420> let's<00:01:18.750> get<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.619> it

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
unchanged the ridgeline up there is

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.130 
unchanged the ridgeline up there is
pretty<00:02:05.430> much<00:02:05.579> exactly<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.329> same<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.810> was

the quickest way to get down here is
going<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.849> from<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.390> road<00:02:27.720> here<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:29.660> then

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
going to be from this road here and then

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.300 
going to be from this road here and then
that<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.930> going<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.170> lead<00:02:31.380> down<00:02:31.709> into<00:02:31.920> this

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
that is going to lead down into this

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.920 
that is going to lead down into this
sunken<00:02:32.580> area<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.150> roads<00:02:33.390> going<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.660> lead

sunken area that roads going to lead

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.449 
sunken area that roads going to lead
around<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.350> back<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.800> Ridge<00:02:35.040> here<00:02:35.069> this

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
around the back of this Ridge here this

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.309 
around the back of this Ridge here this
is<00:02:35.550> going<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.760> lead<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.420> where<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:37.110> just

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
is going to lead up to where we just

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.720 
is going to lead up to where we just
were<00:02:37.440> lead<00:02:37.860> onto<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.580> northern<00:02:40.100> bases<00:02:41.100> base

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
capture zone as you can see there's a

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.509 
capture zone as you can see there's a
lot<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.610> cover<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.360> region<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.519> there's

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
lot of cover in this region and there's

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.520 
lot of cover in this region and there's
another<00:02:47.610> little<00:02:48.060> puffy<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.780> sneaks<00:02:49.080> along

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
another little puffy that sneaks along

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.530 
another little puffy that sneaks along
the<00:02:49.680> edge<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.430> water<00:02:50.670> line<00:02:51.060> don't<00:02:51.360> want<00:02:51.480> to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
the edge of the water line don't want to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.850 
the edge of the water line don't want to
drop<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.930> there<00:02:52.140> because<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.440> ain't<00:02:52.470> coming

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
drop in there because we ain't coming

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
back from that beam you can see because

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.559 
back from that beam you can see because
it's<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.709> depressed<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.549> they're<00:02:56.819> sunken

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
it's so depressed and they're sunken

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.850 
it's so depressed and they're sunken
into<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.900> terrain<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.590> going<00:02:58.680> to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
a lot of protection from fire as you can

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.210 
a lot of protection from fire as you can
see<00:03:05.850> in<00:03:06.030> crest<00:03:06.299> up<00:03:06.510> there<00:03:06.810> which<00:03:07.350> leads<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.799> on

see in crest up there which leads to on
the<00:03:08.700> face<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.150> looks<00:03:09.450> very<00:03:09.540> similar<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.290> how

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the face of it looks very similar to how

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.309 
the face of it looks very similar to how
the<00:03:10.530> map<00:03:10.830> used<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.430> look<00:03:11.660> but<00:03:12.660> if<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:12.870> come<00:03:13.140> up

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
the map used to look but if we come up

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.470 
the map used to look but if we come up
this<00:03:13.769> little<00:03:14.040> rhody<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.819> can<00:03:14.940> start<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.450> see

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
this little rhody you can start to see

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.390 
this little rhody you can start to see
some<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.350> major<00:03:16.620> changes<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.310> have

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
some of the major changes that have

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.880 
some of the major changes that have
happened<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.600> region<00:03:19.019> as<00:03:19.380> well<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.769> this

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
happened to this region as well so this

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.009 
happened to this region as well so this
looks<00:03:20.040> almost<00:03:20.570> unchanged<00:03:21.570> but<00:03:21.660> then<00:03:21.810> when<00:03:21.959> you

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
looks almost unchanged but then when you

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.930 
looks almost unchanged but then when you
have<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.230> look<00:03:22.440> here<00:03:22.709> instead<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.549> can<00:03:23.700> see

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
have a look here instead you can see

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.000 
have a look here instead you can see
that<00:03:24.150> there's<00:03:24.630> actually<00:03:25.079> been<00:03:25.109> some<00:03:25.470> huge

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
that there's actually been some huge

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.569 
that there's actually been some huge
changes<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:26.910> bit<00:03:27.709> this<00:03:28.709> award<00:03:29.220> which

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
changes to this bit this award which

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.280 
changes to this bit this award which
leads<00:03:29.880> all<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.120> way<00:03:30.480> from<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> southern

as is everything in the north
what<00:04:03.630> we'll<00:04:03.810> do<00:04:04.050> is<00:04:04.290> we'll<00:04:04.440> head<00:04:04.680> down<00:04:05.040> this

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
what we'll do is we'll head down this

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.340 
what we'll do is we'll head down this
road<00:04:05.610> as<00:04:05.760> if<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:06.000> were<00:04:06.090> coming<00:04:06.390> here<00:04:06.630> from<00:04:06.990> the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
road as if you were coming here from the

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.570 
road as if you were coming here from the
northern<00:04:07.830> spawn<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:10.290> then<00:04:11.190> head<00:04:11.430> around

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
northern spawn and then head around

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.940 
northern spawn and then head around
towards<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.810> southern<00:04:13.230> beer<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:13.770> you<00:04:13.830> can

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
towards the southern beer so you can

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.440 
towards the southern beer so you can
just<00:04:14.130> take<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.310> quick<00:04:14.490> look<00:04:14.760> at<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:17.299> so<00:04:18.299> as<00:04:18.359> you

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
just take a quick look at that so as you

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.690 
just take a quick look at that so as you
can<00:04:18.540> see<00:04:18.690> great<00:04:19.230> cover<00:04:19.590> afforded<00:04:20.340> here<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.670> I

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
can see great cover afforded here and I

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.280 
can see great cover afforded here and I
can<00:04:20.820> see<00:04:20.970> there's<00:04:21.120> been<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.299> real<00:04:21.570> choke<00:04:21.930> point

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
can see there's been a real choke point

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.620 
can see there's been a real choke point
for<00:04:22.920> heavy<00:04:23.220> tanks<00:04:23.670> battling<00:04:24.120> against<00:04:24.540> each

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
for heavy tanks battling against each

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.970 
for heavy tanks battling against each
other<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:24.990> Rory<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.440> splits<00:04:25.710> off<00:04:25.860> to

other and this Rory the splits off to
the<00:04:26.100> left<00:04:26.310> there<00:04:26.580> which<00:04:27.180> raises<00:04:27.570> up<00:04:28.020> towards

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
the left there which raises up towards

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.990 
the left there which raises up towards
the<00:04:28.500> base<00:04:28.710> or<00:04:28.860> this<00:04:29.040> little<00:04:29.370> bit<00:04:29.520> here<00:04:29.550> gets

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
the base or this little bit here gets

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.690 
the base or this little bit here gets
you<00:04:30.120> extra<00:04:30.630> close<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.680> base<00:04:31.890> as<00:04:32.100> well<00:04:32.490> as

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
you extra close to the base as well as

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.780 
you extra close to the base as well as
you<00:04:32.820> can<00:04:32.880> see<00:04:32.940> we<00:04:33.180> pop<00:04:33.390> up<00:04:33.630> right<00:04:33.990> here<00:04:34.790> one

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
you can see we pop up right here one

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.860 
you can see we pop up right here one
thing<00:04:35.970> that's<00:04:36.150> been<00:04:36.270> changed<00:04:36.600> a<00:04:36.660> lot<00:04:36.810> of

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
thing that's been changed a lot of

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.210

people<00:04:37.110> used<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.320> love<00:04:37.500> camping<00:04:37.890> on<00:04:38.040> that

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
people used to love camping on that

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.740 
people used to love camping on that
ridge<00:04:38.430> line<00:04:38.460> there<00:04:38.940> that's<00:04:39.150> pretty<00:04:39.390> much<00:04:39.540> not

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
ridge line there that's pretty much not

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.280 
ridge line there that's pretty much not
possible<00:04:40.260> anymore<00:04:40.880> as<00:04:41.880> it's<00:04:42.300> been<00:04:42.570> increased

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
possible anymore as it's been increased

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.610 
possible anymore as it's been increased
in<00:04:43.730> height<00:04:44.730> so<00:04:45.630> people<00:04:45.900> can't<00:04:46.110> just<00:04:46.380> hide

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
in height so people can't just hide

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.380 
in height so people can't just hide
behind<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.220> ridge<00:04:47.400> line<00:04:47.640> there<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.000> just<00:04:48.180> lay

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
behind the ridge line there and just lay

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.150

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
this map where you can rest assured that

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.969 
this map where you can rest assured that
if<00:05:27.000> there<00:05:27.120> are<00:05:27.270> any<00:05:27.479> changes<00:05:27.690> there<00:05:28.080> then<00:05:28.590> they

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
if there are any changes there then they

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.950 
if there are any changes there then they
are<00:05:29.160> so<00:05:29.669> minor<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.210> they're<00:05:30.450> not<00:05:30.540> really

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
are so minor that they're not really

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.800 
are so minor that they're not really
going<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.350> make<00:05:31.500> much<00:05:31.800> difference<00:05:32.190> whatsoever

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.390 

as<00:05:36.810> you<00:05:36.900> can<00:05:37.020> see<00:05:37.140> the<00:05:37.290> first<00:05:37.590> little<00:05:37.919> fork<00:05:38.190> of

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
as you can see the first little fork of

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.580 
as you can see the first little fork of
the<00:05:38.669> road<00:05:38.880> leads<00:05:39.120> up<00:05:39.360> to<00:05:39.390> this<00:05:39.660> area<00:05:39.960> here<00:05:40.350> and

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
the road leads up to this area here and

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.310 
the road leads up to this area here and
then<00:05:41.240> you<00:05:42.240> can<00:05:42.360> probably<00:05:42.660> get<00:05:42.810> behind<00:05:43.140> these

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
then you can probably get behind these

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.990 
then you can probably get behind these
rocks<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:43.860> these<00:05:44.010> rocks<00:05:44.370> to<00:05:44.550> take<00:05:44.729> cover

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
rocks and these rocks to take cover

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.370 
rocks and these rocks to take cover
whilst<00:05:45.630> advancing<00:05:46.229> on<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.860> southern<00:05:47.550> base

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.100 

one<00:05:52.380> major<00:05:52.590> addition<00:05:53.130> is<00:05:53.250> this<00:05:53.610> thing<00:05:54.090> here<00:05:54.419> so

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
one major addition is this thing here so

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.110 
one major addition is this thing here so
this<00:05:55.320> huge<00:05:55.770> rock<00:05:56.160> here<00:05:56.400> is<00:05:56.580> again<00:05:56.850> just<00:05:57.060> to

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
this huge rock here is again just to

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.180 
this huge rock here is again just to
offer<00:05:57.300> some<00:05:57.630> protection<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:58.710> that<00:05:58.830> you<00:05:58.919> can't

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
offer some protection so that you can't

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.400 
offer some protection so that you can't
be<00:05:59.340> fired<00:05:59.669> at<00:05:59.910> while<00:06:00.240> making<00:06:00.510> your<00:06:00.900> way<00:06:01.139> in

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
be fired at while making your way in

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.770 
be fired at while making your way in
this<00:06:02.250> zone<00:06:02.639> but<00:06:02.910> you<00:06:02.970> can<00:06:03.090> see<00:06:03.210> there's<00:06:03.389> also<00:06:03.570> a

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780

this zone but you can see there's also a
lovely<00:06:04.320> bush<00:06:04.590> here<00:06:04.889> which<00:06:05.460> is<00:06:05.580> going<00:06:05.669> to<00:06:05.760> offer

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
lovely bush here which is going to offer

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.860 
lovely bush here which is going to offer
a<00:06:06.120> lot<00:06:06.449> of<00:06:06.690> protection<00:06:07.229> for<00:06:07.410> firing<00:06:08.190> into<00:06:08.790> the

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
a lot of protection for firing into the

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.420 
a lot of protection for firing into the
advancing<00:06:09.870> northern<00:06:10.470> team<00:06:10.710> as<00:06:10.919> they<00:06:11.190> move

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
advancing northern team as they move

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.280 
advancing northern team as they move
across<00:06:11.580> and<00:06:12.030> then<00:06:12.600> obviously<00:06:12.720> if<00:06:13.050> you<00:06:13.139> get

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
across and then obviously if you get

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.790 
across and then obviously if you get
spotted<00:06:13.680> out<00:06:13.830> a<00:06:13.860> great<00:06:14.250> ridge<00:06:14.669> and<00:06:15.030> there

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
spotted out a great ridge and there

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.260
