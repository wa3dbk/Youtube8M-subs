guess<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.640> fundamental<00:02:57.060> level<00:02:57.299> if<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.750> had<00:02:57.870> a

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
guess on a fundamental level if I had a

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.619 
guess on a fundamental level if I had a
problem<00:02:58.170> with<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.829> would<00:02:58.920> be<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.310> we

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
problem with this it would be that we

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.110 
problem with this it would be that we
part<00:03:00.629> of<00:03:00.720> like<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.110> million<00:03:01.470> years<00:03:02.099> in<00:03:02.459> as<00:03:02.849> far
