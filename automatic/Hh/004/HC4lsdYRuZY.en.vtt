whatever<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.470> want<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:11.190> guess<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.970> can't<00:03:12.209> go

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:24.099 

whoa<00:03:20.260> okay<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:23.180> doesn't<00:03:23.599> look<00:03:23.750> like<00:03:23.810> there's

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
whoa okay it doesn't look like there's

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.949 
whoa okay it doesn't look like there's
ice<00:03:24.409> in<00:03:24.799> it<00:03:24.950> at<00:03:25.129> all

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
ice in it at all

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.649 
ice in it at all
that's<00:03:26.959> because<00:03:27.769> it's<00:03:28.129> so<00:03:28.670> cold<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.329> it's

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
that's because it's so cold that it's

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.699 
that's because it's so cold that it's
warm<00:03:30.909> that's<00:03:31.909> crazy<00:03:32.329> that's<00:03:32.840> why<00:03:33.079> our<00:03:33.230> voices
