putting that piece of string into my bag
with<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> knot<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.259> because<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.249> going<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
with a knot is because this is going to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.010 
with a knot is because this is going to
give<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.579> some<00:01:56.670> extra<00:01:56.880> added<00:01:57.329> strength<00:01:57.689> so

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
you can cut these to any length I find

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.990 
you can cut these to any length I find
that<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:42.980> know<00:02:43.130> about<00:02:43.250> three<00:02:43.670> feet<00:02:43.880> is

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
great and I'm going to use my glue stick

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.570 
great and I'm going to use my glue stick
here<00:02:47.739> I'm<00:02:48.739> just<00:02:48.920> going<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.160> take<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.430> glue

stick and I'm going to rub it all over

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.020 
stick and I'm going to rub it all over
the<00:02:53.090> bottom<00:02:53.360> here<00:02:55.630> take<00:02:56.630> my<00:02:56.750> streamer<00:02:58.030> place

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030

the bottom here take my streamer place
it<00:02:59.150> on<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.330> glue<00:02:59.450> stick<00:03:00.700> take<00:03:01.700> another

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
it on the glue stick take another

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.580 
it on the glue stick take another
streamer<00:03:03.400> place<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.640> on<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.790> glue<00:03:04.940> stick<00:03:05.590> and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
streamer place it on the glue stick and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.979 
streamer place it on the glue stick and
I<00:03:07.550> think<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.760> can<00:03:07.910> do<00:03:08.000> one<00:03:08.180> more<00:03:08.209> streamer<00:03:08.690> here

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
I think I can do one more streamer here

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.270 
I think I can do one more streamer here
I'm<00:03:09.320> going<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.560> add<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.680> little<00:03:09.890> more<00:03:10.070> extra

glue<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:13.100> then<00:03:14.500> just<00:03:15.500> glue<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.130> right<00:03:16.370> there

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
glue and then just glue that right there

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.610 
glue and then just glue that right there
now<00:03:21.070> now<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.100> got<00:03:22.660> some<00:03:23.660> streamers<00:03:23.989> on<00:03:24.320> my

beautiful kite now what's amazing is if

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.850 
beautiful kite now what's amazing is if
you<00:03:32.450> actually<00:03:32.630> take<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.110> out<00:03:33.320> into<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.650> wind

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860

you actually take this out into the wind
and<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.280> run<00:03:34.489> with<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.269> will<00:03:35.540> actually<00:03:35.780> get

some really good loft and it'll go

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.509 
some really good loft and it'll go
really<00:03:38.480> high<00:03:38.720> in<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:38.930> sky<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:40.040> longer<00:03:40.400> that

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
really high in the sky the longer that

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.000 
really high in the sky the longer that
your<00:03:40.700> string<00:03:40.940> is<00:03:41.320> running<00:03:42.320> with<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:42.500> is<00:03:42.829> the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
your string is running with it is the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.770 
your string is running with it is the
best<00:03:43.190> way<00:03:43.370> to<00:03:43.400> make<00:03:43.610> it<00:03:43.730> go<00:03:43.760> high<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:44.329> let<00:03:44.720> me

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
best way to make it go high so let me

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.880 
best way to make it go high so let me
show<00:03:44.900> you<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.049> couple<00:03:45.230> of<00:03:45.440> these<00:03:45.560> that<00:03:45.739> we've
