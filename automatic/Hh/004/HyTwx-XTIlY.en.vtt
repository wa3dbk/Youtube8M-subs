00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
going to fold it over to where this

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.189 
going to fold it over to where this
point<00:00:52.050> meets<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.770> mid<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:54.570> middle<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.050> this

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
point meets the mid the middle of this

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.250
