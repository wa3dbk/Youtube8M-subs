00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
the added functionality of being able to

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.320 
the added functionality of being able to
sort<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.530> turn<00:01:40.159> this<00:01:40.369> round<00:01:40.610> into<00:01:40.820> a<00:01:40.850> triangle

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
well but just give you a little look at

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.880 
well but just give you a little look at
this<00:01:52.220> a<00:01:52.909> different<00:01:53.570> angle<00:01:53.900> for<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.229> there<00:01:54.680> we

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
this a different angle for you there we

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.249 
this a different angle for you there we
go<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:55.640> we<00:01:55.790> can<00:01:56.060> actually<00:01:56.240> stand<00:01:56.720> this<00:01:56.900> up<00:01:56.960> and

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
go so we can actually stand this up and

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.910 
go so we can actually stand this up and
use<00:01:57.680> it<00:01:57.829> in<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:58.040> stand-up<00:01:58.579> mode<00:01:59.329> and<00:01:59.650> i<00:02:00.650> want<00:02:00.890> to

use it in a stand-up mode and i want to
show<00:02:01.159> you<00:02:01.189> also<00:02:02.530> how<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:03.770> actually<00:02:03.950> mounts

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
show you also how this actually mounts

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.100

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.729 
because this was quite quite a bit
different<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.649> normal<00:02:06.799> cases<00:02:07.159> now<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:09.590> can

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
different to normal cases now you can

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:10.960 
different to normal cases now you can
see<00:02:09.920> here<00:02:10.190> there's<00:02:10.399> an<00:02:10.489> that<00:02:10.610> looks<00:02:10.820> like

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
see here there's an that looks like

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.090 
see here there's an that looks like
there's<00:02:11.150> nothing<00:02:11.329> actually<00:02:11.810> holding<00:02:12.500> the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
there's nothing actually holding the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.699 
there's nothing actually holding the
ipad<00:02:13.670> 2<00:02:13.910> into<00:02:14.329> the<00:02:14.450> case<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.989> what<00:02:15.560> they've

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
ipad 2 into the case and what they've

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.300 
ipad 2 into the case and what they've
actually<00:02:15.860> done<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.700> we<00:02:16.790> just<00:02:16.940> remove<00:02:17.329> this<00:02:17.540> is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.550 

they've<00:02:23.310> actually<00:02:23.520> done<00:02:24.030> like<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> sticky<00:02:25.290> pad

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
they've actually done like a sticky pad

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.910 
they've actually done like a sticky pad
it<00:02:26.430> leaves<00:02:26.670> no<00:02:26.790> sort<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.630> residue<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.740> back

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
it leaves no sort of residue on the back

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.780 
it leaves no sort of residue on the back
of<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.940> ipad<00:02:30.840> at<00:02:31.050> all<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.440> then<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.400> fit<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
of the ipad at all and then to fit the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.070 
of the ipad at all and then to fit the
case<00:02:33.380> we<00:02:34.380> just<00:02:35.750> sort<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.780> not<00:02:36.930> got<00:02:37.050> that

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
case we just sort of not got that

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.780 
case we just sort of not got that
aligned<00:02:37.470> but<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:37.800> just<00:02:37.950> sort<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.280> line<00:02:38.520> it

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
aligned but we just sort of a line it

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.420 
aligned but we just sort of a line it
like<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:41.370> then<00:02:41.400> push<00:02:41.850> down<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:43.380> then<00:02:43.920> that

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
like so and then push down and then that

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.790 
like so and then push down and then that
is<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.180> case<00:02:46.160> how<00:02:47.160> cool<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.640> and

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
is it in the case how cool is that and

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.990 
is it in the case how cool is that and
we<00:02:49.800> can<00:02:49.980> if<00:02:50.160> we've<00:02:50.310> not<00:02:50.550> got<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.790> quite<00:02:50.940> right

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
we can if we've not got it quite right

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.950 
we can if we've not got it quite right
we<00:02:51.480> can<00:02:51.660> take<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.870> off<00:02:52.050> again<00:02:53.420> like<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.720> and

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
we can take it off again like so and

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.410 
we can take it off again like so and
then<00:02:54.990> we<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.830> realign<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:58.670> pop<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.700> back<00:02:59.850> onto

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
then we can realign and pop it back onto

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.740 
then we can realign and pop it back onto
that<00:03:01.170> sticky<00:03:01.890> pad<00:03:02.100> give<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.580> push<00:03:02.760> down<00:03:03.000> and

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
that sticky pad give it a push down and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.550 
that sticky pad give it a push down and
it's<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.860> case<00:03:05.010> again<00:03:06.080> brilliant<00:03:07.080> way<00:03:07.290> of

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
it's in the case again brilliant way of

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.100 
it's in the case again brilliant way of
doing<00:03:08.040> things<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.570> it's<00:03:09.570> not<00:03:09.780> going<00:03:09.960> anywhere

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
doing things and it's not going anywhere

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.700 
doing things and it's not going anywhere
look<00:03:10.680> I'm<00:03:10.950> not<00:03:11.160> holding<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:12.720> at<00:03:12.870> all<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.620> is

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
look I'm not holding it at all and it is

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.180 
look I'm not holding it at all and it is
not<00:03:13.950> coming<00:03:14.160> off<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:15.240> a<00:03:15.270> really<00:03:15.960> nice<00:03:16.170> way<00:03:16.920> of

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
not coming off so a really nice way of

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.390 
not coming off so a really nice way of
actually<00:03:17.820> mounting<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.930> ipad<00:03:19.290> 2<00:03:19.560> into<00:03:20.310> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
actually mounting the ipad 2 into the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.540 
actually mounting the ipad 2 into the
case<00:03:20.640> now<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.360> do<00:03:21.510> want<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:21.900> move<00:03:22.290> my

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
case now I do want to just move my

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.860 
case now I do want to just move my
tripod<00:03:23.550> back<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.910> little<00:03:24.120> bit<00:03:24.240> for<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.660> and

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
tripod back a little bit for you and

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.320 
tripod back a little bit for you and
just<00:03:25.860> give<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.130> another<00:03:26.459> look<00:03:26.790> at<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
just give you another look at the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.720 
just give you another look at the
different<00:03:27.989> angles<00:03:28.380> we<00:03:28.560> can<00:03:28.709> get<00:03:28.830> on<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.130> so

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
different angles we can get on this so

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.400 
different angles we can get on this so
again<00:03:30.030> we<00:03:30.150> can<00:03:30.300> fold<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:30.720> round<00:03:31.020> into<00:03:31.350> a

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
again we can fold this round into a

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.740 
again we can fold this round into a
triangle<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.130> we've<00:03:32.970> got<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.150> nice<00:03:33.450> angle

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
triangle and we've got a nice angle

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.290 
triangle and we've got a nice angle
there<00:03:34.140> for<00:03:34.440> typing<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.130> then<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.820> course<00:03:35.850> we

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
there for typing and then of course we

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.760 
there for typing and then of course we
can<00:03:36.420> pull<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.720> all<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.050> way<00:03:37.080> around<00:03:37.290> and

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
can pull this all the way around and

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.430 
can pull this all the way around and
then<00:03:37.800> we've<00:03:38.459> got<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.640> brilliant<00:03:39.120> angle<00:03:39.690> on<00:03:39.870> the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
then we've got a brilliant angle on the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.640 
then we've got a brilliant angle on the
ipad<00:03:40.860> 2<00:03:41.130> for<00:03:41.730> actually<00:03:42.060> viewing<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:43.230> likes<00:03:43.440> of

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
ipad 2 for actually viewing the likes of

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.400 
ipad 2 for actually viewing the likes of
youtube<00:03:44.459> videos<00:03:44.489> or<00:03:45.090> other<00:03:45.239> content<00:03:45.540> when<00:03:46.290> you

want this more upright form it doesn't

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.550 
want this more upright form it doesn't
lend<00:03:49.110> itself<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.830> doing<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.610> it's<00:03:51.390> just<00:03:52.230> not

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
lend itself to doing this it's just not

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.860 
lend itself to doing this it's just not
going<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.739> do<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.160> portrait<00:03:53.880> form<00:03:54.150> but<00:03:54.720> for

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
going to do it in portrait form but for

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.590 
going to do it in portrait form but for
landscape<00:03:55.410> typing<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.130> video<00:03:56.850> viewing<00:03:57.209> it

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
landscape typing and video viewing it

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.130 
landscape typing and video viewing it
does<00:03:57.930> an<00:03:58.080> extremely<00:03:59.010> good<00:03:59.160> job<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.900> is
