00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
bit after unlocking the armor so what

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.320 
bit after unlocking the armor so what
you're<00:00:41.650> gonna<00:00:41.710> do<00:00:41.980> is<00:00:42.250> if<00:00:42.699> you<00:00:42.820> have<00:00:43.000> already

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
you're gonna do is if you have already

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.220 
you're gonna do is if you have already
started<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:43.809> game<00:00:43.980> going<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.010> options<00:00:46.230> scroll

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
started a game going to options scroll

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.880 
started a game going to options scroll
down<00:00:47.500> go<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:50.400> restart<00:00:51.400> bloodline<00:00:51.940> one<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.800> you

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
down go to restart bloodline one so you

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.100 
down go to restart bloodline one so you
just<00:00:54.010> hit<00:00:54.159> that<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:55.229> then<00:00:56.229> the<00:00:56.350> check<00:00:56.530> mark<00:00:56.769> so

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
just hit that and then the check mark so

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.990 
just hit that and then the check mark so
when<00:00:59.110> it<00:00:59.229> restarts<00:00:59.409> is<00:01:00.070> probably<00:01:00.670> gonna<00:01:00.820> do

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
when it restarts is probably gonna do

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.530 
when it restarts is probably gonna do
the<00:01:01.540> original<00:01:01.870> cutscene<00:01:02.530> yeah<00:01:02.979> and<00:01:03.540> during

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.290 

and<00:04:04.569> there<00:04:04.959> we<00:04:05.080> go

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
and there we go

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:14.040 
and there we go
what<00:04:07.300> you're<00:04:07.420> gonna<00:04:07.510> want<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.840> do<00:04:10.500> hmm<00:04:13.050> its

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
what you're gonna want to do hmm its

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:21.379 
what you're gonna want to do hmm its
save<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.650> restart<00:04:14.980> castle<00:04:19.350> yep<00:04:20.350> that<00:04:20.709> was<00:04:20.859> it

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
save and restart castle yep that was it

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.290 
save and restart castle yep that was it
so<00:04:22.389> now<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:22.690> says<00:04:22.770> negative<00:04:23.770> 20<00:04:24.280> years<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.820> it

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
so now it says negative 20 years and it

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.450 
so now it says negative 20 years and it
shows<00:04:25.540> this<00:04:25.780> character<00:04:26.230> and<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:27.070> believe<00:04:27.310> this

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
shows this character and I believe this

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.760 
shows this character and I believe this
is<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.820> dark<00:04:28.090> version

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
is the dark version

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.030 
is the dark version
yeah<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.310> dark<00:04:30.580> version<00:04:30.850> of<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.860> armor<00:04:32.860> you

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
yeah the dark version of the armor you

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.430 
yeah the dark version of the armor you
can<00:04:33.220> get<00:04:33.430> so<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.150> can't<00:04:34.450> actually<00:04:34.660> buy<00:04:35.050> what

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
can get so you can't actually buy what

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.220 
can get so you can't actually buy what
he<00:04:35.650> has<00:04:35.860> on<00:04:36.150> but<00:04:37.150> you<00:04:37.360> can<00:04:37.540> buy<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.780> white

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
he has on but you can buy the white

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.659 
he has on but you can buy the white
version<00:04:38.500> which<00:04:39.010> is<00:04:39.220> just<00:04:39.460> slightly<00:04:39.610> less<00:04:41.669> and

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
version which is just slightly less and

00:04:42.669 --> 00:05:09.740 
version which is just slightly less and
yeah<00:04:43.600> I'll<00:04:43.780> show<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:43.990> what<00:04:44.110> it<00:04:44.200> can<00:04:44.230> do

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750

high level um but still these guys are

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.340 
high level um but still these guys are
pretty<00:05:16.990> easy<00:05:17.290> for<00:05:17.710> the<00:05:18.160> army<00:05:18.820> you<00:05:18.940> get<00:05:19.350> even

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:34.830 
pretty easy for the army you get even
when<00:05:20.470> you<00:05:20.560> start<00:05:32.730> doing<00:05:33.730> not<00:05:34.450> that<00:05:34.480> much

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
when you start doing not that much

00:05:34.840 --> 00:06:37.030 
when you start doing not that much
damage

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.270 

and<00:06:38.040> so<00:06:38.400> yeah<00:06:39.050> I'll<00:06:40.050> show<00:06:40.290> you<00:06:40.350> what<00:06:40.980> you<00:06:41.100> get

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
and so yeah I'll show you what you get

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:54.770 
and so yeah I'll show you what you get
in<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:43.730> armory<00:06:51.830> okay<00:06:52.830> so<00:06:52.890> this<00:06:53.730> is<00:06:54.150> the<00:06:54.540> blade

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
in the armory okay so this is the blade

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.220 
in the armory okay so this is the blade
you're<00:06:54.960> using<00:06:55.140> right<00:06:55.410> now<00:06:55.670> as<00:06:56.670> this<00:06:56.880> character

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.230 
you're using right now as this character

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.450 
you're using right now as this character
but<00:06:58.230> in<00:06:58.590> the<00:06:59.480> what<00:07:00.480> do<00:07:00.540> you<00:07:00.630> call<00:07:00.780> it<00:07:00.810> a<00:07:00.990> store

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
but in the what do you call it a store

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.180 
but in the what do you call it a store
there's<00:07:02.460> this<00:07:03.150> one<00:07:03.360> dirt<00:07:03.600> I<00:07:04.040> think<00:07:05.040> yeah

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
there's this one dirt I think yeah

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.820 
there's this one dirt I think yeah
that's<00:07:05.250> the<00:07:05.430> exact<00:07:05.760> same<00:07:06.030> except<00:07:06.570> for<00:07:06.830> this

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
that's the exact same except for this

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.220 
that's the exact same except for this
one<00:07:08.070> just<00:07:08.100> dark<00:07:08.610> and<00:07:08.940> it<00:07:09.090> has<00:07:09.240> dark<00:07:09.660> damage<00:07:10.110> I

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
one just dark and it has dark damage I

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.410 
one just dark and it has dark damage I
believe<00:07:10.500> that's<00:07:10.920> what<00:07:11.040> it's<00:07:11.160> called<00:07:11.280> and<00:07:11.580> this

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:12.420 
believe that's what it's called and this

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.370 
believe that's what it's called and this
one<00:07:12.630> I<00:07:13.670> think<00:07:14.670> it<00:07:15.180> gives<00:07:15.420> you<00:07:15.720> a<00:07:15.750> little<00:07:16.020> bit<00:07:16.230> of

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 
one I think it gives you a little bit of

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.460 
one I think it gives you a little bit of
health<00:07:16.590> if<00:07:16.860> you<00:07:17.100> hit<00:07:17.460> them<00:07:17.580> like<00:07:17.990> a<00:07:18.990> critical

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.470 
health if you hit them like a critical

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.460 
health if you hit them like a critical
hit<00:07:19.880> so<00:07:20.880> it's<00:07:21.300> pretty<00:07:21.750> much<00:07:21.900> the<00:07:22.050> same<00:07:22.170> with

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.470 
hit so it's pretty much the same with

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.460 
hit so it's pretty much the same with
all<00:07:22.620> the<00:07:22.650> other<00:07:22.800> armor<00:07:24.110> see<00:07:25.110> it's<00:07:25.290> just

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.470 
all the other armor see it's just

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.590 
all the other armor see it's just
there's<00:07:26.190> some<00:07:26.550> differences<00:07:27.120> but<00:07:27.390> they're

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:27.600 
there's some differences but they're

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.090 
there's some differences but they're
basically<00:07:27.930> the<00:07:28.200> names<00:07:28.410> are<00:07:28.590> only<00:07:28.770> different

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:29.100 
basically the names are only different

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:37.460 
basically the names are only different
