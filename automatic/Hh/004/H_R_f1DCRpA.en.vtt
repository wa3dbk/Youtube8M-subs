00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hey guys well I'm here today I'll be

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.130 
hey guys well I'm here today I'll be
doing<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:03.000> troubleshooting<00:00:03.449> video<00:00:03.810> for<00:00:04.080> the

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
doing a troubleshooting video for the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.970 
doing a troubleshooting video for the
Razer<00:00:04.350> Marco<00:00:04.890> 2.0<00:00:05.879> system<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> speaker

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
Razer Marco 2.0 system this is a speaker

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.160 
Razer Marco 2.0 system this is a speaker
set<00:00:08.400> that<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.790> had<00:00:09.000> owned<00:00:09.269> for<00:00:09.690> around<00:00:09.809> three

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
set that I had owned for around three

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.740 
set that I had owned for around three
years<00:00:10.820> for<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.880> first<00:00:12.059> two<00:00:12.300> year<00:00:12.540> this

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
years for the first two year this

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.029 
years for the first two year this
speaker<00:00:13.290> worked<00:00:13.500> perfectly<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.450> I<00:00:15.450> think

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
speaker worked perfectly and I think

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.529 
speaker worked perfectly and I think
just<00:00:17.039> until<00:00:17.520> recently<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.029> start<00:00:18.270> developing

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
just until recently you start developing

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.140 
just until recently you start developing
really<00:00:19.050> annoying<00:00:19.350> ticking<00:00:19.680> noise<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
really annoying ticking noise so to

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.210 
really annoying ticking noise so to
demonstrate<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:22.080> I've<00:00:22.260> attached<00:00:22.650> my<00:00:22.830> mp3

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
demonstrate that I've attached my mp3

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.960 
demonstrate that I've attached my mp3
player<00:00:23.670> here<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.420> corn<00:00:24.689> j-3<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.640> I<00:00:26.640> attached

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
player here the corn j-3 and I attached

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:36.260 
player here the corn j-3 and I attached
it<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.539> back<00:00:27.779> oh<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.560> here<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.859> go<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:35.270> this

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
it to the back oh so here we go so this

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.799 
it to the back oh so here we go so this
is<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.570> ticking<00:00:36.870> sound<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.200> makes<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:38.809> it

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
is the ticking sound it makes and it

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.549 
is the ticking sound it makes and it
gets<00:00:40.430> louder<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.930> frequency<00:00:43.379> becomes

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
gets louder and the frequency becomes

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.959 
gets louder and the frequency becomes
higher<00:00:44.000> when<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.629> control<00:00:46.200> pad<00:00:46.350> dips<00:00:46.910> so<00:00:47.910> I'm

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
higher when the control pad dips so I'm

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:59.750 
higher when the control pad dips so I'm
gonna<00:00:48.170> light<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.879> and<00:00:50.879> see<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.329> loads<00:00:58.760> but

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
gonna light it on and see it's loads but

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.880 
gonna light it on and see it's loads but
there's<00:00:59.940> one<00:01:00.149> thing<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.420> common<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.930> that's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
there's one thing in common and that's

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.009 
there's one thing in common and that's
the<00:01:02.160> mp3<00:01:02.760> player<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.690> supposed<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the mp3 player that's supposed to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.500 
the mp3 player that's supposed to
playing<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.589> music<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.790> feeds<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
playing the music that feeds to the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.050 
playing the music that feeds to the
speaker<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:07.920> working<00:01:08.340> because<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.939> this

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
speaker it's not working because of this

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.929 
speaker it's not working because of this
ticking<00:01:09.450> problem<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.950> after<00:01:11.430> doing<00:01:11.520> some

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
ticking problem so after doing some

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.140 
ticking problem so after doing some
research<00:01:12.210> online<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.159> found<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.820> has<00:01:15.000> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
research online I found that it has to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.710 
research online I found that it has to
do<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> capacitor<00:01:16.140> razor<00:01:16.380> used<00:01:17.720> they

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
do with the capacitor razor used they

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.060 
do with the capacitor razor used they
were<00:01:18.840> saying<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> capacitor<00:01:19.890> could

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
were saying that the capacitor could

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.820 
were saying that the capacitor could
either<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.939> bad<00:01:21.180> quality<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.710> may

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
either be a of bad quality or be it may

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.910 
either be a of bad quality or be it may
have<00:01:22.979> been<00:01:23.220> soldered<00:01:23.720> improperly<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.799> this

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
have been soldered improperly so in this

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.880 
have been soldered improperly so in this
video<00:01:26.189> I'm<00:01:26.549> gonna<00:01:26.670> try<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> remove<00:01:28.020> all<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
video I'm gonna try to remove all the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.880 
video I'm gonna try to remove all the
existing<00:01:29.220> capacity<00:01:29.520> or<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.890> capacitor

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
existing capacity or the capacitor

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.499 
existing capacity or the capacitor
that's<00:01:32.040> closer<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> heatsink<00:01:32.970> I'm<00:01:33.360> gonna

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
that's closer to the heatsink I'm gonna

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.140 
that's closer to the heatsink I'm gonna
try<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.750> switch<00:01:34.320> them<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:36.030> we're

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
try to switch them out and then we're

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.450 
try to switch them out and then we're
gonna<00:01:36.270> test<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.810> system<00:01:37.140> again<00:01:37.409> see<00:01:37.799> if<00:01:38.040> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
gonna test the system again see if that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
gonna test the system again see if that
solves<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.850> problem<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.930> stay<00:01:40.290> tuned<00:01:40.500> while<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
solves the problem so stay tuned while I

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.219 
solves the problem so stay tuned while I
do<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.100> exists<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.090> William<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
do that exists is William this is a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.710 
do that exists is William this is a
continuation<00:01:43.710> video<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.850> which<00:01:45.299> I'll<00:01:45.479> show

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
continuation video in which I'll show

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.780 
continuation video in which I'll show
you<00:01:45.780> guys<00:01:46.140> or<00:01:46.920> give<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.220> guys<00:01:47.369> some<00:01:47.549> pointers

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
you guys or give you guys some pointers

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.480 
you guys or give you guys some pointers
on<00:01:48.090> how<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.840> about<00:01:48.869> fixing<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.590> razor<00:01:49.799> 2.1

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
on how to go about fixing the razor 2.1

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.969 
on how to go about fixing the razor 2.1
speaker<00:01:51.229> so<00:01:52.229> essentially<00:01:53.100> my<00:01:54.229> razor<00:01:55.229> Marco<00:01:55.770> as

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
speaker so essentially my razor Marco as

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.709 
speaker so essentially my razor Marco as
you<00:01:56.100> guys<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.399> known<00:01:56.610> from<00:01:56.880> my<00:01:57.210> last<00:01:57.360> video

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
you guys have known from my last video

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.399 
you guys have known from my last video
was<00:01:58.049> making<00:01:58.380> Kukla<00:01:58.710> noise<00:01:58.920> and<00:02:00.409> essentially

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
was making Kukla noise and essentially

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.550 
was making Kukla noise and essentially
it<00:02:01.710> would<00:02:01.799> nose<00:02:02.460> would<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:02.880> stop<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
it would nose would not stop so in the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.440 
it would nose would not stop so in the
end<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.890> had<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> stop<00:02:05.549> using<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.939> speaker<00:02:06.299> for

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
end I had to stop using a speaker for

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.039 
end I had to stop using a speaker for
quite<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> bit

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
quite a bit

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.830 
quite a bit
until<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.950> day<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.099> found<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.479> solution

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
until one day I found it it's a solution

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.530 
until one day I found it it's a solution
in<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> forum<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.550> whirlpool

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
in the forum in the whirlpool

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.009 
in the forum in the whirlpool
calm<00:02:13.110> form<00:02:13.519> so<00:02:14.519> essentially<00:02:14.939> the<00:02:15.480> foreign

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
calm form so essentially the foreign

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.709 
calm form so essentially the foreign
members<00:02:16.319> were<00:02:16.530> saying<00:02:16.829> that<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:18.030> particular

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
members were saying that this particular

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.910 
members were saying that this particular
capacitor<00:02:19.730> at<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.969> position<00:02:21.420> C<00:02:21.840> one<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.590> five

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
capacitor at the position C one to five

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.449 
capacitor at the position C one to five
was<00:02:23.909> causing<00:02:24.480> an<00:02:24.540> issue<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:26.280> can

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
was causing an issue and that you can

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.789 
was causing an issue and that you can
actually<00:02:26.640> fix<00:02:27.299> your<00:02:27.689> eraser<00:02:27.989> macro<00:02:28.469> speaker

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
actually fix your eraser macro speaker

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.330 
actually fix your eraser macro speaker
by<00:02:29.099> replacing<00:02:29.489> this<00:02:30.090> faulty<00:02:30.810> capacitor<00:02:31.379> so

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
by replacing this faulty capacitor so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.809 
by replacing this faulty capacitor so
the<00:02:33.120> whole<00:02:33.299> fix<00:02:33.569> was<00:02:33.870> actually<00:02:34.230> very<00:02:34.439> cheap

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
the whole fix was actually very cheap

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.210 
the whole fix was actually very cheap
surprisingly<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:37.590> capacitor<00:02:38.099> itself

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
surprisingly and the capacitor itself

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.490 
surprisingly and the capacitor itself
costs<00:02:38.790> around<00:02:38.939> a<00:02:39.030> dollar<00:02:39.209> twenty-five<00:02:39.750> that's

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
costs around a dollar twenty-five that's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.740 
costs around a dollar twenty-five that's
for<00:02:40.739> eight<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:40.980> them<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.519> now<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.329> certain

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
for eight of them so now I have certain

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.789 
for eight of them so now I have certain
spares<00:02:43.909> on<00:02:44.909> top<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.269> that<00:02:45.359> I<00:02:45.629> also<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.200> some

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
spares on top of that I also have some

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.710 
spares on top of that I also have some
soldering<00:02:47.189> irons<00:02:47.549> which<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.879> bought<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.599> I'll

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
soldering irons which I bought so I'll

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.409 
soldering irons which I bought so I'll
show<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.900> guys<00:02:49.049> what<00:02:49.560> they<00:02:49.709> are<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.299> the

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
show you guys what they are this is the

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.449 
show you guys what they are this is the
cheapest<00:02:51.840> solder<00:02:52.049> iron<00:02:52.260> one<00:02:52.680> can<00:02:52.889> possibly

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
cheapest solder iron one can possibly

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.659 
cheapest solder iron one can possibly
get<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:55.290> caught<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.590> for<00:02:55.980> around<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.400> think

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669 
get and I caught it for around I think

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.420 
get and I caught it for around I think
six<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.480> eight<00:02:57.659> dollars<00:02:58.129> actually<00:02:59.129> doesn't

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
six to eight dollars actually doesn't

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.270 
six to eight dollars actually doesn't
have<00:02:59.609> any<00:02:59.989> temperature<00:03:00.989> control<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.980> once<00:03:02.159> you

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
have any temperature control so once you

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.259 
have any temperature control so once you
turn<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.579> on<00:03:02.669> it<00:03:02.909> is<00:03:02.939> on<00:03:03.829> and<00:03:04.829> also<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.310> got<00:03:05.639> basic

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
turn it on it is on and also I got basic

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.860 
turn it on it is on and also I got basic
soldering<00:03:06.510> irons<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.310> got<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> little<00:03:09.720> bit

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
soldering irons and I got a little bit

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.390 
soldering irons and I got a little bit
clipper<00:03:10.230> that's<00:03:10.500> something<00:03:10.919> I<00:03:11.010> have<00:03:11.189> already

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
clipper that's something I have already

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.849 
clipper that's something I have already
and<00:03:12.709> with<00:03:13.709> these<00:03:13.919> tools<00:03:14.159> I<00:03:14.400> was<00:03:14.519> able<00:03:14.700> to

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
and with these tools I was able to

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.369 
and with these tools I was able to
remove<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:17.220> existing<00:03:17.489> capacitor<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.449> then

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
remove the existing capacitor and then

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.960 
remove the existing capacitor and then
replace<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:20.069> with<00:03:20.190> new<00:03:20.519> one

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
replace it with new one

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.860 
replace it with new one
so<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.049> capacitor<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.709> removed<00:03:23.159> and<00:03:23.870> as

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
so this is a capacitor I removed and as

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.530 
so this is a capacitor I removed and as
you<00:03:24.989> can<00:03:25.139> see<00:03:25.199> I<00:03:25.349> did<00:03:25.709> break<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.069> legs<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:27.359> what

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
you can see I did break the legs so what

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.129 
you can see I did break the legs so what
happened<00:03:27.840> was<00:03:28.970> razor<00:03:29.970> had<00:03:30.180> three<00:03:30.750> small

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
happened was razor had three small

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.909 
happened was razor had three small
soldering<00:03:32.129> pits<00:03:32.659> when<00:03:33.659> they<00:03:33.870> were<00:03:33.930> using<00:03:34.319> when

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
soldering pits when they were using when

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.849 
soldering pits when they were using when
they<00:03:34.949> were<00:03:35.129> soldering<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:36.000> units<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:36.859> those

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
they were soldering the units and those

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.309 
they were soldering the units and those
solder<00:03:38.579> parts<00:03:39.060> were<00:03:39.419> stuck<00:03:39.989> down<00:03:40.139> pretty

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
solder parts were stuck down pretty

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.009 
solder parts were stuck down pretty
tight<00:03:40.409> so<00:03:40.949> in<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:41.760> process<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.359> moving<00:03:42.720> I

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
tight so in the process of moving I

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.520 
tight so in the process of moving I
poked<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.909> capacitor<00:03:44.909> and<00:03:45.479> I<00:03:45.810> had<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.109> resort<00:03:46.409> to

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
poked a capacitor and I had to resort to

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.979 
poked a capacitor and I had to resort to
using<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:47.459> mechanical<00:03:47.729> pencil<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.629> push<00:03:48.840> out

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
using a mechanical pencil to push out

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.530 
using a mechanical pencil to push out
the<00:03:49.079> parts<00:03:49.489> so<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:51.000> probably<00:03:51.329> something

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
the parts so this is probably something

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.969 
the parts so this is probably something
of<00:03:51.720> interest<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.199> guys<00:03:52.349> if<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.590> guys<00:03:52.680> are

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
of interest to you guys if you guys are

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.520 
of interest to you guys if you guys are
thinking<00:03:53.220> about<00:03:53.459> doing<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.699> mod<00:03:53.989> my<00:03:54.989> basic

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
thinking about doing a mod my basic

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.449 
thinking about doing a mod my basic
mechanical<00:03:55.979> pencil<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:57.269> ideal<00:03:57.389> to<00:03:58.049> push<00:03:58.229> out

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
mechanical pencil is ideal to push out

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.509 
mechanical pencil is ideal to push out
stuck<00:03:59.459> parts<00:03:59.909> for<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.359> leg<00:04:00.569> because<00:04:01.470> it's<00:04:02.189> led

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
stuck parts for the leg because it's led

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.610 
stuck parts for the leg because it's led
and<00:04:03.359> therefore<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.810> doesn't<00:04:03.959> really<00:04:04.229> transfer

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
and therefore it doesn't really transfer

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.250 
and therefore it doesn't really transfer
that<00:04:04.739> much<00:04:04.919> heat<00:04:05.269> so<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:06.329> guys<00:04:06.629> can<00:04:06.900> apply

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
that much heat so you guys can apply

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.710 
that much heat so you guys can apply
force<00:04:07.650> onto<00:04:07.889> it<00:04:08.189> and<00:04:08.519> it's<00:04:08.729> able<00:04:08.939> to<00:04:09.120> push<00:04:09.449> down

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
force onto it and it's able to push down

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.170 
force onto it and it's able to push down
the<00:04:10.049> bits<00:04:11.009> once<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.489> have<00:04:11.639> built<00:04:11.849> in<00:04:12.060> the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
the bits once you have built in the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.319 
the bits once you have built in the
solder<00:04:12.449> so<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.560> really<00:04:13.799> really<00:04:14.280> helped<00:04:14.579> me

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.390 

another<00:04:18.409> pointer<00:04:19.409> if<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.799> guys<00:04:19.949> want<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.250> go

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
another pointer if you guys want to go

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.159 
another pointer if you guys want to go
about<00:04:20.579> fixing<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.239> speaker<00:04:21.630> will<00:04:21.810> be<00:04:21.959> to

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
about fixing the speaker will be to

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.469 
about fixing the speaker will be to
actually<00:04:22.320> remove<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.919> screw<00:04:23.219> on<00:04:23.550> this

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
actually remove the screw on this

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.950 
actually remove the screw on this
thermal<00:04:24.990> fan

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
thermal fan

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.680 
thermal fan
not<00:04:26.620> so<00:04:26.740> sure<00:04:26.889> you<00:04:27.039> guys<00:04:27.220> can<00:04:27.430> see<00:04:27.729> but<00:04:28.539> this

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
not so sure you guys can see but this

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.290 
not so sure you guys can see but this
like<00:04:29.380> it<00:04:29.620> really<00:04:29.919> gives<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.910> little<00:04:31.210> bit

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
like it really gives you a little bit

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.450 
like it really gives you a little bit
more<00:04:31.419> space<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.750> work<00:04:31.900> with<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.460> helps<00:04:35.460> so

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
more space to work with so that helps so

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.689 
more space to work with so that helps so
yeah<00:04:37.030> like<00:04:37.479> removing<00:04:38.199> and<00:04:38.740> replacing<00:04:39.220> the

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
yeah like removing and replacing the

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.909 
yeah like removing and replacing the
capacitor<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.360> was<00:04:40.479> able<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.720> fix<00:04:41.139> the<00:04:41.289> problem

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
capacitor I was able to fix the problem

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.999 
capacitor I was able to fix the problem
so<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:43.539> know<00:04:43.660> for<00:04:43.930> those<00:04:44.380> of<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:44.620> guys<00:04:44.740> out

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
so you know for those of you guys out

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.580 
so you know for those of you guys out
there<00:04:45.039> was<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.430> broken<00:04:45.639> razor<00:04:46.000> Malcolm<00:04:46.449> speaker

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
there was a broken razor Malcolm speaker

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.499 
there was a broken razor Malcolm speaker
do<00:04:48.100> go<00:04:48.280> ahead<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:48.699> give<00:04:48.789> this<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.940> shot<00:04:49.240> before

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
do go ahead and give this a shot before

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.140 
do go ahead and give this a shot before
you<00:04:49.720> toss<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.259> for<00:04:50.440> good<00:04:50.710> because<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:52.030> know

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
you toss it for good because you know

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.100 
you toss it for good because you know
chances<00:04:52.840> are<00:04:53.050> you<00:04:53.340> might<00:04:54.340> be<00:04:54.729> just<00:04:55.240> one<00:04:55.509> faulty

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
chances are you might be just one faulty

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.300 
chances are you might be just one faulty

Rocco and now I'm gonna show you guys

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.879 
Rocco and now I'm gonna show you guys
what<00:05:03.729> it<00:05:03.849> sounds<00:05:04.210> like<00:05:04.360> a<00:05:04.389> throw<00:05:04.720> to<00:05:04.840> fix<00:05:05.050> I'm

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
what it sounds like a throw to fix I'm

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.600 
what it sounds like a throw to fix I'm
gonna<00:05:06.099> plug<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.880> we'll<00:05:07.630> see<00:05:08.520> how<00:05:09.520> it

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
gonna plug it in and we'll see how it

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.930 
gonna plug it in and we'll see how it
works<00:05:10.949> so<00:05:11.949> I'm<00:05:12.070> not<00:05:12.190> even<00:05:12.250> gonna<00:05:12.460> bother<00:05:12.699> to

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
works so I'm not even gonna bother to

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.490 
works so I'm not even gonna bother to
place<00:05:13.180> a<00:05:13.210> playback<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:14.050> takes<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:14.710> while<00:05:16.500> we'll

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
place a playback it takes a while we'll

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.570 
place a playback it takes a while we'll
plug<00:05:17.860> in<00:05:18.099> the<00:05:18.220> power<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:18.910> we'll<00:05:19.300> see<00:05:20.250> how<00:05:21.250> it

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
plug in the power and we'll see how it

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.480 
plug in the power and we'll see how it
fares<00:05:22.500> this<00:05:23.500> won't<00:05:23.710> be<00:05:23.800> actually<00:05:24.220> been<00:05:24.460> a

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
fares this won't be actually been a

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.999 
fares this won't be actually been a
second<00:05:24.970> time<00:05:25.120> that's<00:05:25.300> right

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
second time that's right

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.570 
second time that's right
go<00:05:27.009> on<00:05:27.360> after<00:05:28.360> fix<00:05:28.960> so<00:05:29.650> hopefully<00:05:30.070> doesn't<00:05:30.280> die

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
go on after fix so hopefully doesn't die

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.649 
go on after fix so hopefully doesn't die
on<00:05:30.729> me<00:05:30.880> cuz<00:05:31.360> don't<00:05:31.570> get<00:05:31.750> colbert's<00:05:32.320> in<00:05:32.530> it<00:05:33.659> it

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
on me cuz don't get colbert's in it it

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:39.589 
on me cuz don't get colbert's in it it
goes<00:05:35.760> up<00:05:36.760> turn<00:05:36.970> on<00:05:37.150> closed<00:05:38.139> speakers<00:05:38.560> on<00:05:38.710> now

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
goes up turn on closed speakers on now

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:44.189 
goes up turn on closed speakers on now
okay<00:05:40.599> I'm<00:05:40.990> turning<00:05:41.320> on<00:05:41.590> and<00:05:43.050> there's<00:05:44.050> no

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 
okay I'm turning on and there's no

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.689 
okay I'm turning on and there's no
clicking<00:05:44.560> noise<00:05:44.830> which<00:05:45.099> is<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.250> really<00:05:45.520> good

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
clicking noise which is a really good

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.740 
clicking noise which is a really good
sign<00:05:45.940> but<00:05:46.780> I'm<00:05:46.900> now<00:05:47.020> gonna<00:05:47.169> play<00:05:47.440> music<00:05:48.659> so<00:05:49.659> I

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
sign but I'm now gonna play music so I

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:59.370 
sign but I'm now gonna play music so I
just<00:05:49.930> move<00:05:50.110> it<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:50.380> my<00:05:50.470> other<00:05:50.740> screen<00:05:58.020> so<00:05:59.020> it

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
just move it to my other screen so it

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.330 
just move it to my other screen so it
works<00:05:59.620> perfectly

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
works perfectly

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.600 
works perfectly
I'm<00:06:00.490> gonna<00:06:00.639> turn<00:06:00.880> this<00:06:01.060> thing<00:06:01.120> off<00:06:01.509> I<00:06:01.690> know<00:06:02.610> and

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
I'm gonna turn this thing off I know and

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.790 
I'm gonna turn this thing off I know and
I'll<00:06:03.729> turn<00:06:03.909> it<00:06:04.000> back<00:06:04.150> on<00:06:04.360> the<00:06:04.780> issue<00:06:05.169> was<00:06:05.770> that

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
I'll turn it back on the issue was that

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.490 
I'll turn it back on the issue was that
I<00:06:06.130> had<00:06:06.370> clicking<00:06:06.820> noise<00:06:07.000> at<00:06:07.300> the<00:06:07.509> startup<00:06:07.870> so

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
I had clicking noise at the startup so

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:19.850 
I had clicking noise at the startup so
let's<00:06:08.680> see<00:06:17.400> so<00:06:18.400> it's<00:06:18.520> perfect<00:06:18.909> so<00:06:19.180> it<00:06:19.240> goes

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
let's see so it's perfect so it goes

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.680 
let's see so it's perfect so it goes
jump<00:06:20.860> straight<00:06:21.190> to<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:21.430> music<00:06:21.729> on<00:06:22.000> startup<00:06:22.479> so

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
jump straight to the music on startup so

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.740 
jump straight to the music on startup so
that's<00:06:22.870> perfect<00:06:23.409> so<00:06:23.680> this<00:06:24.419> fixed<00:06:25.419> they

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
that's perfect so this fixed they

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.770 
that's perfect so this fixed they
recommend<00:06:26.199> it<00:06:26.320> in<00:06:26.380> the<00:06:26.470> forum<00:06:26.710> does<00:06:27.130> work<00:06:27.780> it

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
recommend it in the forum does work it

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.219 
recommend it in the forum does work it
takes<00:06:28.990> a<00:06:29.080> little<00:06:29.229> bit<00:06:29.349> of<00:06:29.470> time<00:06:30.400> if<00:06:30.849> you're<00:06:31.090> a

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
takes a little bit of time if you're a

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.610 
takes a little bit of time if you're a
first-time<00:06:32.229> solder<00:06:32.919> person<00:06:33.789> like<00:06:34.090> myself<00:06:34.620> but

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
first-time solder person like myself but

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.980 
first-time solder person like myself but
yeah<00:06:35.919> it<00:06:36.340> is<00:06:36.460> possible<00:06:36.940> to<00:06:36.969> fix<00:06:37.270> the<00:06:37.539> razor<00:06:37.719> map

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
yeah it is possible to fix the razor map

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.290 
yeah it is possible to fix the razor map
go<00:06:38.139> to<00:06:38.169> point<00:06:38.650> one

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
go to point one

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.160 
go to point one
by<00:06:39.540> changing<00:06:40.020> just<00:06:40.200> one<00:06:40.470> capacitor<00:06:42.170> the

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 
by changing just one capacitor the

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.020 
by changing just one capacitor the
capacitor<00:06:43.320> I<00:06:43.740> changed<00:06:44.310> for<00:06:44.640> those<00:06:44.760> of<00:06:44.910> you

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
capacitor I changed for those of you

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.810 
capacitor I changed for those of you
interested<00:06:45.560> was<00:06:46.560> the<00:06:46.830> 25<00:06:47.840> version<00:06:48.840> and<00:06:49.820> the

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
interested was the 25 version and the

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.070 
interested was the 25 version and the
good<00:06:51.000> thing<00:06:51.210> about<00:06:51.300> it<00:06:51.600> is<00:06:51.630> that<00:06:51.960> they

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
good thing about it is that they

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.010 
good thing about it is that they
actually<00:06:52.230> have<00:06:52.950> a<00:06:52.980> really<00:06:53.340> detailed<00:06:53.580> photo<00:06:54.480> of

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
actually have a really detailed photo of

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.840 
actually have a really detailed photo of
the<00:06:55.950> Razr<00:06:56.160> Marko<00:06:57.830> capacitors<00:06:58.830> and<00:06:59.160> they're

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
the Razr Marko capacitors and they're

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.380 
the Razr Marko capacitors and they're
actually<00:07:00.180> all<00:07:00.390> labeled<00:07:01.400> on<00:07:02.400> a<00:07:02.460> forum<00:07:03.000> so<00:07:03.270> it

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:03.390 
actually all labeled on a forum so it

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.300 
actually all labeled on a forum so it
really<00:07:03.600> helped<00:07:04.080> to<00:07:04.260> differentiate<00:07:04.740> different

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
really helped to differentiate different

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.370 
really helped to differentiate different
capacitors<00:07:06.120> I<00:07:06.360> was<00:07:07.050> thinking<00:07:07.290> about

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
capacitors I was thinking about

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.010 
capacitors I was thinking about
replacing<00:07:07.860> all<00:07:08.160> of<00:07:08.430> the<00:07:08.550> capacitors<00:07:09.150> but<00:07:09.810> it

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
replacing all of the capacitors but it

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.090 
replacing all of the capacitors but it
took<00:07:10.170> a<00:07:10.200> little<00:07:10.350> bit<00:07:10.500> longer<00:07:10.770> than<00:07:10.920> I<00:07:10.980> expected

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
took a little bit longer than I expected

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.910 
took a little bit longer than I expected
to<00:07:11.670> move<00:07:11.910> one<00:07:12.180> of<00:07:12.210> the<00:07:12.390> capacitors<00:07:12.990> and<00:07:13.590> since

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:13.920 
to move one of the capacitors and since

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.190 
to move one of the capacitors and since
it<00:07:14.100> did<00:07:14.280> fix<00:07:14.700> the<00:07:14.880> problem<00:07:15.270> I'm<00:07:15.780> probably<00:07:16.050> just

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.200 
it did fix the problem I'm probably just

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.610 
it did fix the problem I'm probably just
gonna<00:07:16.410> leave<00:07:16.650> these<00:07:16.830> exact<00:07:18.020> as<00:07:19.020> they're<00:07:19.440> worse

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
gonna leave these exact as they're worse

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.560 
gonna leave these exact as they're worse
because<00:07:20.130> there's<00:07:20.460> no<00:07:20.580> need<00:07:20.760> to<00:07:20.790> fix<00:07:21.030> that<00:07:21.240> and

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.570 
because there's no need to fix that and

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.980 
because there's no need to fix that and
yeah<00:07:22.500> I<00:07:22.740> guess<00:07:23.730> all<00:07:23.970> along<00:07:24.300> glad<00:07:24.690> it<00:07:24.840> worked

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
yeah I guess all along glad it worked

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.350 
yeah I guess all along glad it worked
out<00:07:25.200> so<00:07:25.920> thanks<00:07:26.160> for<00:07:26.220> watching<00:07:26.550> see<00:07:27.240> you<00:07:27.330> guys

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 
out so thanks for watching see you guys

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.840 
out so thanks for watching see you guys
