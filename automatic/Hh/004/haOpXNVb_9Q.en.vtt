everything<00:01:26.430> light<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> kind<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
everything light and kind of have the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.450 
everything light and kind of have the
whole<00:01:28.170> operating<00:01:28.500> system<00:01:28.829> go<00:01:28.979> along<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
whole operating system go along with the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.920 
whole operating system go along with the
way<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.640> feel<00:01:29.850> about<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> there<00:01:30.689> are<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.810> lot<00:01:30.900> of

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
way you feel about it there are a lot of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.330 
way you feel about it there are a lot of
great<00:01:31.110> apps<00:01:31.290> out<00:01:31.439> there<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.770> already<00:01:31.890> use

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
great apps out there that already use

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
great apps out there that already use
they<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> switcher<00:01:33.750> where<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:33.990> can

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
they have a switcher where you can

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.749 
they have a switcher where you can
choose<00:01:34.380> from<00:01:34.560> dark<00:01:34.890> or<00:01:35.040> light<00:01:35.070> themes<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.729> I

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
choose from dark or light themes so I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.249 
choose from dark or light themes so I
think<00:01:35.880> Android<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.570> definitely<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> same

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
think Android can definitely do the same

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.660 
think Android can definitely do the same
thing<00:01:37.470> something<00:01:37.740> I'd<00:01:37.799> also<00:01:37.920> like<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.430> is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
thing something I'd also like to see is

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.390 
thing something I'd also like to see is
built-in<00:01:39.360> performance<00:01:40.229> profiles<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:41.130> already

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
built-in performance profiles we already

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.950 
built-in performance profiles we already
know<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.180> some<00:01:42.450> quad-core

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
know that there are some quad-core

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.480 
know that there are some quad-core
devices<00:01:43.380> coming<00:01:43.560> out<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.250> are<00:01:44.280> already

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
devices coming out and there are already

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.280 
devices coming out and there are already
dual<00:01:44.909> core<00:01:45.180> devices<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.810> are<00:01:45.899> doing<00:01:46.049> really

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
dual core devices that are doing really

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.740 
dual core devices that are doing really
well<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.670> they<00:01:47.670> tend<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.659> bit

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
well and they tend to be a little bit

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.030 
well and they tend to be a little bit
short<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.020> battery<00:01:49.409> life<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.829> should<00:01:50.009> have

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
short on battery life so you should have

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
short on battery life so you should have
some<00:01:50.340> sort<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.610> ability<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.119> change<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.750> how

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
some sort of ability to change just how

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.319 
some sort of ability to change just how
well<00:01:52.290> how<00:01:53.070> highly<00:01:53.399> they<00:01:53.700> are<00:01:53.790> performing<00:01:54.210> at

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
well how highly they are performing at

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.850 
well how highly they are performing at
given<00:01:54.600> time<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.020> could<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.320> night<00:01:55.619> time

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
given time you could have a night time

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.590 
given time you could have a night time
mode<00:01:56.130> which<00:01:56.399> under<00:01:56.729> clocks<00:01:56.939> your<00:01:57.180> processor

you<00:01:57.719> could<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.990> work<00:01:58.259> time<00:01:58.560> mode<00:01:58.829> which<00:01:59.369> is

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you could have a work time mode which is

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.010 
you could have a work time mode which is
sort<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.759> more<00:01:59.939> interactive<00:02:00.600> may<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.899> an

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
sort of more interactive may be an

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.719 
sort of more interactive may be an
entertainment<00:02:01.530> mode<00:02:01.860> or<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.100> gaming<00:02:02.430> mode

entertainment mode or a gaming mode
which<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.450> more<00:02:03.719> processing<00:02:04.259> power<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
which is more processing power and the

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.740 
which is more processing power and the
modes<00:02:05.040> could<00:02:05.310> switch<00:02:05.579> either<00:02:05.880> manually<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.540> by

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
modes could switch either manually or by

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.889 
modes could switch either manually or by
like<00:02:07.439> automatically<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.399> maybe<00:02:08.910> by<00:02:09.239> location

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
like automatically so maybe by location

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.750 
like automatically so maybe by location
or<00:02:10.140> by<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.590> Wi-Fi<00:02:11.129> network<00:02:11.430> your

or by the Wi-Fi network your

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
or by how much better you have left

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.720 
or by how much better you have left
something<00:02:13.650> else<00:02:13.769> cool<00:02:13.920> would<00:02:14.069> be<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.430> little

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
something else cool would be a little

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.509 
something else cool would be a little
bit<00:02:14.819> faster<00:02:15.110> multitasking<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.349> I'm<00:02:17.310> really

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
bit faster multitasking you I I'm really

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.399 
bit faster multitasking you I I'm really
a<00:02:17.670> big<00:02:17.819> fan<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.269> current<00:02:18.689> multitasking<00:02:19.230> UI

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
a big fan of the current multitasking UI

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.899 
a big fan of the current multitasking UI
I<00:02:19.530> think<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.099> one<00:02:20.189> of<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> best<00:02:20.549> on<00:02:20.760> any

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
I think it's one of the best on any

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.690 
I think it's one of the best on any
mobile<00:02:21.299> platform<00:02:21.750> right<00:02:22.019> next<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.319> webOS<00:02:22.799> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
mobile platform right next to webOS the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.280 
mobile platform right next to webOS the
way<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.239> flip<00:02:24.450> through<00:02:24.659> cards<00:02:25.110> and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
way that you can flip through cards and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.589 
way that you can flip through cards and
see<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.829> end<00:02:26.040> applications<00:02:26.760> on<00:02:26.970> Android<00:02:27.239> is

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
see and end applications on Android is

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.869 
see and end applications on Android is
really<00:02:27.810> solid<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.379> think<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.159> only<00:02:29.340> part

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
really solid I think it's the only part

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.539 
really solid I think it's the only part
of<00:02:29.970> Android<00:02:30.329> 4.0<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> little<00:02:32.040> bit<00:02:32.190> slow

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
of Android 4.0 that is a little bit slow

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.190 
of Android 4.0 that is a little bit slow
so<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.209> next<00:02:33.390> version<00:02:33.629> of<00:02:33.690> Android<00:02:33.810> should

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
so the next version of Android should

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.660 
so the next version of Android should
hopefully<00:02:34.349> bring<00:02:34.709> performance<00:02:35.280> increases

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
hopefully bring performance increases

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.550 
hopefully bring performance increases
and<00:02:36.000> speaking<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.810> performance<00:02:37.230> increases

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
and speaking of performance increases

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.740 
and speaking of performance increases
quad<00:02:38.370> core<00:02:38.640> optimization<00:02:39.329> should<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.599> on<00:02:39.720> that

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
quad core optimization should be on that

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.720 
quad core optimization should be on that
list<00:02:39.930> as<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.530> next<00:02:40.799> wave<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.489> next

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
list as the next wave the next

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.970 
list as the next wave the next
generation<00:02:42.299> of<00:02:42.420> processors<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.379> phones<00:02:43.829> that

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
generation of processors of phones that

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.199 
generation of processors of phones that
are<00:02:44.040> released<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.579> these<00:02:44.700> super<00:02:44.940> phone

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
are released in these super phone

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.149 
are released in these super phone
category<00:02:45.690> they're<00:02:46.290> gonna<00:02:46.379> be<00:02:46.560> quad<00:02:46.769> core<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
category they're gonna be quad core and

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.619 
category they're gonna be quad core and
then<00:02:47.340> there<00:02:47.459> are<00:02:47.579> some<00:02:47.790> little<00:02:48.000> things<00:02:48.329> like

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
then there are some little things like

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.259 
then there are some little things like
the<00:02:49.140> ability<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.620> unlock<00:02:50.310> straight<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.150> an

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
the ability to unlock straight to an

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.849 
the ability to unlock straight to an
application<00:02:51.659> you<00:02:51.959> know<00:02:52.019> some<00:02:52.230> additional

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
application you know some additional

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.009 
application you know some additional
lockscreen<00:02:53.489> functionality<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.480> mean<00:02:54.900> that

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
lockscreen functionality I mean that
