 it's four gigabytes with maybe with 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.149
 growth opportunity the expansion of this 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.430
 memory up to 32 gigabytes is necessary for this 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.020

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.940

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.670
 shooting video separate also this 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.130
 microphone during a call has 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.460
 noise reduction function that's enough 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.479
 well has an accelerometer accelerometer compass 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.030
 proximity sensor still in front of us on 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.280
 the phone has touch buttons with 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.770
 backlit button back home and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.799
 context menu 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.219
 so back there is still, I don't 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.070
 spoke microphone and speaker for music and 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.350
 speakerphone on this side here 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.500
 on off also lock 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.000
 screen and volume rocker with this 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.450
 there is nothing 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.940
 honest unblock and wrong and 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.510
 let's see the antutu test we antutu test 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.260
 held 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.700
 see this 15700 14 parrots from that 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.709
 I would like to say in general in this 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.680
 huawei phone 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.440
 the company is quite new recently 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.450
 our market and and getting off this phone she 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.330
 should give a good account of myself 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.540
 the phone is generally good quality 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.840
 enough quality is quality assembled 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.640
 the panel is not bursting 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.700
 good on the 5th floor 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.590
 means the launcher is still native here 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.410
 here we tried to put others 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.880
 launcher and native launcher enough 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.760
 cool and flying dresser mean about 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.519
 telephone bugs phone more than two 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.780
 months during which time the two had two such 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.330
 small manhole 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.000
 what were those glitches i.e. phone 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.100
 completely hung did not react to either 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.040
 which button and accounted for it 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.269
 open and take out the battery well i 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.200
 I think that glitches in principle 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.060
 insignificant farther in time 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.190
 so this works this phone works 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.590
 with an average load somewhere around 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.200
 about a day 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:33.100
 this job provides him 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.549
 lithium-ion battery is 2150 miles 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.109
 amp hours and if on average or in mini 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.910
 active mode ie do not watch 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.579
 movies do not play faith use it 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.030
 about here for talking to 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.650
 Internet surfing up to two days 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.459
 Well, in principle , so here is a good 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.950
 phone huawei means how to shoot 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.530
 I will insert the main camera at the end of the video 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.530
 Thank you all for your attention. Bye bye.
