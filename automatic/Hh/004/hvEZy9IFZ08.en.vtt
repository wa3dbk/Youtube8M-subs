00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.689
 hello everyone welcome to the world apart 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.510
 in this opportunity we are going to make a 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.879
 floral arrangement like this or like this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.879
 so that we can decorate any place 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:18.260
 of our house is very easy to do and 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.000
 now I will explain how it is done 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.760
 the materials this I will explain 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.860
 to make a flower and then you can do 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.900
 the flowers you want to be able to do 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.439
 your floral arrangement besides we are going to 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.660
 use a bottle or container to use 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.489
 as a basis for our flowers can be 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.400
 a bottle like this we can decorate it 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.300
 outside if you want but I'm going to 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.350
 use this a little bit to reuse 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.629
 a craft that he had made 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.790
 earlier that if you did not see it I'm going 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.739
 to leave here the link so that 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.760
 You can see it as I did or if you do not 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.170
 I will also leave below in the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.140
 description of the video I will use 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.750
 this a little bit to recycle good that 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.059
 we are going to need a flower this flower 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.409
 I also did it in a tutorial accents 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.790
 tutorials I also think I'm going to 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.339
 leave here the link so that the 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.030
 you can do we're going to need a stick 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.330
 of brochette 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.500
 We are going to need artificial leaves 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 You can also make them yourself 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.380
 paper me in this case I bought them from 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.470
 buy a lot that came they were coming 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.259
 several branches and it cost me one euro and 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.970
 we're also going to need paper from this one 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.610
 uach and tape that is duct tape 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.470
 green paper I have these two 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.220
 shades of green so now I will see 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.830
 which one I'm going to use and it's very easy to 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.009
 what we are going to do is with the skewer 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.200
 side that clicks we're going to introduce 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.020
 in the middle 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.469
 until we see that it touches this part of 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.450
 here and we're just going to make a 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.939
 hole and let's pass the stick of the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.560
 night is then up to the height that 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.909
 we consider the truth is 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.390
 that this is going to leave me a little bit long 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:03.130
 because it's going to be the main flower 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.780
 of my arrangement and I'm going to use this as 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.140
 it's a light pink I'm going to use the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.670
 green light and what we do 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.640
 With paper 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.310
 We put here in the small town taking a 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.349
 piece of stick and a piece of flower and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.790
 we are going to turn it around so that 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.790
 stay well firm 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.420
 a couple of turns to make it firm and 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.420
 a new one we connect 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.090
 and that's enough and I would stay like that 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.870
 and they are now and they would simply be 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.760
 line the entire stick with the tape to 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.990
 do not occupy so much tape I recommend you 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.730
 that you put the tape diagonally 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.830
 so we wind up by one side and then at 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.290
 turn around 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:02.250
 to fill the whole stick 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.250
 in this way 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.819
 we simply turn the stick 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.819
 we are filling everything green 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.820
 and I'm going to leave more or less here 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.080
 if you do not have tape like this one 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.380
 washi tape what you can do is what 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.360
 same but with a green paper band 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.800
 you just put glue on it 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.450
 top part and the scroll is 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.580
 equally as if it were this ribbon 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.020
 and now what I'm going to do is put a 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.110
 couple of leaves 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.480
 around here and a little bit lower and I do 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.860
 the same with a piece of tape 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.860
 I'm going pasting 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.830
 and we would have our flower with the 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.019
 little leaves and now it would simply be to do 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.510
 several like these with different sizes 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.639
 and different colors to make a 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.010
 floral arrangement so now I'm going to 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.010
 show how it is that I have 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.139
 and that is how my 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.460
 floral arrangement I'll leave it there in 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.949
 this furniture because the truth is that there 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.770
 I needed something and good in the box 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:39.530
 I had it before and you know I'll leave you 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.419
 down in the description of the video how 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.819
 I made that box but it's very easy it's a 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.710
 decorated tissue box so nothing 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:47.210
 I hope you liked the video if 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.220

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.629

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.310
 videos and you liked subscribe and nothing 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:05:00.370
 we would see each other in the next 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.370
