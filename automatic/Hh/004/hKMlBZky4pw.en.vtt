00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
to fabric because there's two different

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.560 
to fabric because there's two different
techniques<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:38.380> do<00:02:38.560> each<00:02:38.860> one<00:02:39.130> now<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:40.330> is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
techniques to do each one now this is

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.180 
techniques to do each one now this is
just<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.930> basic<00:02:41.200> piece<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.560> on<00:02:41.830> Trudeau<00:02:42.160> and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
it's a strip that has these this little

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.310 
it's a strip that has these this little
bridging<00:02:44.740> of<00:02:44.920> tiny<00:02:45.250> little<00:02:45.460> holes<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:47.110> can

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
bridging of tiny little holes this can

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.990 
bridging of tiny little holes this can
be<00:02:47.410> used<00:02:47.590> decoratively<00:02:48.070> but<00:02:48.430> it's<00:02:48.580> also<00:02:48.730> a

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
be used decoratively but it's also a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.170 
be used decoratively but it's also a
functional<00:02:49.660> piece<00:02:50.040> when<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.220> want<00:02:51.490> to<00:02:51.610> add

functional piece when you want to add

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.130 
functional piece when you want to add
stability<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.740> strength<00:02:54.130> in<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.820> piece<00:02:55.270> the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
stability and strength in a piece the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.570 
stability and strength in a piece the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
does this so we we treat this edge just

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.030 
does this so we we treat this edge just
like<00:03:21.370> we<00:03:21.670> would<00:03:21.910> any<00:03:22.180> kind<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.020> on<00:03:23.200> Trudeau<00:03:23.530> so

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
edge of that stitching it's it's kind of

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.320 
edge of that stitching it's it's kind of
a<00:03:52.630> tight<00:03:53.340> satin<00:03:54.340> stitching<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.120> really

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
a tight satin stitching that really

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.590 
a tight satin stitching that really
makes<00:03:55.540> up<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:56.020> little<00:03:57.390> bridging<00:03:58.390> right

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
makes up that little bridging right

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.460 
makes up that little bridging right
there<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.860> we're<00:03:59.980> gonna<00:04:00.070> remove<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.470> you

lace<00:06:16.029> so<00:06:17.020> let's<00:06:17.919> get<00:06:18.129> started<00:06:18.669> and<00:06:18.969> see

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:19.569 
lace so let's get started and see

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:22.739 
lace so let's get started and see
I've<00:06:19.809> got<00:06:20.050> my<00:06:20.199> zigzag<00:06:21.029> of<00:06:22.029> course<00:06:22.270> it's<00:06:22.449> got<00:06:22.629> to

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:22.749 
I've got my zigzag of course it's got to

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.419 
I've got my zigzag of course it's got to
do<00:06:22.869> that<00:06:23.050> all<00:06:23.319> right<00:06:23.499> that<00:06:23.889> looks<00:06:24.039> like<00:06:24.249> it's

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:24.429 
do that all right that looks like it's

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:27.209 
do that all right that looks like it's
gonna<00:06:24.550> be<00:06:24.729> great<00:06:24.999> and<00:06:25.770> I'm<00:06:26.770> gonna<00:06:26.979> get<00:06:27.099> this

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:27.219 
gonna be great and I'm gonna get this

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:29.100 
gonna be great and I'm gonna get this
started<00:06:27.520> once<00:06:27.909> you<00:06:27.999> get<00:06:28.119> started<00:06:28.449> and<00:06:28.990> it

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
started once you get started and it

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.949 
started once you get started and it
starts<00:06:29.439> drawing<00:06:30.249> it<00:06:30.369> together<00:06:33.719> now<00:06:34.719> I<00:06:34.749> think

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:34.959 
starts drawing it together now I think

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:37.859 
starts drawing it together now I think
I'm<00:06:35.199> going<00:06:35.319> to<00:06:35.379> set<00:06:35.589> this<00:06:35.770> at<00:06:36.039> a<00:06:36.069> 2.5<00:06:36.999> I<00:06:37.389> really

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:37.869 
I'm going to set this at a 2.5 I really

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:39.149 
I'm going to set this at a 2.5 I really
can<00:06:38.080> work<00:06:38.199> with<00:06:38.379> it<00:06:38.499> a<00:06:38.589> little<00:06:38.709> bit<00:06:38.889> more

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159 
can work with it a little bit more

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:45.510 
can work with it a little bit more
narrow<00:06:41.309> all<00:06:42.309> right<00:06:42.520> we<00:06:43.059> started<00:06:44.279> actually<00:06:45.279> I'm

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
narrow all right we started actually I'm

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.879 
narrow all right we started actually I'm
gonna<00:06:45.639> set<00:06:45.879> it<00:06:45.999> at<00:06:46.119> 2.0<00:06:46.839> I<00:06:47.199> think<00:06:47.469> I<00:06:47.589> could<00:06:47.740> even

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
gonna set it at 2.0 I think I could even

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:53.939 
gonna set it at 2.0 I think I could even
go<00:06:48.039> more<00:06:48.069> narrow<00:06:49.469> and<00:06:50.469> I'm<00:06:51.399> just<00:06:52.800> kind<00:06:53.800> of

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:53.949 
go more narrow and I'm just kind of

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:55.739 
go more narrow and I'm just kind of
working<00:06:54.430> with<00:06:54.459> holding<00:06:55.029> it<00:06:55.149> together<00:06:55.300> in<00:06:55.629> the

00:06:55.739 --> 00:06:55.749 
working with holding it together in the

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.769 
working with holding it together in the
back<00:06:55.930> and<00:06:56.319> holding<00:06:56.830> it<00:06:56.949> together<00:06:57.599> in<00:06:58.599> the

00:06:58.769 --> 00:06:58.779 
back and holding it together in the

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:00.959 
back and holding it together in the
front<00:06:59.020> and<00:06:59.199> as<00:06:59.289> you<00:06:59.379> see<00:06:59.619> the<00:07:00.520> entre<00:07:00.789> dough's

is<00:07:10.839> drawing<00:07:11.169> it<00:07:11.499> together<00:07:11.830> automatically<00:07:12.519> I

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
is drawing it together automatically I

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.420 
is drawing it together automatically I
don't<00:07:12.849> have<00:07:13.059> to<00:07:13.180> really<00:07:13.389> do<00:07:13.539> anything

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.029 
that's the front side that's the back
side<00:07:57.409> now<00:07:58.280> we<00:07:58.340> can<00:07:59.090> either<00:07:59.389> cut<00:07:59.990> this<00:08:00.319> edge<00:08:00.620> off

00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 
side now we can either cut this edge off

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:03.459 
side now we can either cut this edge off
into<00:08:01.370> an<00:08:01.490> another<00:08:01.729> piece<00:08:02.030> of<00:08:02.060> lace<00:08:02.419> or<00:08:03.020> we<00:08:03.289> can

into an another piece of lace or we can

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:05.140 
into an another piece of lace or we can
use<00:08:03.710> this<00:08:03.919> to<00:08:04.159> join<00:08:04.400> this<00:08:04.610> to<00:08:04.849> a<00:08:04.879> piece<00:08:05.120> of

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:05.150 
use this to join this to a piece of

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.689 
use this to join this to a piece of
fabric<00:08:05.569> so<00:08:06.440> let's<00:08:06.740> go<00:08:06.889> back<00:08:07.099> to<00:08:07.250> the<00:08:07.340> board<00:08:07.550> and

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:07.699 
fabric so let's go back to the board and

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:09.670 
fabric so let's go back to the board and
I'll<00:08:07.819> show<00:08:08.000> you<00:08:08.029> how<00:08:08.270> you<00:08:08.330> join<00:08:08.719> a<00:08:08.990> piece<00:08:09.500> of

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 
I'll show you how you join a piece of

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.309 
I'll show you how you join a piece of
fabric<00:08:09.919> to<00:08:10.789> the<00:08:11.210> on<00:08:11.509> trudeau<00:08:11.779> edge<00:08:11.960> and<00:08:12.199> we'll

00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 
fabric to the on trudeau edge and we'll

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:15.010 
fabric to the on trudeau edge and we'll
be<00:08:12.440> using<00:08:12.620> the<00:08:13.009> camisole<00:08:13.699> to<00:08:14.060> to<00:08:14.479> demonstrate

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:15.020 
be using the camisole to to demonstrate
