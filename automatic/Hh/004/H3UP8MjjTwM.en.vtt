00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.070
 when they led to a generator it transforms the kinetic energy that 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.300
 generates in braking in electrical energy 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.150
 in the return to the regulations allows to store a maximum of 400 kilos 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.899
 each pilot will have that extra power to use it as he wants in each 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.909
 turn by pressing a button that the steering wheel is centered 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.909
 around 80 horses for 6 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.130
 die swimming problems 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.520
 the weight of the baby well its volume 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.630
 a place where to place his 30 kilos of weight is going to be key this year another of 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.670
 the problems was to combat the electric shocks that the system causes 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.670
 but it is that you perform exercises in the discharge that you gave to this mechanic 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.290
 of the equipment when touching the car 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.129
 for this there will be a signal code and warning lights 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.129
 In addition, all those who have to touch the cars must wear gloves 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.680
 the psc theory is that we can 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.090
 I would prefer to pick up in the car area when they brake 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.310
 and to come back in the long run or the short general we also know that it has been a 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.630
 challenge for engineers and a monumental helmet for teams 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.630
 in many cases it has touched 100 million euros 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.439
 a system that should have been postponed and is not necessary 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.090
 these types of mechanical and electrical cancer 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.470
 All equipment except for Uria will use the electrical system 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.910
 the electrical one is more complex of the newspapers more dangerous because it uses 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.880
 Lithium ion batteries to store energy 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.399
 the system consists of a generator that transforms the energy 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.700
 kinetics that are generated 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.360
 each round the regulation allows to store a maximum of 400 kilos 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.200
 juniors 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.320
 Each pilot has that extra power to use it as he wants in each 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.070
 return 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.630
 by pressing a button the steering wheel is centered around 80 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.640
 more horses for six and a half seconds 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.030
 Another problem that has generated the kers has been the electric shock 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.790
 that causes after several scares a code of signals and lights has been created 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.610
 warning that indicates the state of the acs 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.569
 the usual procedure is excellent 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.719
 e your intention to jump car 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:14.739
 with the two feet the stop does not always have a foot on the ground and a car 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.489
 but good that's going to be very difficult to happen the batteries are very good 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.079
 isolated from what is the car in general idol 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.399
 what has a high voltage is 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.159
 very well protected 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.199
 I know we have that warning but 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.559
 I think it should have never been subtle 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.829
 they see that the judge dictated besides expensive and a problem for the engineers 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.329
 it is a dangerous and unknown weapon 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.159
 the mechanics and engineers who have learned how it works but we will see 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.290
 see if some clueless pilot would bundle her by giving the little button at the moment 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.290
 should not 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.000
 I think in the end we will use all the button 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.400
 in the same places and it will not do any good not because we have one behind 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.649
 another P 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.409
 I do not think it's a good question 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.969
 we still need to know how to resist the system in case of a 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:10.209
 strong impact of the car those who are here for months insisting on 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.669
 the chassis
