00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.450
 welcome to this video 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.280
 I am monique too rich and I have this 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.679
 video made for you to give you an exercise 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.010
 to show that I myself apply worse 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.930
 in training and during my lessons 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.570
 it is an exercise that fits perfectly 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.939
 good warm and cooling 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.250
 because it loosely loosens all muscles 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.779
 length and the circulation well 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.000
 coming 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.369
 this helps prevent muscle pain 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.960
 solve small blockages and take care of it 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.670
 correct development of the long 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.860
 The back muscle is meant to be 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.500
 horse stretching sideways through in 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.090
 two positions to ride that way 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.949
 you work at the same time a muscle tension 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.420
 between left and right 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.390
 and were extended muscle nicely 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.309
 symmetrical development is the result 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.980
 that 's worth the forward downward 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.570
 trend policy 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.180
 when the horse lowers its head 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.800
 but then on one side there are 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.629
 more resistance 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.020
 would be his head in response 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.909
 bent to bring the solution 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.280
 to focus it on his service leftover 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.350
 of the long back muscle 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.590
 this, after all, has uneven muscle tension 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.210
 because of the natural skewness 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.210
 at the moment the long russel here 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.580
 the horse becomes the forward 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.229
 achieve a downward trend and it 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.390
 The result is that the horse's head 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.320
 can go down without getting into it 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.320
 is blocked 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.610
 it is intended that the horse 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.680
 be independent of the rest of 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.960
 body are head and neck to the left and 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.200
 can set right without being vertical 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.030
 balance to lose to do therefore 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.920
 I also like this exercise on the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.780
 inner corner sleeps so that I can do well 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.539
 check whether the horse goes straight with 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.189
 his body therefore I always focus 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.759
 very clear at a point where i 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.759
 go 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.479
 if you start with this exercise then you can 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.610
 you do the best first over the hoof 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.289
 that there is a little more support for the horse 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.600
 and a few can feel what the 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.100
 intention is 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.610
 for example, start with the statement to 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.920
 Outside 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.170
 take your hand off the neck and your elbow 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.760
 a little bit backwards 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.980
 make sure you always have a knee 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.590
 hold your elbow and your arm won't go 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.450
 pull and fix 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.400
 keep that position until the horse 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.160
 can relax themselves in that position 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.130
 and keep your balance then switch to 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.200
 the inner cities and do the same 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.180
 It is important that you fit your position 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.900
 alternates the moment that horse loses that 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.420
 in his body 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.019
 this for you back in your hand and on the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.019
 back of the horse 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.120
 the looser the horse is a back is over 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.680
 easier and faster your position 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.269
 can change 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.030
 never make a few shortcomings in this 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.040
 we wooden neck pupils at length 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.269
 achieve the maximum result in terms of 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.269
 looseness and blood flow 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.650
 You feel in your hands resistance your horse 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.920
 rot is a body 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.780
 order your question right then serves 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.030
 the horse 's longer muscle to the mi 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.620
 release the tire 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.840
 give this muscle resistance that the horse 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.090
 that will leave the horse with this resistance 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.460
 feel by giving up more resistance 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.110
 the tile 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.120
 so you can very well feel this moment 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.000
 on which the longer muscle pain releases and 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.810
 to length because then the connection is 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.090
 with the horse's head lying in subtle 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.680
 makes the horse feel a bit strong 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.780
 it is that he experiences that feeling 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.200
 body and that it clearly works on the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.200
 store is 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.660
 changing the position is also 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.210
 do a fine exercise on asphalt 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.620
 that way you can feel it very well or 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.470
 the horse does not itself in a certain 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.180
 position , especially in the hollow 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.769
 direction on the photo it often sees 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.600
 to happen 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.280
 the horse spends longer back muscle on the 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.760
 too much inside 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.960
 in it pulls itself into a role 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.850
 then that the horse is above the 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.730
 shoulder and against the outer rein 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.470
 a because the outside is exaggerated brother 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.910
 is shown 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.770
 the by default the horse in two 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.150
 propositions to drive you 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.139
 feel like he is nowhere in the back 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.659
 blocks 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.520
 the smoother the horse becomes in this 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:47.020
 better he is a vertical balance of 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.020
 retained during a switch 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.689
 The goal in it works is that a horse 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:04.689
 nice to follow him at the turk 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.489
 without any resistance or voltage 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:09.719
 any kind of resistance is the voltage 

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:09.719
 nevertheless a sign of the horses 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.820
 through this exercise in your warm-up and 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.950
 cooling down 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.710
 you work systematically and effectively 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.400
 loosely symmetrical and above all 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.400
 athletic horse 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.300
 it is particularly the end of the long rest 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.970
 speedy the horse must let go well in order 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.979
 perform this exercise smoothly 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.790
 this is the area behind the saddle where 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.830
 the loins are located 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.410
 the area where many horses suffer 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.020
 have and are sensitive 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.510
 this exercise can be indirectly correct 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.550
 carried out a very effective contribution 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.100
 deliver to the unloading and smoother 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.680
 from the loins 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.370
 so far this video i hope you are there 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.660
 what to wear 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.660
 and know your success with practice
