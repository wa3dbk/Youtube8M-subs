pretty<00:02:16.890> sweet<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.750> didn't<00:02:18.750> trim<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.200> did<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
pretty sweet I didn't trim I did the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.000 
pretty sweet I didn't trim I did the
paint<00:02:20.190> job<00:02:20.400> with<00:02:20.580> trim<00:02:20.879> clad<00:02:21.530> green<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.739> black

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
paint job with trim clad green and black

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.160

but<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:23.940> sprayed<00:02:24.329> it<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:24.690> time<00:02:24.870> instead<00:02:25.019> of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
but I sprayed it on this time instead of

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.670 
but I sprayed it on this time instead of
rolling<00:02:25.430> turned<00:02:26.430> out<00:02:26.610> really<00:02:26.819> good<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.150> think

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
rolling turned out really good I think

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.500 
rolling turned out really good I think
you<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.860> barely<00:02:29.040> even<00:02:29.220> tell<00:02:29.549> from<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.120> distance

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
you can barely even tell from a distance

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.770 
you can barely even tell from a distance
it<00:02:30.690> looks<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.079> it's<00:02:31.230> real<00:02:31.950> good<00:02:32.370> paint<00:02:32.670> job

it looks like it's real good paint job

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.440 
it looks like it's real good paint job
only<00:02:33.780> when<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.989> get<00:02:34.110> up<00:02:34.230> close<00:02:35.180> can<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.239> tell
