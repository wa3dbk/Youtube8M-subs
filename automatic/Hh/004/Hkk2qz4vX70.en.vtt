 My niece, I think, as a little girl and 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.470
 they taught doing it but when 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.020
 young children begin to sing and talk 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.760
 always causes more thanks when 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.980
 they say they do things wrong then 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.450

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.280

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.240
 champions and well there that we form them 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.000

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.440
 always watching the matches and good 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.970
 happy as my brother said because 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.970
 they really see me happy 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.950
 and after a difficult stage 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.930
 that I had had there in Mexico in the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.470
 which things had not come out that 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.080
 come a year so fruitful of what 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.450
 sports but above all of life 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.980
 so very happy I do not know the laugh you had 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.710
 had a song in one of the 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.150
 teams that I have been in is not good 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.980
 the hurricane and vélez 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.040
 in vélez they sang to me bat and ole ole ole 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.170
 activates you but not as marked as 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.070
 here and now do the same but the network 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.340
 so never so marked the truth that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.410
 then it's incredible, we live 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.720
 all my friends and my family as with 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.180
 many emotions all this year at the level 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.520
 personal and group level that are 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.870
 all very pending that I do well 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.130
 me and that it goes well the roll has 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.980
 much contact with her you talk multiva 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.540
 usually with the family he married 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.700
 with whatsapp with me with my dad who 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.070
 he's just now learning to do it 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.600
 and good with my sister is all day 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.450
 there with the twitter and with all that type 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.310
 of things and I speak I speak often 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.470
 and with my niece but I try to talk 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.209
 quite often with the theme of the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.440
 skype we are all there quite 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.500
 pending how many times have you been told 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.650
 who want the ray to continue 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.000
 well it's pretty inhabitants times like that 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.270
 we're going to 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.020
 to see the decision we made but 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.240
 good 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.100
 well they see me happy and good to be so 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.590
 away and one always 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.700
 luckily they were lucky to see if 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.430
 I had the possibility to come here 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.170
 and see the way I was and that 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.060
 that coming in a stage that maybe 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.590
 is not the best but anyway I 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.930
 they saw well 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.930
 and then now that things are 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.610
 they straightened out to sports things to 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.099
 standard of living 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.190
 obviously they improved but they saw me 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.260
 well at a distance that now 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.510
 they talk to me and they realize that I'm 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.550
 going spectacular and it's not easy to spend 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.130
 the spectacular far from all the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.170
 things that one maneuvers as a family 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.570
 with friends and as a city of one 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.300
 but the truth is that here things 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.220
 They have gone well and the step was very 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.290
 well already to finish the route that 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.580
 we launched by the polar is a 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.260
 folly of the people wants to ask you 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.090
 the realists wanted to ask you and ruiz 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.680
 there is some question that you have to 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.810
 answer us above if there are a few 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.520
 for example tell us héctor rodríguez is 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.320
 the radio hobby the best you have ever 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.569
 seen as a footballer the one that I lived yes 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.290
 the truth that 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.290
 maybe 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.100
 is less numerous than that of vélez or the 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.180
 will last 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.230
 but really 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.359
 with the heat that they give you and above all 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.069
 I am always surprised by the 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.450
 I keep saying threads never touched me 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.060
 live a situation in which I was 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.890
 antetrophically and people encouraged as if 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.480
 we were first and it would continue 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.329
 growing up so I the truth that is 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.219
 difficult because now I'm not going to I can not 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.799
 be very objective specifically written 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:16.799
 also here that elvis the goal but 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.579
 well this is something that did not touch me 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.579
 he has never touched
