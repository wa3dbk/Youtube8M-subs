we<00:00:00.630> have<00:00:00.780> built<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.350> virtual<00:00:01.979> slow-motion

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
we have built a virtual slow-motion

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.170 
we have built a virtual slow-motion
camera<00:00:03.589> where<00:00:04.589> we<00:00:04.740> can<00:00:04.890> see<00:00:05.100> photons<00:00:05.700> or<00:00:06.120> light

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
camera where we can see photons or light

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.680 
camera where we can see photons or light
particles<00:00:06.980> moving<00:00:07.980> through<00:00:08.189> space<00:00:08.630> now<00:00:09.630> you

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
particles moving through space now you

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.900 
particles moving through space now you
have<00:00:09.900> seen<00:00:10.050> dr.<00:00:10.380> Jordans<00:00:10.679> pictures<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.340> a

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
have seen dr. Jordans pictures of a

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.220 
have seen dr. Jordans pictures of a
bullet<00:00:12.240> through<00:00:12.780> an<00:00:12.900> apple<00:00:13.730> but<00:00:14.730> photons

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
bullet through an apple but photons

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.550 
bullet through an apple but photons
travel<00:00:16.230> about<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.740> million<00:00:17.250> times<00:00:17.490> faster<00:00:17.760> than

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
travel about a million times faster than

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.220 
travel about a million times faster than
bullets<00:00:19.609> so<00:00:20.609> our<00:00:20.730> camera<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.779> see<00:00:21.840> these

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
bullets so our camera can see these

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.099 
bullets so our camera can see these
photons<00:00:22.500> or<00:00:23.039> bullets<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.910> light<00:00:24.210> traveling

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
photons or bullets of light traveling

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.439 
photons or bullets of light traveling
through<00:00:25.140> space<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:26.369> use<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.519> very<00:00:26.880> regular

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
through space we use a very regular

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.290 
through space we use a very regular
pulsed<00:00:27.930> light<00:00:28.080> source<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.490> camera<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.060> is

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
pulsed light source and a camera that is

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.080 
pulsed light source and a camera that is
not<00:00:30.599> one<00:00:30.840> camera<00:00:31.289> but<00:00:31.560> an<00:00:32.009> array<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.279> 500

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
not one camera but an array of 500

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.180 
sensors each triggered at a trillionth
of<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.550> second<00:00:35.880> delay<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:37.469> even<00:00:37.770> though<00:00:37.890> each<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
of a second delay so even though each of

of a second delay so even though each of
our<00:00:38.280> centers<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.820> slow<00:00:39.320> we<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.530> still<00:00:40.800> capture

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
our centers is slow we can still capture

our centers is slow we can still capture
a<00:00:41.160> fast<00:00:41.399> movie<00:00:42.170> I'm<00:00:43.170> standing<00:00:43.559> next<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.890> our

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
a fast movie I'm standing next to our

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.750 
a fast movie I'm standing next to our
laboratory<00:00:45.059> setup<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:46.039> this<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.160> our<00:00:47.280> camera

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
laboratory setup here this is our camera

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.910 
laboratory setup here this is our camera
objective<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.780> front<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> body

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
objective is in the front here the body

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.939 
objective is in the front here the body
of<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> camera<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.260> much<00:00:52.260> larger<00:00:52.710> than<00:00:52.800> what

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
of the camera is much larger than what

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.290 
of the camera is much larger than what
you<00:00:53.039> would<00:00:53.160> expect<00:00:53.460> from<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.730> regular<00:00:54.120> camera

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
you would expect from a regular camera

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.930 
you would expect from a regular camera
like<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.780> over<00:00:54.809> here<00:00:55.340> our<00:00:56.340> light<00:00:56.610> source

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
like the one over here our light source

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.689 
like the one over here our light source
is<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.629> titanium<00:00:58.050> sapphire<00:00:58.620> laser<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.460> over

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
is a titanium sapphire laser that's over

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.060 
is a titanium sapphire laser that's over
here<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> beam<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.260> very<00:01:01.559> very<00:01:01.739> short

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
here and it's a beam of very very short

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.640 
here and it's a beam of very very short
pulses<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.449> those<00:01:03.690> pulses<00:01:04.229> are<00:01:04.439> then

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
pulses and that those pulses are then

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.679 
pulses and that those pulses are then
directed<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.000> scene

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.260 

because<00:01:09.289> he<00:01:09.409> smears

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
because he smears

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.710 
because he smears
now<00:01:11.840> our<00:01:12.650> camera<00:01:13.189> only<00:01:13.369> sees<00:01:14.030> one<00:01:14.270> dimension

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
now our camera only sees one dimension

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.510 
now our camera only sees one dimension
so<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:14.930> makes<00:01:15.079> a<00:01:15.170> fast<00:01:15.320> movie<00:01:15.740> but<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:16.250> makes<00:01:16.430> a

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
so it makes a fast movie but it makes a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.960 
so it makes a fast movie but it makes a
fast<00:01:16.670> movie<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.180> one<00:01:17.630> line<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.409> scene<00:01:18.649> only

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
fast movie of one line of the scene only

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.490 
fast movie of one line of the scene only
in<00:01:19.970> order<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.390> fix<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:20.840> we<00:01:21.049> have<00:01:21.200> these<00:01:21.290> two

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
in order to fix that we have these two

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.039 
in order to fix that we have these two
mirrors<00:01:21.680> here<00:01:21.950> we<00:01:22.070> look<00:01:22.189> at<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.689> scene<00:01:23.689> via

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
mirrors here we look at the scene via

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.469 
mirrors here we look at the scene via
these<00:01:24.259> two<00:01:24.320> mirrors<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.070> when<00:01:25.789> we<00:01:25.909> rotate

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
these two mirrors and when we rotate

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.719 
these two mirrors and when we rotate
this<00:01:27.140> upper<00:01:27.439> mirror<00:01:27.680> here<00:01:28.009> we<00:01:28.399> actually<00:01:28.549> see

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
this upper mirror here we actually see

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.570 
this upper mirror here we actually see
different<00:01:29.030> lines<00:01:29.479> of<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.020> scene<00:01:30.399> so<00:01:31.399> what's

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
different lines of the scene so what's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.730 
different lines of the scene so what's
happening<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.600> camera<00:01:32.990> keeps<00:01:33.259> taking

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
happening is the camera keeps taking

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.490 
happening is the camera keeps taking
images<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.460> we<00:01:34.970> very<00:01:35.210> slowly<00:01:35.600> rotate<00:01:36.320> this

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
images and we very slowly rotate this

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.240 
images and we very slowly rotate this
mirror<00:01:37.539> to<00:01:38.539> scan<00:01:38.869> our<00:01:39.140> field<00:01:39.649> of<00:01:39.770> view<00:01:39.890> across

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
mirror to scan our field of view across

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.580 
mirror to scan our field of view across
the<00:01:40.369> entire<00:01:40.759> scene<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.420> because<00:01:42.170> all<00:01:42.380> of<00:01:42.409> our

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
the entire scene and because all of our

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.889 
the entire scene and because all of our
paths<00:01:42.830> look<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.280> same<00:01:43.490> we<00:01:44.060> can<00:01:44.209> on<00:01:44.299> any<00:01:44.420> end<00:01:44.690> go

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
paths look the same we can on any end go

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.800 
paths look the same we can on any end go
and<00:01:45.670> combine<00:01:46.670> all<00:01:46.700> these<00:01:47.149> images<00:01:47.539> that<00:01:47.659> we

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
and combine all these images that we

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.440 
and combine all these images that we
took<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.770> get<00:01:48.920> one<00:01:49.159> complete<00:01:49.610> movie<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.270> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
took to get one complete movie of the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.710 
took to get one complete movie of the
scene<00:01:50.979> such<00:01:51.979> a<00:01:52.009> camera<00:01:52.429> may<00:01:52.850> be<00:01:52.909> useful<00:01:53.209> in

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
scene such a camera may be useful in

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.680 
scene such a camera may be useful in
medical<00:01:54.200> imaging<00:01:54.709> in<00:01:55.490> industrial<00:01:56.479> or

medical imaging in industrial or
scientific<00:01:57.409> use<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.940> future<00:01:59.299> even<00:01:59.750> for

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
scientific use and the future even for

scientific use and the future even for
consumer<00:02:00.319> photography<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.789> medical<00:02:02.330> imaging

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
consumer photography in medical imaging

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.070 
consumer photography in medical imaging
now<00:02:03.590> we<00:02:03.649> can<00:02:03.950> do<00:02:04.069> ultrasound<00:02:04.640> with<00:02:04.819> light

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
now we can do ultrasound with light

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.259 
now we can do ultrasound with light
because<00:02:06.080> we<00:02:06.200> can<00:02:06.350> analyze<00:02:06.799> of<00:02:07.459> light<00:02:07.789> with

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
because we can analyze of light with

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.190
