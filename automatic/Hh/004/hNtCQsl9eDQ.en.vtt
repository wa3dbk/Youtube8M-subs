00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.460
 hello friends you are watching martial channel 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.080
 botany we already had a release about 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.070
 Thai clinch and today we look 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.730
 the difference between the cry of kickboxing and us 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.760
 this will help 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.320
 jura karavaya figure hello now once 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.559
 small introduction what has changed 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.980
 Now in K-1 there is essentially no clinch 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.090
 modern and after section to 11 punch with 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.280
 sticking need to carry 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.800
 From Russia to the head of such a body 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.890
 one arm on this side yes 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.590
 here and grab the essence of doing there 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.719
 let go but you have the right to take again 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.550
 no tacking arena you work everything 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.820
 time freely as the hands as 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.489
 real but earlier literally four years 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.350
 back five were other rules crying 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.820
 what were the similar rules of becoming with him 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 boxing only without elbows 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.280
 tack could take and work during the day 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.320
 5 seconds five seconds without stopping you 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.810
 working on something is breaking all that 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.790
 want our late to go anywhere 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.259
 except the back and neck to and groin 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.689
 accordingly, there are a couple of such 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.340
 items that are in general now 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.220
 applied but there is so tricky 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.689
 such a thing broke came to us then 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.650
 have when we rival shy away 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.950
 then i work jab job job 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.280
 performed 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.250
 yes, I have a chance to catch him 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.520
 performed yes and this use tack 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.360
 hand leaves there and tighter about train 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.280
 this hands does not allow him to go back he does not 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.009
 trying to go back even back I'm with him 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.229
 I go and he can not rise even more important 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.680
 loading his back leg then new 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.960
 leaving and kicking the same 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.170
 the very right x times I can and in the jump 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.299
 protocol 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.459
 also for example just tough 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.770
 grabbing and should try to load this 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.870
 leg so here not so fight will feel 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.660
 you load about leg and well you can 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.200
 You can punch a very good topic or how 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.140
 move quickly from hand attack to 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.510
 go personally you have to intercept this 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.340
 Lacks not two hands until 5 to him so 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.140
 also possible and there is nothing right 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.030
 wrong all that applies in battle 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.220
 acts it is already proving that it is 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.080
 right but there is such a good moment 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.360
 you beat 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.580
 for example on the side greek i will 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.760
 the next movement is already taking capture i 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.730
 how ruined that most insidious can already 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.720
 straight beat open glove and and 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.910
 left there 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.040
 the court quietly thought that just 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.959
 sticking i can even sly yo i can 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.709
 waste open gloves and hand 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.500
 substitute 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.510
 I intercept it with the second hand 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.920
 there is a volume for the back of the head 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.650
 plate glove and further develop clinch 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.360
 again on the same left one 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.090
 it doesn't even matter if you 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.130
 failed to make a seizure and yet it 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.320
 also go to where it is and from here 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.720
 don't forget that you can 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.670
 attack up second hand in place and 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.370
 the very last moment you already missing 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.870
 him here and honestly like thai boxing all 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.790
 clinch thai is a whole science 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.530
 that is, all these principles they act 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.390
 that it is necessary to block him to try here 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.489
 take yes she is not always possible not 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.560
 knows it probably just 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.900
 take it a little lower if 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.220
 Of course your opponent is not wrong 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.989
 the clinch knight 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.680
 Yes, that is, you can slightly neglect these 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.140
 principles you work from here throw in 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.990
 you load 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.819
 and punch another very interesting 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.340
 moment there is a blow through the hands up 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.630
 classic boxing promoter not 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:04.290
 budget oyster hand 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.090
 happens before foxy-woxy crush boxing you 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.250
 either start working through the arm until 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.900
 there can go further 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.130
 go from here immediately to the clinch 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.100
 higher press his hand press u 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.989
 arm so that he could not pull yes y 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.269
 he has another chance there is a chance with you 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.390
 getting close he breaks down is compared to 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.320
 you and all of you do not give you neck 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.900
 intercepting 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.620
 his hand about his hand to you his 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.270
 rate 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.169
 thus you can even elbow 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.820
 it is possible to swim and here it is in the jaw 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.130
 to resist that we grew up on that king knows 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.530
 unpleasant you stretch here 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.900
 tell me he immediately hides in the furnace 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.790
 there can be 5 seconds, these well clobber 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.270
 you will not be able to oppose 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:54.919
 after that moment again yes he 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.460
 here everything remains here makes its way 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.160
 want to leave 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.700
 peck if you catch this 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.250
 trap 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.919
 the same course depends on the dexterity 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.510
 have your rival what else but 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.030
 there is also cunning in what you 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.130
 can punch through his arm specifically 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.690
 beat and 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.700
 injure your forehead but it's full forever 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.040
 little can go about more meanness 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.790
 vie as well as clinch 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.610
 use knees blows yes yes left 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.870
 hips from you took yes tick here i passed 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.330
 in nissan rival already 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.940
 that is, I can work not only for him in 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.390
 corps again he can be from here then 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.789
 there is exactly 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.560
 very good lasted knee and Mazov 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.139
 hips on the inside do not fall into 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:42.719
 groin of the vessel from time to time 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:44.219
 two also from here binges working 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.539
 constantly if you take a flight 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.469
 it protects itself against a tick 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.460
 strongly brings together 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:51.990
 coming close to us from here you can meters 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.659
 very afraid to hit them constantly 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.779
 combine good strong logic also 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.699
 possible during the exit and meeting usher 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:02.460
 if you have not yet had time to take firmly and 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.310
 trying to impose his cry that from here 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.259
 good will go with you will go out 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.849
 kick back turn 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:17.060
 hence impose a nickname on the sneakers waste 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:17.060
 Well, you are forced to sell Shirak from here 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:23.969
 cast can also be signed to you 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.009
 impose a foot dragging just 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.479
 backwards 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:30.750
 That is a very good topic when such 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.930
 trying to grab you by the neck and from here 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.400
 pulls away 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.949
 Basically all I never recommend 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.719
 going out sites trying to him imposed 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:41.849
 impose in clinically the best in the framework 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:44.279
 in general, it will be more 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.089
 masterful shoulders but if you are afraid of him 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.699
 high 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:49.469
 in principle, there everything is already compared hands 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.839
 many colleagues can still with 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:54.479
 each such close is with a fighter 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:55.139
 I want to impose a mass of 1 cup 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.360
 snuggles up 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.379
 c generally tell you to get away from begging 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.229
 you were not beaten with your knees 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:05.219
 your pelvis to come to him and then for what 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:07.710
 strongly worries then up trying already 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:09.740
 do nothing i mean i come to 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:13.610
 he wo n't do anything on his knees 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.300
 until we want this yes but when 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.970
 is close to him 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:21.580
 brought together 5 6 hotels you can pelvis 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.580
 pull off reputation side strokes 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:32.449
 all this will go well in the head 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:34.430
 stay from here hit less 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.860
 effectively now all the rest of what 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:40.580
 he is so not strong and powerful and apply 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:42.130
 it can be a little to the side here as he goes 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:47.330
 in principle, he goes to the thigh 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:49.610
 this is a plan I will remind you that the link to 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.190
