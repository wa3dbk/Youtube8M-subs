00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:06.970
 then first of all we have to look at the world from positioning the loves 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.579
 then 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:13.789
 let's look at our edges that we have positioned bernhard of our procio 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:14.889
 become 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:15.939
 this for example 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.320
 Orange 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.130
 this eberhard 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.929
 mantova cellaro a corner 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.880
 that is 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.239
 Orange 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.929
 the presence 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.790
 let's look at distinguishing between positioned 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.890
 bloom 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.040
 orange where to find us a corner 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.160
 that is 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.290
 White 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.330
 blue 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.960
 caution 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 let's look for the worst orange-blue corner 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
 he goes below where to go 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.410
 now. what should I do we must not move 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.630
 then comments post 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.480
 let's lower this part of our earth face 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.720
 and then lory we report the world is so coincina we report sky 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.240
 ecomostro we say a part of ours 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.110
 the wick layer 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.110
 performed 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.600
 we want here 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.710
 orange rod there is no look for our orange white corner 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.260
 here it is 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.979
 we carry it underneath 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.259
 where to go 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.160
 should go here tenco 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.480
 here is a peculiarity 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.460
 our our white part is the face of one 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.660
 then 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.160
 we must follow this move let's say we bring it down 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.160
 there we carry our face letra 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.180
 put it we turn it down the way it is 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.520
 our corner 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.179
 we say that it is no longer oriented towards the bottom but oriented towards 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.739
 the outside 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.739
 the tree we move 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.359
 no voice came up 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.359
 now we can fix it 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.219
 we put it below where to go 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.159
 let's lower our face 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.979
 we make coincidences 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:37.449
 vettel and alonso 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.449
 here is another corner set up 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.789
 this corner 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:44.989
 green 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.009
 red 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:50.389
 let's look for this little corner then white shit on him 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:52.759
 there he is 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.759
 romatiamo below had to go 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.779
 as we see we have the face of the white woman in front 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.779
 therefore we can to the left 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.279
 ah let's move on 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.759
 we make it coincide 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.279
 I believe that up there 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.269
 done 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.269
 have placed a third pass 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.769
 let's fix this last corner now 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.819
 then look for our white corner 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.199
 Red Blue 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.199
 here it is, we put it down where it needs to go 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.149
 and on our right face 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.149
 the Pope is in white 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.709
 let's match up 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.749
 I think 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.749
 here is that our corners are all arranged 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.939
 then after making t edges 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.819
 and the corners 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.819
 we must do and the second layer 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.760
 so first of all lugano the cube 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.760
 alessandro to analyze of trecase that can happen 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.959
 that is, here is an ancient rationale explanation 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.429
 I love you this edge 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:12.749
 red 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:15.379
 verga means you will go 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.290
 here where there is a garden red note the subtle corners setting two columns 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:25.020
 you put it 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.809
 own duty 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:29.529
 where that part we drink is from 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:34.599
 in front of us therefore this red door vase is placed in correspondence of his 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:35.479
 center 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.089
 if it was this sale put in correspondence of the center drink like this 

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:41.430
 as a roast 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.430
 puts itself in correspondence 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.499
 you have seen that wanting is being able to be lost so there are 2 tenths of the data 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.100
 in the event of a claim 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.400
 if it was only when it would have been the case on the right 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.960
 and then it also happens the last hot case we all say a second layer is 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.939
 risen 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:04.909
 who we are that reference 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.150
 compote be already inserted 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.210
 inverted for example here garden and then 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.360
 red 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.360
 but now I'll show you some pictures because they live better 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.599
 The vase 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.949
 in this case we in over the edge are edge 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.949
 because we have made it coincide with the center 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.740
 is on our right 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.740
 then we must follow a simple algorithm 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.759
 let's leave a right sigh let's remember our peace in front 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.830
 we must make a first 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.349
 first 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.349
 u 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.259
 rm 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.379
 a first 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.710
 land 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.710
 as you can see I am not edgy 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.400
 here we have our second step where the edge we made 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.030
 coincide with corresponding center I ask on the left 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.520
 then 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.330
 to do this algorithm we have to keep the edge to reorder green 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
 in the face of death we will follow the tired rhythm 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.949
 for me 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.879
 a first 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:50.930
 first 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.129
 a first 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:56.129
 fb 

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:00.699
 fb 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.699
 free eco news in law 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:19.679
 this is the sporty cost in which all the second layer risotto to the last tram 

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:21.330
 part of the last edge 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.649
 in which 

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:25.139
 common to be seen are reversed 

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:25.970
 then 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.020
 soon I show you an algorithm this algorithm practically does not say that 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.240
 beautiful 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.280
 d isabella magically deer will reverse
