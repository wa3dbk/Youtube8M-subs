00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
day in Victoria Australia that it's

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.790 
day in Victoria Australia that it's
almost<00:00:08.519> 27<00:00:09.389> degrees<00:00:09.660> actually<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:10.559> getting

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
almost 27 degrees actually it's getting

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.160 
almost 27 degrees actually it's getting
quite<00:00:10.980> nice<00:00:11.219> here<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.670> little<00:00:12.330> bit<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.630> wind<00:00:12.809> but

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
quite nice here a little bit of wind but

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.810 
quite nice here a little bit of wind but
that's<00:00:13.950> not<00:00:14.099> bad<00:00:15.289> mmm<00:00:16.289> yeah<00:00:16.470> it's<00:00:17.400> nice<00:00:17.550> out

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
that's not bad mmm yeah it's nice out

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.120 
that's not bad mmm yeah it's nice out
here<00:00:18.289> good<00:00:19.289> time<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.770> stuff<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:22.100> can<00:00:23.100> see

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
here good time to do stuff you can see

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.480 
here good time to do stuff you can see
that's<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> 30<00:00:24.480> mark<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:25.019> there<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.769> we're

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
that's the 30 mark up there so we're

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.200 
that's the 30 mark up there so we're
getting<00:00:26.670> there<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.150> almost<00:00:27.269> 27<00:00:28.730> ok<00:00:29.730> probably

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
getting there it's almost 27 ok probably

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.150 
getting there it's almost 27 ok probably
won't<00:00:30.449> get<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.750> high<00:00:30.960> down<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:31.769> it'll

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
won't get that high down here but it'll

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.819 
won't get that high down here but it'll
get<00:00:32.250> fairly<00:00:32.520> close<00:00:33.469> that's<00:00:34.469> all<00:00:34.680> your

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
get fairly close that's all your

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.819 
get fairly close that's all your

mounted there is my outdoor air temp
gauge<00:00:46.170> still<00:00:47.129> works<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> same<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.640> for

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
gauge still works the same as for

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
gauge still works the same as for
mercury<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> giant<00:00:49.379> mercury

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
mercury to just a giant mercury

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.600 
mercury to just a giant mercury
thermometer<00:00:50.750> really<00:00:51.750> need<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:55.309> as<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.489> can

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
thermometer really need that as you can

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.619 
thermometer really need that as you can
see<00:00:56.789> there's<00:00:57.059> stuff<00:00:57.390> everywhere<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:59.629> little

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
see there's stuff everywhere and little

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.850 
see there's stuff everywhere and little
cars<00:01:00.809> aren't<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.230> far<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.710> did

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
cars aren't going far and I did

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.670 
cars aren't going far and I did
accidentally<00:01:05.400> drop<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.170> plasma<00:01:07.170> television

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
accidentally drop the plasma television

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.820 
accidentally drop the plasma television
so<00:01:07.979> that's<00:01:08.700> kind<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.390> bit<00:01:10.170> unfortunate<00:01:10.740> that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
so that's kind of a bit unfortunate that

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.600 
so that's kind of a bit unfortunate that
I<00:01:10.920> did<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:12.290> but<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.590> autopsy<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.400> see

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
I did that but we can autopsy it and see

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.420 
I did that but we can autopsy it and see
what<00:01:14.760> kind<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.270> mess<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.659> made<00:01:16.159> as<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.340> can

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
what kind of a mess it made as you can

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
what kind of a mess it made as you can
see<00:01:17.610> there's<00:01:17.820> two<00:01:18.000> people<00:01:18.299> two<00:01:18.420> layers<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
see there's two people two layers to the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.230 
see there's two people two layers to the
glass<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.590> they<00:01:19.920> all<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.070> etched<00:01:20.460> traces<00:01:21.119> on

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
glass and they all have etched traces on

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.270 
glass and they all have etched traces on
them<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:22.049> shall<00:01:22.200> also<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:22.950> happens

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
them and we shall also see what happens

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
them and we shall also see what happens
when<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.640> throw<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> microwave

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.610 

and<00:01:30.300> i<00:01:30.450> guess<00:01:30.600> i<00:01:30.720> should<00:01:30.900> say<00:01:31.050> next<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.800> this

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
and i guess i should say next up is this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.600 
and i guess i should say next up is this
temperature<00:01:34.620> control<00:01:34.980> that<00:01:35.190> i<00:01:35.220> guess<00:01:35.430> you'd

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
temperature control that i guess you'd

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.040 
temperature control that i guess you'd
call<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.410> it's<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:38.120> thermo<00:01:39.120> regulator<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.810> glue

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
call it it's a thermo regulator for glue

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.790 
call it it's a thermo regulator for glue
roller<00:01:40.350> thermal<00:01:40.980> regulator<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.850> glue<00:01:42.150> tank

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
roller thermal regulator for glue tank

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.760 
roller thermal regulator for glue tank
so<00:01:43.800> it's<00:01:44.040> an<00:01:44.160> adhesives<00:01:44.760> type<00:01:45.180> thing<00:01:45.660> hot<00:01:46.530> melt

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
so it's an adhesives type thing hot melt

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.830 
so it's an adhesives type thing hot melt
obviously<00:01:47.400> it<00:01:47.520> starts<00:01:47.880> at<00:01:47.970> 50<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.540> looks<00:01:48.720> like

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
obviously it starts at 50 and looks like

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.440 
obviously it starts at 50 and looks like
that's<00:01:48.900> what<00:01:49.080> they've<00:01:49.200> had<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.410> set<00:01:49.620> to<00:01:49.650> and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
that's what they've had it set to and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.030 
that's what they've had it set to and
glue<00:01:51.450> roll<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.990> probably<00:01:52.230> not<00:01:52.350> connected<00:01:52.890> so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
glue roll is probably not connected so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.500 
glue roll is probably not connected so
it's<00:01:53.190> we<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.490> feeding<00:01:53.760> hot<00:01:54.120> glue<00:01:54.360> into

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
it's we just feeding hot glue into

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.150 
it's we just feeding hot glue into
something<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:56.220> modified<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:57.210> whatever<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.590> lot

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
something it modified or whatever so lot

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.650 
something it modified or whatever so lot
will<00:01:59.460> probably<00:01:59.760> had<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.910> lot<00:02:00.150> number<00:02:00.480> on<00:02:00.630> it

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
will probably had a lot number on it

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.900 
will probably had a lot number on it
from<00:02:00.870> an<00:02:00.960> auction<00:02:01.490> there's<00:02:02.490> all<00:02:02.580> surplus

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
from an auction there's all surplus

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.220 
from an auction there's all surplus
equipment<00:02:03.090> there<00:02:03.570> are<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.660> couple<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.900> control

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
equipment there are a couple of control

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.250 
equipment there are a couple of control
boxes<00:02:04.650> with<00:02:05.640> very<00:02:06.240> basic<00:02:06.450> rocker<00:02:06.960> switches

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
boxes with very basic rocker switches

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.240 
boxes with very basic rocker switches
and<00:02:07.530> things<00:02:07.650> on<00:02:07.800> them<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.950> didn't<00:02:08.130> bother

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and things on them I didn't bother

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.400 
and things on them I didn't bother
grabbing<00:02:08.670> them<00:02:08.880> but<00:02:09.720> since<00:02:09.960> this<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.260> had

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
grabbing them but since this one had

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.650 
grabbing them but since this one had
temperature<00:02:10.860> gauges<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.550> nice<00:02:11.760> switches<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
temperature gauges and nice switches and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.880 
temperature gauges and nice switches and
panel<00:02:12.900> lights<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.500> figured<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:13.800> was

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
panel lights on it I figured it was

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.940

haven't had to use the air conditioning
yet<00:03:49.370> but<00:03:49.940> that<00:03:50.240> needs<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.930> good<00:03:51.050> clean<00:03:51.410> and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
yet but that needs a good clean and

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.020 
yet but that needs a good clean and
that'll<00:03:52.220> probably<00:03:52.370> be<00:03:52.520> one<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.880> next

that'll probably be one of the next
things<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.480> I'll<00:03:53.600> do<00:03:53.830> I'll<00:03:54.830> drop<00:03:55.070> this<00:03:55.130> whole

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
things that I'll do I'll drop this whole

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.100 
things that I'll do I'll drop this whole
top<00:03:55.700> cover<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:57.820> drop<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:58.940> filter<00:03:59.360> clean<00:03:59.959> the

top cover and drop the filter clean the

top cover and drop the filter clean the
coils<00:04:00.320> and<00:04:00.590> everything<00:04:00.890> if<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.070> can<00:04:01.190> get<00:04:01.280> in

coils and everything if I can get in

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.130 
coils and everything if I can get in
there<00:04:01.640> well<00:04:01.790> enough<00:04:02.060> I've<00:04:02.360> tried<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:02.959> once

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
there well enough I've tried it once

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.210 
there well enough I've tried it once
before<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.739> was<00:04:03.800> sort<00:04:04.010> of<00:04:04.070> half

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
before and it was sort of half

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.400 
before and it was sort of half
successful<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:05.090> think<00:04:05.810> I<00:04:05.870> actually<00:04:05.989> have<00:04:06.290> to

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
successful I think I actually have to

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.650 
successful I think I actually have to
drop<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.890> condensate<00:04:07.819> pan<00:04:08.120> before<00:04:08.390> I<00:04:08.510> can

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
drop the condensate pan before I can

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.960 
drop the condensate pan before I can
properly<00:04:08.930> clean<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.319> coils<00:04:09.620> I<00:04:09.980> just<00:04:10.820> put<00:04:10.940> a

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
properly clean the coils I just put a

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.880 
properly clean the coils I just put a
big<00:04:11.300> sheet<00:04:11.540> of<00:04:11.660> plastic<00:04:11.840> over<00:04:12.320> all<00:04:12.410> this<00:04:12.590> stuff

okay<00:04:35.840> let's<00:04:36.080> have<00:04:36.230> a<00:04:36.260> look<00:04:36.380> inside<00:04:36.710> this

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
okay let's have a look inside this

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.950 
okay let's have a look inside this
simply<00:04:38.390> as<00:04:38.600> I<00:04:38.780> found<00:04:39.050> it<00:04:39.260> there's<00:04:39.530> no<00:04:40.960> I'm

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
simply as I found it there's no I'm

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.290 
simply as I found it there's no I'm
taken<00:04:42.770> apart<00:04:43.100> before<00:04:43.340> it's<00:04:43.760> just<00:04:43.940> been<00:04:44.060> half

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
taken apart before it's just been half

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.960 
taken apart before it's just been half
apart<00:04:44.600> when<00:04:44.780> I<00:04:44.810> found<00:04:45.050> it<00:04:45.400> if<00:04:46.400> these<00:04:46.610> screws

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
apart when I found it if these screws

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.940 
apart when I found it if these screws
out<00:04:49.660> since<00:04:50.660> we've<00:04:50.750> made<00:04:51.050> in<00:04:51.169> Germany<00:04:51.620> I<00:04:51.650> guess

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
out since we've made in Germany I guess

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.100 
out since we've made in Germany I guess
since<00:04:52.190> these<00:04:52.490> are<00:04:52.550> gay<00:04:53.330> or<00:04:53.570> meters

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
since these are gay or meters

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.510 
since these are gay or meters
temperature<00:04:54.860> meters<00:04:55.130> are<00:04:55.220> made<00:04:55.340> in<00:04:55.490> Germany

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
temperature meters are made in Germany

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.230 
temperature meters are made in Germany
okay<00:04:59.169> as<00:05:00.169> you<00:05:00.290> can<00:05:00.350> see<00:05:00.440> they<00:05:00.890> got<00:05:00.970> fixed<00:05:01.970> lines

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
okay as you can see they got fixed lines

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.230 
okay as you can see they got fixed lines
and<00:05:02.750> they've<00:05:03.229> been<00:05:03.350> cut<00:05:03.590> off<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.430> don't

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
and they've been cut off so I don't

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.900 
and they've been cut off so I don't
think<00:05:05.390> there's<00:05:05.540> much<00:05:05.660> hope<00:05:05.720> of<00:05:06.020> saving<00:05:06.260> them

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
think there's much hope of saving them

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.590 
think there's much hope of saving them
to<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.030> damn<00:05:08.240> shame<00:05:10.240> yeah<00:05:11.240> stork<00:05:11.810> Germany

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
to the damn shame yeah stork Germany

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.520 
to the damn shame yeah stork Germany
fairly<00:05:14.600> expensive<00:05:14.870> bits<00:05:15.260> of<00:05:15.380> kit<00:05:17.290> is<00:05:18.290> that<00:05:18.500> a

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
fairly expensive bits of kit is that a

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.860 
fairly expensive bits of kit is that a
fuser<00:05:19.010> or<00:05:19.250> bloody<00:05:19.870> switch<00:05:20.870> oh<00:05:22.479> it's<00:05:23.479> a<00:05:23.570> switch

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
fuser or bloody switch oh it's a switch

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:31.600 
fuser or bloody switch oh it's a switch
nobody<00:05:24.110> fuse<00:05:24.770> or<00:05:25.479> maybe<00:05:26.479> both<00:05:29.380> hmm<00:05:30.490> why<00:05:31.490> they

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
nobody fuse or maybe both hmm why they

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.070 
nobody fuse or maybe both hmm why they
have<00:05:31.729> a<00:05:31.760> cap<00:05:32.000> screw<00:05:32.330> in<00:05:32.450> there<00:05:32.600> I<00:05:32.630> don't<00:05:32.810> know

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
have a cap screw in there I don't know

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.199 
have a cap screw in there I don't know
but<00:05:34.390> hmm

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:37.209 
but hmm

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:39.369 
but hmm
maybe<00:05:38.209> it<00:05:38.330> used<00:05:38.479> to<00:05:38.569> be<00:05:38.629> part<00:05:38.839> of<00:05:38.899> a<00:05:38.989> lockout<00:05:39.349> or

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:39.379 
maybe it used to be part of a lockout or

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:45.309 
maybe it used to be part of a lockout or
something<00:05:40.539> it's<00:05:41.539> a<00:05:41.599> bit<00:05:41.719> odd<00:05:43.989> yeah<00:05:44.989> as

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 
something it's a bit odd yeah as

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.519 
something it's a bit odd yeah as
expected<00:05:45.679> there<00:05:45.979> isn't<00:05:46.189> much<00:05:46.429> in<00:05:46.459> here<00:05:47.529> the

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529 
expected there isn't much in here the

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.129 
expected there isn't much in here the
fitting<00:05:49.189> on<00:05:49.339> the<00:05:49.459> back<00:05:49.819> oh<00:05:50.119> it's<00:05:50.509> precious<00:05:50.839> end

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
fitting on the back oh it's precious end

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.649 
fitting on the back oh it's precious end
up<00:05:51.429> that<00:05:52.429> tells<00:05:52.699> you<00:05:52.849> when<00:05:52.999> the<00:05:53.179> system<00:05:53.360> has

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
up that tells you when the system has

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.129 
up that tells you when the system has
air<00:05:53.839> pressure<00:05:55.389> yeah<00:05:56.389> so<00:05:56.689> that<00:05:56.809> just<00:05:57.019> goes

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
air pressure yeah so that just goes

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:03.359 
air pressure yeah so that just goes
straight<00:05:57.319> into<00:05:57.619> there<00:05:58.479> and<00:05:59.479> this<00:06:00.610> sensor<00:06:02.289> will

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:03.369 
straight into there and this sensor will

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:06.219 
straight into there and this sensor will
be<00:06:04.369> rated<00:06:04.759> a<00:06:04.849> certain<00:06:05.300> trigger<00:06:05.599> pressure<00:06:05.869> so

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
be rated a certain trigger pressure so

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.229 
be rated a certain trigger pressure so
this<00:06:06.769> machine<00:06:06.979> will<00:06:07.249> only<00:06:07.459> operate<00:06:07.610> when<00:06:08.149> it

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:08.239 
this machine will only operate when it

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:10.169 
this machine will only operate when it
has<00:06:08.419> a<00:06:08.449> certain<00:06:08.779> amount<00:06:09.050> of<00:06:09.199> air<00:06:09.289> pressure

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:10.179 
has a certain amount of air pressure

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:12.909 
has a certain amount of air pressure
it's<00:06:11.179> like<00:06:11.269> a<00:06:11.300> safety<00:06:11.569> feature<00:06:11.959> cannot

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
it's like a safety feature cannot

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.769 
it's like a safety feature cannot
operate<00:06:13.219> without<00:06:13.489> air<00:06:15.369> so<00:06:16.419> old<00:06:17.419> set<00:06:17.749> of

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:17.779 
operate without air so old set of

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:22.929 
operate without air so old set of

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.670 

berger<00:06:56.470> well<00:06:57.470> let's<00:06:58.069> take<00:06:58.250> one<00:06:58.400> out<00:06:58.580> and

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
berger well let's take one out and

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:20.499 
berger well let's take one out and
autopsy<00:07:18.610> what<00:07:19.610> do<00:07:19.669> a<00:07:19.729> separate<00:07:20.030> video<00:07:20.150> on<00:07:20.360> this

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:20.509 
autopsy what do a separate video on this

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:22.379 
autopsy what do a separate video on this
one<00:07:20.720> since<00:07:20.870> it's<00:07:21.020> a<00:07:21.169> separate<00:07:21.530> item<00:07:21.710> and

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:22.389 
one since it's a separate item and

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:26.770 
one since it's a separate item and
getting<00:07:23.389> nice<00:07:23.599> and<00:07:23.629> close<00:07:24.190> so<00:07:25.449> it's<00:07:26.449> about<00:07:26.539> all

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:26.780 
getting nice and close so it's about all

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.469 
getting nice and close so it's about all
it's<00:07:26.960> in<00:07:27.080> that<00:07:27.259> one<00:07:27.789> I'll<00:07:28.789> work<00:07:29.150> out<00:07:29.300> what

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:29.479 
it's in that one I'll work out what

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:31.059 
it's in that one I'll work out what
voltage<00:07:29.840> these<00:07:30.110> lamps<00:07:30.409> and<00:07:30.620> everything<00:07:30.919> are

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:31.069 
voltage these lamps and everything are

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:35.439 
voltage these lamps and everything are
hopefully<00:07:31.610> it's<00:07:31.789> 240<00:07:32.419> not<00:07:32.780> 110<00:07:34.000> if<00:07:35.000> not<00:07:35.240> I

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:35.449 
hopefully it's 240 not 110 if not I

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:38.890 
hopefully it's 240 not 110 if not I
could<00:07:35.509> probably<00:07:35.780> run<00:07:36.169> a<00:07:36.520> transformer<00:07:37.900> but

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:38.900 
could probably run a transformer but

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.659 
could probably run a transformer but
yeah<00:07:39.229> this<00:07:39.530> is<00:07:39.590> make<00:07:39.800> a<00:07:39.830> nice<00:07:40.009> engine<00:07:40.219> start

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:40.669 
yeah this is make a nice engine start

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.159 
yeah this is make a nice engine start
panel<00:07:41.060> or<00:07:41.180> something<00:07:41.449> like<00:07:41.599> that<00:07:41.659> I'm<00:07:42.139> just

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:42.169 
panel or something like that I'm just

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:44.140 
panel or something like that I'm just
repurpose<00:07:42.830> these<00:07:43.009> for<00:07:43.280> like<00:07:43.400> oil<00:07:43.729> pressure

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:44.150 
repurpose these for like oil pressure

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.080 
repurpose these for like oil pressure
battery<00:07:44.629> that<00:07:44.840> sort<00:07:45.110> of<00:07:45.169> thing<00:07:45.229> like<00:07:45.469> that

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.090 
battery that sort of thing like that

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.040 
battery that sort of thing like that
change<00:07:47.090> the<00:07:47.240> color<00:07:47.449> of<00:07:47.569> the<00:07:47.750> lenses<00:07:48.199> who<00:07:49.039> knows

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.050 
change the color of the lenses who knows

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.890 
change the color of the lenses who knows
these<00:07:51.050> things<00:07:51.110> a<00:07:51.349> bit<00:07:51.469> odd<00:07:52.629> actually<00:07:53.629> a<00:07:53.659> switch

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:53.900 
these things a bit odd actually a switch

00:07:53.900 --> 00:08:01.529 
these things a bit odd actually a switch
not<00:07:54.229> a<00:07:54.259> a<00:07:57.520> fuse<00:07:58.520> holder<00:07:58.909> by<00:07:59.060> the<00:07:59.120> looks<00:07:59.330> of<00:07:59.449> it

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:01.539 
not a a fuse holder by the looks of it

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:06.640 
not a a fuse holder by the looks of it
interesting<00:08:04.630> anywho<00:08:05.630> thanks<00:08:06.229> for<00:08:06.380> watching
