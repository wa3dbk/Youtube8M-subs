00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
get started just climb up here now the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.160 
get started just climb up here now the
first<00:00:37.230> time<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.739> tried<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.570> bombarded

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
first time I tried this I was bombarded

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.819 
first time I tried this I was bombarded
with<00:00:40.590> guards<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.719> I<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:43.260> wasn't<00:00:43.530> expecting

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
with guards and I just wasn't expecting

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.209 
with guards and I just wasn't expecting
it<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.059> wasn't<00:00:45.300> ready<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.020> either<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
it and I wasn't ready for it either and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.760 
it and I wasn't ready for it either and
so<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.430> failed<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> memory<00:00:48.329> straight<00:00:48.660> away<00:00:49.050> now

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
so I failed the memory straight away now

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.830 
so I failed the memory straight away now
the<00:00:49.890> second<00:00:50.370> time<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.730> played<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.480> didn't

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the second time I played it I didn't

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.560 
the second time I played it I didn't
have<00:00:52.020> half<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.590> many<00:00:52.620> guards<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.360> like

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
have half as many guards and it was like

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.619 
have half as many guards and it was like
such<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> breeze<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.500> play<00:00:56.010> through<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.879> I

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
such a breeze to play through it and I

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.750 
such a breeze to play through it and I
thought<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.260> would<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.620> awful<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.460> use

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
thought that that would be awful to use

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.310 
thought that that would be awful to use
as<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> walkthrough<00:01:00.600> because<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.960> wouldn't<00:01:01.230> be

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
as a walkthrough because it wouldn't be

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.380 
as a walkthrough because it wouldn't be
truly<00:01:01.680> representative<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.120> happen

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
truly representative of what can happen

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.190 
truly representative of what can happen
in<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.899> bit<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> yeah<00:01:06.330> I've<00:01:06.689> got<00:01:06.869> about<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
in this bit so yeah I've got about a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800 
in this bit so yeah I've got about a
medium<00:01:07.619> amount<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.400> guards<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
medium amount of guards in this one and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.080 
medium amount of guards in this one and
that's<00:01:10.200> why<00:01:10.320> I've<00:01:10.439> chosen<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:11.040> use<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.520> I'm

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that's why I've chosen to use this I'm

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.140 
that's why I've chosen to use this I'm
not<00:01:12.479> completely<00:01:12.840> overrun<00:01:13.350> by<00:01:13.530> them<00:01:14.040> now<00:01:15.000> there

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
not completely overrun by them now there

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.789 
not completely overrun by them now there
are<00:01:15.210> two<00:01:15.299> guards<00:01:15.659> below<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.080> here<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.619> won't

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
are two guards below you here they won't

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.609 
are two guards below you here they won't
notice<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.630> careful<00:01:18.869> how<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.200> jump

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
notice you and be careful how you jump

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.580 
notice you and be careful how you jump
over<00:01:19.799> there<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.400> case<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.790> miss<00:01:21.439> now<00:01:22.439> I'm

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
over there in case you miss now I'm

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.039 
over there in case you miss now I'm
going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.979> use<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.270> splinter<00:01:24.270> bomb<00:01:24.420> these<00:01:24.780> guys

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
going to use my splinter bomb these guys

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.210 
going to use my splinter bomb these guys
just<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> make<00:01:25.830> sure<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.189> all

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
just going to make sure that all

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.910 
just going to make sure that all
highlighted<00:01:26.909> throw<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.829> will

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
highlighted throw it and it will

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.490 
highlighted throw it and it will
immediately<00:01:29.369> kill<00:01:29.970> them

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.980 

now<00:01:34.160> it<00:01:34.460> is<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.640> good<00:01:34.850> idea<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.270> search<00:01:35.660> these

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
now it is a good idea to search these

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.700 
now it is a good idea to search these
guys<00:01:36.290> because<00:01:36.650> if<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.190> don't<00:01:37.550> have<00:01:37.880> enough

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
guys because if you don't have enough

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.320 
guys because if you don't have enough
things<00:01:39.710> on<00:01:39.980> you<00:01:40.190> ingredients<00:01:40.880> on<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.150> to<00:01:41.300> make

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
things on you ingredients on you to make

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.650 
things on you ingredients on you to make
more<00:01:41.870> bombs<00:01:42.140> they<00:01:42.530> sometimes<00:01:42.830> do<00:01:43.340> have<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:43.940> so

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
more bombs they sometimes do have and so

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.110 
more bombs they sometimes do have and so
yeah<00:01:45.170> it's<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.410> good<00:01:45.590> idea<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.920> keep<00:01:46.120> keep

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
yeah it's a good idea to keep keep

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.680 
yeah it's a good idea to keep keep
searching<00:01:47.660> them<00:01:48.850> now<00:01:49.850> I'm<00:01:50.030> just<00:01:50.210> going<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.510> lay

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
searching them now I'm just going to lay

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.350 
searching them now I'm just going to lay
a<00:01:50.720> tripwire<00:01:51.140> bomb<00:01:51.770> here<00:01:52.130> this<00:01:52.400> is<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.640> caltrops

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
a tripwire bomb here this is a caltrops

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.320 
a tripwire bomb here this is a caltrops
one<00:01:53.950> because<00:01:54.950> they<00:01:55.100> should<00:01:55.460> be<00:01:55.640> two<00:01:55.880> guards

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
one because they should be two guards

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.600 
one because they should be two guards
here<00:01:56.510> and<00:01:56.780> I'm<00:01:57.229> going<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.680> try<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:57.979> coax<00:01:58.340> them

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
here and I'm going to try and coax them

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:06.280 
here and I'm going to try and coax them
to<00:01:58.910> me<00:02:03.340> now<00:02:04.340> normally<00:02:04.700> would<00:02:05.360> only<00:02:05.570> be<00:02:05.869> two

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
to me now normally would only be two

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.999 
to me now normally would only be two
