00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
I noticed when you turn on your cheat

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.990 
I noticed when you turn on your cheat
codes<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:55.350> you're<00:01:56.350> using<00:01:56.590> them<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.759> let's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
codes and you're using them and let's

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.059 
codes and you're using them and let's
say<00:01:58.179> after<00:01:58.569> there<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.350> turn<00:01:59.500> them<00:01:59.649> on<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.950> you

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
say after there you turn them on and you

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.520 
say after there you turn them on and you
use<00:02:00.190> it<00:02:00.340> now<00:02:00.460> once<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.360> let's<00:02:02.080> see<00:02:02.229> if<00:02:02.289> you<00:02:02.380> go

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
use it now once you let's see if you go

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.350 
use it now once you let's see if you go
back<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.100> add<00:02:03.250> another<00:02:03.280> one<00:02:03.789> or<00:02:03.970> take<00:02:04.179> one

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
back and you add another one or take one

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.960 
back and you add another one or take one
off<00:02:05.039> for<00:02:06.039> some<00:02:06.190> reason<00:02:06.429> I've<00:02:06.520> noticed<00:02:06.850> that

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
off for some reason I've noticed that

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:29.480 
off for some reason I've noticed that
it'll<00:02:07.569> disable<00:02:08.080> your<00:02:09.269> invincibility

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.700 

that's<00:02:30.490> pretty<00:02:30.730> cool<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:33.990> guess<00:02:34.990> when<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.440> use<00:02:35.680> it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
that's pretty cool I guess when I use it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.570 
that's pretty cool I guess when I use it
I'm<00:02:36.160> dying

that<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.940> doesn't<00:02:47.130> doesn't<00:02:48.130> really<00:02:48.370> work<00:02:48.580> that

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
that it doesn't doesn't really work that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.930 
that it doesn't doesn't really work that
well<00:02:48.910> but<00:02:50.310> those<00:02:51.310> are<00:02:53.340> those<00:02:54.340> are<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.670> cheat

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
well but those are those are the cheat

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:10.790 
well but those are those are the cheat
codes<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:55.360> have<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:55.870> far<00:02:59.670> no<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.730> get<00:03:01.030> to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.620 

see<00:03:11.800> I'm<00:03:11.890> dying<00:03:12.130> again<00:03:12.460> for<00:03:12.910> some<00:03:13.060> reason<00:03:13.390> I

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
see I'm dying again for some reason I

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.290 
see I'm dying again for some reason I
don't<00:03:14.320> know<00:03:14.410> what<00:03:14.620> happens<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.310> student<00:03:16.240> out
