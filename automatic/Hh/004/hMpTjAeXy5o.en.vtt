00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:04.990
 welcome to step 3 but we dare to place blocks of the second layer 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.430
 first what we are going to do so we are going to look for a manual in the year 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.529
 upper layer 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:15.169
 not to give up yellow but this time yellow in itself but it saves orange 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.359
 9 gill didn't get blue with this shield and neither did we but we start 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:21.189
 with this 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.499
 who is blue orange white blue on the front 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.359
 well that color at the front 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.880
 twente at sc at that associated center 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.779
 that's not so 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.270
 like together 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.280
 if look where should it go 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.660
 belga ypu must go there 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.790
 so we need that can up to 8 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.200
 well what an oen 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.340
 usually an algorithm the algorithm goes itself 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.470
 here at school 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.680
 every school 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 heard a lot 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.980
 thuram shot 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.170
 really upside down 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.980
 and then you see that this game is sitting right still intact 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.880
 it may also be that the cubes are only good after 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.670
 like us here 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.070
 and then all my eyes 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.480
 that is exactly the opposite of the eyelid more for 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.480
 and which rhythm is 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.010
 here at school 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.210
 year in school 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.540
 here at school 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.540
 with apple syrup 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.110
 and then you see that you are in it too 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.760
 and that is white surfaces but still a carpet of searching for cubes that 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.840
 have no hearing in the top layer 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.430
 and stay open that way 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.110
 place 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.320
 and in the end you would be in a situation there are the whole second 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.910
 low is also good sometimes you have situation like this 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.860
 but at rescue it can block wrong to light 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.290
 the takeover of guardians of gaal just a random can block with yellow on 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.920
 just place in this place 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.140
 the country then it becomes 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.660
 there is a serious disease let you know places there 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.380
 and we do very clever shot of erp software captured by algorithms in July 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.250
 he is hiding 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.319
 ndtv and karim and now we see this block 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:14.139
 then we cannot use the algorithm 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.900
 Here, Utrecht also gets disturbed for tips before leaving 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.770
 We will not stand a chance in the depth in the next step 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.760
 need an algorithm for marc
