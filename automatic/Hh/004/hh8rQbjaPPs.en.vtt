you want to basically water it down and
make<00:00:34.230> sure<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.500> absorbs<00:00:34.829> water<00:00:35.010> before<00:00:35.430> you

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
make sure it absorbs water before you

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.670 
make sure it absorbs water before you
use<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.210> way<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.050> get<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> 22

the way that I'm setting this up is I'm

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.450 
the way that I'm setting this up is I'm
using<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:52.170> cup<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.410> bone<00:00:52.680> meal<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.309> use<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
using one cup of bone meal I just use a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.260 
using one cup of bone meal I just use a
basic<00:00:53.699> 8<00:00:53.969> ounce<00:00:54.149> cup<00:00:54.270> one<00:00:55.079> cup<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.350> bone<00:00:55.590> meal

basic 8 ounce cup one cup of bone meal
that's<00:00:57.270> great<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> phosphorus<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:59.219> cup

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
that's great for the phosphorus one cup

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.930 
that's great for the phosphorus one cup
of<00:00:59.609> blood<00:00:59.820> meal<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.600> great<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.109> nitrogen

the pH peat moss has a pH that's four
point<00:01:11.490> five<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.909> 5.5<00:01:12.450> depending<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.080> where<00:01:13.229> you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
point five to 5.5 depending on where you

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.670 
point five to 5.5 depending on where you
get<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.950> that's<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.310> little<00:01:14.400> more<00:01:14.549> acidic

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
get it and that's a little more acidic

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.320 
get it and that's a little more acidic
lime<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.920> alkaline<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:17.939> I'm<00:01:18.030> trying<00:01:18.270> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
lime is alkaline so what I'm trying to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.270 
lime is alkaline so what I'm trying to
do<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:19.049> throw<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.409> some<00:01:19.619> lime<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.070> so

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
do is just throw in some lime here so

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.260 
do is just throw in some lime here so
this<00:01:20.400> isn't<00:01:20.610> too<00:01:20.909> acidic<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:23.270> doing

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
this isn't too acidic I know in in doing

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.120 
this isn't too acidic I know in in doing
some<00:01:24.450> soil<00:01:24.720> testing<00:01:25.110> my<00:01:25.229> garden<00:01:25.680> tends<00:01:25.950> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
some soil testing my garden tends to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.749 
some soil testing my garden tends to
have<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.640> pH<00:01:27.420> level<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.840> 7<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.860> little<00:01:29.549> more

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
have a pH level of 7 so a little more

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.760 
have a pH level of 7 so a little more
acidic<00:01:30.150> peat<00:01:30.960> moss<00:01:31.079> isn't<00:01:31.409> really<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.710> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
acidic peat moss isn't really going to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.469 
acidic peat moss isn't really going to
change<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> pH<00:01:32.430> value<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.850> my<00:01:32.970> garden<00:01:33.329> too

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
change the pH value of my garden too

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.149 
change the pH value of my garden too
much<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.229> other<00:01:34.259> thing<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:34.770> adding<00:01:34.950> in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
much the other thing that I'm adding in

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.940 
much the other thing that I'm adding in
is<00:01:35.280> 2<00:01:35.520> cups<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.060> garden<00:01:36.509> tone<00:01:36.720> which<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.470> 3

is 2 cups of garden tone which is a 3

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.179 
is 2 cups of garden tone which is a 3
for<00:01:38.220> 4<00:01:38.490> or<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.729> can't<00:01:39.000> remember<00:01:39.090> maybe<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.509> 4-3-3

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189

for 4 or I can't remember maybe a 4-3-3
fertilizer<00:01:41.210> but<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.390> also<00:01:42.600> has

and if you can see it but it has a Kali
colony<00:01:53.520> forming<00:01:53.939> bacteria<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.380> going

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
colony forming bacteria so this is going

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.310 
colony forming bacteria so this is going
to<00:01:55.680> put<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.009> bunch<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.280> good<00:01:56.490> bacteria<00:01:57.320> into

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
to put in a bunch of good bacteria into

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.740 
to put in a bunch of good bacteria into
the<00:01:58.649> peat<00:01:58.860> moss<00:01:58.890> into<00:01:59.670> my<00:01:59.790> garden<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.360> we'll

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the peat moss into my garden and we'll

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929 
the peat moss into my garden and we'll
see<00:02:00.930> what<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.590> does<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.280> uh<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.909> know

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
see what it what it does it uh you know

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.969 
see what it what it does it uh you know
boasts<00:02:03.509> itself<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.259> saying<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.770> helps

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
boasts itself in saying that it helps

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.469 
boasts itself in saying that it helps
promote<00:02:05.189> growth<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.540> 2<00:02:06.780> cups<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.229> this

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
promote growth so it's 2 cups of this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.449 
promote growth so it's 2 cups of this
one<00:02:09.479> cup<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.869> garden<00:02:10.229> line<00:02:10.410> 1<00:02:10.830> cup<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.220> bone

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
one cup of garden line 1 cup of bone

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.570 
one cup of garden line 1 cup of bone
meal

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
meal

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.880 
meal
and<00:02:12.840> well<00:02:13.840> bone<00:02:14.050> me<00:02:14.200> on<00:02:14.290> one<00:02:14.440> cup<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.620> blood

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and well bone me on one cup of blood

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.310 
and well bone me on one cup of blood
meal<00:02:15.070> this<00:02:15.850> goes<00:02:16.120> into<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.690> 18<00:02:17.020> gallon

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
meal this goes into the 18 gallon

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.110 
meal this goes into the 18 gallon
container<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:18.280> reason<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.850> want<00:02:19.030> to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
container the reason that you want to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.730 
container the reason that you want to
put<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.330> in<00:02:19.450> first<00:02:19.690> dry<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.350> that<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.590> can

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
put it in first dry so that you can

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.870 
put it in first dry so that you can
really<00:02:21.550> just<00:02:21.580> mix<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.120> all<00:02:22.240> in<00:02:23.670> you're<00:02:24.670> going

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
really just mix it all in you're going

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.380 
really just mix it all in you're going
to<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:27.130> know<00:02:27.220> spend<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.640> good<00:02:27.760> two<00:02:27.970> minutes<00:02:28.120> or

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
to you know spend a good two minutes or

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.540 
to you know spend a good two minutes or
so<00:02:30.900> mixing<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.050> through<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.710> can<00:02:33.370> see

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
so mixing this through and you can see

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.250 
so mixing this through and you can see
that's<00:02:33.730> dry<00:02:34.090> its<00:02:34.390> dusty<00:02:34.420> if<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.930> want<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.170> wear

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
that's dry its dusty if you want to wear

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.800 
that's dry its dusty if you want to wear
a<00:02:35.290> mask<00:02:35.530> certainly<00:02:35.920> go<00:02:36.040> wear<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> mask<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:37.570> next

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
a mask certainly go wear a mask the next

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.360 
a mask certainly go wear a mask the next
thing<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:37.990> want<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.140> do<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:40.920> really<00:02:41.920> soak<00:02:42.220> it

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
thing you want to do is really soak it

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.980 
thing you want to do is really soak it
down<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.820> what<00:02:42.940> you'll<00:02:43.090> find<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.540> this<00:02:43.750> water

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
down and what you'll find is this water

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.160 
down and what you'll find is this water
goes<00:02:44.260> right<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.740> bottom<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.250> peat<00:02:45.970> moss

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
goes right to the bottom and peat moss

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.860 
goes right to the bottom and peat moss
will<00:02:47.170> float<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:48.640> once<00:02:48.850> you<00:02:48.940> put<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.210> some<00:02:49.510> water

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
will float so once you put in some water

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.110 
will float so once you put in some water
you<00:02:50.770> basically<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:51.190> have<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.580> put<00:02:51.790> your<00:02:51.910> hand

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
you basically just have to put your hand

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.060 
you basically just have to put your hand
in<00:02:52.240> and<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:52.990> can<00:02:53.140> see<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.500> it's<00:02:53.650> repelling

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
in and you can see that it's repelling

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.970 
in and you can see that it's repelling
water<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.970> just<00:02:55.270> have<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.540> really<00:02:55.980> actually

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
water you just have to really actually

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.340 
water you just have to really actually
rub<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:58.240> press<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.870> together<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:02.080> it'll

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
rub it and press it together and it'll

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.840 
rub it and press it together and it'll
probably<00:03:02.590> take<00:03:02.830> between<00:03:03.040> five<00:03:03.490> or<00:03:03.670> ten

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
probably take between five or ten

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.160 
probably take between five or ten
minutes<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.720> I'm<00:03:04.810> going<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:07.020> prepare<00:03:08.020> this

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
minutes so I'm going to prepare this

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.600 
minutes so I'm going to prepare this
peat<00:03:08.440> moss<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.650> I'll<00:03:08.980> come<00:03:09.160> back<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.430> show

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
peat moss and I'll come back and show

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.560 
peat moss and I'll come back and show
you<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.790> rest<00:03:09.970> of<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.180> video<00:03:12.420> all<00:03:13.420> right<00:03:13.510> I

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
you the rest of the video all right I

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.310 
you the rest of the video all right I
have<00:03:13.690> soaked<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.080> peat<00:03:14.290> moss<00:03:14.470> down<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:16.320> again

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
have soaked the peat moss down and again

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.500 
have soaked the peat moss down and again
peat<00:03:17.709> moss<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:18.220> really<00:03:18.730> really<00:03:18.910> dry<00:03:19.209> when<00:03:19.420> you

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
peat moss is really really dry when you

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.680 
peat moss is really really dry when you
get<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:21.850> really<00:03:22.120> doesn't<00:03:22.510> want<00:03:22.630> to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
get it and it really doesn't want to

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.490 
get it and it really doesn't want to
absorb<00:03:23.230> water<00:03:23.500> so<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.950> have<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:25.290> pre-soak<00:03:26.290> it

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
absorb water so you have to pre-soak it

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.990 
absorb water so you have to pre-soak it
before<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:26.980> use<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.280> in<00:03:27.370> your<00:03:27.490> garden<00:03:27.820> because

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
before you use it in your garden because

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000 
before you use it in your garden because
if<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.720> put<00:03:28.900> in<00:03:28.990> dry<00:03:29.170> peat<00:03:29.380> moss<00:03:29.560> into<00:03:29.890> your

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
if you put in dry peat moss into your

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.290 
if you put in dry peat moss into your
garden<00:03:30.160> sometimes<00:03:30.400> it's<00:03:30.700> just<00:03:30.790> good<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:31.030> float

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
garden sometimes it's just good a float

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.960 
garden sometimes it's just good a float
it's<00:03:31.450> not<00:03:31.600> really<00:03:31.810> good<00:03:31.959> absorb<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:33.100> water<00:03:33.280> so

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
it's not really good absorb the water so

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.170 
it's not really good absorb the water so
soak<00:03:34.300> this<00:03:34.510> down<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:36.100> really<00:03:36.490> want<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:36.970> get<00:03:37.060> it

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
soak this down you really want to get it

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.910 
soak this down you really want to get it
to<00:03:37.300> a<00:03:37.330> point<00:03:37.570> where<00:03:37.720> when<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.380> squeeze<00:03:38.709> it

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
to a point where when you squeeze it

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.430 
to a point where when you squeeze it
maybe<00:03:39.520> a<00:03:39.610> couple<00:03:39.670> of<00:03:40.000> drops<00:03:40.270> of<00:03:40.450> water<00:03:40.720> come

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
maybe a couple of drops of water come

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.140 
maybe a couple of drops of water come
out<00:03:41.470> but<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:42.340> note<00:03:42.520> that<00:03:42.730> lets<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.000> know

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
out but that note that lets you know

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.030 
out but that note that lets you know
that<00:03:43.180> you've<00:03:43.510> soaked<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.140> peat<00:03:44.350> moss<00:03:44.380> through

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
that you've soaked the peat moss through

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.030 
that you've soaked the peat moss through
and<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.730> ready<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.240> use<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:46.840> your<00:03:46.930> garden<00:03:47.140> and

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
and it's ready to use in your garden and

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.190 
and it's ready to use in your garden and
again<00:03:48.310> just<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.580> review<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:49.120> put<00:03:49.600> in<00:03:49.690> one<00:03:49.840> cup<00:03:50.080> of

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
again just to review I put in one cup of

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.920 
again just to review I put in one cup of
bone<00:03:50.380> meal<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:50.950> is<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.220> slow-release

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
bone meal this is a slow-release

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.570 
bone meal this is a slow-release
fertilizer<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.200> adds<00:03:53.380> phosphorous<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.280> your

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
fertilizer that adds phosphorous to your

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.710 
fertilizer that adds phosphorous to your
peat<00:03:55.240> moss<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.780> used<00:03:56.590> one<00:03:56.830> cup<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.190> blood<00:03:57.400> meal

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
peat moss I used one cup of blood meal

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.510 
peat moss I used one cup of blood meal
it's<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.840> slow<00:03:59.050> release<00:03:59.200> nitrogen<00:03:59.520> supplement

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
it's a slow release nitrogen supplement

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.170 
it's a slow release nitrogen supplement
I<00:04:00.930> used<00:04:01.930> 1<00:04:02.230> cup<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.620> garden<00:04:03.010> line<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.730> line<00:04:03.970> is

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
I used 1 cup of garden line the line is

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.290 
I used 1 cup of garden line the line is
to<00:04:04.390> raise<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.440> pH<00:04:05.740> level<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.880> peat<00:04:07.120> moss

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
to raise the pH level of the peat moss

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.140 
to raise the pH level of the peat moss
peat<00:04:07.720> moss<00:04:07.840> is<00:04:08.050> acidic<00:04:08.500> lime<00:04:09.250> is<00:04:09.430> alkaline<00:04:09.880> so

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
peat moss is acidic lime is alkaline so

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.540 
peat moss is acidic lime is alkaline so
by<00:04:10.390> adding<00:04:10.690> in<00:04:10.810> lime<00:04:11.050> over<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:12.040> next<00:04:12.220> couple

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
by adding in lime over the next couple

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.220 
by adding in lime over the next couple
of<00:04:12.610> months<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:12.940> winter<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:13.660> will<00:04:13.900> help<00:04:14.080> kind

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
of months of winter this will help kind

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.229 
of months of winter this will help kind
of<00:04:14.380> neutralize<00:04:14.770> the<00:04:14.980> acidity<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.640> don't<00:04:16.090> really

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
of neutralize the acidity I don't really

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.729 
of neutralize the acidity I don't really
have<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.510> worry<00:04:16.690> about<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:17.049> in<00:04:17.169> my<00:04:17.260> garden<00:04:17.650> I

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
have to worry about that in my garden I

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.099 
have to worry about that in my garden I
happen<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.100> know<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:19.150> pH<00:04:19.630> level<00:04:20.020> my

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
happen to know that the pH level my

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.050 
happen to know that the pH level my
garden<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:20.650> about<00:04:20.890> seven<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.580> I<00:04:21.910> actually

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
garden is about seven and I actually

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.300 
garden is about seven and I actually
want<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.419> bring<00:04:22.660> down<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.350> pH<00:04:23.710> level<00:04:24.100> to<00:04:24.190> make

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
want to bring down the pH level to make

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.780 
want to bring down the pH level to make
a<00:04:24.340> little<00:04:24.580> more<00:04:24.729> acidic<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.150> six<00:04:25.390> point

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
a little more acidic to six point

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.490 
a little more acidic to six point
five<00:04:25.880> but<00:04:26.450> if<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:26.630> are<00:04:26.750> concerned<00:04:26.870> about<00:04:27.230> it

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
five but if you are concerned about it

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.050 
five but if you are concerned about it
you<00:04:27.590> could<00:04:27.740> use<00:04:27.890> two<00:04:28.100> cups<00:04:28.400> alignment<00:04:28.910> here

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
you could use two cups alignment here

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.690 
you could use two cups alignment here
and<00:04:29.780> then<00:04:29.930> I<00:04:29.960> also<00:04:30.200> use<00:04:30.530> 2<00:04:30.920> cups<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.310> garden

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
and then I also use 2 cups of garden

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.570 
and then I also use 2 cups of garden
tone<00:04:31.910> which<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:32.870> 3/4<00:04:33.530> for<00:04:33.770> fertilizer<00:04:34.280> so

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
tone which is a 3/4 for fertilizer so

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.670 
tone which is a 3/4 for fertilizer so
it'll<00:04:34.760> add<00:04:34.910> some<00:04:34.940> nutrients<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.320> garden

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
it'll add some nutrients to the garden

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.740 
it'll add some nutrients to the garden
but<00:04:36.830> it<00:04:36.980> also<00:04:37.160> is<00:04:37.820> called<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.210> bio<00:04:38.420> tone

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
but it also is called the bio tone

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.550 
but it also is called the bio tone
formula<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:39.740> it's<00:04:40.250> adds<00:04:40.610> in<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.410> don't<00:04:42.410> know<00:04:42.500> if

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
formula and it's adds in I don't know if

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.060 
formula and it's adds in I don't know if
you<00:04:42.620> can<00:04:42.770> read<00:04:42.950> it<00:04:43.130> but<00:04:43.250> if<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.270> look<00:04:44.390> at<00:04:44.570> the

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
you can read it but if you look at the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.610 
you can read it but if you look at the
garden<00:04:46.070> tone<00:04:46.310> formula<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.940> has<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.720> bunch<00:04:48.500> of

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
garden tone formula it has a bunch of

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.280 
garden tone formula it has a bunch of
microorganism<00:04:50.020> microorganisms<00:04:51.020> in<00:04:51.140> there

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
microorganism microorganisms in there

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.200 
microorganism microorganisms in there
and<00:04:51.470> bacteria<00:04:52.310> that<00:04:52.730> are<00:04:52.880> really<00:04:53.060> that

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
and bacteria that are really that
