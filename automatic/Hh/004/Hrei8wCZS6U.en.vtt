00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
every mode starting from the six degrees

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.549 
every mode starting from the six degrees
since<00:00:44.680> we're<00:00:44.800> on<00:00:44.859> a<00:00:45.039> minor

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
since we're on a minor

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
third degree or minor 7th the 4th degree

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.050 
third degree or minor 7th the 4th degree
is<00:01:11.799> another<00:01:12.130> major<00:01:12.340> 7th<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.549> 5th<00:01:15.819> degree

so<00:01:35.270> there's<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.659> order<00:01:36.049> I'd<00:01:36.830> recommend

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
so there's the order I'd recommend

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.520 
so there's the order I'd recommend
memorizing<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:38.060> because<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:39.050> stays<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.500> same

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
memorizing it because it stays the same

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.090 
memorizing it because it stays the same
and<00:01:40.040> whatever<00:01:40.220> key<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:40.580> are<00:01:40.700> on<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:41.440> use<00:01:42.440> seven

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
and whatever key you are on I use seven

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.880 
and whatever key you are on I use seven
quotes<00:01:43.400> by<00:01:43.580> playing<00:01:43.850> all<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.180> time<00:01:44.740> if<00:01:45.740> you

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
quotes by playing all the time if you

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.740 
quotes by playing all the time if you
want<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.100> get<00:01:46.310> into<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.970> more<00:01:47.000> with<00:01:47.270> me<00:01:47.479> just

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
want to get into it more with me just

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.610
