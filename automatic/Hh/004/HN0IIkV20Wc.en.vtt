when<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:03.720> do<00:00:03.899> tutorials<00:00:04.430> online<00:00:05.430> there<00:00:06.180> are

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
when I do tutorials online there are

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.990 
when I do tutorials online there are
images<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.290> text<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:08.130> look<00:00:08.340> at<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.610> images

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
images and text you look at the images

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.600 
images and text you look at the images
read<00:00:09.300> through<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.809> text<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.740> discern

read through the text and you discern

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.209 
read through the text and you discern
the<00:00:11.940> process<00:00:12.509> from<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.960> well<00:00:13.469> I've<00:00:13.860> never

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
the process from that well I've never

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.519 
the process from that well I've never
done<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:15.240> video<00:00:15.540> form<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.230> I'm<00:00:16.350> going<00:00:16.500> to

all<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.500> way<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> final<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:23.970> can

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
all the way to final just so you can

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.359 
all the way to final just so you can
kind<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.840> an<00:00:25.019> understanding<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.980> how<00:00:26.039> I

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
kind of get an understanding of how I

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.480 
kind of get an understanding of how I
work<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.090> how<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.420> could<00:00:27.779> possibly<00:00:27.930> work

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
work and how you could possibly work

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.999 
work and how you could possibly work
this<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:30.029> my<00:00:30.390> pencil<00:00:30.779> sketch<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.679> as

buscemi<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:36.149> head<00:00:36.450> inspired<00:00:37.110> me<00:00:37.320> believe<00:00:37.649> it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
buscemi for head inspired me believe it

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.380 
buscemi for head inspired me believe it
or<00:00:37.860> not<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.250> i<00:00:38.280> start<00:00:38.550> drawing<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.090> it's

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
or not and i start drawing this it's

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.780 
or not and i start drawing this it's
just<00:00:39.570> simple<00:00:39.960> old<00:00:40.140> pencil<00:00:40.469> drawing<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.280> I

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
just simple old pencil drawing and I

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.940 
just simple old pencil drawing and I
drew<00:00:42.000> half<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.960> symmetric<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:43.800> going

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
drew half of it it's symmetric I'm going

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.790 
drew half of it it's symmetric I'm going
to<00:00:44.040> flip<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.309> when<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.329> scan<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.440> that's

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to flip it when I scan it in so that's

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.500 
to flip it when I scan it in so that's
where<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.100> started<00:00:47.489> right<00:00:47.670> there<00:00:47.700> pencil

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
where it started right there pencil

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.150 
where it started right there pencil
sketch<00:00:49.250> from<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.430> point<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.940> sketch<00:00:51.660> this

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
sketch from that point I sketch this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.369 
sketch from that point I sketch this
well<00:00:53.160> scanned<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> sketch<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.629> Photoshop

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
well scanned in the sketch in Photoshop

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.910 
well scanned in the sketch in Photoshop
cloned<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.340> together<00:00:56.989> put<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.260> welded<00:00:58.770> it

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
cloned it together put it to welded it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.860 
cloned it together put it to welded it
together<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.280> should<00:00:59.520> say<00:00:59.730> printed<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
together I should say printed out and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.779 
together I should say printed out and
when<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> looked<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.430> know<00:01:02.640> what

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
when I looked at this I go you know what

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.179 
when I looked at this I go you know what
he<00:01:03.210> look<00:01:03.449> cool<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> third<00:01:04.409> eye<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.159> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
he look cool with the third eye so I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.149 
he look cool with the third eye so I
added<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.880> third<00:01:05.909> eye<00:01:06.330> scan<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.290> back<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.799> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
added a third eye scan it back in and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.179 
added a third eye scan it back in and
came<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.320> printed<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.860> out<00:01:10.920> now

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
came up with this and printed it out now

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.399 
came up with this and printed it out now
this<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.880> sheet<00:01:12.210> I'll<00:01:12.390> draw<00:01:12.869> from<00:01:13.200> this

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
this on one sheet I'll draw from this

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.130 
this on one sheet I'll draw from this
now<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> reason<00:01:14.580> why<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
now now the reason why I do that you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.149 
now now the reason why I do that you
know<00:01:16.229> some<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.619> might<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.799> saying<00:01:17.040> well

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
know some of you might be saying well

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
know some of you might be saying well
why<00:01:17.369> don't<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.759> build<00:01:18.119> from<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.540> well

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
why don't you just build from this well

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.560 
why don't you just build from this well
if<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.470> look<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.920> closely<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.909> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
if you look at this closely it's it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.440 
if you look at this closely it's it
gives<00:01:21.960> me<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> good<00:01:22.470> idea<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:23.130> overall<00:01:23.729> form<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
gives me a good idea of overall form and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.899 
gives me a good idea of overall form and
how<00:01:24.600> my<00:01:24.750> art<00:01:24.960> works<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.380> up<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.640> not

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
how my art works on up here but it's not

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.330 
how my art works on up here but it's not
precise<00:01:27.450> enough<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.869> know<00:01:28.170> exactly<00:01:28.200> how<00:01:28.860> my

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
precise enough to know exactly how my

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.240 
precise enough to know exactly how my
vector<00:01:29.729> shapes<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:31.439> built<00:01:31.710> does

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
vector shapes are going to be built does

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.609 
vector shapes are going to be built does
the<00:01:32.369> point<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.320> want<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the point go here or here and I want to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.060 
the point go here or here and I want to
map<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.130> all<00:01:35.340> out<00:01:35.549> beforehand<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.799> it<00:01:37.799> leaves

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
map that all out beforehand so it leaves

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.160 
map that all out beforehand so it leaves
little<00:01:38.490> guesswork<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.420> makes<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:39.960> more

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
little guesswork that makes for more

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.469 
little guesswork that makes for more
precision<00:01:40.619> artwork<00:01:41.250> now<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.880> at<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.150> point

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
precision artwork now it's at this point

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.730 
precision artwork now it's at this point
I<00:01:42.630> bring<00:01:42.899> vellum<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:44.490> top<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.939> this

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
I bring vellum in and on top of this

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.950 
I bring vellum in and on top of this
this<00:01:46.740> rougher<00:01:47.340> sketch<00:01:47.640> I'll<00:01:47.909> draw<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:48.930> I

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
this rougher sketch I'll draw what I

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.289 
this rougher sketch I'll draw what I
call<00:01:49.320> my<00:01:49.590> refine<00:01:50.009> sketch<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:51.090> is

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
call my refine sketch and this is

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.050 
call my refine sketch and this is
working<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.869> my<00:01:52.079> form<00:01:52.619> exactly<00:01:53.250> how<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> want

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
working out my form exactly how I want

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.539 
working out my form exactly how I want
to<00:01:54.149> build<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.750> vector<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:56.340> pretty

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
to build it and vector and it's pretty

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.730 
to build it and vector and it's pretty
much<00:01:56.640> all<00:01:56.939> symmetric<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.960> exception<00:01:58.560> of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
much all symmetric with the exception of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.730 
much all symmetric with the exception of
obviously<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.549> hair<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.180> top<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
obviously the hair on top and the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.160 
obviously the hair on top and the
eyebrows<00:02:02.189> right<00:02:02.700> there<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.509> that's<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.930> I

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
eyebrows right there so that's that I

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.730 
eyebrows right there so that's that I
scan<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.600> genre<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
scan that in and this is the genre the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.130 
scan that in and this is the genre the
style<00:02:08.099> that

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
style that

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.190 
style that
I<00:02:09.259> will<00:02:09.710> be<00:02:09.860> working<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:10.670> AI<00:02:10.850> I<00:02:10.910> love<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.960> kind

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
I will be working in AI I love this kind

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.140 
I will be working in AI I love this kind
of<00:02:12.350> shading<00:02:12.830> where<00:02:13.040> it's<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.430> tiger<00:02:13.910> tooth

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
of shading where it's this tiger tooth

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.440 
of shading where it's this tiger tooth
effect<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:16.069> is<00:02:16.310> my<00:02:16.550> stylistic

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
effect and so this is my stylistic

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.410 
effect and so this is my stylistic

core base vector shapes and black and
white<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:32.540> printed<00:02:32.959> out<00:02:33.170> at<00:02:33.350> this<00:02:33.500> point

white and I printed out at this point

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.370 
white and I printed out at this point
and<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.160> scrutinize<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:35.120> art<00:02:35.480> direct<00:02:35.870> myself

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
and I scrutinize it I art direct myself

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.650 
and I scrutinize it I art direct myself
essentially<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.310> it's<00:02:37.790> always<00:02:38.090> good<00:02:38.300> art

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
essentially and it's always good art

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.370 
essentially and it's always good art
direct<00:02:38.959> yourself<00:02:39.440> because<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.190> leaves<00:02:41.380> less

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
direct yourself because it leaves less

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.190 
direct yourself because it leaves less
opportunity<00:02:43.220> for<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.520> client<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.600> art<00:02:44.810> direct

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
opportunity for a client to art direct

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.440 
opportunity for a client to art direct
it<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.620> then<00:02:45.830> read<00:02:46.130> into<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.670> more<00:02:46.970> than<00:02:47.269> what

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
it and then read into it more than what

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.420 
it and then read into it more than what
they<00:02:47.570> really<00:02:47.750> should<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:48.739> really

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
they really should so I really

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.130 
they really should so I really
scrutinize<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:50.090> at<00:02:50.209> this<00:02:50.330> point<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.690> print<00:02:50.959> out

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
scrutinize it at this point I print out

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.130 
scrutinize it at this point I print out
and<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.440> realize<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.190> know<00:02:52.220> here<00:02:52.959> it's<00:02:53.959> not

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
and I realize you know here it's not

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.080 
and I realize you know here it's not
dark<00:02:54.440> enough<00:02:54.590> under<00:02:55.070> his<00:02:55.160> cheeks<00:02:55.519> it's<00:02:55.880> too

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
dark enough under his cheeks it's too

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.030 
dark enough under his cheeks it's too
light<00:02:56.300> so<00:02:56.600> I'm<00:02:56.959> going<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.170> fix<00:02:57.350> that<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.890> other

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
light so I'm going to fix that and other

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.430 
light so I'm going to fix that and other
little<00:02:58.370> details<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.209> just<00:02:59.630> mark<00:02:59.959> up<00:03:00.200> on

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
little details that I just mark up on

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.800 
little details that I just mark up on
this<00:03:00.709> printout<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.400> using<00:03:02.060> this<00:03:02.150> as<00:03:02.209> my<00:03:02.540> guide

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
this printout and using this as my guide

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.590 
this printout and using this as my guide
go<00:03:03.170> back<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.560> my<00:03:03.680> vector<00:03:04.040> file<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.640> refine

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
go back to my vector file and refine

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.320 
go back to my vector file and refine
those<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:07.130> print<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.489> out<00:03:07.640> again<00:03:07.940> after<00:03:08.150> I

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
those and I print it out again after I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.900 
those and I print it out again after I
do<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.019> I<00:03:09.739> still<00:03:10.010> notice<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.519> it<00:03:10.670> still

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
do that and I still notice that it still

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.430 
do that and I still notice that it still
needs<00:03:11.120> some<00:03:11.330> work<00:03:11.480> there<00:03:11.690> so<00:03:11.750> it's<00:03:12.320> a

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
needs some work there so it's a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.880 
needs some work there so it's a
continuing<00:03:13.190> process<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:14.209> refinement<00:03:14.890> print

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
continuing process of refinement print

continuing process of refinement print
it<00:03:15.950> out<00:03:16.070> again<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.579> Bing<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:17.329> have<00:03:17.540> my<00:03:17.720> base

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
it out again and Bing I have my base

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.340 
it out again and Bing I have my base
vector<00:03:18.590> shapes<00:03:18.890> now<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.160> can<00:03:19.430> start<00:03:19.700> exploring

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
vector shapes now I can start exploring

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.860 
vector shapes now I can start exploring
in<00:03:21.350> color<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:21.980> never<00:03:22.400> think<00:03:22.730> about<00:03:22.880> color<00:03:23.299> until

this stage all I'm concerned about is

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.990 
this stage all I'm concerned about is
shape<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.019> form<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:27.620> now<00:03:28.160> that<00:03:28.430> that's<00:03:28.579> all

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
shape and form and now that that's all

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.880 
shape and form and now that that's all
locked<00:03:29.720> in<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.290> can<00:03:30.890> now<00:03:31.070> play<00:03:31.310> with<00:03:31.760> my<00:03:31.940> color

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.390 
part is I don't know it can be whatever
you<00:03:46.820> want<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.329> be<00:03:47.450> but<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.470> fact<00:03:48.650> is<00:03:48.920> he

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
you want it to be but the fact is he

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.930 
you want it to be but the fact is he
does<00:03:49.610> have<00:03:49.940> three<00:03:50.360> eyes<00:03:50.540> so<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:51.440> felt<00:03:52.100> that<00:03:52.519> it

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
does have three eyes so I felt that it

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.940 
does have three eyes so I felt that it
was<00:03:53.150> warranted<00:03:53.540> not<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:54.140> color<00:03:54.380> them<00:03:54.590> flesh

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
was warranted not to color them flesh

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.759 
was warranted not to color them flesh
tones<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.489> I<00:03:55.549> decided<00:03:55.970> on<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.269> green<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:56.870> gold

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
tones so I decided on a green and gold

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.460 
tones so I decided on a green and gold
for<00:03:58.130> pupils<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.850> this<00:03:59.450> is<00:03:59.630> where<00:03:59.840> I<00:04:00.140> began

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
for pupils and this is where I began

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.530 
for pupils and this is where I began
moving<00:04:00.920> forward<00:04:01.340> on<00:04:01.519> exploring<00:04:02.239> different

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
moving forward on exploring different

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.819 
moving forward on exploring different
color<00:04:03.500> options<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.510> at<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:05.690> point<00:04:05.989> I<00:04:06.230> set

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
color options and at this point I set

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.979 
color options and at this point I set
them<00:04:06.980> up<00:04:07.100> for<00:04:07.459> up<00:04:07.609> on<00:04:07.820> one<00:04:08.030> page<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:08.570> I<00:04:08.690> print

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
them up for up on one page and I print

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.820 
them up for up on one page and I print
out<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:09.470> this<00:04:09.950> is<00:04:10.010> what<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:10.430> will<00:04:10.820> use

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
out and this is what I will use

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.220 
out and this is what I will use
it's<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.010> pencil<00:04:12.520> to<00:04:13.030> start<00:04:13.270> figuring<00:04:13.570> out<00:04:13.900> okay

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
it's a pencil to start figuring out okay

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.110 
it's a pencil to start figuring out okay
how<00:04:14.440> can<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.770> shading<00:04:15.220> work<00:04:15.400> on<00:04:15.610> this<00:04:15.760> where's

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
how can the shading work on this where's

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.140 
how can the shading work on this where's
the<00:04:16.360> primary<00:04:17.200> light<00:04:17.470> source<00:04:17.830> and<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.640> kind<00:04:19.090> of

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
the primary light source and I kind of

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.570 
the primary light source and I kind of
had<00:04:19.330> that<00:04:19.360> in<00:04:19.690> mind<00:04:19.870> before<00:04:20.140> I<00:04:20.350> built<00:04:20.650> this<00:04:20.890> but

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
had that in mind before I built this but

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.700 
had that in mind before I built this but
this<00:04:21.910> helps<00:04:22.090> me<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.420> explore<00:04:23.020> how<00:04:23.320> I'm<00:04:23.530> going

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
this helps me to explore how I'm going

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.310 
this helps me to explore how I'm going
to<00:04:23.800> render<00:04:24.040> that<00:04:24.340> out<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.900> this<00:04:25.900> shows<00:04:26.290> the

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
to render that out and this shows the

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.220 
to render that out and this shows the
actual<00:04:27.150> pencil<00:04:28.470> shading<00:04:29.470> that<00:04:29.950> I<00:04:30.430> did<00:04:30.910> on

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
actual pencil shading that I did on

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.720 
actual pencil shading that I did on
actually<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.350> first<00:04:32.590> one<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:32.860> printed<00:04:33.280> out<00:04:33.400> for

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
actually the first one I printed out for

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.870 
actually the first one I printed out for
but<00:04:34.060> I<00:04:34.360> hit<00:04:35.230> it<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.620> first<00:04:35.650> time<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.730> way<00:04:36.850> I

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
but I hit it the first time the way I

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.690 
but I hit it the first time the way I
wanted<00:04:37.270> so<00:04:37.780> that<00:04:37.960> gives<00:04:38.260> me<00:04:38.380> my<00:04:38.650> shading<00:04:39.160> this

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
wanted so that gives me my shading this

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.940 
wanted so that gives me my shading this
shows<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.000> large<00:04:40.390> blow-up<00:04:41.050> of<00:04:41.230> that<00:04:41.410> now<00:04:41.680> I'll

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
shows a large blow-up of that now I'll

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.810 
shows a large blow-up of that now I'll
scan<00:04:42.370> this<00:04:43.270> back<00:04:43.630> end<00:04:43.990> this<00:04:44.350> at<00:04:44.560> 50%<00:04:44.950> blow<00:04:45.700> it

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
scan this back end this at 50% blow it

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.750 
scan this back end this at 50% blow it
up<00:04:45.940> 200<00:04:46.540> place<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:47.200> and<00:04:47.410> use<00:04:47.920> this<00:04:48.100> as<00:04:48.340> my<00:04:48.520> guide

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
up 200 place it and use this as my guide

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.990 
up 200 place it and use this as my guide
to<00:04:49.120> build<00:04:49.360> my<00:04:49.630> vector<00:04:50.020> shape<00:04:50.290> and<00:04:51.010> after<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:51.910> do

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
to build my vector shape and after I do

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.680 
to build my vector shape and after I do
so<00:04:52.420> I<00:04:52.720> end<00:04:53.050> up<00:04:53.290> with<00:04:53.620> this<00:04:54.000> so<00:04:55.000> you<00:04:55.060> can<00:04:55.300> see<00:04:55.510> the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
so I end up with this so you can see the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.570 
so I end up with this so you can see the
illustration<00:04:56.320> starting<00:04:56.950> to<00:04:57.070> breathe<00:04:57.250> some

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
illustration starting to breathe some

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.250 
illustration starting to breathe some
life<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:58.150> dimension<00:04:58.630> into<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:59.020> with<00:04:59.230> that

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
life and dimension into it with that

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.400 
life and dimension into it with that
shading<00:04:59.950> at<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.310> now<00:05:00.490> I'll<00:05:01.270> print<00:05:02.170> it<00:05:02.260> out

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
shading at it now I'll print it out

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.650 
shading at it now I'll print it out
again<00:05:02.770> my<00:05:03.160> process<00:05:03.730> is<00:05:03.940> both<00:05:04.120> digital<00:05:04.570> and

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
again my process is both digital and

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.590 
again my process is both digital and
analog<00:05:04.840> I<00:05:05.410> go<00:05:05.590> back<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.190> forth<00:05:06.580> from<00:05:06.910> from

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
analog I go back and forth from from

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.530 
analog I go back and forth from from
digital<00:05:08.110> back<00:05:08.470> to<00:05:08.680> analog<00:05:09.190> figure<00:05:10.090> out<00:05:10.270> my

digital back to analog figure out my

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.560 
digital back to analog figure out my
might<00:05:10.990> what<00:05:11.530> I<00:05:11.560> call<00:05:11.920> my<00:05:12.160> my<00:05:12.640> deep<00:05:13.000> shadows

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
might what I call my my deep shadows

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.990 
might what I call my my deep shadows
here<00:05:13.930> these<00:05:14.380> are<00:05:14.620> secondary<00:05:15.190> shadows<00:05:15.760> that

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
here these are secondary shadows that

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.240 
here these are secondary shadows that
are<00:05:16.120> darker<00:05:16.540> than<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.960> primary<00:05:17.410> shadows<00:05:18.040> and

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
are darker than the primary shadows and

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.460 
are darker than the primary shadows and
my<00:05:18.940> highlights<00:05:19.390> and<00:05:19.720> that's<00:05:19.900> what<00:05:20.080> I'm<00:05:20.169> doing

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
my highlights and that's what I'm doing

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.970 
my highlights and that's what I'm doing
here

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
here

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.909 
here
highlight<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:21.820> shadows<00:05:22.240> scan<00:05:23.020> this<00:05:23.230> in<00:05:23.530> once

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
highlight and shadows scan this in once

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.880 
highlight and shadows scan this in once
again<00:05:24.220> build<00:05:24.880> it<00:05:25.060> in<00:05:25.150> vector<00:05:25.330> form<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.110> I<00:05:26.650> get

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
again build it in vector form and I get

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.500 
again build it in vector form and I get
to<00:05:27.100> this<00:05:27.250> stage<00:05:27.550> so<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:27.880> really<00:05:28.240> see<00:05:28.419> it

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
to this stage so you really see it

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.030 
to this stage so you really see it
starting<00:05:28.810> to<00:05:28.870> come<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:29.200> life<00:05:29.380> now<00:05:29.620> with<00:05:29.860> all

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
starting to come to life now with all

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.159 
starting to come to life now with all
these<00:05:30.190> highlights<00:05:30.730> and<00:05:31.000> shadows<00:05:31.030> but<00:05:31.870> it's<00:05:32.020> at

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
these highlights and shadows but it's at

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.290 
these highlights and shadows but it's at
this<00:05:32.350> point<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:32.980> feel<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.700> hairs<00:05:33.970> too

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
this point that I feel the hairs too

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.990 
this point that I feel the hairs too
flat<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:34.810> black<00:05:35.350> I<00:05:35.710> need<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.250> bring<00:05:36.490> some<00:05:36.760> life

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
flat and black I need to bring some life

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.810 
flat and black I need to bring some life
to<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.450> so<00:05:38.050> I<00:05:38.410> add<00:05:38.620> this<00:05:38.919> highlighting<00:05:39.610> in

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
to that so I add this highlighting in

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.540 
to that so I add this highlighting in
and<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.270> really<00:05:40.630> pops<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.290> hair<00:05:41.560> really
