00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and they call it that because the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.690 
and they call it that because the
numbers<00:01:17.790> are<00:01:18.119> huge<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
days 13 hours and 38 minutes and then

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:29.840 
days 13 hours and 38 minutes and then
though<00:01:28.920> they<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> time<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.400> day<00:01:29.640> at<00:01:29.759> the

though they have the time of day at the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.149 
though they have the time of day at the
bottom<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.900> could<00:01:31.200> use<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.500> same<00:01:31.799> exact

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
bottom now I could use this same exact

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.749 
bottom now I could use this same exact
information<00:01:33.170> as<00:01:34.170> slate<00:01:34.590> information<00:01:35.159> this

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
information as slate information this

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.700 
information as slate information this
could<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.210> seen<00:01:36.479> information<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.560> then

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
could be seen information here and then

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.620 
could be seen information here and then
take<00:01:37.950> information<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.329> would<00:01:39.479> be

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
take information here so this would be

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.219 
take information here so this would be
scene<00:01:39.930> 42<00:01:40.470> /<00:01:40.680> 13<00:01:41.340> take<00:01:42.060> 38<00:01:42.450> that's<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.960> lot<00:01:43.140> of

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
scene 42 / 13 take 38 that's a lot of

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.499 
scene 42 / 13 take 38 that's a lot of
takes<00:01:43.439> must<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> Kubrick<00:01:44.220> film<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.390> then

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
takes must be a Kubrick film and then

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.030 
takes must be a Kubrick film and then
you<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> time<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.229> day<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> bottom
