00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
ten years that you know for everything

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.990 
ten years that you know for everything
that<00:03:54.360> can<00:03:54.510> be<00:03:54.570> poor<00:03:54.989> is<00:03:55.110> older<00:03:55.530> than<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:56.000> 1985

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
that can be poor is older than that 1985

I<00:03:57.420> know<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.500> I'm<00:03:59.100> starting<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.489> second-guess

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
I know and I'm starting to second-guess

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.090 
I know and I'm starting to second-guess
my<00:04:00.420> opinion<00:04:00.930> on<00:04:01.050> this<00:04:01.230> it's<00:04:01.470> like<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.650> think

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
my opinion on this it's like I think

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.490 
my opinion on this it's like I think
maybe<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.400> forgot<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.300> some<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.989> these<00:04:04.110> older

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
maybe I forgot that some of these older

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.320 
maybe I forgot that some of these older
movies<00:04:04.830> actually

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
movies actually

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.910 
movies actually
hold<00:04:05.540> up<00:04:05.690> pretty<00:04:05.870> well<00:04:06.050> back<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.710> the<00:04:06.800> future

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
hold up pretty well back to the future

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.460 
hold up pretty well back to the future
