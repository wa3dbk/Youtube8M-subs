00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.170
 to 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:16.049
 is another new video review that gives them 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:18.840
 I bring thanks to cristian and in this case 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.000
 be watching the last one speaks a video 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.500
 that came out why good to the new 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.820
 announced should be two already and 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.579
 comparing it a little bit with the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.980
 previous version of assets 1 these of 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.579
 captain america of a smooth smell like 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.840
 demonstrate the slit very similar to 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.010
 interior 10 just as we have 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.060
 reviewed previously same style with 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.280
 The same design and type shoe box 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.469
 It is very functional and correct 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.399
 all black widow the truth is that 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.290
 we bring too many things several hands 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.449
 interchangeable bracelets 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.420
 interchangeable hands have the 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.030
 detail that one comes with the gloves 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.470
 blacks and the others come with the effect 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.720
 that electricity that is good in the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.250
 paint was up well done so 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.320
 we do not have hands of those two types in 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.300
 several positions for what we 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.850
 we need 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:27.690
 then does not come with this cell phone the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.690
 which fulfills was dating has 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.150
 it opens in this way nothing the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.310
 true that fulfills its function nothing 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.820
 what to highlight about it has a 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.760
 decal only 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.780
 it comes with two revolvers which 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.360
 the 220 are the same and the base is 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.250
 regulated nothing more than this task 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.050
 I use more things in the movie 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.020
 it seems that out there for these figures 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:03.080
 could include some extra base with 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.630
 some kind of diorama or something that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.209
 enrich a little bit more one of the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.910
 parts where this figure shines is in 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.400
 the suit as in the case of the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.750
 winter soldier the truth that they put 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.319
 everything here we have mix corina with fabric 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.940
 with plastic 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.300
 has realism very 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.040
 as also in the case of boots the 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.060
 true that in that sense of work 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.970
 light 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.860
 good and I think that 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.470
 that's why you want to be one of the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.600
 major differences in terms of 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.110
 noisy previous 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.510
 although the costume of this one is different from 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.930
 of the previous ones also in the movie 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.770
 I think their hair was very good 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.410
 real type 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.080
 I think the fall is very good 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.210
 which is a problem that I had 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.050
 any 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.260
 other cases cut a hair in this style 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.750
 it seems that this return was very 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.980
 well and it fits the figures very well 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.350
 needs retouching as many joints 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.460
 it's pretty good because it's the neck 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.230
 do not 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.450
 have any convenient 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.379
 just like they are 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.379
 the arms 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.099
 and the dolls 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.329
 they are all parts that we can articulate 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.510
 practically to the maximum without any 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:39.469
 problem we have problems if in what 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.689
 it's the torso that's good with the different 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.879
 types of fabrics make it restrict a 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:47.100
 little joints as we can see 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.350
 there in the leg 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.250
 in a little the joints in some 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.130
 parts and rubber boots either 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.530
 allow too many joints in the 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.690
 ankles comparing a little bit both 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.750
 good figures this is a bit complicated 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.030
 since I think that each one is pretty 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.640
 true to the movie version that 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.610
 belongs it seems to me that the suit of the 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.190
 new looks better but it is also 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.050
 different although I think it's 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.080
 better executed I think this is the 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:21.120
 greater difference between the two although 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.840
 as I said before each one faithful to her 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.900
 film it seems to me that the materials 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.570
 who have chosen for this new suit 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.630
 I think that make the difference 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.960
 there bigger of this black widow with 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.030
 with respect to the previous one in what is the 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.880
 sculpted from the face I really like how 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.580
 is this but I can not say that I do not 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.030
 like the previous one since the version of 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.300
 avengers I really like the expression and 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.940
 the face as it has been left not so much what 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.070
 which is the hair that in that sense if such 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.340
 time in this that better but this time 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.930
 It is also easier to do 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:08.250
 but the faces I think it will taste 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:11.250
 carrier I liked both so 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.710
 good friends this is the third black 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.949
 widow that goes to the market of the just and if 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.979
 I do not remember correctly at this time they have 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:21.840
 seen improvements but between the last two 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.120
 as we saw it is quite even in the 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.880
 proportions of the figures between both 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.430
 it seems to me that there is also no great 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.770
 evolution since it is black widow me 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.670
 it seems that it is thinner than what 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.800
 it was in the movie the avengers 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.620
 that each one 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.870
 is that it's going to stop for your movie another 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.330
 idea that I have is that it does not seem bad 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.199
 for this type of figures guess with 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:52.400
 few things that could include a 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:55.039
 extra for another figure let's say he sealed 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.270
 a new sculpted for the captain 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:01.470
 America with another expression on her face 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:05.190
 how they had done 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:09.140
 time with the sarah connor version of 1000 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:12.390
 which included a mini tea head 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.390
 extra that was only available in this 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.090
 version and I think it greatly enriched the 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.120
 figure since you were not interested in there 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.780
 much both the room with the yes but have 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.230
 the head of extras was also another 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.510
 club was another attraction to spend 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.760
 our money 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:36.840
 in this figure, I think it would be 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.720
 a good and viable option for photos in 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.910
 case of figures that take us 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.430
 too many accessories friends 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.010
 thank you very much for looking we are 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.770
 watching in some other video and if there 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.910
 some interesting news we will be with 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.910
 that soon
