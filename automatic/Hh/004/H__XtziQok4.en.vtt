was<00:00:36.140> essentially<00:00:36.559> underneath<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:36.980> tarps<00:00:37.249> the

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
was essentially underneath the tarps the

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:38.680 
was essentially underneath the tarps the
whole<00:00:37.460> time<00:00:37.730> because<00:00:37.940> I<00:00:38.120> came<00:00:38.300> up<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:38.510> checked

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
whole time because I came up and checked

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.930 
whole time because I came up and checked
it<00:00:38.809> several<00:00:39.050> times<00:00:39.289> so<00:00:39.760> basically<00:00:40.760> this<00:00:40.879> whole

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
it several times so basically this whole

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.959 
it several times so basically this whole
tarping<00:00:41.390> didn't<00:00:41.570> work<00:00:41.749> and<00:00:42.370> nails<00:00:43.370> were<00:00:43.730> put

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
tarping didn't work and nails were put

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:54.130 
tarping didn't work and nails were put
through<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:48.909> tarp<00:00:50.230> right<00:00:51.230> into<00:00:51.649> our<00:00:51.679> roof<00:00:53.140> so

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
through the tarp right into our roof so

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.930 
through the tarp right into our roof so
they<00:00:54.350> nailed<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.890> tarp<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.550> there<00:00:55.670> were<00:00:55.760> some

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940
