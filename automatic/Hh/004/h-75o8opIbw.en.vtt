00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
that's even the word for it but I was

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.930

like oh my god that is so creepy because

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.640 
like oh my god that is so creepy because
it's<00:05:36.900> very<00:05:37.140> uncommon<00:05:37.670> but<00:05:38.670> on<00:05:39.000> a<00:05:39.060> pain<00:05:39.650> the

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
it's very uncommon but on a pain the

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.610 
it's very uncommon but on a pain the

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
least painful and ten being the most I

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.150 
least painful and ten being the most I

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
would probably give it a three and

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.160 
would probably give it a three and
healing<00:05:50.160> time<00:05:50.400> was<00:05:50.700> a<00:05:50.730> breeze<00:05:51.090> I<00:05:51.420> didn't
