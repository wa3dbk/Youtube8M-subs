00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.370
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.679
 another small unboxing of 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.070
 mobile-review I stand again something 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.640
 cheap is the sony xperia takes the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.170
 dual with the built-in walkman player 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.730
 even here the color is about 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.670
 was shown with thankfulness 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.849
 from your onlineshop getgo de zur 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.960
 Provision so I have it 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.489
 in the meantime just that 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.320
 Packaging opened with the look 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.180
 so it could all throw in I say 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.040
 sometimes more or less messy 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.050
 thrown apart from the smartphone 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 what trey from a small park as 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.559
 Everything comes together at the xperia prix 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.110
 by simply showing the carton 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.059
 turns upside down and does not shake 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 and the whole then just simply times 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.129
 assorted quick start sr information 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.129
 Of course you should not miss something 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.050
 so to speak, the normal 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.420
 headset must not be missing so that we 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.399
 listening to music on the go 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.290
 we still have a suitable battery for 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.939
 that is with 1500 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.510
 milliamps is just fine 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.150
 recognize 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.570
 We'll be right in town 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.979
 year data cable usb to micro sd and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.970
 of course, also a suitable one 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.400
 charger for this the outlet and last 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.330
 but not least, how so beautiful also says 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.790
 by the way, the xperia j itself here in the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.430
 black variant probably the carton of 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.460
 There was only golden on the outside 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.079
 Black's back is with one 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.500
 Waffle-like surface I say 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.030
 provided or rather gummed or how 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.590
 Whatever you want to say it does not 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.560
 definitely very good in the hand 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.990
 we see the 3.2 megapixels up here 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.390
 Camera only takes videos in vga quality 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.869
 on 512 mb ram 1 ghz single core 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.159
 Processor 4 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.259
 front you already see one 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.310
 Protected film still that I will 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.840
 just now 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.320
 remove because I do not need that 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.909
 blow more too much 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.550
 so that the whole is neatly smooth 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.470
 here we see the display 3 5 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.380
 inch diagonal and an incredible 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.320
 Resolution of 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.040
 120 x 480 pixels you probably think 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.010
 beautiful 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.440
 this is definitely one 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.420
 entry-level smartphone below the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.490
 displays three sensor keys backward 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.620
 home button and context sensitive help 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.740
 on the left side we see the one here 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.490
 access micro-usb base completely 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.700
 free top 35 mm headset port right 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.770
 outside loudly and quietly button 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.450
 camera button and on and off switch what 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.040
 we are still missing the access to 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.590
 battery cover so we will the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.870
 he 'd like to just do that 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.070
 just push the noise 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.060
 it cracked neat micro-usb that 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.980
 means we can store also 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.980
 expanded we want and very important 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.810
 It means dual I can do two here 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.170
 can insert sim cards so with both 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.880
 sim cards in parallel call and that 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.330
 I will test in any case 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.030
 then the accor plugged in first 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.740
 the lid on it all the way 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.870
 Engage the neat 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.430
 Processing the cheap home what you want 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.410
 I say because it is relatively cheap 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.350
 is ok is not ok now 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.570
 so sure he's the one he's watching 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.980
 category square practical or in 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.750
 the case so slightly 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.960
 inside, the dimensions are curved 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.360
 by the way, 114 millimeters in length 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.450
 just under 62 millimeters in width and 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.360
 eleven millimeters in thickness so the first one 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.950
 follow brut has taken several minutes 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.390
 So that's where you're comfortable 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.590
 you can make another cup of coffee 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.940
 relate the possibility different 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.340
 select languages ​​for example 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.590
 German and Germany very helpful 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.530
 to me 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:54.220
 you may see the whole thing reacting 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.700
 now a bit sluggish and shows us all 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.500
 normal user interface of sony and the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.730
 icons when loaded in the background and 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.720
 which is very important in the device that 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.940
 This protection of this front protection 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.860
 it's so thin that you're comfortable with it 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.780
 fingers when you press on it 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.930
 can trigger something 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.590
 that does not only mean the function but 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.470
 also expresses certain plasma effects 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.420
 this goes directly into the display itself we 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.880
 go 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.650
 in the appropriate setting 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.240
 look which operating systems on it 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:33.090
 is over the phone we can find here 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.420
 android 4 0 4 that's android ice cream 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.040
 cream sandwich updates I think 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.360
 could follow jelly bean must 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.000
 but it does not have the manufacturer yet 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.250
 asked and knows about it too 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.280
 nothing specific 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:52.230
 yes it should have been unboxing 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.240
