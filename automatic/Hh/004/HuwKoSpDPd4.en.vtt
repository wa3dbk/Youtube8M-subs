00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.820 
I believe so what you're going to want
to<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.700> go<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.970> file<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.479> not<00:01:22.320> file<00:01:22.560> what

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
to do is go in a file or not file what

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.730 
to do is go in a file or not file what
am<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.070> say<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.820> server<00:01:24.600> browser<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.560> then

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
