00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.509
 present you today the prestige 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.619
 or on call of duty black ops 2 en 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.059
 multiplayer 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.010
 and yes as some have been able to 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.930
 notice there are already a few people 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.520
 who are prestige 12 on this game you 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.450
 you ask how did they do it and 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.070
 Well, I'll tell you 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.170

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.850
 I congratulate him in passing and I 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.590

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.820
 sweet girlfriend who mixes then 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.860
 duplicate on my psn account 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.930
 so this works with duplication 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.130
 so I invite you to click on the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.870
 notation that is currently displayed at 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.840
 screen or by checking the description the 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.980
 video will obviously be present so 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.480
 there you see I'm on an account 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.890
 so in passing my first doggie 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.600
 psn accounts on which I played 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.369
 who is level 1 on call of duty black 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.810
 ops of you are going to realize the clip of the 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.270
 duplication I would like to explain in 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.310
 speed you do join your 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.569
 Split screen in quality time once 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.249
 that it's done you're going to click two 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.689
 times increases quickly on the tab 

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:16.729
 shop with your second joystick 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.259
 then directly as soon as it's over you 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.619
 press round with your first 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.789
 controller 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.020
 this will bring you back to the menu 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.520
 main you are going to have an error 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.139
 you click on cross with your 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.209
 first controller and that will put you a 

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:27.859
 drop-down menu ask you about yourself 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.209
 asking to select a psn account 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.009
 so there you select the count 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.810
 person in question who is prestige 12 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.829
 or another a fact that you want for 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.929
 duplicate me anyway I you 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.249
 present prestige 12 es there you have lady 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.469
 magically you see that your 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:42.020
 psn account you just selected and 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.969
 connected instead of your psn I you 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.170
 shows that I am in my account 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.060
 or first psn accounts forgiveness 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.470
 on which to play on ps3 but that on 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.659
 call of duty black ops in the Home 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.570
 I am not on the same psn and well 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.820
 disconnect and reconnect psn 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.830
 and your statistical prestige weapons and 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.720
 company will be duplicated on this account 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.520
 and you will be prestige 12 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.409
 so now I'm going to explain 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.030
 one thing the prestige 12 and banned 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.940
 automatically servers at each 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.929
 update so about I do not know the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.890
 all I do not want to say bullshit 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.209
 but so quickly 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.410
 so that's why I want you 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.580
 advise against doing it you can 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.530
 to do on a secondary account if you 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.030
 want to show off or whatever, but 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.230
 good we never know in case we 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.510
 you stick to banne console I think 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.980
 still not for that but good at 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.600
 the origin the prestigious all 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.030
 first prestige hence this fact and in my 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.470
 notice at dock and then with the blue glitch of 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.510
 duplication therefore supports the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.220
 pass on to other people so I 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.380
 strongly discourages you if 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.660
 you are interested a link in the 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.880
 description will be present of a service 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.160
 a person who duplicates 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.450
 prestige 12 so he will certainly 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.799
 overwhelmed with requests but I'll get it 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.299
 put anyway so here are the friends 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.290

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.360

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.390

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.390
 world
