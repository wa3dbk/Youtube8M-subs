00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.309
 hi boy i wanted to start 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.440
 recommending you a channel of my own 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.749
 friend who is called camilla she makes gods 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.610
 super cool videos with the gopro then vi 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.950
 I leave with the link just go on his 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.200
 channel are really beautiful when in 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.170
 travel on the back door and make video 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.810
 so one of his most beautiful videos 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.010
 that of Zakynthos is fine not to introduce 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.410
 nothing else go see his 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:35.860
 canal and sign up fishbone 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:39.300
 inverse very easy much more than 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.300
 what looks like that at all 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:46.390
 so I dedicate the material and start 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.450
 immediately graphic you know my usual 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.090
 I am a little repetitive 1 usual go 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.440
 elastic of those little ones in this 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.790
 here that I use because my friends and videos 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.770
 would also do a video on how 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.469
 speak at home so if you don't find them 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:08.310
 in his part you will also have them made 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:11.049
 from we start with the comb I carry 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.549
 all the hair I don't make a line for 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.920
 the simple fact that I don't have many 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.320
 hair so if you too are anyway 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.000
 you do not have this very strong call there 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.979
 I advise you to do so the effect 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.170
 final will be more voluminous and then not 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.659
 you will have pole but to see the falling of 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:34.420
 strands from this court has therefore 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:36.210
 start by taking a lock and 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.880
 split it into two 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.890
 in this way to braid a 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.170
 fish bone if you want you can watch 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.380
 here that I put the video click here and 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.130
 send them directly to the videos to do 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.450
 the actress 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.360
 the reverse herringbone braid 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.540
 instead of passing a lock in front 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.500
 to the other one passes behind 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:06.280
 in this way then then the same thing 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.229
 on the other side a lock back 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.619
 take this step about three 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.619
 times 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.570
 and well so it will remain more attached 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.070
 starts really starts lat recently 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.700
 so always taking neither a small piece 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.270
 from the original then the lock 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.490
 initial brought from the other side like 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.880
 you did with the previous ones but one 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.950
 time you brought the lock 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.060
 start on the other side or add 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:54.540
 an external piece and then it 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.870
 therefore always carry the same there 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.940
 thing 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.120
 on this side and then take one 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.120
 lock 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.299
 and the flow from the other side once 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.299
 done this, take a lock from here 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:22.650
 and there you always take the other side 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:26.329
 then a lock the vault the villas to itself 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.329
 but lock to take 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.200
 on the other side 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.070
 once you get to this point you can 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.990
 start talking about gardens there 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.889
 they are never 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.060
 normal but inverse then 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.060
 in a jacket on this side 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.270
 Yes No 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.810
 messori lasko and now the piece arrives 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.740
 strong that is to make this mega 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:44.699
 super soft very gently 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:47.449
 starting from above pull slightly 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.449
 hair 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.220
 worry about accidents 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.610
 I doubt that much 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.610
 you can always see with the not you go 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.979
 let's say pull from a yes 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:47.800
 nobody the spain that often command of 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:50.020
 landfills that will get the best effect 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.580
 otherwise you can always pull in 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.939
 this sense but expect it was a bit 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.949
 more 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:57.179
 so if you want to make it become more 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:07:01.050
 large but not completely disheveled 

00:06:57.179 --> 00:07:01.050
 pull lightly 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:10.639
 if you see that you can't pull 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:15.529
 because actually with the elastic vi 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:21.369
 block everything you can always give it up 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:21.369
 this way it will be even simpler 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.220
 okay 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:35.910
 is this is shiny you see is giant 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.820
 very much I think it is understood I hope 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:43.410
 that you also like I send you a kiss 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.820
 Giant comment and make yourself like 

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.380
 sign up that nobody is still there 

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:49.340
 members see you at the next video 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.340
 Hello
