00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
to be answering the question sent by

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.400

tomorrow<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.850> she's<00:00:06.150> asking<00:00:06.540> it<00:00:06.810> causes<00:00:07.290> a

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
tomorrow and she's asking it causes a

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.799 
tomorrow and she's asking it causes a
phone<00:00:07.649> ops<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.099> speed<00:00:08.370> or<00:00:08.809> Phalaenopsis

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
phone ops of speed or Phalaenopsis

leaves<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.349> split<00:00:10.710> down<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:10.980> center<00:00:11.809> now<00:00:12.809> I've

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
leaves to split down the center now I've

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.720 
leaves to split down the center now I've
been<00:00:13.320> wondering<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.740> same<00:00:13.830> thing<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.429> quite

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
been wondering the same thing for quite

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.849 
been wondering the same thing for quite
a<00:00:14.759> while<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.389> did<00:00:15.599> find<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.080> answer<00:00:16.440> now

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
a while but I did find the answer now

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.540 
a while but I did find the answer now
this<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.400> my<00:00:17.910> only<00:00:18.090> orchid<00:00:18.480> which<00:00:18.660> has<00:00:19.550> split

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
this is my only orchid which has split

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.279 
this is my only orchid which has split
two<00:00:20.699> down<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> center<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.660> leaf<00:00:21.810> as<00:00:22.080> you

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
two down the center of the leaf as you

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.779 
two down the center of the leaf as you
can<00:00:22.470> see<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:22.769> not<00:00:22.890> really<00:00:23.189> big<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:23.640> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
can see it's not really big but it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.570 
can see it's not really big but it
really<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.449> noticeable<00:00:25.019> now<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> believe<00:00:26.279> this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
really is noticeable now I believe this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.240 
really is noticeable now I believe this
has<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.150> mechanical<00:00:27.410> reason<00:00:28.410> behind<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
has a mechanical reason behind it and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.730 
has a mechanical reason behind it and
I'll<00:00:29.340> tell<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.789> what<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> mean<00:00:30.380> usually<00:00:31.380> after

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
I'll tell you what I mean usually after

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740 
I'll tell you what I mean usually after
some<00:00:32.070> research<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.730> some<00:00:33.030> observation<00:00:33.630> I

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
some research and some observation I

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.870 
some research and some observation I
discovered<00:00:34.230> splitting<00:00:34.680> leaves<00:00:34.950> are<00:00:35.340> caused

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
discovered splitting leaves are caused

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.479 
discovered splitting leaves are caused
sometimes<00:00:36.719> or<00:00:37.050> many<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> times<00:00:37.860> by

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
sometimes or many of the times by

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.420 
sometimes or many of the times by
dehydration<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.629> then<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.350> sudden<00:00:40.680> watering

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
dehydration and then a sudden watering

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.940 
dehydration and then a sudden watering
of<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.510> orchid<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.290> pretty<00:00:43.680> logical

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
of the orchid and it's pretty logical

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.940 
of the orchid and it's pretty logical
imagine<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.539> walls<00:00:45.809> or<00:00:46.170> actually<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
imagine that the walls or actually the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.729 
imagine that the walls or actually the
cells<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.270> orchid<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> leaf<00:00:49.110> got

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
cells of the orchid and the leaf got

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.740 
cells of the orchid and the leaf got
really<00:00:50.039> dehydrated<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.510> suddenly

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
really dehydrated and then you suddenly

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.500 
really dehydrated and then you suddenly
water<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.590> they<00:00:52.829> expand<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.699> get

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
water it and they expand and get

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.020 
water it and they expand and get
hydrated<00:00:54.930> again<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.129> leaf<00:00:56.309> actually

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
hydrated again and the leaf actually

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.430 
hydrated again and the leaf actually
gets<00:00:57.480> split<00:00:57.870> because<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.469> expansion<00:00:58.980> of

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
gets split because of this expansion of

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
gets split because of this expansion of
its<00:01:01.440> structure<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> believe<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
its structure so I believe this is the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.179 
its structure so I believe this is the
main<00:01:03.809> cause<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> splitting<00:01:04.890> leaves

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
main cause of splitting leaves

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.969 
main cause of splitting leaves
especially<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.630> center<00:01:07.080> after<00:01:07.380> some

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
especially down the center after some

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.130 
especially down the center after some
research<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.640> tend<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.909> believe<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.570> pretty

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
research I tend to believe it is pretty

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.399 
research I tend to believe it is pretty
logical<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.369> happens<00:01:11.760> quite<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.299> lot<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
logical and it happens quite a lot now I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.140 
logical and it happens quite a lot now I
have<00:01:13.740> another<00:01:13.979> case<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.520> splitting<00:01:14.850> leaves

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
have another case of splitting leaves

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.749 
have another case of splitting leaves
actually<00:01:15.479> which<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.710> at<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> tip<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.340> I'm

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
actually which is at the tip so I'm

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.020 
actually which is at the tip so I'm
going<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:17.970> discuss<00:01:18.330> about<00:01:18.540> them<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:18.930> well<00:01:20.030> so

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
going to discuss about them as well so

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
going to discuss about them as well so
here<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.409> largest

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
here we have one of my largest

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
here we have one of my largest
Phalaenopsis<00:01:23.939> orchids<00:01:24.299> actually<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.500> can

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
Phalaenopsis orchids actually as you can

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.330 
Phalaenopsis orchids actually as you can
see<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> leaves<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.689> absolutely<00:01:27.689> huge<00:01:28.340> but

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
see the leaves are absolutely huge but

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.749 
see the leaves are absolutely huge but
this<00:01:30.090> also<00:01:30.689> means<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:32.430> prone

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
this also means that it's really prone

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.330 
this also means that it's really prone
to<00:01:33.390> splitting<00:01:33.780> leaves<00:01:34.140> especially<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to splitting leaves especially at the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.609 
to splitting leaves especially at the
tip<00:01:35.640> here<00:01:35.970> because<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> sheer<00:01:36.960> size<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
tip here because of the sheer size of

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.880 
tip here because of the sheer size of
the<00:01:38.250> leaf<00:01:38.490> now<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.600> course<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.200> nature<00:01:40.590> they<00:01:40.829> do

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the leaf now of course in nature they do

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.819 
the leaf now of course in nature they do
droop<00:01:41.430> down<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.840> they<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> different

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
droop down but they do have a different

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.889 
droop down but they do have a different
texture<00:01:44.340> I've<00:01:44.610> noticed<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.210> well<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> can

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
texture I've noticed as well as you can

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.050 
texture I've noticed as well as you can
see<00:01:46.079> these<00:01:46.290> leaves<00:01:46.590> are<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:47.790> thick

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
see these leaves are really really thick

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.710 
see these leaves are really really thick
so<00:01:48.659> anyway<00:01:49.290> if<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.649> bump<00:01:49.890> into<00:01:50.040> an<00:01:50.280> orchid

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
so anyway if you bump into an orchid

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.499 
so anyway if you bump into an orchid
like<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.229> huge<00:01:52.710> leaves<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.399> are

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
like this with huge leaves that are

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.260 
like this with huge leaves that are
super<00:01:54.509> strong<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.079> super<00:01:55.380> stiff<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:57.090> might

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
super strong and super stiff you might

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.999 
super strong and super stiff you might
get<00:01:57.509> some<00:01:57.689> splitting<00:01:58.079> ends<00:01:58.259> because<00:01:58.500> I

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
get some splitting ends because I

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.429 
get some splitting ends because I
believe<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.939> leaf<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.270> actually<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.200> sort

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
believe the leaf is actually in a sort

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.300 
believe the leaf is actually in a sort
of<00:02:01.530> attention

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
of attention

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.880 
of attention
as<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:04.030> can<00:02:04.210> see<00:02:04.420> it<00:02:04.509> doesn't<00:02:04.840> really<00:02:04.990> Bend<00:02:05.500> if

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
as you can see it doesn't really Bend if

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.100 
as you can see it doesn't really Bend if
I<00:02:06.009> try<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.250> bend<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:06.909> will<00:02:07.299> certainly<00:02:07.509> split

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
I try to bend it I will certainly split

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.440 
I try to bend it I will certainly split
it<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:08.500> there<00:02:08.739> are<00:02:08.890> those<00:02:09.099> hybrids<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.090> phalion

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
it so there are those hybrids of phalion

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.660 
it so there are those hybrids of phalion
opposites<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.959> are<00:02:11.080> just<00:02:11.670> genetically

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
opposites that are just genetically

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.660 
opposites that are just genetically
engineered<00:02:13.569> or<00:02:13.900> none<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:14.860> genetically

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
engineered or none they just genetically

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.600 
engineered or none they just genetically
obtained<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.569> feature<00:02:16.900> they're<00:02:17.650> very<00:02:18.190> prone

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
obtained this feature they're very prone

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.660 
obtained this feature they're very prone
to<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:20.050> have<00:02:20.200> been<00:02:20.349> splitting<00:02:20.739> ends<00:02:21.459> and

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
to you have been splitting ends and

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.670 
to you have been splitting ends and
stuff<00:02:22.480> like<00:02:22.599> that<00:02:22.780> especially<00:02:23.290> if<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:23.440> bump

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
stuff like that especially if you bump

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.100 
stuff like that especially if you bump
into<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.040> they<00:02:24.280> can<00:02:24.430> actually<00:02:24.550> happen<00:02:25.110> without

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
into it they can actually happen without

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.259 
into it they can actually happen without
even<00:02:26.500> bumping<00:02:26.920> into<00:02:27.040> them<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.849> because<00:02:27.970> the

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
even bumping into them just because the

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.280 
even bumping into them just because the
genetics<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.380> orchid<00:02:29.769> are<00:02:30.989> favoring<00:02:31.989> this

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
genetics of the orchid are favoring this

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.920 
genetics of the orchid are favoring this
behavior

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
behavior

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.780 
behavior
now<00:02:34.930> improper<00:02:35.590> care<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:36.130> cause<00:02:36.370> something

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
now improper care can cause something

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.180 
now improper care can cause something
like<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.360> as<00:02:37.510> well<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.500> hope<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.130> could

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
like that as well and I hope I could

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.210 
like that as well and I hope I could
show<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.730> without<00:02:40.450> damaging<00:02:41.049> my<00:02:41.200> orchid<00:02:41.590> this

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
show you without damaging my orchid this

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.460 
show you without damaging my orchid this
leaf<00:02:42.489> right<00:02:42.519> here<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.120> really<00:02:43.840> really<00:02:44.049> split

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
leaf right here is really really split

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.729 
leaf right here is really really split
as<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.950> can<00:02:45.130> see<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:45.850> this<00:02:46.569> is<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.230> sort<00:02:47.590> of<00:02:47.680> a

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
as you can see but this is a sort of a

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.339 
as you can see but this is a sort of a
combination<00:02:47.980> between<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:49.150> two<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.989> market

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
combination between the two this market

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.039 
combination between the two this market
doesn't<00:02:50.650> really<00:02:50.769> have<00:02:51.510> super<00:02:52.510> thick<00:02:52.780> leaves

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
doesn't really have super thick leaves

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.440 
doesn't really have super thick leaves
but<00:02:53.380> they<00:02:53.680> are<00:02:53.920> kind<00:02:54.549> of<00:02:54.640> long<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:55.150> they<00:02:55.239> are

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
but they are kind of long and they are

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.710 
but they are kind of long and they are
kinda<00:02:56.410> hard<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.670> touch<00:02:57.700> now<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.450> market

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
kinda hard to the touch now this market

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.690 
kinda hard to the touch now this market
was<00:02:58.870> very<00:02:58.930> abused<00:02:59.440> before<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.739> got<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.580> was

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
was very abused before I got it it was

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.380 
was very abused before I got it it was
super<00:03:01.120> dehydrated<00:03:01.299> it<00:03:02.230> was<00:03:02.739> really<00:03:03.610> packed<00:03:04.030> in

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
super dehydrated it was really packed in

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.650 
super dehydrated it was really packed in
her<00:03:04.980> packaging<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.099> was<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.730> was<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.940> mess<00:03:07.269> so

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
her packaging it was it was a mess so

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.650 
her packaging it was it was a mess so
all<00:03:07.930> these<00:03:08.200> factors<00:03:09.180> contributed<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.480> the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
all these factors contributed to the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.199 
all these factors contributed to the
splitting<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.290> leaf<00:03:11.950> as<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.310> can<00:03:12.459> see<00:03:12.640> but

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
splitting of the leaf as you can see but

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.930 
splitting of the leaf as you can see but
there<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.840> good<00:03:14.230> news<00:03:14.440> actually<00:03:14.680> it<00:03:15.549> doesn't

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
there is a good news actually it doesn't

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.849 
there is a good news actually it doesn't
seem<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.269> affect<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.690> plant<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.350> much<00:03:17.620> the

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
seem to affect the plant so much the

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.650 
seem to affect the plant so much the
leaf<00:03:18.040> can<00:03:18.310> perform<00:03:18.730> normally<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.600> just

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
leaf can perform normally it just

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.170 
leaf can perform normally it just
doesn't<00:03:20.350> look<00:03:20.380> pretty<00:03:20.500> I'll<00:03:21.010> give<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.370> that<00:03:21.400> so

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
doesn't look pretty I'll give it that so

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.890 
doesn't look pretty I'll give it that so
if<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:22.870> want<00:03:23.109> to<00:03:23.290> avoid<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.829> I<00:03:24.130> think<00:03:24.900> not

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
if you want to avoid it I think not

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.800 
if you want to avoid it I think not
letting<00:03:26.290> your<00:03:26.440> orchid<00:03:26.859> go<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.670> dry<00:03:28.030> for<00:03:28.090> too

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
letting your orchid go to dry for too

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.509 
letting your orchid go to dry for too
long<00:03:29.079> of<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.380> time<00:03:29.760> will<00:03:30.760> limit<00:03:31.150> this

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
long of a time will limit this

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.759 
long of a time will limit this
appearance<00:03:33.519> so<00:03:34.510> other<00:03:34.930> than<00:03:35.049> that<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.440> think

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
appearance so other than that I think

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.610 
appearance so other than that I think
it's<00:03:35.920> just<00:03:35.980> genetics<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:38.019> orchids<00:03:38.319> being

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
it's just genetics and the orchids being

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.199 
it's just genetics and the orchids being
prone<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.190> something<00:03:39.519> like<00:03:39.609> this<00:03:39.790> because<00:03:40.030> of

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
prone to something like this because of

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.660 
prone to something like this because of
the<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.810> whole<00:03:40.930> hybridization<00:03:41.769> thing<00:03:41.980> so

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
the the whole hybridization thing so

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.599 
the the whole hybridization thing so
yeah<00:03:43.030> keep<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.540> hydrated<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:45.069> believe<00:03:45.459> you

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
yeah keep it hydrated and I believe you

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.970 
yeah keep it hydrated and I believe you
can<00:03:45.760> avoid<00:03:46.060> stuff<00:03:46.780> like<00:03:46.959> these<00:03:47.230> other<00:03:47.709> than

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
can avoid stuff like these other than

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.770 
can avoid stuff like these other than
that<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.340> really<00:03:48.519> doesn't<00:03:48.910> harm<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.480> plant

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
that it really doesn't harm the plant

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.900 
that it really doesn't harm the plant
that<00:03:50.200> much<00:03:50.470> for<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:50.829> to<00:03:50.980> get<00:03:51.160> super<00:03:51.489> worried

that much for you to get super worried

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.720 
that much for you to get super worried
