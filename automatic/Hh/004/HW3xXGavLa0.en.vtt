00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.370 

back<00:04:04.390> in<00:04:04.630> same<00:04:04.930> thing<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.840> since<00:04:08.080> this<00:04:08.170> is<00:04:08.230> a

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
back in same thing so since this is a

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.940 
back in same thing so since this is a
round<00:04:08.850> pin<00:04:09.850> alight<00:04:10.120> model<00:04:10.930> 2002<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.620> believe

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
round pin alight model 2002 I believe

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.700 
round pin alight model 2002 I believe
it's<00:04:12.220> like<00:04:12.250> 72<00:04:13.090> maybe<00:04:13.690> an<00:04:14.140> order

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
it's like 72 maybe an order

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.400 
it's like 72 maybe an order
pick<00:04:15.310> 73<00:04:15.940> or<00:04:16.060> 74<00:04:16.090> they<00:04:16.840> came<00:04:17.019> out<00:04:17.140> with<00:04:17.200> the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
pick 73 or 74 they came out with the

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.979 
pick 73 or 74 they came out with the
square<00:04:17.769> taillights

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
square taillights

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:28.560 
square taillights
