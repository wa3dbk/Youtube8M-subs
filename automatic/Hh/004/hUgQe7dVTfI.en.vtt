00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.309
 hi friends of jeta fico i am extra yours 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.960
 I bring a new video for the channel and 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.790
 Well, we are going back today with a video of 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.650
 gta do not worry that you are going to continue 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.840
 gta for taking the time now then you 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.039
 I will comment a few things and well what 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.439
 that I wanted to teach the ears a 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.359
 trick very good for polar good 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.310
 well let's call it almost in a way 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.439
 infinite with the courageous parachute not 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.279
 let's fall down and for that what 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.750
 What we need is a friend who takes a 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.149
 sniper is worth a rifle 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.190
 sniper and we go shooting at the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.750
 top of the parachute as you see 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.700
 here what can you try 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.040
 shoot then to the side part or 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.850
 up is worth the thing is to shoot at 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.579
 parachute 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.829
 our friend evidently as you see is 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.620
 very easy to do and good before 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.000
 nothing to thank also the help to the same 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.860
 forever is worth to help me with this 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.149
 trick and forward what 09 also that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.590
 you will have their channels in the description 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.850
 Well, as you can see, the only thing 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.829
 we have to do is we throw in 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.170
 parachute this would be our view worth 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.510
 receiving the shots of our friend 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.730
 as you see the parachute as it moves 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.650
 that moves is an impact of 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.650
 parachute that is a bullet impact 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.840
 forgiveness that has given the parachute as 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.610
 you see then as we go 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.370
 shooting if they catch us well then 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.470
 we will start going up again, and 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.510
 we can be so infinitely the same 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.100
 time that we want good always and 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.410
 when your friend is not left without 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.780
 ammunition for which it is a trick 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.850
 pretty funny and funny you can 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.850
 use it to do a competition to 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.440
 see who goes further I do not know that anymore 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.630
 good to fly your imagination and what 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.610
 os do as gladly as 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.740
 first of all I also want to tell you 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.370
 tell a little something about the topic of 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.900
 watch dogs and others I've seen that I 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.990
 you have put comments saying no 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.840
 let me associate you with the gta 5 not you 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.200
 Do not worry, I will not leave 7 to 5 or 7 to 5 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.360
 it's like I'd say is the basis of charging worth 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.760
 is what with what other than me 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.870
 really like it from the game and no no 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.030
 I'll leave it 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.620
 I do not know is something that I know you like 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.500
 much so do not worry that 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.940
 you are going to have to tea 5 for a while 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.210
 as long as you want 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.730
 you when you are the ones who decided more 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.770
 or less the content you want in the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.690
 channel so as I know what you want 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.980
 gta 5 do not worry that you are going to continue 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.410
 having telecinco the truth is that 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.350
 At no time have I considered leaving 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.330
 to go up gta 5 and that yes yes I have 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.490
 tried to implement a little watch 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.950
 dogs so as not to be for people who know 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.600
 I was going to buy and other things, so you go 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.790
 to keep having some video of watch 2 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.040
 I hope you give me a little support 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.690
 the truth with the theme of watch 2 because 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.680
 the truth is that I have seen that it is 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.920
 complicated a little bit because we see the subject 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.690
 of that of likes and all that I've seen 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.070
 the truth that good that there are people who 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.320
 like but there are also many people who 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.840
 he does not like it and man is clear is for 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.450
 obviously not all of us likes 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.550
 You may like the game or anything but good 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.170
 The truth is that I would encourage you to 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.480
 you would have to try it because the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.710
 truth is that it is very good 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.020
 obviously has nothing of 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.680
 comparison with z 5 so we can not 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.210
 compare what's dogs with gta 5 for nothing 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.550
 of the world the truth is that freedom 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.410
 that we have here in watch 2 not the 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.030
 we obviously have many things 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.800
 different to this game that yes yes 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.170
 we put them in this game we would make 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.810
 this game every time the best game of the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.390
 story because imagine you can 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.030
 hack things and so on with a mobile here 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.700
 in gta 5 and that we would change the traffic lights 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.830
 I do not know that would be a real last 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.540
 true but good as it was going 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.940
 commenting that do not worry that you are going 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.110
 to continue having gta 5 for a while and 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.560
 Well, from time to time, too 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.780
 You will have a video of how many or 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.270
 also as I imagine that many 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.020
 you will have seen that sometimes I put some 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.940
 weapons game of these humiliating to 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.220
 youtubers and so on I do not know things 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.900
 fun to try a little bit to put a 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.250
 little for all tastes and a little 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.010
 of variety that never comes bad 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.350
 obviously guys do not worry 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.920
 that mainly the channel is going to be gta 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.900
 5 because it's what you like 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.720
 so do not worry about this but 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.190
 Well, from time to time it's not bad 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.739
 varied so good I hope your 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.600

 tired of being flying infinitely 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.200
 if you notice we have more than 23 minutes 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.850
 flying in the air and well then nothing 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.130
