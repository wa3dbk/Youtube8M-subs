the<00:02:37.680> LED<00:02:38.010> flash<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.460> forgot<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.820> mention<00:02:39.060> that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the LED flash I forgot to mention that

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.690 
the LED flash I forgot to mention that
and<00:02:39.390> then<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.840> nice<00:02:40.440> size<00:02:40.680> speaker<00:02:41.340> grill<00:02:41.490> down

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
and then a nice size speaker grill down

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.530 
and then a nice size speaker grill down
here<00:02:43.010> one<00:02:44.010> big<00:02:44.400> difference<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.270> you'll<00:02:45.390> see

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
here one big difference that you'll see

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.110 
here one big difference that you'll see
with<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.050> Atrix<00:02:46.920> 2<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> fact<00:02:48.000> that

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
with the Atrix 2 it's the fact that

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.000 
with the Atrix 2 it's the fact that
there's<00:02:48.360> no<00:02:48.600> fingerprint<00:02:49.380> sensor<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.830> there

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
there's no fingerprint sensor on there

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.640 
there's no fingerprint sensor on there
it's<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.240> 3.5<00:02:51.750> millimeter<00:02:51.930> jack<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.560> a

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
it's just the 3.5 millimeter jack and a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.110 
it's just the 3.5 millimeter jack and a
standard<00:02:53.630> power<00:02:54.630> button<00:02:55.020> /<00:02:55.760> unlock<00:02:56.760> button

I'll<00:02:57.960> be<00:02:58.110> great<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:59.550> well<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.000> shouldn't<00:03:00.390> say

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
I'll be great the well I shouldn't say

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.940 
I'll be great the well I shouldn't say
the<00:03:00.630> great<00:03:00.810> thing<00:03:00.960> but<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.320> thing<00:03:01.470> about<00:03:01.500> this

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
the great thing but the thing about this

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.980 
the great thing but the thing about this
is<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.460> makes<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.700> wonder<00:03:02.910> exactly<00:03:03.360> what

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
is it makes you wonder exactly what

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.570 
is it makes you wonder exactly what
happened<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> original<00:03:04.680> fingerprint

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
happened to the original fingerprint

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.210 
happened to the original fingerprint
sensor<00:03:06.350> chances<00:03:07.350> are<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.590> wasn't<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.070> most

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
sensor chances are it wasn't the most

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.790 
sensor chances are it wasn't the most
popular<00:03:08.400> thing<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:10.230> they<00:03:10.470> probably<00:03:10.680> just

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
popular thing and so they probably just

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.340 
popular thing and so they probably just
decided<00:03:11.460> a<00:03:11.550> cannon<00:03:11.910> it'll<00:03:12.900> be<00:03:12.960> interesting<00:03:12.990> to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
decided a cannon it'll be interesting to

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.050 
decided a cannon it'll be interesting to
see<00:03:13.410> if<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.740> pops<00:03:13.860> up<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.250> any<00:03:14.370> phones<00:03:14.670> down<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
see if it pops up in any phones down the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.850 
see if it pops up in any phones down the
down<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.450> road<00:03:15.630> because<00:03:15.870> certainly<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.830> a

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
down the road because certainly is a

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.980 
down the road because certainly is a
very<00:03:17.340> interesting<00:03:17.640> idea<00:03:18.150> but<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.720> don't<00:03:18.900> think

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
very interesting idea but I don't think

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.350 
very interesting idea but I don't think
it<00:03:19.140> gained<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.410> whole<00:03:19.530> lot<00:03:19.710> of<00:03:19.740> traction<00:03:20.210> on<00:03:21.210> the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
it gained a whole lot of traction on the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.600 
it gained a whole lot of traction on the
right<00:03:21.510> side<00:03:21.750> we<00:03:21.780> have<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.320> typical<00:03:23.070> volume

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
right side we have the typical volume

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.240 
right side we have the typical volume
rocker<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:24.720> we<00:03:24.930> also<00:03:25.050> have<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.620> physical

camera<00:03:26.640> button<00:03:26.880> thing<00:03:27.720> about<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.080> one<00:03:28.260> is

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
camera button thing about this one is

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.700 
camera button thing about this one is
though<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.070> it's<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.670> single-stage<00:03:30.260> not<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> GG

under<00:04:21.949> battery<00:04:22.130> life<00:04:22.460> tests<00:04:22.850> so<00:04:22.970> far<00:04:24.039> it<00:04:25.039> seems

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
under battery life tests so far it seems

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.350 
under battery life tests so far it seems
to<00:04:25.430> actually<00:04:25.550> do<00:04:25.789> better<00:04:26.000> than<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.300> original

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
to actually do better than the original

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.820 
to actually do better than the original
matrix<00:04:28.720> so<00:04:29.720> let's<00:04:29.870> turn<00:04:30.080> this<00:04:30.139> back<00:04:30.320> on<00:04:32.830> now

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
matrix so let's turn this back on now

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.110 
matrix so let's turn this back on now
while<00:04:33.979> we're<00:04:34.130> turning<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:34.430> back<00:04:34.610> on<00:04:34.820> let's

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
while we're turning this back on let's

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.890 
while we're turning this back on let's
bring<00:04:35.270> out<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.750> original<00:04:37.419> do<00:04:38.419> some<00:04:38.570> side<00:04:38.750> by

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
bring out the original do some side by

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.460 
bring out the original do some side by
side<00:04:39.080> comparisons<00:04:39.650> between<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:40.039> two<00:04:41.470> of

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
side comparisons between the two of

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.730 
side comparisons between the two of
course<00:04:42.710> four-inch<00:04:43.639> vs.<00:04:44.000> 4.3<00:04:44.599> inch<00:04:47.650> aside<00:04:48.650> from

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
course four-inch vs. 4.3 inch aside from

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.490 
course four-inch vs. 4.3 inch aside from
that<00:04:48.860> they<00:04:49.099> look<00:04:49.360> like<00:04:50.360> they're<00:04:50.810> designed<00:04:51.320> to

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
that they look like they're designed to

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.670 
that they look like they're designed to
be<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:53.030> same<00:04:53.210> exact<00:04:53.539> look<00:04:53.780> which<00:04:54.199> is<00:04:54.229> nice

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
be the same exact look which is nice

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.100 
be the same exact look which is nice
because<00:04:54.860> well<00:04:55.430> if<00:04:55.759> this<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.150> hx2<00:04:56.570> then<00:04:56.900> it

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
because well if this is hx2 then it

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.040 
because well if this is hx2 then it
should<00:04:57.590> look<00:04:57.740> very<00:04:57.800> similar<00:04:58.130> right<00:04:58.509> well<00:04:59.509> the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
should look very similar right well the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.719 
should look very similar right well the
other<00:05:00.169> major<00:05:00.440> difference<00:05:00.949> is<00:05:01.099> the<00:05:01.340> soft<00:05:01.550> touch

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
other major difference is the soft touch

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.850 
other major difference is the soft touch
plastic<00:05:02.270> with<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.509> textured<00:05:02.870> back<00:05:03.050> versus

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
plastic with the textured back versus

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.210 
plastic with the textured back versus
the<00:05:04.130> hard<00:05:04.340> plastic<00:05:04.550> with<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.240> funky

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
the hard plastic with the funky

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.770 
the hard plastic with the funky
holographic<00:05:07.220> pattern<00:05:07.610> on<00:05:07.759> here<00:05:08.120> which

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
holographic pattern on here which

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.360 
holographic pattern on here which
sometimes<00:05:09.500> if<00:05:09.860> you<00:05:09.919> put<00:05:10.070> it<00:05:10.130> in<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.280> right

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
sometimes if you put it in the right

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.399 
sometimes if you put it in the right
light<00:05:10.610> can<00:05:11.180> be<00:05:11.210> rather<00:05:11.449> disturbing<00:05:12.110> to<00:05:12.289> the

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
light can be rather disturbing to the

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.339 
light can be rather disturbing to the
eye<00:05:12.610> so<00:05:13.720> personal<00:05:14.720> opinion<00:05:14.990> there<00:05:15.110> of<00:05:15.199> course

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
eye so personal opinion there of course

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.270 
eye so personal opinion there of course
but<00:05:16.150> I<00:05:17.150> much<00:05:17.449> prefer<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:18.139> design<00:05:18.860> and<00:05:19.220> the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
but I much prefer the design and the

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.159 
but I much prefer the design and the
look<00:05:19.580> over<00:05:19.909> all<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.389> atrix<00:05:20.659> 2<00:05:20.720> over<00:05:21.080> the

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
look over all of the atrix 2 over the

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:33.739 
look over all of the atrix 2 over the
original<00:05:21.320> so<00:05:27.220> let's<00:05:28.220> do<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.430> on<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:28.610> sides

00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:33.749 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:36.029 

they're<00:05:34.749> as<00:05:34.899> you<00:05:35.020> can<00:05:35.169> tell<00:05:35.319> is<00:05:35.559> the<00:05:35.740> major

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
they're as you can tell is the major

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.339 
they're as you can tell is the major
difference<00:05:36.520> between<00:05:36.719> having<00:05:37.719> fingerprint

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
difference between having fingerprint

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.689 
difference between having fingerprint
sensor<00:05:38.619> and<00:05:38.830> not<00:05:39.039> ooh<00:05:39.809> and<00:05:40.809> that's<00:05:41.289> me<00:05:41.529> just

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
sensor and not ooh and that's me just

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.049 
sensor and not ooh and that's me just
letting<00:05:42.699> the<00:05:42.849> phones<00:05:43.330> fall<00:05:43.539> out<00:05:43.659> of<00:05:43.689> my<00:05:43.809> hands

00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:45.059 
letting the phones fall out of my hands

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:47.969 
letting the phones fall out of my hands
on<00:05:46.059> the<00:05:46.210> right<00:05:46.360> hand<00:05:46.509> side<00:05:46.629> here<00:05:47.050> are<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.830> web

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
on the right hand side here are the web

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:53.129 
on the right hand side here are the web
top<00:05:48.279> docs<00:05:50.009> now<00:05:51.009> if<00:05:51.129> these<00:05:51.279> ones<00:05:51.930> assume<00:05:52.930> in<00:05:53.080> a

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
top docs now if these ones assume in a

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.959 
top docs now if these ones assume in a
little<00:05:53.319> bit<00:05:53.409> closer<00:05:53.680> here<00:05:54.039> we<00:05:54.189> can<00:05:56.969> major

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
little bit closer here we can major

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.639 
little bit closer here we can major
difference<00:05:58.389> is<00:05:58.509> you<00:05:58.569> can<00:05:58.689> tell<00:05:58.809> is<00:05:59.050> that<00:05:59.080> the

00:05:59.639 --> 00:05:59.649 
difference is you can tell is that the

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:03.119 
difference is you can tell is that the
ports<00:05:59.979> are<00:06:00.129> upside<00:06:00.759> down<00:06:01.559> so<00:06:02.559> the<00:06:02.860> original

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.129

about this is the atrix 2 is compatible

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.790 
about this is the atrix 2 is compatible

00:06:23.489 --> 00:06:23.499 
and according to Motorola pretty much

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:26.879 
and according to Motorola pretty much
any<00:06:23.830> future<00:06:24.599> webtop<00:06:25.599> compatible<00:06:26.229> phones<00:06:26.469> will

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 
any future webtop compatible phones will

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.449 
any future webtop compatible phones will
have<00:06:27.159> that<00:06:27.610> same<00:06:27.849> setup<00:06:28.149> so<00:06:28.779> that<00:06:28.809> way<00:06:29.459> every

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:30.459 
have that same setup so that way every

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:32.070 
have that same setup so that way every
phone<00:06:30.699> will<00:06:31.240> have<00:06:31.360> the<00:06:31.539> same<00:06:31.689> exact

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
phone will have the same exact

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.499 
phone will have the same exact
accessories<00:06:32.770> so<00:06:33.759> which<00:06:33.879> we<00:06:33.999> say<00:06:34.149> it's<00:06:34.419> about

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:34.509 
accessories so which we say it's about

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:39.119 
accessories so which we say it's about
time<00:06:34.899> it's<00:06:35.319> it's<00:06:36.129> nice<00:06:36.370> to<00:06:36.550> see<00:06:37.709> all<00:06:38.709> the

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:39.129 
time it's it's nice to see all the

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:40.559 
time it's it's nice to see all the
motorola<00:06:39.490> phones<00:06:39.789> having<00:06:40.269> the<00:06:40.419> same

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:40.569 
motorola phones having the same

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:42.959 
motorola phones having the same
compatibility<00:06:41.349> there<00:06:41.589> so<00:06:42.189> i<00:06:42.219> think<00:06:42.699> it<00:06:42.879> will

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:42.969 
compatibility there so i think it will

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.809 
compatibility there so i think it will
help<00:06:43.889> further<00:06:44.889> along<00:06:45.189> the<00:06:45.370> development<00:06:45.789> of

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:45.819 
help further along the development of

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:49.320 
help further along the development of
web<00:06:45.999> top<00:06:46.209> and<00:06:46.509> certainly<00:06:47.229> it<00:06:48.159> needs<00:06:48.430> any<00:06:49.209> help
