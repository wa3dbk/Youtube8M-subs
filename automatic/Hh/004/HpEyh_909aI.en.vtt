00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.450 
I'll probably ship with the Box broken
down<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.510> because<00:02:29.600> they're<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.830> massive

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
are ridiculous maybe the Gerber too but

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.820 
are ridiculous maybe the Gerber too but
yeah<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:38.510> know<00:02:38.630> all<00:02:38.810> these<00:02:39.020> are<00:02:39.290> one<00:02:39.710> hundred

too<00:02:51.710> many<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.330> I've<00:02:53.330> got<00:02:53.360> too<00:02:53.570> many<00:02:53.660> flippers

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
too many and I've got too many flippers

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.710 
too many and I've got too many flippers
for<00:02:54.590> some<00:02:54.800> reason<00:02:55.210> more<00:02:56.210> than<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.950> would<00:02:57.950> like

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
for some reason more than I would like

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.950 
for some reason more than I would like
so<00:02:59.720> yeah<00:02:59.840> this<00:02:59.990> one<00:03:00.170> just<00:03:00.320> doesn't<00:03:00.590> really<00:03:01.040> get

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
so yeah this one just doesn't really get

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.870 
so yeah this one just doesn't really get
obviously<00:03:02.960> doesn't<00:03:03.200> get<00:03:03.290> any<00:03:03.440> pocket<00:03:03.770> time<00:03:03.950> so

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
obviously doesn't get any pocket time so

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.090 
obviously doesn't get any pocket time so
figured<00:03:05.480> I'd<00:03:05.600> put<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.960> one<00:03:06.110> up<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.620> know<00:03:06.710> if

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
figured I'd put that one up you know if

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.560 
figured I'd put that one up you know if
any<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.370> these<00:03:07.490> don't<00:03:07.760> sell<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.240> don't<00:03:08.480> really

blade<00:04:24.440> comes<00:04:25.440> with<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.710> box<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.870> only

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
blade comes with the box and the only

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.610 
blade comes with the box and the only
imperfection<00:04:28.590> is<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.760> little<00:04:30.750> bit<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.230> glue

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
imperfection is a little bit of glue

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.400 
imperfection is a little bit of glue
that's<00:04:32.310> probably<00:04:33.300> locked<00:04:33.660> tight<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:34.110> seeped

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
that's probably locked tight that seeped

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.230 
that's probably locked tight that seeped
out<00:04:34.620> from<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.310> factory<00:04:35.760> this<00:04:36.150> came<00:04:37.730> tip<00:04:38.730> down

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240

out from the factory this came tip down
Keri<00:04:39.750> so<00:04:40.230> when<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.380> remove<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.830> clip<00:04:41.070> you<00:04:41.250> can

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
Keri so when I remove the clip you can

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.380 
Keri so when I remove the clip you can

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
see there's a little bit of residue

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.720 
see there's a little bit of residue
right<00:04:42.810> there<00:04:43.080> so<00:04:43.950> that's<00:04:44.070> just<00:04:44.220> how<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.550> came
