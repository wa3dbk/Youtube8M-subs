00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.479
 and so that's it so I was actually 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.450
 I explain why I saw them 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.340
 so in this wake in a store that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.270
 cost and I believe they sell them and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.500
 in the 3 or 4 euros and I told myself 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.330
 I'm going to take it etc 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.460
 except in fact when I saw the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.600
 simplicity of the thing I thought I 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.560
 wanted to do the house why not 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.899
 with what I have at home 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.340
 so here's where I show you the 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.560
 mister after you can do it well 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.090
 sure simple version without the mustaches 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.100
 so for the mooseheads I took 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.470
 simple simply a t-shirt invites 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.390
 dear ones of my daughter that I cut into 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.659
 what an old black t-shirt like these 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.319
 that I came so cut out for in 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.479
 make a mustache 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:49.170
 I have layers and a mustache and I 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.720
 I just came to cut it here and the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.849
 paste with glue is issued I you 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.030
 show it so the koala fabric goes in 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:58.649
 find the one here me I prices 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.470
 in supermarkets so next to the 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.569
 haberdashery all the buttons the pins to 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.929
 nanny all that and so I stuck the ex 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:10.470
 mustache with that's it for what is 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.730
 of fabric here what I need you 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.120
 that is to say that you will have 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.640
 need one of a mesh fabric 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.709
 if you have if you are a threat from 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.370
 knit you can of course knit a 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.810
 little knit band and so come 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.580
 use it for your furniture 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.500
 now if you are knit 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.050
 you can of course come and take 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.750
 in fact I took an old maid and 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.260
 so they were like this so 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.290
 to actually roll 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.819
 and suddenly I rolled them out to make them 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.300
 for pauline use it for furniture 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.310
 you can take an old sweater 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.560
 in wool so here it is enough it is 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.260
 so a little like that if he has little knitting 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.320
 you know why so that gives a 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.730
 warmer effect that's it then you 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.290
 you show me how I used that 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.930
 I'm going to use it on my guy to me 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.330
 so this one i'm showing you so this is 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.390
 this thursday me frost had at prima I 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.500
 actually come measured which pretty much the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.590
 height of my morgue 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.510
 so I take my guy like this I 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.430
 so take my piece of cloth whatever 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.720
 it is and I come actually measured to little 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.580
 near the height of my eye knowing that 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.450
 I do not cover my whole guy I 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.590
 leave a little bit of 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.890
 furniture appear it's a little more 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.430
 pretty 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.510
 so at the level we will say the hanse the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.440
 years of furniture like this positioning 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.380
 furniture like this you see but 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.210
 maybe this way and we'll say 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:35.500
 this height there I come from the cuts and 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:38.720
 7 miles So therefore tales games 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.980
 simply a my try not 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.930
 too much fired on the hand because once 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.050
 cut out the mesh of course she 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.480
 opens so it's more convenient to 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.170
 knit but for those who do not know 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.280
 not knitting 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.930
 Well here's a simpler trick 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.310
 so it makes me a bunch of guys like 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.290
 so this is the band like that 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:10.160
 so I take my blog like this and I 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:12.200
 come in fact so open the band like 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.000
 this so I end up with a language 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:25.270
 long strips of mesh people want up 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:28.810
 so my mac like this here 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.940
 and so I measure the length here of the mug 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.139
 so to get to the years it is necessary that 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.349
 the opening is at the level of the hip 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.169
 then I come to choose a button 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.370
 like these game button we try to 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.669
 make a nice button which I took a 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.830
 soft pink rose like that so we 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.330
 recognize that it's one with a month and 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.860
 then it goes with the little flowers 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.050
 in party that are already on the furniture 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.349
 like this I then need a 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.550
 needle and white thread so I'm going 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:05:01.120
 well spent so my son whites which in 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.090
 needle so I'm doing a big better l 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.979
 end of the thread with my needle 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.120
 so at the end for those who do not have 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.159
 the basics of sewing 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.800
 ask your mom it's great 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:14.650
 simple to do so so I come 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.150
 first so rolled up my hobby if I 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.940
 first come to realize so sew 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.349
 a first point at the mobile level at 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.349
 the hip above lens 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.450
 then I take my button 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:44.280
 This raises like this and I just 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:46.610
 sew the button so here at that level 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.610
 hac 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.150
 so here is my sewn buttons now 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:14.770
 so I take a hole in the mesh in 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:20.159
 face and so I bring my good tone 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:22.629
 teeth we saw so it's closed 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.430
 then there is still this end there so 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:26.110
 I'm coming back to do the same thing as 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.789
 level there so at the elbow still a small 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.020
 point here i'm trying so in fact to 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.639
 take a little more tissue at this 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.009
 level there when I sew for that 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.979
 do so so that my nexus could 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:43.629
 tighten high level so at the bottom of 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:47.590
 fight of the first head and so that's our 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:50.169
 pretty trendy mugs really very very 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.969
 pretty i find it really very cute the 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:56.879
 little button here the little pink button 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:07:06.639
 here and so the little flowers here pink 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:08.289
 and our our knitting here I hope that 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:10.870
