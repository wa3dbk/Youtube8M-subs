00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello, friends, how are you? 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.020
 spent a very happy Christmas and that the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.360
 next year be full of blessings 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.580
 for you and your families and of course 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.099
 also craft beer is now 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.010
 very good time to start let's hope 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.320
 for next year we have 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.140
 a lot more new beers than 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.570
 try continuing with what we 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.300
 we are going to continue elaborating 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.640
 beer but now from grains of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.160
 barley if you remember our beer 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.980
 previous was from extract from 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.500
 malta now let's complicate a little bit 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.879
 plus the process and we are going to elaborate the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.200
 barley grains 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.149
 you have to leave some things in mind and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.250
 during this video the blog I'm going to 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.430
 answer the questions that have gone 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.440
 emerging along the other videos 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.120
 that we have uploaded to the network we are going to 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.760
 start with our first question 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.850
 where they tell us what is the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.570
 difference between malt and barley if 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.080
 remember the barley is a cereal is the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.140
 grass of the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.230
 let's get the necessary starches 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.120
 to make our beer will happen 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.480
 by a process of germination that is 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.490
 Malted flame because malted good 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.710
 because during the evil left they are going to 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.190
 unfold the starches contained in the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.380
 barley producing maltos so in 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.810
 all its torturous normal ways bad 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.990
 tedious et cetera etcetera is why 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.060
 that barley malt is called 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.479
 now we must remember that malt 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.930
 barley goes the malted and malt is what 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.320
 same 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.840
 our next question is we're 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.820
 saying that the ingredients 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.580
 main ones are repeated for all 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.560
 clear beer types yes 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.540
 clear in different proportions but 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.860
 everything repeats means that the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.530
 beer will bring the four 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.200
 basic ingredients that is malt water and 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.320
 hops and yeast the next question 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.970
 tells us which of the elements 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.490
 determines the degree of alcohol in the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.890
 beer alcohol will determine us 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.170
 the base malt that is the one that has all 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.090
 the necessary starches so that 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.220
 turn into fermentable sugars that 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.580
 in turn, the yeast will consume them 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.239
 producing alcohol and co2 in our 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.400
 next question are we 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.690
 questioning about which of the elements 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.280
 determine body color and taste if 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.440
 remember the hop is the species of the 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.390
 beers are going to give us bitterness goes to 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.760
 also contribute in part to the taste 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.190
 characteristic of beer malt 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.930
 will contribute to us in terms of color and 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.870
 as for the body also depending 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.810
 the maceration that we are going to give 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:53.080
 in the body and taste I already answered 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.230
 in the process where the must is made 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.160
 drink a constant temperature which 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.870
 would be the right one and for how long 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.400
 when we make beer from 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.290
 barley grains if we have certain 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.019
 temperatures that we should take care of but 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.700
 we will define this with time 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.560
 depending on the characteristics that 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.090
 we want to obtain and make a 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.800
 beer body light body 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.709
 robust body medium first you have to 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.350
 specify what features we want 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.739
 and then we are going to design the 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.940
 steps that you will need is the 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.480
 maceration process 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.300
 now in the fermentation process how 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.310
 I can determine what is the optimal point 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.560
 to recognize a finished product 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.660
 when there is no activity in your 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.970
 fermentor is because yeast is already 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.310
 finish working this happens in a 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.460
 approximate period of 7 to 14 days 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.250
 depending on the weather you have in the 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.220
 where are you brewing your beer 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.460
 how many types of yeast are there if 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.290
 remember there are more than 1500 strains of 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.140
 yeast but the ones that we use 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.620
 commonly in beer are 2 yeast 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.840
 which they are called removed and service 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.060
 the lager yeast that you will find 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.100
 with various names like dried and cesc and 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.120
 baron took out my scarce xisco bergen 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.519
 they took out my pastor and we 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.680
 now the taste of sweet beer 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.570
 light bitterness is determined by which 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.120
 ingredient for the hops 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.550
 what are the main types of 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.750
 malts and what would be the resulting effect 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.640
 in good beer the main kind of 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.760
 malt that they will find is malt 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.200
 base there is no beer that has no base and 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.120
 the other malts are going to find 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.740
 many everything depends on what style of 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.889
 beer want to make 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.960
 about being the effect resulting from the 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:56.069
 good beer because it will provide 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.080
 certain flavor and also the coloring 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:01.090
 characteristic of beer my name 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.919
 is the low payment on facebook me 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.240
 they find elba busy blue master 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:09.280

 they find me on facebook like elba

 beer unites us
