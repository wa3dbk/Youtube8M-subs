00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:10.290
 frames one number one situation what 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.580
 it happens 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:20.100
 the road or somehow try it happens 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 you are leaving our kebabs somewhere else all 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.539
 the night is already with music and 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.279
 battery is dead need a car not 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.520
 start all the songs you alone have in general 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.370
 unreal general machines push there 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:40.640
 Gleze is worth what is the exit for 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:44.670
 a situation to find here almost vaz 2104 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:51.840
 injector standard jet at all 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:55.699
 reworked not a drop of zavadsky that 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.699
 you can do more 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.120
 first we hang wheels any rear 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.150
 wheel 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.060
 jack 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:14.180
 so she just hung out 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:18.110
 turn on the ignition even turned on flew away 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.990
 lighting all the lights lit up the pin 3 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.700
 battery oil things second speed 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.830
 everything 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.830
 salon we do nothing more further 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.390
 but I think everyone 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.420
 because I don't know which driver 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:42.650
 there should be an ordinary sailing cable not 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.210
 Do you know the dome meter standard do 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.300
 exactly one and a half turnovers 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.360
 exactly one and a half here and here such a part 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.630
 wheels 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.630
 we wind we wind as much as possible more tightly 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.920
 he 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.980
 paper 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:17.250
 rose overall is also better still forgotten 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.990
 say under the apron wheels better 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.530
 put something down 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.370
 either brick well what's on hand here 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.220
 from hand what we proved here 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.060
 car and drove forward and either units 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.060
 somehow mkad 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.550
 next we take this growth the biggest spike 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.330
 here and so we can not do so 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:49.170
 for what if that cable 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.640
 winds back at the factory car20 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:59.040
 can me and shake the wheel 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:03.330
 he does too what emphasis you 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.900
 comfortable leg and very sharp movement and and 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.900
 dogs 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.010
 a machine 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.340
 drove whether 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.970
 everything 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.780
