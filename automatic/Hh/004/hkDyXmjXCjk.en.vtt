00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
first and second chicane it is so easy

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.799 
first and second chicane it is so easy
to<00:00:51.309> find<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.489> back<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.820> car<00:00:53.059> where<00:00:53.750> the

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
to find the back of the car where the

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.410 
to find the back of the car where the
front<00:00:54.050> should<00:00:54.260> be<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:55.670> that's<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.150> Eric

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
front should be and that's and Eric

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.450 
front should be and that's and Eric
running<00:00:56.990> right<00:00:57.410> at<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.740> very<00:00:57.770> edge<00:00:58.190> now<00:00:58.430> I

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
running right at the very edge now I

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.740 
running right at the very edge now I
don't<00:00:58.670> know<00:00:58.730> why<00:00:58.880> he<00:00:59.000> did<00:00:59.150> that<00:00:59.180> I<00:00:59.330> think<00:00:59.630> that

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
don't know why he did that I think that

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.850 
don't know why he did that I think that
was<00:00:59.870> looking<00:01:00.170> down<00:01:00.320> maybe<00:01:00.590> at<00:01:00.740> his

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
was looking down maybe at his

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.650 
was looking down maybe at his
instruments<00:01:01.310> and<00:01:01.400> not<00:01:02.000> watching<00:01:02.360> ahead<00:01:02.450> of

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
instruments and not watching ahead of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.400 
instruments and not watching ahead of
him<00:01:03.009> 3:24<00:01:04.009> clicks<00:01:04.339> at<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.880> second

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
him 3:24 clicks at the second

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.040 
him 3:24 clicks at the second
intermediate<00:01:06.410> point<00:01:06.680> in<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.890> circuit<00:01:08.050> well

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
intermediate point in the circuit well

intermediate point in the circuit well
Eric<00:01:09.710> nearly<00:01:10.250> went<00:01:10.369> off<00:01:10.550> they're<00:01:10.940> running

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
Eric nearly went off they're running

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.880 
Eric nearly went off they're running
very<00:01:12.380> wide<00:01:12.710> indeed<00:01:14.470> sparks<00:01:15.470> coming<00:01:15.680> from

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
very wide indeed sparks coming from

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.840 
very wide indeed sparks coming from
those<00:01:16.100> skid<00:01:16.520> plates

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.550 

into<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.780> stadium<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.880> onto<00:01:22.450> this<00:01:22.600> notorious

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
into the stadium and onto this notorious

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.170 
into the stadium and onto this notorious
tax<00:01:23.860> curve<00:01:24.159> it's<00:01:24.400> one<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.610> those<00:01:24.670> corners<00:01:25.090> that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
tax curve it's one of those corners that

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.570 
tax curve it's one of those corners that
doesn't<00:01:25.510> really<00:01:25.659> seem<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:25.930> matter<00:01:26.080> what<00:01:26.580> line

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
doesn't really seem to matter what line

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.760 
doesn't really seem to matter what line
you<00:01:27.790> take<00:01:28.030> in<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.360> corner<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:29.380> never<00:01:29.530> can

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
you take in the corner you never can

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.850 
you take in the corner you never can
really<00:01:29.890> pick<00:01:30.130> up<00:01:30.250> speed<00:01:30.490> on<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.729> exits<00:01:31.120> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
really pick up speed on the exits and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.780 
really pick up speed on the exits and
then<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.070> final<00:01:33.490> two<00:01:33.520> right-hand<00:01:34.510> corners<00:01:35.790> in

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
then the final two right-hand corners in

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.060 
then the final two right-hand corners in
third<00:01:37.090> gear<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.570> then<00:01:37.660> important<00:01:38.650> here<00:01:38.860> too

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
third gear and then important here too

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.179 
third gear and then important here too
to<00:01:39.880> get<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.090> drive<00:01:40.420> out<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.259> that<00:01:41.470> corner

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
to get the drive out of that corner

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.260 
to get the drive out of that corner
forty<00:01:43.820> three<00:01:44.030> point<00:01:44.270> five<00:01:44.570> six<00:01:44.960> five<00:01:46.270> and

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
forty three point five six five and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.649 
forty three point five six five and
again<00:01:47.509> we<00:01:47.689> see<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:47.930> trend<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:50.360> third

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
again we see the trend that the third

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.080 
again we see the trend that the third
lap<00:01:50.990> is<00:01:51.259> slower<00:01:51.920> than<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.399> second

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
lap is slower than the second

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.109 
lap is slower than the second
so<00:01:54.009> Derek<00:01:55.009> Warwick<00:01:55.220> is<00:01:55.579> going<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:55.850> come<00:01:56.000> back

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
so Derek Warwick is going to come back

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.539 
so Derek Warwick is going to come back
into<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.659> pits<00:01:56.899> into<00:01:57.350> tenth<00:01:57.619> position<00:01:57.829> on

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
into the pits into tenth position on

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.359 
into the pits into tenth position on
this<00:01:59.119> very<00:01:59.750> last<00:02:00.020> flying<00:02:00.679> lap<00:02:01.009> of<00:02:01.220> qualifying

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
this very last flying lap of qualifying

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.539 
this very last flying lap of qualifying
so<00:02:02.179> his<00:02:02.420> session<00:02:02.810> is<00:02:02.960> finished<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.130> not

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
so his session is finished and not

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:05.889 
so his session is finished and not
because<00:02:04.909> he<00:02:05.030> went<00:02:05.210> off<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.450> road<00:02:05.630> that's

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
because he went off the road that's

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.990 
because he went off the road that's
because<00:02:06.259> we<00:02:06.380> run<00:02:06.560> out<00:02:06.679> of<00:02:06.710> laps<00:02:07.000> Alessandro

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
because we run out of laps Alessandro

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.350 
because we run out of laps Alessandro
