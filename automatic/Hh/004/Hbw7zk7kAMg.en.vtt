00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.819
 very good we all always have a 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.770
 day more with all of us and in this 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.299
 I bring you a video that is very 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.880
 expected that is the presentation of the 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.200
 new champion of flirt legens atrox a 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.790
 character that has not happened in mÃ¡laga 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.280
 unnoticed since good its appearance 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.260
 physical is like a devil a demon 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.210
 what could be but that's how 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.670
 bloodthirsty and maybe it's not called the 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.770
 attention and want to play it for 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.820
 make a horror and good in this video 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.290
 what we are going to see is they are a little 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.210
 skills and a little the potential of 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.010
 this champion that what must be stressed 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.020
 at first sight is that he is a champion of 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.079
 of no rank so the 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.660
 more viable positions or more take them 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.239
 to go better all over all in top and 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.559
 also in jungle how do you do not like 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.510
 I can say you can also play in my 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.359
 everything even from support but it's not what 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.589
 usual for this champion no and good 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.149
 going a little bit the skills we're going to 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.600
 see that our ability has as 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.579
 two round the small round is where 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.079
 is going to jump atrox and the champions that 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.460
 are in the small round you are going to 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.769
 push up would be something like that 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.359
 as the rope cv is our double b 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.909
 they are like two skills in one since 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.950
 when we are with the icon in red the 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.719
 third blow that we see is going 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.850
 a quantity of life and when it is in 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:11.259
 purple as is the case then the third 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.520
 spell is going to make us lose a 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.399
 amount of life but aside we're going to 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.719
 win a hit additional damage what 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.360
 which will be good for us to go playing 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.070
 in according to what occasions and do what 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.929
 more suits us as you have just seen 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.610
 our third ability not stability 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.770
 they are rays that we throw towards 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.110
 go ahead and that by giving you they inflict you 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.789
 damage and also slows you down 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.880
 highlight how good the template you use 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.439
 Our ability is unique, the color 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.759
 I know you've seen the launch, I do not know 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.439
 use for any other skill d league 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.020
 of legends of no other character like that 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.479
 which is something unique to the atrox champion 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.000
 and here as you are seeing I am going to die 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.920
 atrox is a champion who dies but if 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.750
 you have been observers you have seen 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.640
 that at the beginning of the video has also 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.890
 dead but I have revived what is due 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.229
 well this is due to the passive 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.299
 atrox as you can see the same is in 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.569
 cooling has 130 seconds of cool 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:05.110
 down and I think you get using just 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.119
 use it has about 220 seconds 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.250
 approximately I remember it well but 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.509
 out there there's the thing for which 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.400
 is a 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.650
 a cult still quite important but 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.569
 good to relive always comes well and 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.519
 that depends on receiving good as the 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.400
 red bar that you will see below our 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.799
 life bar will decide with what life 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.970
 revive atrox that is to say the more 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.280
 charged we will receive with more life 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.670
 and here we can see our ultimate 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.210
 which we just saw and what it does is 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.350
 cause damage in the area to enemies that 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.620
 they surround him and also apart so we 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.210
 it generates different different things 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.940
 benefits as it could be to get 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.130
 attack speed and additional range 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.920
 it would be something like that of caile you 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.750
 generates scope therefore similar and apart from 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.890
 hurt the area because age that gives you 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.780
 attack speed and additional range 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.270
 and well here we are going to continue rehearsing is 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.450
 a little the character watching a bit the 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.970
 animations a bit like fight and well ya 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.530
 this would be a bit all of atrox 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.300
 Any question that you have, you already know 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.770

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.110

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.400
 all and well this would be all I hope that 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.650
 you liked it here we are going to go with 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.209
