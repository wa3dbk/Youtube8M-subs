00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:17.580
 Hello, under is love Today I would like to introduce in that I know and love 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:22.400
 I really like curly hair and I use it every day 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.910
 That's coming here Antipodes Chan Vidal Sassoon 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:31.539
 It is Swarosuki of a little break care 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:35.470
 A lot of temperature can be adjusted from 120 degrees to 180 degrees 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:41.940
 By the way, I wound at 180 degrees 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:47.610
 Jen was 150 degrees, but my hair was going to be damaged, so for mass production 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.829
 From it is said it'll be better wound at 180 degrees Once you have a story that of Dakuso 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:59.410
 I wound it at 180 degrees 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:01:03.490
 Right now I'm just ahead on the right side but now I'd like to try winding the left side 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:07.020
 Well before maseri's 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.670
 I use shower mist 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.710
 Do 2 laps 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.760
 Towards the bristles in the feeling I 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.820
 I'm putting 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:24.920
 After all the paper is also 180 degrees 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.920
 I was careful about hair care with what I had 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.240
 I Kyoto from the side of the back 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.159
 Put 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.150
 This good part of the beauty of the Bidder Sasun is very good 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.140
 Than there is a feeling of close adhesion 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.140
 It is easy to wind 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.150
 In feeling you 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.150
 When a woman comes 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.020
 Next is it 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.350
 This hard-to-work 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.360
 It is appropriate 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.360
 Because it is quite busy in the morning 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.539
 On my head 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.539
 I wound taking feel that say so or not this about 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.680
 Than the surface of the really come has become hot because it is still 180 degrees 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:34.550
 It 's so hot when you touch it with your finger 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.550
 You have to be careful there 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:44.190
 I've used a variety of trowels, but this one is the easiest to use 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.320
 Near the baseline 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.170
 Only in the place 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.250
 To be able to wind beautifully 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.090
 very well 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.910
 I'm doing it with care 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.560
 I was able to do it like this 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:45.780
 Mostly I like Uchimaki very much 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.780
 I'm wrapping around 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:54.870
 Or with or to mix the Tokizaki in the winding and the outer winding 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.870
 I will 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.710
 Finally, in something like 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.069
 Distracting Well 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:12.020
 done 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:16.250
 If it is this generation for generations, it loses in about 10 minutes 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:20.590
 It is highly recommended for busy hours in the morning 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.590
 Please try by all means try
