system and you remember this amp was in

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:29.540 
system and you remember this amp was in
the<00:00:29.130> system

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the system

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.979 
the system
come<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:31.040> now<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> got<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:35.059> don't<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> 2200

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
come on now I got it don't have the 2200

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.660 
come on now I got it don't have the 2200
anymore<00:00:38.480> traded<00:00:39.480> dad<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.070> couple<00:00:41.280> lethal

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
twelves and audio cue 2200 for this and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.740 
twelves and audio cue 2200 for this and
not<00:00:58.710> only<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.460> I'll<00:01:00.000> be<00:01:00.210> getting

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.899 

another<00:01:03.750> sprinter<00:01:04.680> 370<00:01:05.369> battery<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:07.880> also<00:01:08.880> I

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
another sprinter 370 battery and also I

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.500 
another sprinter 370 battery and also I
already<00:01:09.240> got<00:01:09.390> about<00:01:09.960> 10<00:01:10.260> feet<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.650> zero<00:01:10.890> gauge

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
already got about 10 feet of zero gauge

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.240 
already got about 10 feet of zero gauge
so<00:01:12.890> pretty<00:01:13.890> beast<00:01:14.189> 4,000<00:01:14.970> want<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:16.860> goes<00:01:17.070> down

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
so pretty beast 4,000 want it goes down

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.730 
so pretty beast 4,000 want it goes down
to<00:01:17.400> 2<00:01:17.580> ohms<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:18.119> close<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.900> home<00:01:19.020> staple<00:01:19.590> but

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
to 2 ohms it's close to home staple but

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.149 
to 2 ohms it's close to home staple but
at<00:01:19.860> 2<00:01:20.040> ohms<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.460> puts<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.810> 4000<00:01:21.810> Watts<00:01:22.159> it's

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
at 2 ohms it puts out 4000 Watts it's

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.149 
at 2 ohms it puts out 4000 Watts it's
rated<00:01:23.430> at<00:01:23.520> 12<00:01:23.759> point<00:01:24.060> 5<00:01:24.240> volts<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.040> really

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
rated at 12 point 5 volts so it's really

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.020 
rated at 12 point 5 volts so it's really
efficient<00:01:26.700> crossfire<00:01:27.509> good<00:01:27.960> competition<00:01:28.470> amp

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
efficient crossfire good competition amp

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.910 
efficient crossfire good competition amp
and<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.950> have<00:01:32.420> back<00:01:33.420> hair<00:01:33.600> took<00:01:33.869> off<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.770> back

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and I have back hair took off the back

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.580 
and I have back hair took off the back
plate<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.250> see<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> guts<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.240> got<00:01:37.140> pictures<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
plate to see the guts I got pictures of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.050 
plate to see the guts I got pictures of
that<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:39.650> yeah<00:01:40.650> pretty<00:01:41.040> beast<00:01:42.049> has<00:01:44.060> six

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that and yeah pretty beast has six

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.800 
that and yeah pretty beast has six
mounting<00:01:45.390> legs

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:02:04.710 

and<00:01:50.770> if<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:50.950> measure<00:01:51.159> it<00:01:51.310> here<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.930> is<00:02:03.540> 27<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.600> a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
and if I measure it here it is 27 and a

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:15.620 
and if I measure it here it is 27 and a
half<00:02:04.750> inches<00:02:07.440> it's<00:02:08.440> just<00:02:12.930> nine<00:02:13.930> inches<00:02:14.290> wide

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
half inches it's just nine inches wide

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.180 
half inches it's just nine inches wide
so<00:02:16.630> it's<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.930> pretty<00:02:17.140> big<00:02:17.319> amp<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:20.100> it's<00:02:21.100> a

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
so it's a pretty big amp and it's a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.660 
so it's a pretty big amp and it's a
single<00:02:21.550> zero<00:02:21.910> gate<00:02:22.150> inputs<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:24.190> has<00:02:24.340> dual<00:02:26.670> dual

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
single zero gate inputs it has dual dual

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.710 
single zero gate inputs it has dual dual
zero<00:02:28.890> grounded<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.670> positive<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.510> neat

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
zero grounded and positive and neat

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.910 
zero grounded and positive and neat
internals<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:33.120> on<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.209> other<00:02:34.330> side<00:02:35.850> as<00:02:36.850> our

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
internals and on the other side as our

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.610

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
C's subsonic and low-pass obviously

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.350 
C's subsonic and low-pass obviously
competition<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:47.700> good<00:02:48.700> stuff
