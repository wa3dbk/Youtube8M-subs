00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.209
 but let's create it 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:19.850
 a program for the plc 17 300 the cpu 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:23.390
 314 initially the software shows us 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.320
 the project assistant we are going to create 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.320
 a new project 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.390
 So here we give you where the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.390
 process control program 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:43.190
 test 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.190
 for example effects click on accept 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.580
 and we're going to start configuring the plc 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.130
 from scratch we have the possibility of 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:56.480
 add the frame first 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:01.450
 then we add an object 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:06.040
 17 300 that you want to work 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.790
 then we click on 300 of the file 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.409
 who created us 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.030
 and we double click on hardware 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.299
 in the hardware we will open a new 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.299
 application 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.860
 which we are going to configure the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.880
 software we start by the rack that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.890
 is the mounting rail 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.509
 we give a to your support profile where 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.640
 let's associate the configuration to 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.680
 our plc 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.450
 based on the characterization that has been 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.690
 made the bank then we're going to 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:40.869
 add the cpu in this case the cpu is a 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:44.350
 314 striped pnp allows communication and 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:48.250
 communication but he asks me for the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.820
 system parameters I have 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.170
 aggregates of the address to dakar but 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.390
 within characterization that 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.479
 realized the address is 10 the mask to 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:04.000
 turn and an outbreak is used the door 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:06.720
 link on the 192 168 101.1 generates a 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.380
 new network connection 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.840
 to link ministries 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.110
 generates the CPU another ice module in which 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.140
 I have is a source of that coffee is 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.270
 318 amps 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.170
 and according to the reference that we 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:29.230
 like in the touch of the system of meaning 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.920
 go to the network creates the pro system has 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.510
 I keep and with hair 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.260
 we are going to configure the analogous modules 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.040
 for depending on the central if they are 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.060
 taxis or tickets at 420 milliamps from 0 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.500
 at 10 volts 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.840
 at this point we can 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.900
 select the module configuration 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.500
 if I need it in tension from 0 to 10 or 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.440
 polar or if you need it in intensity and 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.840
 I can configure the modules from 0 to 20 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.599
 from 4 to 20 if it is to know what 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.760
 directions I'm assigning the 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.980
 configuration my tickets the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.790
 addresses start at 800 and end 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.379
 in 8 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.100
 remember that this is a word that 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.190
 I went two by two 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.160
 they are two bytes then in this case 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:22.590
 we would have for tickets 800 800 2 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:26.090
 804 and 86 for outputs 800 and 802 that 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.090
 we can also see it at this point
