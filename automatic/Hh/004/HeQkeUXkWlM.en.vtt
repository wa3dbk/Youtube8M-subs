our sort of fitness levels really this
is<00:03:14.430> really<00:03:14.760> important<00:03:15.209> because<00:03:15.239> we<00:03:15.570> don't

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
is really important because we don't

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.509 
is really important because we don't
want<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.260> be<00:03:16.350> pigeonholed<00:03:16.590> into<00:03:17.130> only

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
want to be pigeonholed into only

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.390 
want to be pigeonholed into only
providing<00:03:18.120> opportunities<00:03:18.780> for<00:03:18.989> young<00:03:19.170> people

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
providing opportunities for young people

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.949 
providing opportunities for young people
clearly<00:03:20.400> young<00:03:20.790> people<00:03:21.090> are<00:03:21.239> our<00:03:21.420> future<00:03:21.600> fans

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
clearly young people are our future fans

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.420 
clearly young people are our future fans
but<00:03:22.260> we<00:03:22.350> can't<00:03:22.560> neglect<00:03:22.799> those<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.340> are

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
but we can't neglect those that are

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.430 
but we can't neglect those that are
already<00:03:23.459> supported<00:03:24.180> Bristol<00:03:24.480> City<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:25.019> so

it's<00:03:25.590> really<00:03:25.739> important<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.459> we<00:03:26.580> provide

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820
