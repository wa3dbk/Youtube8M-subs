00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.470
 tells crowd was 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.610
 and if in the middle how to remove this lens from the 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.060
 rearview mirror 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:29.260
 I had a problem with a motoboy. 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.670
 even ended up breaking my lens 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.670
 I already bought a new 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.160
 the little 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.160
 Hmm 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.040
 [Music] 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:09.000
 and the lens 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.000
 We are also retiring 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.299
 been broken there 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.610
 the rearview mirror with this 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.590
 part of it out here 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.590
 in the case of electric iraq 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.000
 as I have no object here 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:38.189
 pointy to put here behind 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.189
 promised money will break 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.320
 I dropped it 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.920
 on here 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.040
 the original 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:11.230
 dell original is my pay you cheese that 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.310
 I think this is written is calm 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.310
 I bought it too. 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.380
 was 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:28.080
 the metal is attacking something of the type there 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.080
 something similar or seems to be 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:38.080
 original is similar but quality seems 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.350
 the same process here is very simple 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:46.740
 I'll put it on, too. 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:51.300
 back where he was and that's all. 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.300
 put it fits 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.090
 the docking 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.159
 improvised placed 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.080
 it was a little smaller 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.629
 the warning here is a little name 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.180
 original original slightly larger 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:23.590
 It comes as goes the bottom of this 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:28.680
 part that was always there left to 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.680
 break a working branch 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.680
 and this is it 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.680
 so you can put 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.849
 It's very difficult and that's what it's worth
