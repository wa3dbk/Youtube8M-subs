00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
to go to the moon well words are

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.289 
to go to the moon well words are
difficult<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.950> know<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.160> can<00:02:18.459> tell<00:02:19.000> them<00:02:19.180> and

motion and imagery can really give you

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.430 
motion and imagery can really give you
the<00:02:26.590> field<00:02:26.889> so<00:02:27.730> what<00:02:28.180> we<00:02:28.359> tried<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.660> do<00:02:28.959> with

lunar mission lasted 12 days and you

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.400 
lunar mission lasted 12 days and you
only<00:02:53.049> get<00:02:53.319> ten<00:02:53.560> minutes<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:55.019> we've<00:02:56.019> tried<00:02:56.290> to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
only get ten minutes so we've tried to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.949 
only get ten minutes so we've tried to
compress<00:02:56.889> the<00:02:57.700> highlights<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.389> twelve<00:02:58.720> days

our missions it's sort of a generic film
for<00:03:34.930> all<00:03:35.080> missions<00:03:35.590> but<00:03:35.920> it's<00:03:36.520> focused<00:03:37.090> on<00:03:37.210> the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
for all missions but it's focused on the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.960 
for all missions but it's focused on the
last<00:03:37.990> three<00:03:38.380> missions<00:03:38.830> which<00:03:39.130> were<00:03:39.370> the

last three missions which were the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.820 
last three missions which were the
science<00:03:40.450> exploration<00:03:40.840> where<00:03:41.380> we<00:03:41.500> had<00:03:41.680> two

science exploration where we had two

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.580 
science exploration where we had two
lunar<00:03:42.070> rover<00:03:42.490> so<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.900> really<00:03:44.110> get<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.560> sense

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
lunar rover so you really get the sense

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.670 
lunar rover so you really get the sense
of<00:03:45.100> how<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.580> is<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.970> drive<00:03:46.150> in<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.540> moon<00:03:46.720> how<00:03:47.470> it

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
of how it is to drive in the moon how it

is<00:03:47.800> to<00:03:47.980> launch<00:03:48.190> how<00:03:48.520> it<00:03:48.700> is<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:49.000> land<00:03:49.240> and<00:03:49.600> I

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
is to launch how it is to land and I
