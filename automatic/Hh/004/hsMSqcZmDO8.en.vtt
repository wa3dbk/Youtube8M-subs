give<00:02:00.540> us<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.689> idea<00:02:01.170> yeah<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.159> like<00:02:02.399> we

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
give us the idea yeah it's like we

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.640 
give us the idea yeah it's like we
there's<00:02:02.820> always<00:02:03.119> money

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
there's always money

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.950 
there's always money
some<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.430> modular<00:02:05.850> wheels<00:02:06.150> are<00:02:06.360> consistent

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
some the modular wheels are consistent

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.700 
some the modular wheels are consistent
of<00:02:07.140> various<00:02:07.800> wheel<00:02:08.070> parts<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.560> outer

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
of various wheel parts this is the outer

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.130 
of various wheel parts this is the outer
dish<00:02:11.100> we<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.360> outer<00:02:12.540> dish<00:02:12.840> is

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
dish we have here the outer dish is

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:22.880 
dish we have here the outer dish is
available<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.430> different<00:02:15.420> width<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.710> a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
available in different width this is a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.890 
available in different width this is a
much<00:02:23.280> smaller<00:02:24.030> width<00:02:24.500> we<00:02:25.500> have<00:02:25.530> right<00:02:25.920> here

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
much smaller width we have right here

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.060 
much smaller width we have right here
than<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.080> previous<00:02:28.530> one

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
than the previous one

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.880 
than the previous one
giving<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.730> different<00:02:30.150> overall<00:02:31.110> width<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.680> the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
giving a different overall width of the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.980 
giving a different overall width of the
wheel<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:33.870> different<00:02:34.440> offset<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.840> this<00:02:36.840> is

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
wheel and a different offset so this is

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.290 
wheel and a different offset so this is
a<00:02:37.020> real<00:02:37.320> tuna<00:02:37.890> program<00:02:38.340> with<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.670> th<00:02:38.970> line

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
a real tuna program with the th line

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.390 
a real tuna program with the th line
wheel<00:02:39.570> which<00:02:40.350> we<00:02:40.709> can<00:02:41.490> vary<00:02:41.790> 8<00:02:42.060> in<00:02:43.400> different

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
wheel which we can vary 8 in different

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.030 
wheel which we can vary 8 in different
sizes<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.940> offsets<00:02:45.540> which<00:02:46.290> are<00:02:46.470> measuring

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
sizes and offsets which are measuring

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.060 
sizes and offsets which are measuring
your<00:02:47.190> car<00:02:47.459> perfectly
