00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
what if this actually space up at

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.230 
what if this actually space up at
fullback<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:23.310> know<00:01:23.430> kid<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> kicking

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
fullback and you know kid do a kicking

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.630 
fullback and you know kid do a kicking
behind<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.990> that's<00:01:25.140> good<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
behind so that's good right of that you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.450 
behind so that's good right of that you
get<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.180> right<00:01:28.020> teams<00:01:28.409> player<00:01:29.130> that

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
get to see the right teams player that

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.030 
get to see the right teams player that
is<00:01:29.490> currently<00:01:30.180> being<00:01:30.509> controlling<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:32.009> I

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
is currently being controlling and now I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.560 
is currently being controlling and now I
can't<00:01:32.460> actually<00:01:32.610> figure<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.000> what<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
can't actually figure out what is this

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.929 
can't actually figure out what is this
top<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:34.020> hand<00:01:34.140> corner<00:01:34.290> now<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.220> think<00:01:35.790> it's

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
top right hand corner now I I think it's

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.420 
top right hand corner now I I think it's
wind<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.200> wins<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> big

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
wind so I think wins going to be a big

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.300 
wind so I think wins going to be a big
factor<00:01:38.640> well<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:40.310> environment

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
factor well I think environment

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.440 
factor well I think environment
conditions<00:01:41.549> are<00:01:41.820> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> big<00:01:42.299> factor

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
conditions are going to be a big factor

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.539 
conditions are going to be a big factor
weather<00:01:42.840> might<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> big<00:01:43.470> effect<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.950> how

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
weather might have a big effect on how

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.429 
weather might have a big effect on how
you<00:01:44.610> how<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.210> game<00:01:45.450> goes<00:01:45.659> where<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> boy

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you how the game goes where the boy

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.710 
you how the game goes where the boy
actually<00:01:46.680> goes<00:01:47.549> once<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.119> kick<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.570> that's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
actually goes once you kick it so that's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.030

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
made but I don't know who the tackle is

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.100 
made but I don't know who the tackle is
it's<00:01:56.909> sorry<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.420> not<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> best

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it's sorry it's not the really the best

screenshot<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.829> world<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.369> not<00:01:59.490> just

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
screenshot in the world it's not just

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700 
screenshot in the world it's not just
slightly<00:02:00.119> bow<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> middle

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
slightly bow but you can see the middle

slightly bow but you can see the middle
so<00:02:02.060> there<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.090> currently<00:02:03.630> tackle<00:02:03.990> racks

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
so there is currently tackle racks

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.780 
so there is currently tackle racks
probably<00:02:04.829> forming<00:02:05.189> after<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.549> I'm<00:02:05.640> not<00:02:05.670> sure

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
probably forming after that I'm not sure

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.580 
probably forming after that I'm not sure
if<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.420> three<00:02:06.659> or<00:02:06.990> more

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
if it's going to be three or more

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.350 
if it's going to be three or more
hopefully<00:02:08.039> they've<00:02:08.220> changed<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.000> hope
