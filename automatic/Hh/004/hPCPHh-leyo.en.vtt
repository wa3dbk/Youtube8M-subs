00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
wanted I was hoping I'd probably a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.630 
wanted I was hoping I'd probably a
little<00:00:49.230> bit<00:00:49.410> faster<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> guess<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.160> wasn't<00:00:50.370> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
little bit faster but I guess I wasn't I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.889 
little bit faster but I guess I wasn't I
wanted<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.940> set<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> taut<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.660> he<00:00:51.690> wouldn't

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
wanted to set up the taut so he wouldn't

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.750 
wanted to set up the taut so he wouldn't
be<00:00:51.989> able<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> set<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.379> stealth<00:00:52.590> rocks<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:52.980> you

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
be able to set up stealth rocks but you

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.029 
be able to set up stealth rocks but you
know<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.690> always<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.110> want<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.649> I

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
do go to my superior because this means

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.290 
do go to my superior because this means

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.029 
ability contrary is one of the best
abilities<00:01:00.840> I've<00:01:01.079> ever<00:01:01.320> seen<00:01:01.500> my<00:01:01.649> entire<00:01:01.829> life

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
abilities I've ever seen my entire life

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.470 
abilities I've ever seen my entire life
I<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.460> go<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> leaf<00:01:02.940> storm<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
I can just go for a leaf storm and

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.140 
I can just go for a leaf storm and
basically<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.229> wreak<00:01:04.439> havoc<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.150> everything

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150

basically like wreak havoc on everything
and<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:07.860> predicting<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> switch<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.700> easy

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
and I was predicting the switch and easy

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.340 
and I was predicting the switch and easy
babe<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.600> wasn't<00:01:09.930> too<00:01:10.049> worried<00:01:10.260> about

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
babe I really wasn't too worried about

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.890 
babe I really wasn't too worried about
it<00:01:10.530> because<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.189> mean<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:12.420> leaf<00:01:12.630> storm<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it because I mean it's leaf storm is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.300 
it because I mean it's leaf storm is
gonna<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.140> pretty<00:01:13.170> good<00:01:13.380> damage<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
gonna do pretty good damage I do get a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.539 
gonna do pretty good damage I do get a
crit<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:14.909> um<00:01:15.409> but<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.400> my

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
crit right here um but I do get my

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.420 
crit right here um but I do get my
special<00:01:17.850> attack<00:01:18.740> sharply<00:01:19.740> risen<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.250> that's

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
special attack sharply risen so that's

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.850 
special attack sharply risen so that's
also<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:20.939> good<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.409> thinking<00:01:22.680> I

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
also really good now I was thinking I

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.929 
also really good now I was thinking I
was<00:01:22.950> gonna<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.159> faster<00:01:23.580> than<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> same

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
was gonna be faster than the same

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.510 
was gonna be faster than the same

how awesome specs keldeo is right there
and<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.710> go<00:02:04.860> back<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.009> my<00:02:05.189> desktops<00:02:05.579> for<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and I go back in my desktops for a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.240 
and I go back in my desktops for a
couple<00:02:06.119> reasons<00:02:06.149> um<00:02:06.740> because<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.129> take

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
couple reasons um because it can take

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
couple reasons um because it can take
anything<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.789> thing<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.239> row<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.720> me<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.020> it

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
anything this thing in row of me and it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.470 
anything this thing in row of me and it
has<00:02:10.560> fire<00:02:10.800> punch<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.940> gonna<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.180> four

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
has fire punch so it's gonna be four

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.260 
has fire punch so it's gonna be four
times

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
times

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.320 
times
effective<00:02:14.020> against<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.890> Pharaoh<00:02:15.700> thorne<00:02:16.060> and

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
effective against the Pharaoh thorne and

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.450 
effective against the Pharaoh thorne and
being<00:02:17.230> able<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.440> take<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.620> thing<00:02:17.800> down<00:02:17.860> is

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
being able to take that thing down is

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.720 
being able to take that thing down is
really<00:02:18.790> helpful<00:02:19.030> but<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.810> barely<00:02:20.050> survives

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
really helpful but it barely survives

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.280 
really helpful but it barely survives
which<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:21.880> cool<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.360> does<00:02:22.570> get<00:02:22.780> burned<00:02:23.080> so

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
which is cool but it does get burned so

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.770 
which is cool but it does get burned so
I<00:02:23.680> was<00:02:24.550> hoping<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.030> burn<00:02:25.210> would<00:02:25.390> take<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.690> out

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
I was hoping the burn would take it out

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.300 
I was hoping the burn would take it out
but<00:02:25.960> after<00:02:26.080> he<00:02:26.350> gets<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.560> recovery<00:02:26.980> from<00:02:27.070> in

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
but after he gets the recovery from in

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.640 
but after he gets the recovery from in
grain<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.090> his<00:02:28.750> leftovers<00:02:29.230> he's<00:02:29.410> going<00:02:29.590> to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
grain and his leftovers he's going to

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.470 
grain and his leftovers he's going to
barely<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.490> enough<00:02:30.520> HP<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.450> UM<00:02:31.920> survive<00:02:32.920> with

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
barely have enough HP to UM survive with

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.540 
barely have enough HP to UM survive with
which<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.660> pretty<00:02:35.020> okay<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.500> guess<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.920> mean<00:02:36.100> it

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
which is pretty okay I guess I mean it

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.920 
which is pretty okay I guess I mean it
really<00:02:36.610> doesn't<00:02:37.000> matter<00:02:37.060> as<00:02:37.360> long<00:02:37.540> as<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.870> get

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
really doesn't matter as long as I get

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.480 
really doesn't matter as long as I get
this<00:02:38.080> thing<00:02:38.230> taken<00:02:38.410> down<00:02:38.740> right<00:02:39.010> now<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.400> we

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
this thing taken down right now so we

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.910 
this thing taken down right now so we
can't<00:02:39.730> come<00:02:40.600> back<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:40.990> haunt<00:02:41.140> me<00:02:41.290> later<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.680> do

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
can't come back and haunt me later I do

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.290 
can't come back and haunt me later I do
go<00:02:42.100> for<00:02:42.220> shell<00:02:42.400> sleep<00:02:42.610> thinking<00:02:42.970> I'd<00:02:43.060> be<00:02:43.210> able

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
go for shell sleep thinking I'd be able

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.970 
go for shell sleep thinking I'd be able
to<00:02:43.390> take<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.720> out<00:02:43.840> but<00:02:44.050> I'm<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.410> lives<00:02:44.560> like<00:02:44.800> one

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
to take it out but I'm it lives like one

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.840 
to take it out but I'm it lives like one
hit<00:02:45.190> point<00:02:45.520> I<00:02:45.730> found<00:02:46.540> out<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.920> sucks<00:02:48.310> and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
hit point I found out so that sucks and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.450 
hit point I found out so that sucks and
then<00:02:49.000> um<00:02:49.440> that's<00:02:50.440> that's<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:51.100> really<00:02:51.280> I'm

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
then um that's that's just really I'm

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.130 
then um that's that's just really I'm
like<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.910> knowing<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.450> lived<00:02:52.600> took<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:52.960> HP

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
like I knowing that it lived took one HP

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.960 
like I knowing that it lived took one HP
but<00:02:54.100> it's<00:02:54.220> ok<00:02:54.400> I'm<00:02:54.490> not<00:02:54.520> going<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.790> take<00:02:54.850> the

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
but it's ok I'm not going to take the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.310 
but it's ok I'm not going to take the
same<00:02:55.150> chance<00:02:55.390> again<00:02:55.600> I'm<00:02:55.720> going<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.990> go<00:02:56.110> for

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
same chance again I'm going to go for

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.140 
same chance again I'm going to go for
the<00:02:56.350> UM<00:02:56.560> fire<00:02:57.550> punch<00:02:57.700> again<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.090> make

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
the UM fire punch again just to make

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.460 
the UM fire punch again just to make
sure<00:02:58.270> this<00:02:58.630> thing<00:02:58.810> doesn't<00:02:58.840> survive<00:02:59.290> with

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
sure this thing doesn't survive with

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.990 
sure this thing doesn't survive with
like<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> half<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.040> hit<00:03:00.190> point<00:03:00.430> or<00:03:00.640> something

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
like a half a hit point or something

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.930 
like a half a hit point or something
stupid<00:03:01.240> like<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.890> which<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.100> pretty<00:03:03.700> cool

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
stupid like that which is pretty cool

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.850

I know he can't really go for the

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.180 
I know he can't really go for the
fighting<00:03:14.230> move<00:03:14.350> just<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.740> case<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:14.980> would<00:03:15.100> have

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
fighting move just in case I would have

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.770 
fighting move just in case I would have
stayed<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.520> with<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.760> dusclops<00:03:16.270> unless<00:03:16.630> he

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
stayed in with a dusclops unless he

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.360 
stayed in with a dusclops unless he
wanted<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.080> predict<00:03:17.440> really<00:03:17.680> well<00:03:17.830> but<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.190> went

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
wanted to predict really well but I went

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.860 
wanted to predict really well but I went
to<00:03:18.459> keldeo<00:03:18.760> because<00:03:19.060> even<00:03:19.420> if<00:03:19.480> he<00:03:19.570> went<00:03:19.750> for

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
to keldeo because even if he went for

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.540 
to keldeo because even if he went for
the<00:03:19.930> dark<00:03:20.140> tech<00:03:20.350> move<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.709> do<00:03:20.770> have<00:03:20.980> justified

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
the dark tech move I do have justified

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.760 
the dark tech move I do have justified
so<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.060> went<00:03:22.270> taking<00:03:22.540> damage<00:03:22.750> from<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.170> but<00:03:23.650> he's

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
so I went taking damage from it but he's

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.160 
so I went taking damage from it but he's
went<00:03:23.950> from<00:03:24.040> bulk<00:03:24.250> up<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.790> go<00:03:25.240> for<00:03:25.390> my<00:03:25.420> secret

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
went from bulk up so I go for my secret

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.840 
went from bulk up so I go for my secret
sword<00:03:26.410> which<00:03:26.650> is<00:03:26.800> super<00:03:27.010> effective<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.700> um

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
sword which is super effective and um

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.970 
sword which is super effective and um
these<00:03:28.510> things<00:03:28.720> have<00:03:28.840> really<00:03:28.959> good<00:03:29.200> special

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
these things have really good special

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.449 
these things have really good special
defense<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:31.780> does<00:03:32.140> survive<00:03:32.500> but<00:03:32.860> it's<00:03:33.190> cool

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
defense so it does survive but it's cool

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.240 
defense so it does survive but it's cool
because<00:03:33.490> I<00:03:34.110> can<00:03:35.110> just<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.680> am<00:03:35.800> faster<00:03:36.160> I<00:03:36.220> can

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
because I can just I am faster I can

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.150 
because I can just I am faster I can
just<00:03:36.490> go<00:03:36.610> for<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.820> again<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.209> totally<00:03:37.930> own

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
just go for it again and totally own

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.470 
just go for it again and totally own
beat<00:03:39.160> his<00:03:39.310> switch<00:03:39.580> and<00:03:39.820> go<00:03:39.880> into<00:03:40.030> his<00:03:40.270> own

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
beat his switch and go into his own

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.290 
beat his switch and go into his own
reuniclus<00:03:41.050> now<00:03:41.470> these<00:03:41.890> things<00:03:42.250> are<00:03:42.940> really

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
reuniclus now these things are really

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.050 
reuniclus now these things are really
dangerous<00:03:44.020> if<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.709> um<00:03:44.890> let<00:03:45.520> him<00:03:45.640> set<00:03:45.820> up<00:03:45.850> too

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
dangerous if you um let him set up too

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.180 
dangerous if you um let him set up too
much<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:46.300> you<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:46.600> he<00:03:47.230> does<00:03:47.380> take<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.830> secrets

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
much on you so he does take the secrets

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.650 
much on you so he does take the secrets
are<00:03:48.310> pretty<00:03:48.520> well<00:03:48.730> because<00:03:48.820> he<00:03:49.180> does<00:03:49.300> resist

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
are pretty well because he does resist

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.300 
are pretty well because he does resist
it<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:50.320> can't<00:03:50.709> really<00:03:50.920> stay<00:03:51.100> in<00:03:51.160> here

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
it and I can't really stay in here

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.970 
it and I can't really stay in here
because<00:03:51.520> I'm<00:03:51.730> locked<00:03:52.120> into<00:03:52.709> secrets<00:03:53.709> or<00:03:53.830> due

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
because I'm locked into secrets or due

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.740 
because I'm locked into secrets or due
to<00:03:54.040> choice<00:03:54.370> specs<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.300> that's<00:03:55.420> why<00:03:55.510> going<00:03:55.690> to

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
to choice specs so that's why going to

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.800 
to choice specs so that's why going to
desktops<00:03:56.140> um<00:03:56.610> basically<00:03:57.610> as<00:03:58.030> fodder<00:03:58.480> it

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
desktops um basically as fodder it

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.949 
desktops um basically as fodder it
because<00:03:59.760> it's<00:04:00.760> pretty<00:04:01.240> much<00:04:01.360> useless<00:04:01.570> at<00:04:01.870> this

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
because it's pretty much useless at this

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.590 
because it's pretty much useless at this
point<00:04:02.230> but<00:04:02.410> also<00:04:03.310> because<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.209> ghost<00:04:04.420> I

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
point but also because it is a ghost I

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.150 
point but also because it is a ghost I
pandas<00:04:04.959> have<00:04:04.990> super<00:04:05.410> effective<00:04:05.620> moves<00:04:05.950> that

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160

pandas have super effective moves that

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
can feel pretty good damage to the ren

can feel pretty good damage to the ren
fest<00:04:09.040> but<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.489> went<00:04:09.940> for<00:04:10.060> shall<00:04:10.239> seek<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:10.720> it

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
fest but I went for shall seek and it

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.560 
fest but I went for shall seek and it
doesn't<00:04:11.200> actually<00:04:11.260> do<00:04:11.560> anything<00:04:12.330> almost<00:04:13.330> it

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
doesn't actually do anything almost it

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.600 
doesn't actually do anything almost it
seems<00:04:13.780> like<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.200> as<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:14.920> can<00:04:15.010> see<00:04:15.160> scenes<00:04:15.489> have

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
seems like so as you can see scenes have

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.909 
seems like so as you can see scenes have
a<00:04:15.670> lot<00:04:15.820> of<00:04:15.850> HP<00:04:16.060> and<00:04:16.510> um<00:04:16.690> he<00:04:17.320> obviously<00:04:17.560> be

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
a lot of HP and um he obviously be

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:18.240 
a lot of HP and um he obviously be
trained

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
trained

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.220 
trained
defense<00:04:18.700> because<00:04:19.180> it<00:04:19.450> took<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.810> hit<00:04:19.900> really

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
defense because it took that hit really

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.180 
defense because it took that hit really
nicely<00:04:20.730> so<00:04:21.730> he<00:04:22.090> does<00:04:22.210> take<00:04:22.390> down<00:04:22.570> my<00:04:23.190> desktops

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
nicely so he does take down my desktops

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.670 
nicely so he does take down my desktops
and<00:04:24.640> I<00:04:24.760> do<00:04:24.820> going<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.210> my<00:04:25.330> um<00:04:25.510> in<00:04:25.960> Chow<00:04:26.230> and<00:04:26.440> I

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
and I do going to my um in Chow and I

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.200 
and I do going to my um in Chow and I
was<00:04:27.070> able<00:04:27.190> for<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.490> fake<00:04:27.670> out<00:04:27.820> then<00:04:27.970> go<00:04:28.060> for

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
was able for the fake out then go for

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.730 
was able for the fake out then go for
the<00:04:28.240> u-turn<00:04:28.600> right<00:04:28.780> away<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.140> because<00:04:29.620> it

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
the u-turn right away it because it

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.140 
the u-turn right away it because it
would<00:04:29.860> have<00:04:29.950> done<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.100> lot<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.490> damage<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:30.970> the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
would have done a lot of damage to the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.120 
would have done a lot of damage to the
request<00:04:31.510> by<00:04:31.660> predicts<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.590> really<00:04:32.860> one<00:04:32.980> goes

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
request by predicts that really one goes

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.160 
request by predicts that really one goes
in<00:04:33.250> these<00:04:33.340> easy-bake<00:04:33.850> which<00:04:34.570> is<00:04:34.690> choice<00:04:34.870> scarf

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
in these easy-bake which is choice scarf

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.780 
in these easy-bake which is choice scarf
so<00:04:35.350> now<00:04:35.440> I<00:04:35.470> can<00:04:35.560> go<00:04:35.800> for<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:35.980> u-turn<00:04:36.280> more

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
so now I can go for the u-turn more

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.010 
so now I can go for the u-turn more
hillel<00:04:37.060> speed<00:04:37.420> me<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:37.660> take<00:04:37.780> me<00:04:37.870> down<00:04:37.990> with

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
hillel speed me and take me down with

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.860 
hillel speed me and take me down with
them<00:04:38.320> overheat<00:04:38.890> so<00:04:39.520> I<00:04:39.550> do<00:04:39.610> go<00:04:39.820> to<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:40.600> switch

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
them overheat so I do go to the switch

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.920 
them overheat so I do go to the switch
out<00:04:41.050> right<00:04:41.200> here<00:04:41.290> and<00:04:41.440> go<00:04:41.530> into<00:04:41.650> Keldeo<00:04:42.010> and<00:04:42.930> he

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
out right here and go into Keldeo and he

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.900 
out right here and go into Keldeo and he
went<00:04:44.110> for<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.230> toxic<00:04:44.740> actually<00:04:45.160> predicting

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
went for the toxic actually predicting

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.340

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:06.439 
were both paralyzed so it doesn't really

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:07.989

I<00:07:08.179> think<00:07:08.989> you<00:07:09.169> predict<00:07:09.469> you<00:07:09.529> to<00:07:09.619> switch<00:07:09.889> into

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:10.099 
I think you predict you to switch into

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:13.719 
I think you predict you to switch into
my<00:07:10.489> um<00:07:11.409> me<00:07:12.409> and<00:07:12.439> chowder<00:07:12.739> and<00:07:13.099> I<00:07:13.159> think<00:07:13.669> you

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:13.729 
my um me and chowder and I think you

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.009 
my um me and chowder and I think you
went<00:07:13.879> for<00:07:13.969> the<00:07:14.059> hemp<00:07:14.239> our<00:07:14.389> second<00:07:14.749> because<00:07:14.869> it

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:15.019 
went for the hemp our second because it

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:16.299 
went for the hemp our second because it
wasn't<00:07:15.259> very<00:07:15.349> effective<00:07:15.619> against<00:07:15.889> Reggie<00:07:16.069> so

00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:16.309 
wasn't very effective against Reggie so

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:18.819 
wasn't very effective against Reggie so
so<00:07:16.599> I'm<00:07:17.599> not<00:07:17.749> sure<00:07:17.809> which<00:07:18.139> hidden<00:07:18.439> power<00:07:18.619> was

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:18.829 
so I'm not sure which hidden power was

00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:20.199 
so I'm not sure which hidden power was
whatever<00:07:19.129> it's<00:07:19.429> not<00:07:19.579> very<00:07:19.699> effective<00:07:19.909> Ian's

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:20.209 
whatever it's not very effective Ian's

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:21.749 
whatever it's not very effective Ian's
registeel<00:07:20.599> is<00:07:20.689> probably<00:07:20.929> what<00:07:21.049> it<00:07:21.079> was<00:07:21.169> so

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 
registeel is probably what it was so

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.479 
registeel is probably what it was so
good<00:07:22.759> times<00:07:23.029> now<00:07:23.719> I'm<00:07:24.259> taking<00:07:24.949> these<00:07:25.219> lenders

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:25.489 
good times now I'm taking these lenders

00:07:25.489 --> 00:07:28.719 
good times now I'm taking these lenders
like<00:07:25.729> a<00:07:25.789> beast<00:07:26.089> and<00:07:26.899> I<00:07:27.589> do<00:07:28.099> get<00:07:28.309> paralyzed

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:28.729 
like a beast and I do get paralyzed

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:29.949 
like a beast and I do get paralyzed
right<00:07:28.849> there<00:07:29.029> which<00:07:29.149> is<00:07:29.269> really<00:07:29.479> unfortunate

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:29.959 
right there which is really unfortunate

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:33.100 
right there which is really unfortunate
but<00:07:30.499> you<00:07:30.649> know<00:07:30.769> what<00:07:30.979> it<00:07:31.549> happens<00:07:32.389> he's<00:07:32.959> just

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.110 
but you know what it happens he's just

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.389 
but you know what it happens he's just
going<00:07:33.289> to<00:07:33.379> wear<00:07:33.439> himself<00:07:33.619> down<00:07:33.860> with<00:07:34.009> life<00:07:34.159> orb

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:34.399 
going to wear himself down with life orb

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:36.189 
going to wear himself down with life orb
so<00:07:34.579> I<00:07:34.610> guess<00:07:34.819> that's<00:07:34.939> pretty<00:07:35.149> cool<00:07:35.389> I<00:07:35.599> can't

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:36.199 
so I guess that's pretty cool I can't

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:37.419 
so I guess that's pretty cool I can't
believe<00:07:36.259> I<00:07:36.409> got<00:07:36.439> paralyzed<00:07:36.889> twice<00:07:37.129> in<00:07:37.279> a<00:07:37.309> row

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:37.429 
believe I got paralyzed twice in a row

00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:39.189 
believe I got paralyzed twice in a row
that's<00:07:37.519> pretty<00:07:37.789> BS<00:07:38.509> right<00:07:38.719> there<00:07:38.929> but<00:07:39.110> you

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 
that's pretty BS right there but you

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.619 
that's pretty BS right there but you
know<00:07:39.229> hacks<00:07:40.009> are<00:07:40.189> part<00:07:40.369> of<00:07:40.399> the<00:07:40.519> game<00:07:40.699> right<00:07:40.879> so

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:41.629
