00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.150
 what distinguishes today a 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.889
 aprilia of a motorcycle music young people 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.620
 on aprilia we are always on 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.230
 sports genes and we will not derogate from 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.810
 this rule the aprilia mark is 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.030
 the sporting and technological brand of the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.010
 group on motorcycle guzzi we are on some 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.140
 much wider thing is about 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.190
 something much more vintage 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.829
 for some models 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.929
 even if the new v7 engines proves 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.489
 well the new 750 engine proves well 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:37.719
 still this desire to invest and 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.730
 modernize the range 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.640
 then we are also on vehicles 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.920
 grand tourism tourism such as stelvio 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.929
 we are on big travelers like 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.749
 the norges and then we're on 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:53.079
 real roadster vehicles pleasure like 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:55.589
 the gray like the bellagio and and the 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.589
 range v 7 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.310
 can you tell us a little about projects 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.799
 who are in the boxes 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.420
 concerning aprilia moto midi then the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.990
 two projects that I can evoke 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.450
 clearly this is the new california 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.830
 at motorcycle guzzi so 14 centimeters 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.720
 cubes cooling air and will be launched 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.659
 at the end of 2012 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.600
 between October and November in two 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.420
 versions a custom version you 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.390
 have had already on your sites is also 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.240
 a streamlined version to find the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.530
 true Californian so launch late 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.759
 year 2012 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.610
 confirmed on aprilia the project two 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.009
 projects I can tell you about srv 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.319
 850 that you've already seen and that happens 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.700
 very soon in the network with 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:59.549
 the abs and traction control version and well 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.280
 heard of 2013 early in the year 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.100
 2013 the caponord so does with the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.020
 motor of the soft without dorsoduro but 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.660
 who want to a road trail 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.310
 sportsman and what are your ambitions in 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.129
 terms of market share in the future 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.590
 so today the aprilia group more 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.720
 motorcycle guzzi is about 3% share of 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.849
 market in the motorcycle market 125 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.610
 cc and mean 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.709
 we have 3000 vehicles for you 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.129
 give the progression on motorcycle buzet in 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.260
 2010 we sold 5,145 vehicles in 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.660
 2011 sold a thousand and forty two 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.150
 vehicles and our forecasts for this 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.280
 end of the year are around 1200 to 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.769
 1300 vehicles so a very beautiful 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.019
 growth of motorcycles museum a growth 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.880
 healthy that is really connected to the networks 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.250
 and products 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.070
 at aprilia we bet enormously 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.720
 this year on them on the shiver that 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.790
 we repositioned in terms 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.000
 tariffs and which should lead us to 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.660
 they alone 600 to 650 vehicles on 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.640
 this end of the year 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.740
 of course complete the range 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.010
 turn the range v four in all and 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.770
 our range 125 aprilia had these 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.770
 time a tariff policy enough 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.380
 aggressive rollback of shiver 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.150
 the price of hypersport that has been reviewed 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.800
 down 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.250
 it was related to difficulties of 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.560
 sale 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.980
 no it's completely voluntary it's 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.380
 we want to find a park circulating you 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.390
 have all seen that today the market of 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.950
 the bike being is a market 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.070
 particularly tense since it makes 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.300
 for two years at least 10% per year and 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.050
 that so to capture a new 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.350
 customer base 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.990
 we decided in a really thoughtful way 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.220
 and volunteer to have a policy 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.610
 particularly aggressive vis-Ã -vis 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.610
 our competitors 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.630
 we 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.170
 many motorcycle magazine readers get 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.330
 are complaining precisely of the sav of the 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.810
 mark of the 10/01 era what is it 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.340
 today 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.560
 so today we really 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.750
 oriented since the merger and piaggio on 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.379
 processes like one of piaggio's 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.459
 and in terms of pieces and sav 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.049
 today we are in a 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.349
 program that's called the program 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.690
 premium of qualifying the network 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.820
 in after-sales qualification that wants 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.850
 say at home mandatory training of 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.639
 technicians to all engines 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.240
 of the piaggio moto guzzi and aprilia group 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.430
 it also means outside these 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.380
 formations an equipment to have for 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.270
 to be able to maintain the different 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.340
 vehicles and that also means a 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.110
 complete overhaul of our logistics on 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.389
 spare parts what today 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.690
 on the service rate in terms of 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.139
 rooms 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:48.400
 we are at 90 7% service rate 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.150
 on a piaggio and 96% on aprilia and 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.680
 motorcycle guzzi 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.240
 what can you do 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.270
 today to reassure its customers 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.940
 who have been baffled in the past of 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.710
 come try our bikes to go in 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.840
 our network a network that has tremendously 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.630
 changed since at the network today the 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.789
 aprilia motorcycle music network this is a 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.080
 network which is also a very network 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.060
 noble since they work others 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.889
 premium motorcycle brands 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.210
 we can mention dealers who 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.710
 also do harley davidson 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.450
 we can mention dealers who 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.120
 do ducati we can mention 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:23.130
 dealers who make bmw or yamaha 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.130
 via differential structures
