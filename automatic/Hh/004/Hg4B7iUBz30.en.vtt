00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello friends with you a moment in this 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.460
 video I'll show you awesome 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.130
 a program that will allow us to build 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.490
 The inscriptions on the servers are probably many 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.039
 know when entering a server or on a spawn 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.630
 in the air or on some grief here 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.490
 there is an inscription 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.189
 that is, a link to the site to which 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.090
 this server or name is attached 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.340
 the server itself 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.320
 so now we don't just need 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.320
 build these inscriptions this program 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.260
 simplify the task to a minimum of us all 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.559
 only need to draw as well, or 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.309
 write print this inscription in the point 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.190
 make this picture without background and fill in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.620
 this program and she herself rasterized 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.510
 this image into cubes and decide from 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.969
 what cubes it should be built more precisely 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.379
 you can ask yourself and those cubes 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.199
 to use 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.820
 But let's take an example from 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.340
 I have this on my desktop 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.590
 picture and hello here I really donâ€™t 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.519
 completely removed the background here in letters 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.830
 there is a background here but it doesn't matter like this 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.500
 hurts her need to fill not as she 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.750
 test in 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.710
 discoveries we all opened here with us 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.320
 image quality is bad because i 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.140
 drew it in ponte well and not really 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.540
 very much I did it all but oh well you 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.780
 you will make of course more beautiful as you 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.049
 it is necessary all the same this test is now pressed 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.659
 create maykravt blueprint that is 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.700
 translate it to minecraft and here we are 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.159
 We immediately see that we have an image 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.259
 already consists of cubes here with us 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.430
 what cubes will be used are marked 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.840
 that is, snow forty three cubes and wool 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.070
 here are a couple of cubes 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.680
 oringzh in pink wool in general all and 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.680
 the program is rasterized it colors our 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.570
 inscription and decided what cubes you need 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.000
 use that is if here 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.850
 there was no background here would be emptiness and not 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.189
 would need to use a nickname 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.080
 save this image somewhere 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:12.650
 let's call it test 45 for example so 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.660
 save look test 45 approaching 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.700
 we see that we really have an inscription 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.480
 began to consist of minecraft cubicles 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.600
 and now to us make it in 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.110
 maykravt we need a program editor 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.640
 mc world dieter it is called there in general 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.190
 ordinary world editor 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.250
 there is a button to import which 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.910
 any file insert this file and 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.550
 This program already recognizes us 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.230
 an inscription from cubes and interposed and you there 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.330
 already insert it your discretion where 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.450
 walk that's all proper 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.600
 what about the program here there are options 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.860
 and here you can customize which items 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.560
 can be used 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.600
 oh wow you can even be here 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.840
 you can use the workbench here 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.459
 what to use and what items in 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.799
 In general, everything is simply available here. 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.640
 despite being English 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.310
 language 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.900
 and what are the friends on this all with you 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.900
 there was a moment of goodbye
