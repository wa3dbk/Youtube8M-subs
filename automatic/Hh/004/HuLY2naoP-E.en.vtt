shape and understanding that there's

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980 
shape and understanding that there's
another<00:01:38.280> form<00:01:38.640> i<00:01:38.850> decided<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.810> can

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
another form i decided that you can

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.020 
another form i decided that you can
actually<00:01:40.140> look<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.950> twist<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:41.909> the

actually look at it and twist it at the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.069 
actually look at it and twist it at the
same<00:01:42.270> time<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> understand<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.460> geo

same time and understand that it's a geo

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.560 
same time and understand that it's a geo
symmetric<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.240> then<00:01:48.240> he<00:01:48.450> went

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
symmetric like that and then he went

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.719 
symmetric like that and then he went
into<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.869> later<00:01:49.439> period<00:01:49.829> which<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.189> considered

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
into a later period which is considered

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.429 
into a later period which is considered
to<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:50.820> his<00:01:51.030> lazier<00:01:51.479> period<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.290> actually

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
to be his lazier period but is actually

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.330 
to be his lazier period but is actually
very<00:01:52.909> famous<00:01:54.380> he's<00:01:55.380> getting<00:01:55.710> more<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.100> depth

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340
