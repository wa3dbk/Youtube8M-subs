because along with the video quality the
audio<00:01:33.600> quality<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.990> also<00:01:34.170> enhanced<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
audio quality is also enhanced if you

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.039 
audio quality is also enhanced if you
switch<00:01:35.250> into<00:01:35.490> HD<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.479> ahead<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
switch into HD so go ahead and do that

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.050 
switch into HD so go ahead and do that
right<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.829> haven't<00:01:38.159> already<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
right now if you haven't already for the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.840 
right now if you haven't already for the
best<00:01:39.329> listening<00:01:39.900> quality<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.700> an

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
best listening quality so this is an

audio sample from the iPhone 4s is
built-in<00:01:44.399> microphone<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.240> hear<00:01:45.479> for

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
built-in microphone you can hear for

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.810 
built-in microphone you can hear for

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
give you guys a baseline audio sample so

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.539 
give you guys a baseline audio sample so
you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.780> compare<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> Ironman<00:01:52.799> casas<00:01:53.220> audio

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
you can compare the Ironman casas audio

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.819 
you can compare the Ironman casas audio
quality<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.479> what<00:01:55.409> you're<00:01:55.530> hearing<00:01:55.799> right

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
quality to it what you're hearing right

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.530 
quality to it what you're hearing right
now<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.130> an<00:01:56.340> audio<00:01:56.610> sample<00:01:57.030> from<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.360> Iron

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
now is an audio sample from the Iron

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.539 
now is an audio sample from the Iron
Mike<00:01:57.810> cast<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> game<00:01:58.710> switch<00:01:59.009> turned<00:01:59.340> on

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
Mike cast with the game switch turned on

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.749 
Mike cast with the game switch turned on
high<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:01.020> means<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.009> higher<00:02:02.399> in

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
high and this means that it is higher in

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.459 
high and this means that it is higher in
terms<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> sensitivity<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> sound

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
terms of the sensitivity to the sound

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.130 
terms of the sensitivity to the sound
that<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.829> around<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.640> microphone<00:02:06.119> itself<00:02:06.479> so

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
that is around the microphone itself so

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.570 
that is around the microphone itself so
this<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.439> more<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.770> ideal<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.399> situations

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
this is more so ideal for situations

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.699 
this is more so ideal for situations
where<00:02:09.119> your<00:02:09.270> subject<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.869> either<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> lot

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
where your subject is either or a lot

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.140 
where your subject is either or a lot
farther<00:02:11.039> away<00:02:11.190> from<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> microphone<00:02:11.910> than

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
farther away from the microphone than

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.700 
farther away from the microphone than
you<00:02:12.239> would<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.510> them<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.959> or<00:02:13.140> if

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
you would like them to be or if

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.350 
you would like them to be or if
the<00:02:13.770> sound<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> lot<00:02:14.430> quieter<00:02:14.760> than<00:02:15.060> what<00:02:15.270> you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
the sound is a lot quieter than what you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.060 
the sound is a lot quieter than what you
would<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.630> it<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.870> be<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.830> what<00:02:16.950> you're

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
would like it to be so what you're

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.400 
would like it to be so what you're
hearing<00:02:17.100> right<00:02:17.460> now<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:18.180> audio<00:02:18.600> sample<00:02:19.110> from

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
hearing right now is a audio sample from

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.560 
hearing right now is a audio sample from
the<00:02:19.680> Iron<00:02:20.040> Mike<00:02:20.490> cast<00:02:20.820> with<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.060> gain<00:02:21.420> switch

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
the Iron Mike cast with the gain switch

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.690 
the Iron Mike cast with the gain switch
turn<00:02:21.990> on<00:02:22.260> low<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.830> you'll<00:02:23.190> notice<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.520> my

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
turn on low and you'll notice that my

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.340 
turn on low and you'll notice that my
voice<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.120> lot<00:02:24.300> quieter<00:02:24.600> even<00:02:25.170> though<00:02:25.260> I'm

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
voice is a lot quieter even though I'm

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.110 
voice is a lot quieter even though I'm
the<00:02:25.380> same<00:02:25.740> distance<00:02:26.100> away<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.700> that's

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the same distance away and that's

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.700 
the same distance away and that's
because<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> microphone<00:02:27.960> capsule<00:02:28.380> on<00:02:28.470> side

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
because the microphone capsule on side

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.830 
because the microphone capsule on side
is<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.950> lot<00:02:29.220> less<00:02:29.550> sensitive<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.210> sound<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.600> is

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
is a lot less sensitive to sound that is

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.410 
is a lot less sensitive to sound that is
being<00:02:31.230> recorded<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.850> ideal<00:02:33.360> for

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
being recorded and this is ideal for

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.780 
being recorded and this is ideal for
situations<00:02:33.810> where<00:02:34.380> sound<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:35.070> either<00:02:35.340> very

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
situations where sound is either very

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.490 
situations where sound is either very
close<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.480> microphone<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.080> therefore

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
close to the microphone and therefore

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.550 
close to the microphone and therefore
very<00:02:37.740> loud<00:02:38.480> overall<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.690> argument<00:02:40.110> cast<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.440> a

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
very loud overall the argument cast is a

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.350 
very loud overall the argument cast is a
pretty<00:02:40.800> great<00:02:40.980> product<00:02:41.490> though<00:02:41.910> it's<00:02:42.060> not<00:02:42.150> for

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
pretty great product though it's not for

pretty great product though it's not for

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
of $39.99 it can be a little bit out of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.330 
of $39.99 it can be a little bit out of
budget<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:51.900> some<00:02:52.230> but<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> good<00:02:52.890> buy<00:02:53.040> for
