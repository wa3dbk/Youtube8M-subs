00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:10.939 
yeah reconfigure my setup and my room so
it<00:05:09.690> can<00:05:09.840> you<00:05:10.139> look<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.470> bit<00:05:10.500> better<00:05:10.800> because

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
it can you look a bit better because

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.580 
it can you look a bit better because
everything<00:05:11.400> is<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.550> bit<00:05:11.759> not<00:05:12.690> not<00:05:13.320> suitable

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
everything is a bit not not suitable

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.499 
everything is a bit not not suitable
enough<00:05:14.009> to<00:05:14.310> record<00:05:14.639> yeah<00:05:15.150> there's<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.360> lot<00:05:15.479> of

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
enough to record yeah there's a lot of

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.360 
enough to record yeah there's a lot of
stuff<00:05:15.750> behind<00:05:15.930> me<00:05:16.289> when<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:16.470> do<00:05:16.590> face<00:05:16.889> cam<00:05:17.190> and

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
stuff behind me when I do face cam and

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.249 
stuff behind me when I do face cam and
stuff<00:05:17.580> so<00:05:17.849> might<00:05:18.330> get<00:05:18.479> a<00:05:18.509> better<00:05:18.690> camera<00:05:18.990> but

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
stuff so might get a better camera but

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:20.450 
stuff so might get a better camera but
probably<00:05:19.500> have<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:19.710> wait<00:05:19.830> to<00:05:19.979> a<00:05:20.009> couple<00:05:20.340> of

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
probably have to wait to a couple of

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.420 
probably have to wait to a couple of
months<00:05:20.580> after<00:05:21.060> FIFA<00:05:21.300> 16<00:05:21.419> money<00:05:22.410> wise<00:05:22.650> but<00:05:23.310> I've
