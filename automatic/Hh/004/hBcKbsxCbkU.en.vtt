00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.609 
always holds it just think he looks a
lot<00:01:38.820> better<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.270> way<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
lot better that way but I do like the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.469 
lot better that way but I do like the
knife<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.920> he<00:01:41.009> comes<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.340> comes<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.329> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
knife that he comes with comes with a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.260 
knife that he comes with comes with a
joker<00:01:42.899> card<00:01:43.340> it's<00:01:44.340> nothing<00:01:44.579> too<00:01:44.670> special<00:01:44.880> it's

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
joker card it's nothing too special it's

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.350 
joker card it's nothing too special it's
just<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.470> know<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> card<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.939> has<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
just a you know like a card that has a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.420 
just a you know like a card that has a
little<00:01:48.659> Joker<00:01:48.960> symbol<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.590> nothing<00:01:50.280> not

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
little Joker symbol on it nothing not

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.830 
little Joker symbol on it nothing not
too<00:01:50.640> great<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.329> pretty<00:01:51.479> cool<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.720> like

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
too great but it is pretty cool I like

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.190 
too great but it is pretty cool I like
it

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.310 
it
and<00:01:52.939> yeah<00:01:53.939> here<00:01:54.869> he<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.110> compared<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.820> Batman

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
and yeah here he is compared to Batman

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.289 
and yeah here he is compared to Batman
as<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.710> see<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.100> pretty<00:01:59.670> good<00:01:59.850> scale<00:02:00.090> I

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
as you can see here pretty good scale I

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.230 
as you can see here pretty good scale I
think<00:02:00.329> that's<00:02:00.659> actually<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.649> nice

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
think that's actually like really nice

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.940 
think that's actually like really nice
Joker<00:02:03.240> should<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.049> tad<00:02:04.350> bit<00:02:04.409> smaller

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
Joker should be just a tad bit smaller

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.800 
Joker should be just a tad bit smaller
than<00:02:05.189> Batman<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:05.969> exactly<00:02:06.270> how<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.689> is

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
than Batman and that's exactly how it is

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.109 
than Batman and that's exactly how it is
I<00:02:07.079> think<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.619> not<00:02:07.710> perfect<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.819> here

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
I think that it's not perfect and here

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
I think that it's not perfect and here
he<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.270> compared<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.470> other<00:02:10.709> joke

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
he is compared to the other joke

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.990 
he is compared to the other joke

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.979 
this one looks like a cartoon this one
actually<00:02:53.820> looks<00:02:54.090> like<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.420> movie<00:02:54.690> with<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
actually looks like the movie with the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.910 
actually looks like the movie with the
when<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.200> comes<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.560> Facebook<00:02:56.010> which<00:02:56.610> yeah

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
when it comes to the Facebook which yeah

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.440 
when it comes to the Facebook which yeah
but<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.100> one<00:02:59.250> thing<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.550> if<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.910> don't<00:03:00.209> have

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
but the one thing is if you don't have

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.880 
but the one thing is if you don't have
this<00:03:00.600> guy<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.170> have<00:03:01.350> him<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.680> really

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
this guy and you have him you really

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.070 
this guy and you have him you really
don't<00:03:02.100> notice<00:03:02.370> how<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.910> face<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.510> way

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
don't notice how the face is just way

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.800 
don't notice how the face is just way
not<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:05.070> great<00:03:05.370> it's<00:03:06.060> when<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.600> bed

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
not to great it's when you have this bed

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.780 
not to great it's when you have this bed
next<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.140> him<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.980> really<00:03:08.280> see<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.520> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
next to him that you really see that the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.510 
next to him that you really see that the
face<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.270> just<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.660> little<00:03:09.900> goofy<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.920> for<00:03:11.370> him

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
face is just a little goofy for for him

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.850 
face is just a little goofy for for him

but yeah so overall I think it's a very
nice<00:03:14.070> figure<00:03:14.250> out<00:03:14.520> definitely<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.090> worthy
