00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.550 
rod it kind of reminds me of the Tuscan
that<00:05:23.820> I<00:05:23.850> used<00:05:24.090> to<00:05:24.240> braise<00:05:24.450> to<00:05:24.660> be<00:05:24.750> honest<00:05:25.020> in

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
that I used to braise to be honest in

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.330 
that I used to braise to be honest in
that

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
that

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.050 
that
you<00:05:27.730> can<00:05:27.910> just<00:05:28.060> do<00:05:28.720> that<00:05:28.750> sort<00:05:29.290> of<00:05:29.410> big<00:05:29.710> inning

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.070 

all<00:05:33.020> day<00:05:33.470> long<00:05:33.500> if<00:05:33.889> you<00:05:34.010> want<00:05:34.190> to<00:05:34.750> it's<00:05:35.750> nicely

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
all day long if you want to it's nicely

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.740 
all day long if you want to it's nicely
balanced

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
balanced

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.050 
balanced
but<00:05:38.710> you<00:05:38.830> get<00:05:38.950> this<00:05:39.100> lovely<00:05:39.340> impression<00:05:40.030> that

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
but you get this lovely impression that

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.300 
but you get this lovely impression that
there's<00:05:40.360> just<00:05:41.170> a<00:05:41.350> little<00:05:41.560> bit<00:05:41.680> of<00:05:41.770> a<00:05:41.830> surfeit

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
there's just a little bit of a surfeit

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.910 
there's just a little bit of a surfeit
of<00:05:42.460> power<00:05:42.790> over<00:05:43.120> traction<00:05:43.810> and<00:05:43.990> grip<00:05:44.050> and<00:05:44.560> I

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
of power over traction and grip and I

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.240 
of power over traction and grip and I
love<00:05:45.160> that<00:05:46.020> okay<00:05:47.020> you<00:05:47.470> can<00:05:47.680> turn<00:05:47.920> all<00:05:48.100> the

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
love that okay you can turn all the

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.060 
love that okay you can turn all the
systems<00:05:48.670> back<00:05:48.880> on<00:05:49.120> and<00:05:49.470> there's<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.560> track<00:05:50.830> mode

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
systems back on and there's a track mode

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.600 
systems back on and there's a track mode
in<00:05:51.370> which<00:05:51.520> it's<00:05:51.970> very<00:05:52.120> well<00:05:52.510> behaved<00:05:52.900> and<00:05:53.860> you

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
in which it's very well behaved and you

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.310 
in which it's very well behaved and you
can<00:05:54.760> dial<00:05:55.000> the<00:05:55.120> response<00:05:55.540> to<00:05:55.660> the<00:05:55.750> engine<00:05:56.080> down

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
can dial the response to the engine down

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.220 
can dial the response to the engine down
which<00:05:57.070> is<00:05:57.250> good<00:05:57.460> because<00:05:57.730> sometimes<00:05:58.690> the

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
which is good because sometimes the

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.900 
which is good because sometimes the
throttle<00:05:59.590> response<00:05:59.650> can<00:06:00.220> feel<00:06:00.430> a<00:06:00.460> little<00:06:00.670> bit

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
throttle response can feel a little bit

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.080 
throttle response can feel a little bit
too<00:06:01.150> pokey<00:06:01.600> for<00:06:01.780> its<00:06:01.900> own<00:06:02.050> good<00:06:02.940> but<00:06:03.940> now<00:06:04.060> I

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
too pokey for its own good but now I

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.550 
too pokey for its own good but now I
really<00:06:04.510> like<00:06:04.690> driving<00:06:05.110> this<00:06:05.200> thing<00:06:05.260> on<00:06:05.500> a

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
really like driving this thing on a

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.930 
really like driving this thing on a
track<00:06:05.830> it's<00:06:06.310> fast<00:06:06.960> it's<00:06:08.310> slightly<00:06:09.310> unhinged

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
track it's fast it's slightly unhinged

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.670 
track it's fast it's slightly unhinged
in<00:06:10.390> a<00:06:10.480> really<00:06:10.870> appealing<00:06:11.260> kind<00:06:11.710> of<00:06:11.830> way

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
in a really appealing kind of way

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.480 
in a really appealing kind of way
the<00:06:14.680> gearbox<00:06:14.919> works<00:06:15.430> really<00:06:15.700> well<00:06:17.160> the<00:06:18.160> brakes

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
the gearbox works really well the brakes

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.430 
the gearbox works really well the brakes
also<00:06:19.270> don't<00:06:19.510> appear<00:06:19.840> to<00:06:19.900> have<00:06:19.990> run<00:06:20.260> out<00:06:20.290> of

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
also don't appear to have run out of

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.250 
also don't appear to have run out of
path<00:06:20.770> which<00:06:23.310> great<00:06:24.310> join<00:06:24.550> us<00:06:24.870> for<00:06:25.870> this<00:06:26.020> one

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
path which great join us for this one

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260 
path which great join us for this one
because<00:06:26.770> it's<00:06:26.919> aluminium<00:06:27.490> of<00:06:27.610> course<00:06:27.880> weighs

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
because it's aluminium of course weighs

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:37.040 
because it's aluminium of course weighs
that<00:06:28.540> much<00:06:28.600> less

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.850 

how<00:06:37.620> can<00:06:37.860> you<00:06:37.979> know<00:06:38.159> like<00:06:38.460> that

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.800

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.100 
the f-type what do we think of it I love
it<00:06:46.840> I<00:06:47.170> really<00:06:48.130> do<00:06:48.670> love<00:06:48.880> it

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
just just believe me this car goes way

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.360 
just just believe me this car goes way
beyond<00:06:58.930> that<00:06:59.170> anything<00:06:59.440> dragon<00:06:59.950> was<00:07:00.070> done<00:07:00.250> in

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
beyond that anything dragon was done in

beyond that anything dragon was done in
the<00:07:00.460> past<00:07:00.640> it<00:07:01.330> feels<00:07:01.660> like<00:07:01.930> a<00:07:01.960> properly

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
the past it feels like a properly

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.580 
the past it feels like a properly
focused<00:07:03.570> really<00:07:04.570> really<00:07:05.200> well<00:07:05.410> engineered

sports<00:07:06.280> car<00:07:06.720> this<00:07:07.720> car<00:07:07.780> can<00:07:08.440> hold<00:07:08.590> its<00:07:08.860> head

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
sports car this car can hold its head

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.180 
sports car this car can hold its head
high<00:07:09.790> next<00:07:10.450> to<00:07:10.540> the<00:07:10.630> best<00:07:10.930> sports<00:07:11.230> cars<00:07:11.590> in<00:07:11.920> the
