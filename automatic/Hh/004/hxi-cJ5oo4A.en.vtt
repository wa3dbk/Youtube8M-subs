00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
will actually take the head and deep-fry

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.490 
will actually take the head and deep-fry
them<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.459> use<00:02:07.819> it<00:02:07.970> as<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.090> presentation<00:02:08.600> that's

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
them and use it as a presentation that's

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.350 
them and use it as a presentation that's
like<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.920> old<00:02:10.039> school<00:02:10.369> but<00:02:10.910> there's<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.240> much

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
like the old school but there's so much

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.760 
like the old school but there's so much
flavor<00:02:11.720> going<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:12.170> there<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:12.440> don't<00:02:12.470> want<00:02:12.620> to

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
flavor going on there you don't want to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.410 
flavor going on there you don't want to
use<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.100> don't<00:02:13.340> want<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.520> waste<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.060> I'm

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
use it you don't want to waste it so I'm

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.300 
use it you don't want to waste it so I'm
gonna<00:02:14.569> change<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.170> way<00:02:15.319> of<00:02:15.500> thinking<00:02:16.160> that

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
gonna change that way of thinking that

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.199 
gonna change that way of thinking that
way<00:02:17.170> so<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.350> is<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.590> way<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.430> fill<00:02:19.610> 8<00:02:19.760> 2

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
way so this is a way that you fill 8 2

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.840 
way so this is a way that you fill 8 2
ways<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:21.319> at<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> same<00:02:21.709> time<00:02:21.950> but<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:22.670> you

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
ways but at the same time but that you

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.180 
ways but at the same time but that you
have<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.209> fill<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.420> is<00:02:23.600> going<00:02:23.840> back-to-back

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
have to fill that is going back-to-back

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.290 
have to fill that is going back-to-back

when you cut the fish you got to fill

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.600 
when you cut the fish you got to fill
