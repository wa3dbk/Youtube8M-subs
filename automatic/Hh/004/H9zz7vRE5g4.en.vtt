00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:12.200
 This time, let's look at character animations that Casser used. 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:15.740
 The process is as follows: Learn how to set up a new calendar view 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.180
 Let me introduce you how to create animation using the motion layer. 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.750
 I'll do it 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:26.289
 Let's take a closer look at the scenes that will be ready. 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:32.619
 There are a lot of characters ready for the scene. 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:37.390
 The filters developed here by Subatomic Corp. 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:41.320
 I can see that it's been talked about and animated in Cassha Rings 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:46.780
 Gonna have to learn once the cow character from Sy 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:52.540
 When choosing a cap parent of the current Kaunas character Gonzo bit unit 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.970
 Even if you adjust it, you can find or enlarge it so that the skimming value increases or hurts. 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.360
 You can see the value 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:03.339
 But in the new k-league system 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:09.040
 Let the kids use him to find a new node 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:13.090
 This may give as addition and or using the kids while you're here, the cow 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:19.810
 The seeds can deohaejul by selecting the mesh 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:22.049
 Add this and save it as a cow rg3 file by pressing the Save button . 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.049
 When 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:31.549
 From now on, 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:38.860
 You can see that the skimming value is applied without any breaks 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:44.890
 In particular , using the search mode provided from the max 2014 version 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:47.980
 You have quick access to the cam command and the league stored here 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.290
 You can make it fast 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:56.830
 I do not care if you reduce the size in this way . 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:02.140
 You can create a motion layer directly in the panel 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:06.430
 To give the play can be seen that so animated 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.900
 I have this cow character ready now 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.900
 Let's create an animation. 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.970
 With sweat isolation mode on 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.950
 I'm the one applied to the current motion rail just before play haebomyeon 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:28.320
 This is the same as that play animation when applying ah 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.970
 You can see that you applied Phuket Ocean layers in here 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.960
 The editor 10 9 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:39.000
 I'm not one to modify the Ocean's picks have a global value 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:43.380
 We will play Stepping 25 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.060
 When I thought I had too much to do 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:51.870
 122, or you can reduce the extent jugido 140 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.640
 And it came into kbs trees in Chapelle-bis 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.750
 Gut him a little lower position values give the value x 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.920
 I can see that it is aligned like this, 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.690
 It is. 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:11.600
 Then in the case of a foot 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:15.170
 Now look at the location at the foot ah suck the hind pair of left and right about now, 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.140
 You can see these movements , 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:24.170
 You can change the attractiveness 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:26.830
 If you change your mind like this , your feet will move in a sequential manner 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.830
 You can check 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:37.120
 Homes do not work out a little more. 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:43.150
 You can see that the tail is moving stiff 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:46.780
 You can change the twist roll pitch value by entering the tail . 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:54.400
 I change a point to a cycle. 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:56.440
 The next time you get a little more up your skill, here's the tail, 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.340
 You can see the rotation 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.360
 I carpet the value of the trunk here 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.150
 I will also sing best dresser 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.380
 Deoni played the role values apply to rules 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.220
 But not much help in this look at the top are so many moving 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.220
 I can see that. 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:23.510
 If you give more sk values, you can see more moving values 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:28.820
 Now, you set it up. 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:31.130
 In this state earlier this so the flap is a type Te Rennes Images 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.060
 In order to make light value 4 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:38.120
 Oh, you can just put the copied value in it. The groom started. 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.920
 To give more to the clerk, 4 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:48.290
 If you adjust the scale value, you may be making a lot of leaps. 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:53.540
 So if you use the motion layer in that case, 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:58.690
 Whether you are an anime character or an anime character in making a game 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:03.260
 Or you can make it very easy, 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:06.410
 In the case of such secondary motions, 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:13.000
 You can easily make it. 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.000
 So far, I have studied about character animations using casts.
