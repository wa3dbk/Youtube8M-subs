ER and you're thinking okay well maybe I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
ER and you're thinking okay well maybe I
know<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.750> pattern<00:01:34.320> should<00:01:34.620> have<00:01:34.920> more<00:01:35.130> color

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
know that pattern should have more color

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.680 
know that pattern should have more color
in<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.630> I'm<00:01:36.930> gonna<00:01:37.110> go<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.940> select<00:01:38.940> my<00:01:39.240> edit

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
in it so I'm gonna go and select my edit

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.710 
in it so I'm gonna go and select my edit
texture<00:01:40.320> tool<00:01:40.760> and<00:01:41.760> I'm<00:01:41.910> gonna<00:01:42.030> click<00:01:42.300> once

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
texture tool and I'm gonna click once

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.760 
texture tool and I'm gonna click once
and<00:01:43.820> you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.940> see<00:01:45.150> exactly<00:01:45.540> how<00:01:45.900> large<00:01:46.260> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and you can see exactly how large the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.730 
and you can see exactly how large the
texture<00:01:47.580> is<00:01:47.760> I'm<00:01:48.360> gonna<00:01:48.480> zoom<00:01:48.690> out<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:48.900> so

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
texture is I'm gonna zoom out here so

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.720 
texture is I'm gonna zoom out here so
this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.190> full<00:01:50.460> 400<00:01:51.330> by<00:01:51.420> 400<00:01:51.750> extra<00:01:52.730> I'm

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
this is the full 400 by 400 extra I'm

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.690 
this is the full 400 by 400 extra I'm
gonna<00:01:53.970> hold<00:01:54.090> down<00:01:54.180> my<00:01:54.300> shift<00:01:54.420> key<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.700> just

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
gonna hold down my shift key and just

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.200 
gonna hold down my shift key and just
scale<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.450> down<00:01:57.510> and<00:01:57.960> if<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:58.950> note<00:01:59.220> we<00:02:00.150> can

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
scale this down and if you note we can

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.490 
scale this down and if you note we can
start<00:02:00.510> seeing<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:00.960> more<00:02:01.170> color<00:02:01.380> here

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
start seeing a little more color here

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.950 
start seeing a little more color here
I'm<00:02:02.220> gonna<00:02:02.340> keep<00:02:02.580> scaling

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
I'm gonna keep scaling

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.290 
I'm gonna keep scaling
and<00:02:04.050> now<00:02:05.010> we<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.340> see<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> full<00:02:05.940> pattern

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
and now we can see the full pattern

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.690 
and now we can see the full pattern
what's<00:02:06.810> happening<00:02:07.290> now<00:02:08.039> if<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.250> want<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.490> move

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
what's happening now if I want to move

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.690 
what's happening now if I want to move
this<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.440> simply<00:02:10.619> move<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.490> pattern

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
this I can just simply move the pattern

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.470 
this I can just simply move the pattern
around

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
around

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.240 
around
and<00:02:13.599> I<00:02:14.140> think<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.560> way<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.680> slide<00:02:15.069> that

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
and I think the way that slide that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.550 
and I think the way that slide that
looks<00:02:15.400> pretty<00:02:15.640> good<00:02:15.790> right<00:02:15.849> there<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.560> now

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
looks pretty good right there and now

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.040 
looks pretty good right there and now
I'm<00:02:17.920> going<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.220> go<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.730> second<00:02:19.720> picture<00:02:19.900> we

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
I'm going to go to the second picture we

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.479 
I'm going to go to the second picture we
did<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:20.680> going<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.040> scale<00:02:21.280> this

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
did here and I'm going to scale this

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.400 
did here and I'm going to scale this
down<00:02:21.550> as<00:02:21.910> well<00:02:22.120> until<00:02:23.220> they<00:02:24.220> about<00:02:24.520> match<00:02:24.819> and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
down as well until they about match and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.979 
down as well until they about match and
I'll<00:02:26.410> move<00:02:26.739> this<00:02:27.160> not<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.450> much<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.810> it's

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
I'll move this not so much that it's

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.320 
I'll move this not so much that it's
matching<00:02:29.440> because<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.220> shirt<00:02:31.150> that's

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
matching because it is a shirt that's

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.699 
matching because it is a shirt that's
not<00:02:31.540> going<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.750> match<00:02:31.870> perfectly<00:02:32.440> but<00:02:32.620> it's

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
not going to match perfectly but it's

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.280 
not going to match perfectly but it's
going<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.920> be<00:02:32.980> crying<00:02:33.250> too<00:02:33.430> close<00:02:34.230> all<00:02:35.230> right

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
going to be crying too close all right

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.830 
going to be crying too close all right
and<00:02:35.770> I'm<00:02:36.130> going<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.430> click<00:02:36.670> right<00:02:36.880> down<00:02:36.910> in<00:02:37.450> my

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
and I'm going to click right down in my

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.570 
and I'm going to click right down in my
timeline<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.709> this<00:02:38.770> little<00:02:38.890> blank<00:02:39.220> area

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
timeline just in this little blank area

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.070 
timeline just in this little blank area
to<00:02:39.700> get<00:02:39.819> that<00:02:39.970> little<00:02:40.150> orange<00:02:40.630> highlight<00:02:40.959> to

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
to get that little orange highlight to

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.830 
to get that little orange highlight to
go<00:02:41.230> away<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:41.560> want<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.370> zoom<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.360> click<00:02:43.390> once

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
go away I want to zoom in and click once

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
go away I want to zoom in and click once
here<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.200> my<00:02:45.130> camera<00:02:45.459> view<00:02:45.670> let's<00:02:45.940> zoom<00:02:46.209> in<00:02:46.860> all

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
here in my camera view let's zoom in all

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.670 
here in my camera view let's zoom in all
right<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.250> that's<00:02:48.790> not<00:02:49.060> bad<00:02:49.480> except<00:02:50.260> for<00:02:50.290> one

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
right and that's not bad except for one

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.590 
right and that's not bad except for one
thing<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.069> think<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.549> pattern<00:02:51.940> we<00:02:52.090> have<00:02:52.330> here

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
thing I think the pattern we have here

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.660 
thing I think the pattern we have here
is<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.690> little<00:02:53.019> overpowering<00:02:53.430> with<00:02:54.430> our

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
is a little overpowering with our

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.539 
is a little overpowering with our
outline<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:56.200> because<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.739> seems<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.130> little<00:02:57.310> bit

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
outline so because it seems a little bit

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.750 
outline so because it seems a little bit
dark<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.209> have<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.959> second<00:02:59.530> pattern<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.640> the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
dark I have a second pattern that is the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.330 
dark I have a second pattern that is the
exact<00:03:01.239> same<00:03:01.630> plaid<00:03:02.110> but<00:03:02.799> it's<00:03:02.950> just<00:03:03.130> using

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
exact same plaid but it's just using

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.940 
exact same plaid but it's just using
lighter<00:03:03.730> colors<00:03:04.239> so<00:03:05.110> I'm<00:03:05.200> going<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.440> come<00:03:05.590> here

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
lighter colors so I'm going to come here

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.980 
lighter colors so I'm going to come here
and<00:03:06.100> simply<00:03:06.880> double<00:03:07.239> click

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
and simply double click

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.560 
and simply double click
and<00:03:09.110> we<00:03:09.560> have<00:03:09.680> our<00:03:09.860> information<00:03:10.010> set<00:03:10.880> up<00:03:11.000> here

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
and we have our information set up here

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.360 
and we have our information set up here
and<00:03:11.810> what<00:03:12.380> I'm<00:03:12.440> going<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.590> do<00:03:12.710> is<00:03:12.860> go<00:03:13.190> ahead<00:03:13.250> and

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
and what I'm going to do is go ahead and

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.180 
and what I'm going to do is go ahead and
browse<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.360> this<00:03:15.200> time<00:03:15.470> I'm<00:03:15.770> gonna<00:03:15.920> select

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
browse and this time I'm gonna select

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.630 
browse and this time I'm gonna select
the<00:03:16.580> light<00:03:17.330> plaid<00:03:17.780> texture<00:03:18.320> I'll<00:03:19.250> click<00:03:19.460> open

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
the light plaid texture I'll click open

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.900 
the light plaid texture I'll click open
and<00:03:19.880> then<00:03:19.970> I'll<00:03:20.780> click<00:03:20.960> OK<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.370> it's<00:03:22.700> now

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
and then I'll click OK and so it's now

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.290 
and then I'll click OK and so it's now
updated<00:03:23.780> with<00:03:24.470> our<00:03:24.860> lighter<00:03:25.160> plaid<00:03:25.490> so<00:03:26.120> it's

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
updated with our lighter plaid so it's

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.640 
updated with our lighter plaid so it's
just<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.570> same<00:03:26.810> color<00:03:27.080> so<00:03:27.290> it's<00:03:27.380> just<00:03:27.470> a

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
just the same color so it's just a

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.070 
just the same color so it's just a
little<00:03:27.890> more<00:03:28.040> frosted<00:03:28.640> out<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.150> our<00:03:29.420> outline

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
little more frosted out so our outline

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.590 
little more frosted out so our outline
still<00:03:30.650> works<00:03:31.060> now<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.120> might<00:03:32.450> be<00:03:32.480> thinking

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
still works now you might be thinking

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.510 
still works now you might be thinking
this<00:03:32.990> is<00:03:33.230> all<00:03:33.380> what<00:03:33.560> I'm<00:03:33.680> good<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.130> know<00:03:34.160> but

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
this is all what I'm good you know but

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.480 
this is all what I'm good you know but
usually<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.870> sleeves<00:03:36.590> look<00:03:36.860> a<00:03:36.980> little<00:03:37.250> bit

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
usually the sleeves look a little bit

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.040 
usually the sleeves look a little bit
different<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.060> shouldn't<00:03:38.330> be<00:03:38.390> flat<00:03:38.780> just

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
different so it shouldn't be flat just

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.830 
different so it shouldn't be flat just
across<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:40.190> what<00:03:40.400> I<00:03:40.460> want<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:40.640> do<00:03:40.760> now<00:03:40.970> I'm

by adding texture we've pushed the

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.700 
by adding texture we've pushed the
envelope<00:04:59.560> as<00:05:00.220> far<00:05:00.250> as<00:05:00.850> just<00:05:01.660> the<00:05:01.780> old<00:05:01.930> humdrum

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
altered how that's done so it doesn't

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.020

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.250 
texture you're going to call this simply
Lite<00:05:24.430> plat<00:05:24.910> because<00:05:25.420> that's<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:25.900> color<00:05:26.080> we

so<00:05:39.760> I<00:05:39.790> can<00:05:40.060> simply<00:05:40.810> click<00:05:41.110> on<00:05:41.350> tile<00:05:42.160> and<00:05:42.760> I'm

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
so I can simply click on tile and I'm

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.860 
so I can simply click on tile and I'm
gonna<00:05:43.570> click<00:05:43.810> OK<00:05:44.170> and<00:05:45.060> almost<00:05:46.060> an<00:05:46.180> it<00:05:46.330> appears
