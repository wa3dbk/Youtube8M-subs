to go free one and if I come out free
one<00:00:28.160> could<00:00:28.489> be<00:00:28.579> a<00:00:28.640> different<00:00:28.970> game<00:00:29.119> obviously

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
one could be a different game obviously

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.940 
one could be a different game obviously
by<00:00:29.840> winning<00:00:30.169> the<00:00:30.230> net<00:00:30.380> frame<00:00:30.590> after<00:00:30.739> the

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
by winning the net frame after the

interval but all credit to Ronnie
obviously<00:00:33.920> played<00:00:34.220> far<00:00:34.700> better<00:00:34.880> than<00:00:34.940> me<00:00:35.149> and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
obviously played far better than me and

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.750 
obviously played far better than me and
deserve<00:00:35.540> to<00:00:35.690> win<00:00:35.860> what's<00:00:36.860> your<00:00:37.040> mindset<00:00:37.460> when

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
deserve to win what's your mindset when

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.220 
deserve to win what's your mindset when
you're<00:00:37.880> coming<00:00:38.300> into<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:38.600> evening<00:00:38.780> session

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
you're coming into the evening session

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.639 
you're coming into the evening session
71<00:00:40.160> down<00:00:40.430> is<00:00:40.609> it<00:00:40.730> is<00:00:40.850> it<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.090> case<00:00:41.300> of<00:00:41.649> genuinely

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
71 down is it is it a case of genuinely

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.349 
71 down is it is it a case of genuinely
believing<00:00:43.190> you<00:00:43.309> can<00:00:43.489> still<00:00:43.760> turn<00:00:43.969> it<00:00:44.180> round

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
believing you can still turn it round

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:45.819 
believing you can still turn it round
because<00:00:44.629> you<00:00:44.809> have<00:00:45.199> got<00:00:45.379> a<00:00:45.410> habit<00:00:45.710> of

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
because you have got a habit of

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.650 
because you have got a habit of
comebacks<00:00:46.550> or<00:00:46.699> is<00:00:46.820> it<00:00:46.969> more<00:00:47.120> a<00:00:47.179> case<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.480> just

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
comebacks or is it more a case of just

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.240 
comebacks or is it more a case of just
putting<00:00:47.899> some<00:00:48.019> respectability<00:00:48.620> on<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:48.949> school

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
putting some respectability on a school

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.880 
putting some respectability on a school
like<00:00:49.399> a<00:00:49.609> little<00:00:50.090> bit<00:00:50.179> of<00:00:50.210> both<00:00:50.390> really<00:00:50.809> I<00:00:51.140> never

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
like a little bit of both really I never

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.319 
like a little bit of both really I never
believed<00:00:52.190> that<00:00:52.309> I've<00:00:52.429> lost<00:00:52.609> until<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.030> final

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
believed that I've lost until the final

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.689 
believed that I've lost until the final
balls<00:00:53.480> potted<00:00:53.929> so<00:00:54.589> I<00:00:54.620> wasn't<00:00:55.219> going<00:00:55.399> out<00:00:55.519> there

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
balls potted so I wasn't going out there

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.610 
balls potted so I wasn't going out there
thinking<00:00:55.969> that's<00:00:56.149> it<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.359> match<00:00:56.510> is<00:00:56.660> over<00:00:56.809> but

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
thinking that's it the match is over but

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.959 
thinking that's it the match is over but
at<00:00:57.679> the<00:00:57.769> same<00:00:57.949> time<00:00:58.160> obviously<00:00:58.399> I<00:00:58.670> knew<00:00:58.789> in<00:00:58.879> the

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
at the same time obviously I knew in the

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.520 
at the same time obviously I knew in the
back<00:00:58.999> of<00:00:59.149> my<00:00:59.269> mind<00:00:59.449> I<00:00:59.629> was<00:00:59.660> up<00:00:59.839> against<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:00.379> and

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
back of my mind I was up against it and

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.919 
back of my mind I was up against it and
I<00:01:01.010> just<00:01:01.969> had<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.089> go<00:01:02.269> out<00:01:02.329> then<00:01:02.480> just<00:01:02.690> trying<00:01:02.839> to

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
opposed to 93 that could have put a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.490 
opposed to 93 that could have put a
different<00:01:13.940> complexion<00:01:14.150> on<00:01:14.720> things<00:01:14.780> yeah

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.420 
maybe I mean even then I'm still up
against<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:17.990> but<00:01:18.110> obviously<00:01:18.650> having<00:01:19.130> lost<00:01:19.310> the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
against it but obviously having lost the

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.010
