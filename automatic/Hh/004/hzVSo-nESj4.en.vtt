00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.649
 the 80s are very funny after 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.289
 funny because unlike 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.319
 crisis years of the 70s and 80s we want 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.899
 show you have money in fashion 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:30.190
 of course these explosions of these must 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:33.099
 to be chic luxury and at the same time as 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.940
 days is the beginning for example of the 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.069
 sportswear 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.500
 this is the first time that part of 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.899
 sneakers sneakers but in the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.890
 street is part of the look and it wants 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.310
 to say I am a 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.500
 I work I'm cool I'm fast 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.500
 I am sporty I am in shape 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.820
 another element of the movement is the 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.220
 walkman for the first time the walkman 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.950
 sony walkman 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.600
 it's a symbol of 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.010
 symbols of youth and we listen to the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.630
 music running while walking by going 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.300
 at work and that means I'm cool 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.190
 I am young I am modern 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.450
 I have technology I have a little 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.230
 of money I buy things that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.760
 come from Japan 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.760
 we are fascinated by Japan 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.670
 the renault fuego was launched in 1981 she 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.500
 is the result of Michel garden work 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.859
 a renault designer who worked 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.450
 under the orders of robert opron who 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.090
 picks up the car with a lot of 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.069
 simplicity 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.689
 we must keep the faith taste it is 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.870
 based on the platform of the very wise 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:09.200
 renault 18 and the whole purpose of the game was 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.849
 to make a cut not so much 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.340
 sportsmen were not his vocation 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.479
 but we will say maybe a little more at 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.889
 off a little less wise a little bit more 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.889
 flamboyant that the renault sedan 18 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.770
 then the renault fuego is the same 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.760
 it's a car coming out in 1981 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.130
 is in something a little bit 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.330
 atypical for the Renault is actually 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.669
 the r18 coupe 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.020
 but it does not look like a r18 at all 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.830
 luckily by the way and so we are 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:58.530
 in something quite original 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:59.640
 it's a bit of a 924 porsche and 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.560
 its aerodynamics 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.180
 it was a very characteristic 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.790
 important at the time we were after the 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.530
 oil crises and we managed here to 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.030
 to have a six of 0.34 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.490
 which was excellent for the time 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.440
 second big feature these 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.600
 striated sidebands that go 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.770
 boost the profile of the car and 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.229
 then finally third characteristic 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.370
 essential is this bubble back to 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.440
 tim morse bubble that will give a lot 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.570
 of brightness to the cockpit and that will 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.030
 allow to have a form of flags 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.710
 which preserves the cockpit at the rear which 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.930
 gives space to rear passengers 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.490
 who will thus be able to benefit from a 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.700
 nice space to browse from 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.700
 long distances 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.570
 there is a little bit this tri-body side 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.530
 elongated cut a little sporty and 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.229
 today what is quite fun 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.160
 is that the r18 cut is so this 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.380
 car the fuego 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.180
 it's a car to collect so that 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.979
 proves she has she had some 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.350
 thing even though at the time at the ap has known 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.560
 an extravagant success but there was a 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.560
 thing
