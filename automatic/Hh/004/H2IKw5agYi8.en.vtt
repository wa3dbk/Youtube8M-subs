these two devices I mean these dozen you

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.520 
these two devices I mean these dozen you
know<00:00:42.930> don't<00:00:43.930> want<00:00:44.020> to<00:00:44.200> be<00:00:44.380> a<00:00:45.360> scientific<00:00:46.530> test

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
know don't want to be a scientific test

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.180 
know don't want to be a scientific test
or<00:00:48.040> nothing<00:00:48.940> like<00:00:49.120> this<00:00:49.530> nevertheless<00:00:50.530> you

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
or nothing like this nevertheless you

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.170 
or nothing like this nevertheless you
know<00:00:51.310> being<00:00:51.940> able<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.300> test<00:00:52.590> 2<00:00:53.590> LTE<00:00:54.190> devices<00:00:54.670> on

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
know being able to test 2 LTE devices on

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.750 
know being able to test 2 LTE devices on
the<00:00:55.570> same<00:00:57.420> mobile<00:00:58.590> mobile<00:00:59.590> operator<00:01:00.220> because

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
the same mobile mobile operator because

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.959 
the same mobile mobile operator because
both<00:01:01.270> these<00:01:01.660> devices<00:01:02.079> use<00:01:02.790> h<00:01:03.790> 3g<00:01:04.950> the<00:01:05.969> italian

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:06.969 
both these devices use h 3g the italian

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:11.849 
both these devices use h 3g the italian
mobile<00:01:07.929> provider<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:10.390> course<00:01:10.810> both<00:01:11.530> we

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:11.859 
mobile provider and of course both we

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:16.349 
mobile provider and of course both we
use<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.460> h<00:01:12.850> 3g<00:01:13.499> server<00:01:14.499> in<00:01:15.340> order<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.819> test<00:01:16.030> the

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359 
use the h 3g server in order to test the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:22.529 
use the h 3g server in order to test the
speed<00:01:17.049> of<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.770> net<00:01:17.979> as<00:01:18.939> you<00:01:19.569> can<00:01:19.719> see<00:01:19.899> here<00:01:21.539> so

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
speed of the net as you can see here so

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.859 
speed of the net as you can see here so
given<00:01:22.899> this<00:01:23.079> fact<00:01:23.139> maybe<00:01:23.710> we<00:01:24.249> will<00:01:24.520> have<00:01:24.579> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
given this fact maybe we will have a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.599 
given this fact maybe we will have a
good<00:01:25.869> comparison<00:01:26.409> between<00:01:26.950> these<00:01:27.340> two

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
good comparison between these two

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:30.029 
good comparison between these two
devices<00:01:27.939> let<00:01:28.899> me<00:01:29.109> zoom<00:01:29.259> a<00:01:29.319> little<00:01:29.499> bit<00:01:29.859> just

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
devices let me zoom a little bit just

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.149 
devices let me zoom a little bit just
you<00:01:30.310> have<00:01:30.549> a<00:01:30.789> better<00:01:31.179> view<00:01:31.959> of<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.560> episode

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
you have a better view of the episode

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:41.170 
you have a better view of the episode
and<00:01:34.090> let's<00:01:34.450> start<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.020> test

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.970 

so<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.200> pink<00:01:42.620> is<00:01:42.770> more<00:01:43.130> or<00:01:43.250> less<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.400> same<00:01:47.980> so

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
so the pink is more or less the same so

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.030 
so the pink is more or less the same so
we<00:01:49.310> have<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:49.910> deal<00:01:50.420> this<00:01:50.960> or<00:01:51.110> experience<00:01:51.590> efore

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
we have a deal this or experience efore

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.000 
we have a deal this or experience efore
this<00:01:52.190> one<00:01:52.460> seems<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:53.060> win<00:01:53.240> we<00:01:54.140> have<00:01:54.170> maybe<00:01:54.680> it

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
this one seems to win we have maybe it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.969 
this one seems to win we have maybe it
slightly<00:01:55.280> higher<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.510> time<00:01:56.930> but<00:01:57.229> we<00:01:57.410> have<00:01:57.620> a

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
slightly higher in time but we have a

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.030 
slightly higher in time but we have a
better<00:01:58.700> download<00:01:59.000> speed<00:01:59.420> we<00:01:59.570> have<00:01:59.690> 41<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.619> 83

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
better download speed we have 41 on 83

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.730 
better download speed we have 41 on 83
versus<00:02:02.320> 36-point<00:02:03.790> 3063<00:02:04.790> sorry<00:02:05.450> well<00:02:06.380> we<00:02:06.560> have

already<00:03:21.420> run<00:03:22.080> this<00:03:22.260> test<00:03:22.560> several<00:03:22.890> time<00:03:23.280> with

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
already run this test several time with

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.090 
already run this test several time with
these<00:03:23.610> two<00:03:23.850> devices<00:03:24.150> together<00:03:24.770> what<00:03:25.770> I<00:03:25.800> could

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
these two devices together what I could

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.630 
these two devices together what I could
see<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:27.170> maybe<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.560> download<00:03:29.130> speed<00:03:29.220> of

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
see is that maybe the download speed of

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.480 
see is that maybe the download speed of
both<00:03:29.850> devices<00:03:30.240> are<00:03:30.720> more<00:03:31.710> or<00:03:32.010> less<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.460> same

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
both devices are more or less the same

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.300 
both devices are more or less the same
maybe<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.600> little<00:03:33.930> bit<00:03:34.170> faster<00:03:34.530> than<00:03:35.130> sonic

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
maybe a little bit faster than sonic

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.390 
maybe a little bit faster than sonic
speed<00:03:35.670> up<00:03:35.820> be<00:03:36.030> but<00:03:36.360> not<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.720> faster<00:03:37.290> while<00:03:38.190> we

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
speed up be but not that faster while we

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.670 
speed up be but not that faster while we
have<00:03:38.580> really<00:03:39.270> a<00:03:39.510> big<00:03:39.870> difference<00:03:40.410> were

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
have really a big difference were

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.450 
have really a big difference were
concerned<00:03:41.190> upload<00:03:41.610> speed<00:03:41.970> which<00:03:42.300> is<00:03:42.540> almost

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
concerned upload speed which is almost

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.020 
concerned upload speed which is almost
you<00:03:44.460> know<00:03:44.640> two<00:03:45.390> times<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:46.530> upload<00:03:47.400> speed<00:03:47.430> I

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
you know two times the upload speed I

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.230 
you know two times the upload speed I
mean<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.990> sonic<00:03:49.440> speed<00:03:49.650> AVI<00:03:49.950> has<00:03:50.130> almost<00:03:51.030> two

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
mean the sonic speed AVI has almost two

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.270 
mean the sonic speed AVI has almost two
times<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.600> upload<00:03:51.960> speed<00:03:51.990> of<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.740> Sony

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
times the upload speed of the Sony

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.830 
times the upload speed of the Sony
Xperia<00:03:53.580> Z<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.920> for<00:03:56.460> this<00:03:56.580> quick<00:03:56.970> test<00:03:57.300> on<00:03:57.540> the
