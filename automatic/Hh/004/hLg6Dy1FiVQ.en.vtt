Miami<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:47.880> I'm<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.210> use<00:01:48.540> Chris<00:01:48.810> Bosh

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
Miami it's I'm going to use Chris Bosh

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.350 
Miami it's I'm going to use Chris Bosh
at<00:01:49.290> center<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.799> think<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.610> team<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.119> both

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
at center I think this team can do both

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.749 
at center I think this team can do both
we<00:01:51.869> had<00:01:51.990> titus<00:01:52.320> young<00:01:52.530> at<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.770> small<00:01:53.399> forest

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
we had titus young at the small forest

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.090 
we had titus young at the small forest
part<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.140> kind<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> shuffle<00:01:55.680> him<00:01:55.829> around

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
part we can kind of shuffle him around

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.770 
part we can kind of shuffle him around
but<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.490> think<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.149> good<00:01:57.299> problem<00:01:57.659> for

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
but I think it's a good problem for

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.630 
but I think it's a good problem for
coach<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.110> have<00:01:58.259> but<00:01:58.560> I'm<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> coach<00:01:59.430> so

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
coach to have but I'm not the coach so

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.100 
coach to have but I'm not the coach so
I'll<00:01:59.790> let<00:01:59.909> him<00:02:00.060> figure<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:00.600> you've<00:02:01.079> been

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I'll let him figure it out you've been

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.210 
I'll let him figure it out you've been

if he's still like he was he's a very

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.490 
if he's still like he was he's a very
intense<00:02:21.060> coach<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.630> he<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.080> come<00:02:22.200> up<00:02:22.260> with<00:02:22.470> a

play<00:02:22.710> in<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.920> split<00:02:23.130> second<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.700> have<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.970> be

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
play in a split second so you have to be

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.840 
play in a split second so you have to be
in<00:02:24.210> tune<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.630> then<00:02:24.720> check<00:02:24.960> with<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.260> game<00:02:25.470> so
