00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.320
 Our cousin give here we have an art 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.930
 normal 10 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.309
 it is here that the bird courses that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:03.359
 gives sight was pretty cool and very sexy by 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.650
 perhaps witnesses of her ways and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.200
 everything else 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.060
 really hall does a shot that maybe 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.850
 could stay like this 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.130
 I think it would stay in the cool tanks. 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.740
 Let's go to our second place here. 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.729
 we have us west couple faces 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.340
 shit right 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.409
 as everyone knows the floor a couple 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.100
 by chance is one of the couples with more 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.590
 optimism same flash I do not know why not 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.930
 I know if it is pure and it is this good because 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.840
 nor is training to be like this 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.229
 still for years because the pain is 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.200
 very much this couple in mecca 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.680
 Now tell me which one to look for 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.979
 fried lay off legions the gent invent 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.450
 many as I have seen one on this side and 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:55.110
 to plan 2010 and riva invented many 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.009
 Cool couples even flanders home until 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.200
 would be quite certain then here in the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.930
 our third place here we have a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.580
 idea to warm this one even though it already 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.039
 to have many want fire is tim ash I love you 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.000
 say this pokémon years in credits and 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.090
 Lastly 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.240
 is the same name so to speak sapara and 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.120
 so it's a strange case that I'm going 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.220
 think we have the fifth an idea says that 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.210
 I do not think you'd be pretty cool 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.950
 Portuguese for tense today I in her she 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:36.750
 belong front shorts who was from the ice and 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.330
 cold and everything and it is not almost our 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.320
 fourth place we have quite a few ideas 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.850
 Nice I loved artists who have a lot 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.310
 You can still tell when it was 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.340
 I also admit that I do not know 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.520
 Why do you create a stylist? 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.500
 many clothes dreamed many dolls only 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.620
 which then grew and was 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.980
 that I drew very badly I would not have 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.110
 future nakheel certainty in the plans 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.350
 so here in our fifth place has 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.010
 genre of a prass montage in wax with 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.730
 ash with several in fight everything else stayed 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.549
 brutal bath of epic ipi in my 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.989
 opinion this morning a xepa is very 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.230
 beautiful that I think is not much 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.360
 complicated make good luck for her 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.840
