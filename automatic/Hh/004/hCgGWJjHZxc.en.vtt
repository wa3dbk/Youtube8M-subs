00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
about the hardware the devices which is

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.549 
about the hardware the devices which is
actually<00:00:40.860> very<00:00:41.070> similar<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.910> both<00:00:41.940> devices

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
actually very similar for both devices

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.260 
actually very similar for both devices
both<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> 7-inch<00:00:44.370> capacitive

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
even though that is the case then the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.650 
even though that is the case then the
color<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.620> slightly<00:00:53.129> larger<00:00:54.030> because<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.570> this

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
color is slightly larger because of this

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.270 
color is slightly larger because of this

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
and you'll see all the procedures on how

and you'll see all the procedures on how
to<00:02:47.480> do<00:02:47.659> that<00:02:48.579> but<00:02:49.579> we've<00:02:50.269> done<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.599> to<00:02:50.750> this

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
to do that but we've done that to this

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.839 
to do that but we've done that to this
and<00:02:51.109> that's<00:02:51.260> why<00:02:51.500> it's<00:02:51.709> capable<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.310> doing<00:02:52.760> the

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
and that's why it's capable of doing the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.149 
and that's why it's capable of doing the
same<00:02:53.000> stuff<00:02:53.269> as<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.720> galaxy<00:02:53.870> tab<00:02:54.319> but<00:02:54.920> you

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
same stuff as the galaxy tab but you

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.039 
same stuff as the galaxy tab but you
must<00:02:55.340> understand<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:55.879> because<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.569> the

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
must understand that because of that the

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.580 
must understand that because of that the
version<00:02:57.379> of<00:02:57.799> Android<00:02:58.579> on<00:02:58.700> here<00:02:58.970> is<00:02:59.290> far<00:03:00.290> from

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
version of Android on here is far from

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.220 
version of Android on here is far from
perfect<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.120> still<00:03:02.359> a<00:03:02.389> little<00:03:02.599> buggy<00:03:02.840> but

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
perfect it is still a little buggy but

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.690 
perfect it is still a little buggy but
this<00:03:03.560> version<00:03:03.769> is<00:03:04.010> much<00:03:04.159> faster<00:03:04.400> than<00:03:04.639> the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
this version is much faster than the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.610 
this version is much faster than the
last<00:03:04.879> one<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.150> used<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.810> faster<00:03:06.349> than<00:03:06.530> one

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
last one I used and faster than one

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.559 
last one I used and faster than one
before<00:03:06.889> that<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.700> they<00:03:07.909> are<00:03:08.060> making<00:03:08.299> progress

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
before that so they are making progress

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.580 
before that so they are making progress
so<00:03:10.420> that's<00:03:11.420> kind<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:11.810> where<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.079> stands<00:03:12.319> on<00:03:12.500> the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
so that's kind of where it stands on the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:20.670 
so that's kind of where it stands on the
software

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:04:51.430 

you

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.150 

you

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:17.990 

you

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.730 

okay<00:05:18.720> so<00:05:18.780> that's<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.200> for<00:05:19.230> a<00:05:19.410> quick<00:05:19.590> little

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
okay so that's it for a quick little

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.530 
okay so that's it for a quick little
run-through<00:05:20.060> again<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.150> device<00:05:21.360> is<00:05:21.480> very

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
run-through again the device is very

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.060 
run-through again the device is very
similar<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:22.670> wonder<00:05:23.670> if<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.960> extra<00:05:25.470> camera<00:05:25.830> the

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
similar I wonder if the extra camera the

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.980 
similar I wonder if the extra camera the
smaller<00:05:26.370> size<00:05:26.670> and<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.300> more<00:05:27.690> stable

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
smaller size and the more stable

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.460 
smaller size and the more stable
software<00:05:28.770> on<00:05:29.670> the<00:05:30.000> galaxy<00:05:30.390> tab<00:05:30.570> is<00:05:30.870> worth<00:05:31.170> an

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
software on the galaxy tab is worth an

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.400 
software on the galaxy tab is worth an
extra<00:05:32.150> 250<00:05:33.150> bucks<00:05:33.330> you<00:05:33.540> literally<00:05:33.840> buy<00:05:34.020> two<00:05:34.380> of

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
extra 250 bucks you literally buy two of

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.010 
extra 250 bucks you literally buy two of
these<00:05:34.590> for<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.950> price<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.160> this<00:05:35.340> one<00:05:35.550> so<00:05:36.060> not

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
these for the price of this one so not
