00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.429
 welcome with him and welcome 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.540
 to a new episode minecraft news 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.950
 always the newest and 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.690
 most interesting news for you what the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.890
 console edition is concerned as always you 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.420
 you have already noticed that shortly 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.070
 but even one after the ninth 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.960
 day after I uploaded that 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.980
 addressed bugfix update came out and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.180
 then you surely noticed that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.529
 less than a week later that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.060
 next update came out that again 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.380
 a bugfix update was 2 bugfix update 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.119
 one behind the other always has to be done 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.769
 that created new wax the before 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.390
 all were there, and the second by this 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.800
 bugfix update has to be said came too 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.000
 new bugs again if the him 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.770
 has not noticed her, I can indeed 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.090
 count on short or the famous back 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.550
 of all is at once of that one 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.050
 Dispenser piston and do not throw so 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.270
 you can build that you show upwards 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.559
 balanced each other ever so rum again 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.329
 side that you show to the side what 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.559
 of course totally pointless is no idea 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.910
 how to do that in any case 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.649
 of course there is the one or the other 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.300
 ways or tricks that you can do the whole thing 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.410
 but you want to be able to handle it 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.969
 of course a perfect one 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 minecraft do not have what you do not currently 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.940
 this is logically possible 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 the next update also again 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.730
 bugfix will be update that is 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.290
 of course very annoying for all three of us 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.729
 bugfix update in a row that is 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.500
 of course, an achievement and provided 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.909
 after this new bugfix update what? 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.439
 no sooner will be released 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.939
 new wax can arise on it 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.650
 make sure that the next update 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.970
 will be a big update again and 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.530
 All the features I have in one 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.909
 have enumerated the new episode 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.439
 be there in this great feature 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.610
 if you have not seen this episode 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.170
 Just click here on the top right 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.850
 That's what you want there in the next one 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.290
 following the old sequence reaches the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.610
 new ones to be exact, there I still count 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.140
 you have to do a little bit in the end 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.490
 At the end, only the whole counts 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.650
 new features will be added 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.909
 biome new flowers etc you have to 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.200
 Just pull it in any case 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.240
 I have to add a bit more than that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.799
 there was another new information on 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.810
 twitter have revealed themselves first 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.400
 Thousands of people complain what 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.990
 there are also packed again at the start 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.520
 They replied they said yes 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.079
 We will definitely do that in the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.909
 you also have the next update fix 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.470
 already when the other grows up says 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.520
 Anything else that will come to that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.350
 They are also very clear 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.880
 namely on twitter one she has 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.920
 started on twitter and asked how 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.840
 it would be if they adapt that 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.799
 from the flat world 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.450
 he realizes that he is on the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.219
 pc version if you also super flat 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.810
 World class is so little panda 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.579
 usually costs German 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.229
 adjust and can decide which 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.910
 blocks where are or what you think of a world 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.200
 with codes you can do it all and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.640
 there are also which team plates the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.500
 you can insert there or we already 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.730
 in it are water world deserts 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.560
 world and there you have a lot of clips 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.300
 clearly answered now wants like walking 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.250
 in German said they are currently working 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.630
 So it can be assumed that that 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.190
 definitely in the next update 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.390
 what will be natural for me, of course 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.800
 Opinion in any case is very cool 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.150
 I have no experience but I have 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.050
 I'll make your experiences with it 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.060
 opinion with him in the times 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.280
 comments as well 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.720
 is coming is that from now or 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.550
 with the new update then the whole 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.200
 Never build portals as big as you can 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.030
 he wants to know that too 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.890
 a pc version that you both giant 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.239
 Never portals are there and they still are 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.040
 the function meet that one clearly 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.900
 but internet can also get there 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.730
 design technically what horny give what 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.840
 in my opinion is also very cool 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.970
 and I have one or the other 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.250
 interviews with coworkers from vw 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.319
 However, studios are very old 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.849
 finds all these interviews again 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.049
 then I link in the description 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.549
 I also checked who did it again 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.140
 They will not be found again in any case 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.940
 was that time where fresh the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.560
 minecraft playstation 3 action came out 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.390
 It was also clearly stated that 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.040
 despite being able to come there I can 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.049
 one or two fan doctors from 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.459
 Show some people that 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.530
 whole already design-technically so 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.269
 have designed how the whole look 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.440
 could be if a mod expert and 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.880
 actually it should also be slow time 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.440
 for mods if we look at the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.299
 first look at it came in 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.470
 pÃ©cs out then textures packages out 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.480
 and then the whole match attax 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.700
 would have to go out now as the next step 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.410
 actually, if you think the whole thing logically 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.100
 consider if she comes out of mods me 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.630
 I do not want too much now 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.459
 promise that you are right now 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.230
 But the next big update is coming 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.850
 It would be conceivable in any case and also 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.440
 server I think that will take a while 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.670
 and I'm looking forward to the playstation 3 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.319
 honest i dont know if the server 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.700
 come on ps4 can I get there already 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.530
 rather imagine with a higher 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.720
 performance and he does not need either 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.040
 ask if there will be bigger worlds 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.780
 on the playstation 3 then I am too 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.970
 not convinced, therefore, is the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.859
 nextgen consoles are out there and how 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.209
 Indian also for the external consoles 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.500
 I believe that we are just there 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.610
 do with server for example 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.680
 and with the 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.000
 bigger worlds but mods are on 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.200
 every case on all consoles comes that 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.610
 is just that can not 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.380
 of course , each one jumps first 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.570
 xbox you know everything again 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.040
 hint microsoft and so well need 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.330
 we're not upset about it but yours 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.100
 opinion please in the comments what 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.630
 Do you think that now has three bugfix 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.820
 update one behind the other rausgekommen 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.709
 or 1 is still together makes us 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.209
 then three and what do you think of that 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.200
 wax you noticed that too 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.760
 or are you another 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.320
 to write in the comments 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.790
 and what do you think of the feature that 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.470
 we are now available as a head from now 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.450
 From now on we will be adding that soon 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.190
 in any case super flat world 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.169
 can edit or customize 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.940
 As I said, water world deserts what 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.100
 I superflat for a world and then 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.990
 customize as you want your opinion 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.820
 in the comments and what do you say 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.530
 that then mods will come or 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.090
 when and how will you come or what you will 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.560
 from the whole fans I hold her 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.910
 have displayed your opinion 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.290
 is interested in any case and also 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.580
 the opinion, of course, to the big ones 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.780
 nice portal is just what 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.040
 but I think that is design-technical 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.690
 Nevertheless , I think its ice must be 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.830
 at least four by five blocks wide 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.180
 and be long with it all 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.740
 It was definitely working too 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.510
 already with the tenth following 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.010
 ever the tenth of minecraft news 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.390
 Followed your opinion as I said 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.560
 in the comments and if you like this 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.090
 video liked let it out with 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.450
 a thumb up there and skin in 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.450
 friends
