00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.520
 But I'm here to make a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.779
 very short video just to speak one 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.340
 Bit of a story that I think 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.870
 which is already going beyond the limits 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.969
 Suspended it just because I'm Rio 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.519
 because the dream of October has to be 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.870
 compulsory in greasy gent what 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.820
 most of the people of the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.840
 January they are so this way will 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.320

 ottawa of slut I say that the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.230
 miserable is not crazy smooth in the way 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.540
 The Carioca language is practically a 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.370
 expletive per se and rather than invasive 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.309
 stop an order giving to you 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.469
 do is quiet ex partner passes is 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.760
 What's the stopping place in Rio? 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.440
 this way it arrives for example in 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.309
 paulo and minas gerais in quiet cities 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:56.969
 round for example 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:59.280
 quiet people are afraid 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.870
 bandits run like the carioca arrived in the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.760

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.970
 told that the wallet that the brother did not 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.070
 Apologize, it was not bad for the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.720
 quiet wallet even thinks of 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.490
 empty and here in rio de janeiro 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.530
 especially in the new south zone where 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.080
 suppose it's stronger just there guys 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.119
 the funnel was a bullet appear more 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.759
 than the others because it has the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.590
 relative who saw from outside the human father he 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.470
 It 's from there he wants to be carioca. 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.189
 Because they want to put a lot to the glass. 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.270
 The iguana that was on the beach. 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.680

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.259
 with the beach even outside the fact that 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.240
 most of the people outside the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.579
 Rio does not know that only who is Rio who 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.110
 in the river city that is born in other 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.820
 cities within the state of the river 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.689

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.250
 fluminense 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.799
 but who said that Rio de Janeiro 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.380
 the Rio de Janeiro state to respect this 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.640

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.770
 flamengo and this game rule generally 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.690
 it does not really apply I 've already seen people 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.490

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.200
 space will have space three meters 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.400

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.250
