one there which is going to be your
negative<00:02:53.990> pretty<00:02:54.990> much<00:02:55.170> with<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.590> Ford

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
negative pretty much with the Ford

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.630 
negative pretty much with the Ford
Taurus<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:58.260> only<00:02:58.500> setup<00:02:58.770> really<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.280> remember

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
Taurus the only setup really to remember

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.150 
Taurus the only setup really to remember
is<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.030> your<00:03:00.840> pink<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.290> basically<00:03:01.710> your<00:03:01.920> hot

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
is that your pink is basically your hot

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160 
is that your pink is basically your hot
and<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.640> main<00:03:03.120> reason<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.510> think<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.990> is

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
and the main reason I think of that is

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.310 
and the main reason I think of that is
pink<00:03:04.770> red<00:03:05.190> hot<00:03:05.850> pretty<00:03:06.300> much<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.050> best<00:03:07.200> way

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
pink red hot pretty much is the best way

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.240 
pink red hot pretty much is the best way
to<00:03:07.350> think<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.710> it<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:07.980> other<00:03:08.010> ones

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
to think of it and the other ones

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.480 
to think of it and the other ones
