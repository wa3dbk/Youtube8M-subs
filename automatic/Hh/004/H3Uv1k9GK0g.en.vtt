00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.330 

the<00:00:25.359> icon<00:00:25.750> flavorless<00:00:26.230> unit<00:00:26.590> doesn't<00:00:26.949> allow

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
the icon flavorless unit doesn't allow

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.220 
the icon flavorless unit doesn't allow
an<00:00:27.519> easy<00:00:27.759> adjustment<00:00:27.939> of<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:28.689> swashplate

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
an easy adjustment of the swashplate

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.569 
an easy adjustment of the swashplate
at<00:00:29.439> full<00:00:29.649> positive<00:00:29.890> and<00:00:30.430> full<00:00:30.910> negative<00:00:31.149> pitch

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
at full positive and full negative pitch

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.090 
at full positive and full negative pitch
so<00:00:33.579> I<00:00:33.610> will<00:00:33.909> skip<00:00:34.089> this<00:00:34.269> part<00:00:34.480> here<00:00:34.720> if<00:00:35.680> you

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
so I will skip this part here if you

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.009 
so I will skip this part here if you
want<00:00:36.309> to<00:00:36.430> do<00:00:36.579> it<00:00:36.760> just<00:00:37.000> have<00:00:37.629> a<00:00:37.659> look<00:00:37.870> at<00:00:37.989> our

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
want to do it just have a look at our

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.149 
want to do it just have a look at our
instructions<00:00:38.860> PDF<00:00:39.280> file<00:00:40.769> so<00:00:41.769> let's<00:00:41.980> have<00:00:42.100> a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
instructions PDF file so let's have a

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:43.950 
instructions PDF file so let's have a
look<00:00:42.399> at<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.670> setup<00:00:42.909> procedure<00:00:43.629> for<00:00:43.870> the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
look at the setup procedure for the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.500 
look at the setup procedure for the
cyclic<00:00:44.379> pitch<00:00:46.979> if<00:00:47.979> you<00:00:48.699> just<00:00:48.910> have<00:00:49.120> done<00:00:49.359> the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
cyclic pitch if you just have done the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.240 
cyclic pitch if you just have done the
setup<00:00:49.690> for<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.079> collective<00:00:50.530> pitch<00:00:50.710> just

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
setup for the collective pitch just

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.729 
setup for the collective pitch just
leave<00:00:51.550> everything<00:00:51.850> as<00:00:52.120> it<00:00:52.269> is<00:00:52.530> instead<00:00:53.530> of

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
leave everything as it is instead of

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.979 
leave everything as it is instead of
changing<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.219> collective<00:00:54.699> pitch<00:00:54.879> value<00:00:55.269> just

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
changing the collective pitch value just

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.110 
changing the collective pitch value just
leave<00:00:56.260> it<00:00:56.379> to<00:00:56.500> zero<00:00:56.829> pitch<00:00:57.039> which<00:00:57.519> means<00:00:57.789> leave

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
leave it to zero pitch which means leave

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.549 
leave it to zero pitch which means leave
the<00:00:58.239> throttle<00:00:58.420> stick<00:00:58.809> in<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.199> center

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
the throttle stick in the center

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.120 
the throttle stick in the center
position<00:01:03.869> the<00:01:04.869> display<00:01:05.259> faces<00:01:05.649> to<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:05.860> front

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
position the display faces to the front

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.940 
position the display faces to the front
now<00:01:07.060> move<00:01:07.300> the<00:01:07.479> aileron<00:01:07.929> elevator<00:01:08.110> stick<00:01:08.679> to

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
now move the aileron elevator stick to

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.460 
now move the aileron elevator stick to
full<00:01:09.190> aileron<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:09.970> both<00:01:10.179> directions<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:13.470> read

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
full aileron in both directions I read

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.550 
full aileron in both directions I read
here<00:01:14.800> eleven<00:01:15.429> point<00:01:15.729> six<00:01:15.940> degrees<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:17.259> full

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
here eleven point six degrees for full

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.919 
here eleven point six degrees for full
right<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:20.190> eleven<00:01:21.190> point<00:01:21.429> five<00:01:21.580> degrees<00:01:22.060> for

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
right and eleven point five degrees for

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.210 
right and eleven point five degrees for
few<00:01:23.200> left<00:01:23.440> I<00:01:25.110> don't<00:01:26.110> like<00:01:26.410> that<00:01:26.560> much<00:01:26.739> cyclic

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
few left I don't like that much cyclic

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.940 
few left I don't like that much cyclic
pitch<00:01:27.399> so<00:01:28.179> I<00:01:28.509> will<00:01:28.690> change<00:01:28.959> the<00:01:29.319> value<00:01:29.709> in<00:01:29.860> the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
pitch so I will change the value in the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.809 
pitch so I will change the value in the
software<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:32.619> will<00:01:33.009> get<00:01:33.160> something<00:01:33.670> around

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
software so I will get something around

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:45.690 
software so I will get something around
10<00:01:34.450> degrees<00:01:36.929> I'm<00:01:37.929> now<00:01:38.140> at<00:01:38.259> 11

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.520 

I<00:01:45.759> have<00:01:46.060> no<00:01:46.409> 10.2<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:48.899> 10.1<00:01:49.899> degrees

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
I have no 10.2 and 10.1 degrees

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.639 
I have no 10.2 and 10.1 degrees
that's<00:01:51.460> how<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.640> like<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:53.140> let's<00:01:53.350> check<00:01:53.590> the

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
that's how I like it now let's check the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.830 
that's how I like it now let's check the
cyclic<00:01:54.130> pitch<00:01:54.310> for<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.700> elevator<00:01:55.060> turn<00:01:55.689> the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
cyclic pitch for the elevator turn the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.929 
cyclic pitch for the elevator turn the
head<00:01:55.990> 90<00:01:56.200> degrees<00:01:56.679> so<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.100> display<00:01:57.460> faces<00:01:57.820> to

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
head 90 degrees so the display faces to

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.929 
head 90 degrees so the display faces to
the<00:01:58.030> right<00:01:58.380> move<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.590> elrom<00:02:00.100> elevator<00:02:00.610> stick

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
the right move the elrom elevator stick

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.450 
the right move the elrom elevator stick
to<00:02:01.179> full<00:02:01.479> elevator<00:02:02.200> in<00:02:02.500> both<00:02:02.679> directions

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
to full elevator in both directions

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.460 
to full elevator in both directions
I<00:02:04.890> feel<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.920> 10.1<00:02:06.610> degrees<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:08.190> 10.2<00:02:09.190> degrees

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
I feel a 10.1 degrees and 10.2 degrees

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.860 
I feel a 10.1 degrees and 10.2 degrees
that's<00:02:11.470> great<00:02:11.739> in<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.940> setup<00:02:13.150> software<00:02:13.480> I

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
that's great in the setup software I

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
that's great in the setup software I
have<00:02:14.080> now<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.319> value<00:02:14.769> of<00:02:15.000> 44%<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.890> this

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
have now a value of 44% and this

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:30.020 
have now a value of 44% and this
finishes<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.489> setup<00:02:18.849> for<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.269> cyclic<00:02:19.840> pitch

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.090
