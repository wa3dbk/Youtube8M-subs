 of olympics is that but alfonso and the 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.210
 true that we have had today the fit hit

 Monday to the day and calder and have been the 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.739
 as a child elián and jackson the truth is that 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.129

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.540
 acceptance the gym thanks because what 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.750
 have you seen them live live 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.060
 that as you see them very much size 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.320
 much difference the truth is that when 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.659
 plus 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.550
 they impose respect is when they are not 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.650
 competition because then what we 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.170
 They look so much when you're out 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.640
 season looks almost to small but 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.800
 then in competition I who is with 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.510
 them and they keep pressing true yes 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.110
 clear impressive true good I know 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.170
 that if you put yourself next to them 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.690
 The size is the size and your light is much 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.910
 size the good truth what are the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.350
 objectives that you have for the year that 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.330
 it comes not because this year we no longer have 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.010
 no more championships but for the year 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.900
 I imagine that yes you will already be at 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.110
 order to leave to compete not 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.290
 alfonso if you are thinking about competing the year 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.970
 which comes to first about March or April 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.550
 you will have to see the calendar yes yes 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.050
 I want to go out to the fiba germany 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.450
 I do not know if there will be a championship here 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.090
 first of the year and he probably 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.280
 also at the pro level and I do not know if the flex 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.979
 but I will surely close at the level 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.209
 I tried in May that such last year 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.590
 when you get ready to compete as you 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.930
 you found because I saw you in one of 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.670
 the best physical forms the truth that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.170
 it is very I found myself very well then already at 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.890
 very exhausted end so many competitions 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.630
 followed so many trips but good 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.600
 Obviously the view is of the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.150
 results that was the best times 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.640
 I came out I liked the preparation 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.390
 with your current coach who is now 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.040
 same 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.780
 Macri Mubarak does not 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.599
 and the truth is that their power as they say 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.510
 with the key and his help was very 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.400
 important to me for my progression and 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.129
 now well, apart from trainers 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.060
 is a good friend very well perfect this 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.439
 year then you have decided also 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.870
 change of preparer or have to the best 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.849
 a new advisor to see different 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.739
 training tactics nutrition or 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.829
 you are simply going to do what really 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.719
 you know what works for you if this year 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.689
 obviously I will continue counting on the 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.609
 help from my patrick coach and 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.810
 then also a little bit with what 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.750
 that I already know and with what I have learned 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.280
 throughout my career as a bodybuilder 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.260
 very well returning to what is the theme of the 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.150
 gym that interests me a lot gave me 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.970
 they said you have a well-plagued room 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.650
 of machines to make leg not the 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.650
 truth is that he has made conscience 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.379
 good to my taste yes I have many many 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.540
 dams I have three different presses in 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.849
 a machine one to do squats 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.230
 the sitting 10 yes I have many machines 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.939
 to do but the truth is that there 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.069
 can train many of them well 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.920
 they are competing now not alfonso xi 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.409
 here I am here to talk to us there are two 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.959
 girls that go out and a guy and then to 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.840
 Spain I have two or three if I take 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.760
 quite a lot of people that I try to get it out 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.549
 with the point of competition they ask 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.379
 here the important thing is also to help them 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.900
 day to day no and that also 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.489
 encarga not to do the trainings 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.889
 support them and others not yes of course 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.510
 especially mainly because support 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.669
 this salt especially to people who 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.849
 begins and that they are newbies have many 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:10.099
 doubts that are not always asking 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:14.510
 so you have to be there then 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:16.250
 to correct it to show you everything 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.900
 the support that one of the 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.660
 competitors that you have here in the tree 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.650
 is roberto not if roberto del amor will come out 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.410
 On Sunday more than 100 I have seen it very 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.740
 good physical condition these last 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.080
 championships the truth the evolution that 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.240
 has had or is is these years has been 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.910
 wonderful from my point of view and 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.669
 I think it may be one of the following 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.689
 professionals what do you think of that I think 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.719
 what 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.279
 has evolved a lot is touching him 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:48.319
 a category maybe I should take 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:50.809
 more weight and that I have said I 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:53.869
 but if it comes out with a very good point it comes out very 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:56.329
 hard and so he can not get the 

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:58.129
 Professional card is very good that you 

00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:00.319
 would you recommend a person who is 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.179
 starting in this world of 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.459
 bodybuilding nutrition of the 

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:06.799
 competition so you do not want to put 

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:10.069
 strong in two days that is enduring a 

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:12.610
 little that is constant and that therefore 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.680
 who loves this sport 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.810
 how do I do it and how do you lick any 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.300
 person who trains because ultimately 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.610
 the one who competes is because he likes it is not 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.860
 for a job you want to say something to 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.819

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.520

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.409
