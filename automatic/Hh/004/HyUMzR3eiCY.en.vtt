00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
so that you can cut the wire down and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.280 
so that you can cut the wire down and
because<00:02:17.940> we<00:02:18.090> certainly<00:02:18.540> don't<00:02:18.810> need<00:02:18.930> all<00:02:19.110> this

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
because we certainly don't need all this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.680 
because we certainly don't need all this
length<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.340> if<00:02:20.489> that's<00:02:20.820> what<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.150> wanted<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.540> do

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
length so if that's what we wanted to do

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.410 
length so if that's what we wanted to do
it<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.170> possible<00:02:22.769> this<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.579> the<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.209> power

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
it is possible this is the the power

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.960 
it is possible this is the the power
supply<00:02:25.609> you<00:02:26.609> only<00:02:26.670> get<00:02:27.060> half<00:02:27.329> of<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> plug

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
supply you only get half of the plug

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.280 
supply you only get half of the plug
unfortunately<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.299> you<00:02:30.359> may<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.989> just

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
unfortunately so you may have to just

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.599 
unfortunately so you may have to just
cut<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.680> off<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.250> put<00:02:34.190> solder<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.340> couple

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
cut that off and put solder a couple

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.530 
cut that off and put solder a couple
eyes<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:36.090> there<00:02:36.329> to<00:02:36.480> attach<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.049> your<00:02:37.200> battery

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
eyes on there to attach to your battery

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.620 
eyes on there to attach to your battery
these<00:02:39.540> are<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.700> hand<00:02:41.700> brake<00:02:41.910> levers<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.510> you

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
these are the hand brake levers and you

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.180 
these are the hand brake levers and you
can<00:02:42.780> see<00:02:42.959> there<00:02:43.079> are<00:02:43.200> special<00:02:43.560> leverage<00:02:43.829> got<00:02:44.160> a

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
can see there are special leverage got a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.280 
can see there are special leverage got a
wire<00:02:44.549> on<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.060> goes<00:02:45.209> down<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.630> your<00:02:45.660> wheel

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
wire on it that goes down to your wheel

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.220 
wire on it that goes down to your wheel
and<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:48.120> minute<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.570> trigger<00:02:49.140> that

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
and the minute you trigger that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.259 
and the minute you trigger that
handbrake<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.920> motor<00:02:53.190> itself<00:02:53.609> will<00:02:53.910> go<00:02:54.060> into

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
handbrake the motor itself will go into

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.410 
handbrake the motor itself will go into
a<00:02:54.530> regeneration<00:02:55.530> mode<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.730> cuts<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.209> power

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
a regeneration mode it cuts the power

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.229 
a regeneration mode it cuts the power
and<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.620> wheel<00:02:58.859> then<00:02:59.100> becomes<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.700> generator

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
and the wheel then becomes a generator

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.789 
and the wheel then becomes a generator
and<00:03:00.510> when<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.840> does<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.049> of<00:03:01.410> course<00:03:01.560> it's

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
and when it does that of course it's

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.940 
and when it does that of course it's
taking<00:03:02.190> energy<00:03:02.370> away<00:03:02.609> from<00:03:02.940> your<00:03:03.530> bike<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.799> so

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
taking energy away from your bike and so

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.160 
taking energy away from your bike and so
it<00:03:05.100> starts<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.579> slow<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.030> down<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.930> can

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
it starts to slow it down and that can

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.430 
it starts to slow it down and that can
be<00:03:07.319> programmed<00:03:07.790> now<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.450> wire<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:10.290> is

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
be programmed now this this wire here is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.099 
be programmed now this this wire here is
not<00:03:10.680> part<00:03:11.069> of<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.340> kit<00:03:11.609> but<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.569> available

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
not part of the kit but it is available

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.420 
not part of the kit but it is available
and<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:15.180> plug<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.660> into<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.140> wheel<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.709> it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
and you plug that into the wheel and it

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.039 
and you plug that into the wheel and it
allows<00:03:17.729> you<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.000> program<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.600> number<00:03:18.870> of

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
allows you to program a number of

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.800 
allows you to program a number of
features<00:03:19.350> in<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:20.370> wheel<00:03:20.549> like<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.540> ability

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
features in the wheel like the ability

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.449 
features in the wheel like the ability
to<00:03:22.370> go<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.519> Reverse<00:03:23.850> how<00:03:24.239> fast<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:26.070> wheel<00:03:26.250> will

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
to go in Reverse how fast the wheel will

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.870 
to go in Reverse how fast the wheel will
turn<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.940> reverse<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:28.530> amount<00:03:28.979> of<00:03:29.220> energy

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
turn and reverse the amount of energy

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.120 
turn and reverse the amount of energy
that<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.209> draw<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.109> regeneration<00:03:31.739> mode

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
that you draw in that regeneration mode

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.520 
that you draw in that regeneration mode
so<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.579> would<00:03:33.019> control<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.079> amount<00:03:34.380> of

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
so it would control the amount of

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.370 
so it would control the amount of
braking<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.690> can<00:03:36.690> draw<00:03:36.870> off<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.260> that

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
braking that you can draw off of that

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.860 
braking that you can draw off of that
wheel<00:03:37.790> now<00:03:38.790> what<00:03:39.030> does<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.239> take<00:03:39.389> to<00:03:39.419> put<00:03:39.720> this

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
wheel now what does it take to put this

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.090 
wheel now what does it take to put this
wheel<00:03:40.169> on<00:03:40.199> the<00:03:40.650> bike<00:03:41.329> the<00:03:42.329> wheel<00:03:42.510> itself<00:03:43.100> has

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
wheel on the bike the wheel itself has

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.120 
wheel on the bike the wheel itself has
an<00:03:44.370> axle<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.000> flat<00:03:45.540> on<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.840> sides<00:03:46.139> so<00:03:46.979> we

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
an axle that is flat on the sides so we

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.430 
an axle that is flat on the sides so we
need<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.430> lock<00:03:47.609> this<00:03:47.669> axle<00:03:48.359> down<00:03:48.600> because<00:03:49.169> if

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
need to lock this axle down because if

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.199 
need to lock this axle down because if
not<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.829> course<00:03:49.949> it<00:03:50.160> will<00:03:50.220> spin<00:03:50.669> and<00:03:50.910> tear<00:03:51.090> the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
not of course it will spin and tear the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.819 
not of course it will spin and tear the
wires<00:03:51.419> up<00:03:53.030> that<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.209> accomplished<00:03:54.810> hmm<00:03:55.560> now

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
wires up that is accomplished hmm now

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.199 
wires up that is accomplished hmm now
these<00:03:56.010> two<00:03:56.190> brackets<00:03:56.430> are<00:03:56.760> part<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.090> your

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
these two brackets are part of your

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.979 
these two brackets are part of your
hardware<00:03:57.720> kit<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:58.799> what<00:03:59.790> we<00:03:59.940> need<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.239> do<00:04:00.389> is

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
hardware kit and what we need to do is

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.680 
hardware kit and what we need to do is
lock<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:02.130> wheel<00:04:02.459> onto<00:04:02.880> these<00:04:03.000> brackets<00:04:03.329> and

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
lock that wheel onto these brackets and

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.710 
lock that wheel onto these brackets and
so<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.109> have<00:04:04.380> had<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.430> drill<00:04:05.760> them<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.389> center

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
so I have had to drill them the center

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.409 
so I have had to drill them the center
hole<00:04:06.900> out<00:04:07.199> using<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.709> 1/2<00:04:07.889> inch<00:04:08.070> bit<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.639> that

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
hole out using a 1/2 inch bit and that

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.180 
hole out using a 1/2 inch bit and that
was<00:04:09.630> not<00:04:09.870> quite<00:04:10.169> big<00:04:10.410> enough<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:10.919> I<00:04:10.949> had<00:04:11.009> to

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
was not quite big enough so I had to

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.219 
was not quite big enough so I had to
take<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.340> rat<00:04:11.549> tail<00:04:11.699> file<00:04:12.090> sy<00:04:12.479> is<00:04:12.540> not<00:04:12.870> quite

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
take a rat tail file sy is not quite

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.879 
take a rat tail file sy is not quite
round<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:15.209> then<00:04:15.299> I<00:04:15.419> cut<00:04:15.600> another<00:04:16.199> little<00:04:16.560> slot

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
round and then I cut another little slot

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.449 
round and then I cut another little slot
next<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.590> purpose<00:04:19.919> of<00:04:20.040> this<00:04:20.190> is

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
next to it and the purpose of this is

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.350 
next to it and the purpose of this is
you<00:04:21.090> have<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.380> locking<00:04:22.380> washer<00:04:22.729> that's<00:04:23.729> the
