you know just focus on one day at a time
and<00:00:57.829> you<00:00:58.829> know<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.100> interesting<00:00:59.219> when<00:00:59.550> we

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and you know it's interesting when we

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.490 
and you know it's interesting when we
started<00:00:59.910> working<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.690> started<00:01:01.320> with

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
started working on this we started with

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.830 
started working on this we started with
a<00:01:01.530> lot<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> training<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.670> all<00:01:02.879> did<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> lot<00:01:03.809> of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
a lot of training we all did a lot of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600 
a lot of training we all did a lot of
training<00:01:04.170> together<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.979> think<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.369> kind

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
training together and I think that kind

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.359 
training together and I think that kind
of<00:01:05.729> helped<00:01:06.200> loosen<00:01:07.200> things<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.979> little<00:01:08.100> bit

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
of helped loosen things up a little bit

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.399 
of helped loosen things up a little bit
and<00:01:10.490> because<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.790> very<00:01:12.060> physical<00:01:12.409> movie

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and because it is a very physical movie

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.530 
and because it is a very physical movie
at<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> end<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> day<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.780> um<00:01:16.040> that's

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
at the end of the day so um that's

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.200 
at the end of the day so um that's
that's<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.659> good<00:01:18.810> way<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:18.990> kind<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.670> get<00:01:20.670> find

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that's a good way to kind of get find

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.390 
that's a good way to kind of get find
your<00:01:21.390> way<00:01:21.509> into<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.409> know<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.710> couple<00:01:23.130> years
