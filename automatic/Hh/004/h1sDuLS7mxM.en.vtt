header file what we did is created an
outlet<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.740> crawler<00:01:42.320> this<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.590> done<00:01:43.860> by

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
outlet for this crawler this is done by

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.840 
outlet for this crawler this is done by
the<00:01:44.460> iboutlet<00:01:45.710> method<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:50.250> named<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the iboutlet method we named the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.590 
the iboutlet method we named the
scroller<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:52.080> scroller<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.100> then<00:01:54.000> set<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
scroller the scroller and then set a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.529 
scroller the scroller and then set a
getter<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.649> setter<00:01:55.890> methods<00:01:56.210> using<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
getter and setter methods using this

getter and setter methods using this
line<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.200> code<00:01:59.720> now<00:02:00.720> go<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.080> the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
line of code now go to the

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.039 
line of code now go to the
implementation<00:02:02.270> file<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:05.149> then<00:02:06.149> synthesize

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
implementation file and then synthesize

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:16.370 
implementation file and then synthesize
the<00:02:08.720> scroller<00:02:11.959> now<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:14.209> but<00:02:15.209> wait<00:02:15.480> the
