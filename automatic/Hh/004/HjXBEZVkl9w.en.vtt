00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
cancer most breast cancer patients can

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.490 
cancer most breast cancer patients can
now<00:01:24.159> be<00:01:24.340> treated<00:01:24.729> with<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:24.909> lumpectomy<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.960> we

now be treated with a lumpectomy and we

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.140 
now be treated with a lumpectomy and we
now<00:01:26.650> use<00:01:26.680> a<00:01:26.979> new<00:01:27.340> device<00:01:27.670> called<00:01:28.030> a

now use a new device called a

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.660 
now use a new device called a
radioactive<00:01:28.780> seed<00:01:29.080> that<00:01:29.830> allows<00:01:30.159> us<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.430> be

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
more precise in the lumpectomy so that

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.160 
more precise in the lumpectomy so that
all<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.549> cancer<00:01:33.909> cells<00:01:34.180> can<00:01:34.420> be<00:01:34.540> removed<00:01:34.960> in

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
different reconstructions that actually

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.920 
different reconstructions that actually
fit<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.260> patient<00:02:30.799> so<00:02:31.610> we<00:02:31.970> have<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:32.480> patient

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
mastectomy we have a variety of options

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.610 
mastectomy we have a variety of options
available<00:02:40.340> for<00:02:41.090> them<00:02:41.329> and<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:41.870> think<00:02:42.109> many<00:02:42.470> of

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
available for them and I think many of

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.309 
available for them and I think many of
them<00:02:42.769> are<00:02:42.950> cutting<00:02:43.340> edge<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.180> new<00:02:44.420> techniques

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
them are cutting edge and new techniques

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.069 
them are cutting edge and new techniques
we're<00:02:45.920> also<00:02:46.189> able<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.939> give<00:02:47.299> very<00:02:47.900> good

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
we're also able to give very good

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.649 
we're also able to give very good
reconstructive<00:02:49.040> results<00:02:49.730> due<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.450> fact

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
reconstructive results due the fact

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.750 
reconstructive results due the fact
we've<00:02:50.989> actually<00:02:51.260> developed<00:02:51.920> techniques<00:02:52.430> to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
we've actually developed techniques to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.270 
we've actually developed techniques to
do<00:02:52.940> nipple<00:02:53.359> sparing<00:02:53.510> mastectomy<00:02:54.280> which

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
do nipple sparing mastectomy which

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.729 
do nipple sparing mastectomy which
allows<00:02:55.639> women<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.269> undergo<00:02:56.629> mastectomy<00:02:56.989> but

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
allows women to undergo mastectomy but

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.699 
allows women to undergo mastectomy but
keep<00:02:58.010> their<00:02:58.310> entire<00:02:59.079> skin<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.290> their<00:03:00.409> breast

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
keep their entire skin of their breast

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.640 
keep their entire skin of their breast
and<00:03:00.980> also<00:03:01.310> their<00:03:01.519> nipple<00:03:02.109> not<00:03:03.109> only<00:03:03.470> are<00:03:03.590> we

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
and also their nipple not only are we

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.589 
and also their nipple not only are we
really<00:03:04.459> concerned<00:03:04.939> about<00:03:05.299> breast

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
really concerned about breast

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.599 
really concerned about breast
reconstruction<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.680> having<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.099> patients

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
reconstruction and having the patients

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.699 
reconstruction and having the patients
feel<00:03:07.819> that<00:03:08.090> after<00:03:08.269> surgery<00:03:08.709> everything's

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
feel that after surgery everything's

feel that after surgery everything's
going<00:03:10.099> quite<00:03:10.370> well<00:03:10.400> we're<00:03:10.909> also<00:03:11.060> quite

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
going quite well we're also quite

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.289 
going quite well we're also quite

concerned about their quality of life
we've<00:03:14.299> done<00:03:14.569> various<00:03:15.079> studies<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:15.980> far<00:03:16.010> here

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
we've done various studies so far here

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
life of patients and what happens after

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.379 
life of patients and what happens after
they're<00:03:21.139> treated<00:03:21.530> with<00:03:21.680> breast<00:03:21.980> cancer<00:03:22.389> we

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
they're treated with breast cancer we

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.180 
they're treated with breast cancer we
find<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:24.049> is<00:03:24.109> an<00:03:24.379> important<00:03:24.980> component

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190
