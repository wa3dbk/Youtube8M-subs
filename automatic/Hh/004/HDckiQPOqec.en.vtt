other schools that have been recruiting
very<00:02:14.240> hard<00:02:14.480> they're<00:02:14.990> still<00:02:15.260> right<00:02:15.440> there<00:02:15.470> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
very hard they're still right there the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.470 
very hard they're still right there the
level<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.370> Ryan's<00:02:16.730> recruitment<00:02:17.209> has

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
level of Ryan's recruitment has

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.000 
level of Ryan's recruitment has
certainly<00:02:17.810> heightened<00:02:18.200> expectations<00:02:18.860> for

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
certainly heightened expectations for

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.710 
certainly heightened expectations for
Anna<00:02:19.280> prep<00:02:19.490> coming<00:02:19.790> into<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.180> season<00:02:20.390> I

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
Anna prep coming into this season I

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.870 
Anna prep coming into this season I
think<00:02:21.110> just<00:02:21.440> with<00:02:21.650> my<00:02:21.800> recruiting<00:02:22.130> alone<00:02:22.520> we

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
think just with my recruiting alone we

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.270 
think just with my recruiting alone we
were<00:02:23.360> put<00:02:23.630> at<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.840> higher<00:02:24.080> education<00:02:24.740> to<00:02:24.950> go

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
were put at a higher education to go

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.070 
were put at a higher education to go
further<00:02:25.550> I'm<00:02:26.240> expecting<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:26.750> beat<00:02:26.959> those

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
further I'm expecting that beat those

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.870 
further I'm expecting that beat those
teams<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.650> we're<00:02:28.100> gonna<00:02:28.190> be<00:02:28.340> disappointed<00:02:28.790> if

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
teams and we're gonna be disappointed if

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.310 
teams and we're gonna be disappointed if
we<00:02:28.940> don't<00:02:29.120> we<00:02:29.450> have<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.570> young<00:02:29.750> team<00:02:29.780> again

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
we don't we have a young team again

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.720 
we don't we have a young team again
because<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.770> lot<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:30.950> us<00:02:31.040> guys<00:02:31.190> got<00:02:31.459> some<00:02:31.610> good

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
because a lot of us guys got some good

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.850 
because a lot of us guys got some good
experience<00:02:32.150> last<00:02:32.360> year<00:02:32.450> hopefully<00:02:33.230> maybe

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
experience last year hopefully maybe

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.470 
experience last year hopefully maybe
some<00:02:34.310> good<00:02:34.459> things<00:02:34.640> do<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:34.820> have<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.150> your<00:02:35.239> gut

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
some good things do you have in your gut

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.580 
some good things do you have in your gut
you<00:02:35.630> don't<00:02:35.780> say<00:02:35.989> now<00:02:36.140> with<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.350> having<00:02:36.500> your

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
you don't say now with you having your

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.900 
you don't say now with you having your
gut<00:02:36.830> what<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.280> eat<00:02:37.400> with<00:02:37.580> school<00:02:37.790> you're

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
gut what to eat with school you're

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.970 
gut what to eat with school you're
leaning<00:02:38.090> towards<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.650> can't<00:02:39.650> really<00:02:39.769> say

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
leaning towards I can't really say

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.770 
leaning towards I can't really say
anybody<00:02:40.430> I'm<00:02:40.580> leaning<00:02:40.820> towards<00:02:41.150> because<00:02:41.510> I

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
anybody I'm leaning towards because I

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.390 
anybody I'm leaning towards because I
keep<00:02:41.959> getting<00:02:42.320> more<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.530> more<00:02:42.680> schools<00:02:43.040> and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
keep getting more and more schools and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.330 
keep getting more and more schools and
it<00:02:44.030> seems<00:02:44.269> like<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:45.140> level<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.070> schools

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
it seems like the level of the schools

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.340 
it seems like the level of the schools
continues<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:46.940> increase<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:47.450> hopefully<00:02:48.110> this

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
continues to increase so hopefully this

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.690 
continues to increase so hopefully this
time<00:02:48.500> next<00:02:48.709> year<00:02:48.830> I'll<00:02:48.980> have<00:02:49.010> about<00:02:49.310> final

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
time next year I'll have about final

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.910 
time next year I'll have about final
five<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.570> really<00:02:50.840> good<00:02:50.959> idea<00:02:51.110> of<00:02:51.500> maybe

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
five and a really good idea of maybe

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.590 
five and a really good idea of maybe
cutting<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.430> down<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.790> final<00:02:53.000> three<00:02:53.269> or<00:02:53.420> two

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
cutting it down to a final three or two

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.930 
cutting it down to a final three or two
hopefully<00:02:54.380> make<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.560> decision<00:02:54.980> before<00:02:55.100> high

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
hopefully make a decision before high

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.760 
hopefully make a decision before high
school<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.239> have

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
school you have

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.830
