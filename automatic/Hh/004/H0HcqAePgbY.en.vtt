00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.870
 Today is play 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.780
 I have transferred 3 imacs until now 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:17.880
 I have never used a macbook, even my macbook pro 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:22.770
 Although I of course want want without using the macbook air 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.370
 After all, it is why not remove desktop and think of video editing 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:30.430
 In notebook How to mower 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:36.310
 1 week little between the video entered the do You're the place is now Rondo becomes Mako and 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.360
 It 's a big problem to take a backup of the data 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.050
 What 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.360
 There is also a possibility that maybe gone about 1 day 100 giga Toka poor if two 100 giga 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.190
 Forgive d 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.390
 It's a bit unrealistic to buy and take 20 cards and 30 cards 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.340
 After all 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.650
 It will be a combination of a laptop computer and an external mobile hard disk 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.130
 And I wonder if 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:05.110
 If the time is enough, it will be a simple video 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.220
 Edit in situ in imob and I hope I could be crap up from local 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.790
 I think 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:15.070
 Definitely think about it and still think that it is a notebook 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.640
 Of course I want to make my luggage as light as possible macbook air 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:23.780
 It will be kana 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:28.760
 No matter how you think about it, it's not time to buy macbook air right now 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.930
 As you know, as soon as 12 inches of macbook air of macbook air come out 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.659
 It is said 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:43.619
 Well the story of the inch is aside, so I'm sure it will be close to model change now 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.850
 It is the point of stupidity to buy, but perhaps a new model will be announced while in London 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.049
 think 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.459
 I've considered a lot of models of mold loss that has been maintained in the apple store 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.650
 How to buy cheap 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:02:01.530
 You can buy it cheap at Yahoo auction or sell it as soon as you get it new and come back 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.530
 It is the result that we thought in various ways this time 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.160
 I rented it 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:15.470
 Maa's 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:21.190

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.550
 4 minutes 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.870
 I was so surprised that 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.870
 We have entered the winter in bag 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.920

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.370
 As a matter of course, it has an ac adapter 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.659
 It and usb connection 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.350

 It Is not There is also a do means I mean Tsu rental 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.800
 I just searched for me, but for corporate use 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:30.340
 There are quite a few companies that rent Macs, though 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:33.090
 I company is do I not so much that rental in the personal direction I this time CO., LTD video Ei 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.480

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.340
 Well on the 11th, it's okay to be cool 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.280
 Yes 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.480
 I wonder if you should hide it because it contains a password 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.480
 Is power coming 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:57.180
 It starts properly 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:59.100
 As I mentioned earlier, it is a bare model that has not been customized in the 11-day model 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.970
 It's a cheap guy 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.740
 In spring 2014 model because it is the last minute 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:10.650
 It is a current product 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:16.110
 It arrived today and the rental price is 10,370 yen at 14 nights or 12 nights. 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:22.800
 + An insurance-like person called security was 1037 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:23.780
 In fact my trip itself is 7 nights 9 days but I borrow it with some leeway before and after 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.380
 The 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.160
 It is easy not to charge even if it is bought with this new item 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:35.580
 That's 12 nights and it's just 10,000 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:40.110
 It's a pretty good business, but it is very helpful. 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.430
 In fact, it's also quite full 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.840
 Too many things to think about that 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:53.140
 Oh, and from now on the minimum required apps 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:59.020
 Insert the material into it now and read it from the sd card and attach it externally 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:00.040
 Save to hard disk and connect it to imac to transfer data 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.449
 Copy 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.520
 Edit at Final Cut Pro at 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:14.389
 I have to check the operation from now on to the point where I can 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:15.979
 I'm going to get ready for the departure Well, this time I can rent a Mac when it's too late 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.849
 Was the talk Tteyuu by 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:22.270
 Well, maybe it's okay to put it in the corner of your head 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.270
 Well then
