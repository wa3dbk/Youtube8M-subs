00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.029
 hello i am rebecca of elf child 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:06.520
 Berlin 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.870
 and since the autumn is approaching, I thought as I 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.580
 you also need a nice cap and 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.260
 this beautiful beanie this beanie 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.820
 the bestseller in my shop there 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.890
 You can also buy them as sewing patterns and 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.320
 because a lot of people ask what does im mean 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.000
 Do not break the little bit like doing 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.070
 I thought of it above the bend 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.330
 I'll show it to you now 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.710
 you need that for that 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.720
 you can just cut in pattern 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.670
 Buy my shop and in nice jersey 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.270
 fabric and then we can too 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.369
 to cut 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.409
 First of all, he works the fabric once 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.769
 in the middle together and then you have 

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.350
 even the break so this piece 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.120
 Here 's the break 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.370
 and then you put the pattern there 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.639
 is also break again so to speak 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.659
 in the high on the fabric and then you can 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:48.850
 even to cut 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.159
 sometimes the jersey is happy here 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.489
 down can be prevented that one 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.559
 is then really nice steam again 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.809
 under ironed in my section has the 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:03.449
 hold no seam admitted I cut 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.449
 now directly with 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.670
 for all who are unsure and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.260
 not simply hand so free up 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.540
 you want to be able to do that, of course 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:20.230
 Also , I will draw it now 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.860
 flap apart and I so you 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.800
 You would already be a citizen 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.700
 guess a little bit 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.620
 and there still has to be a bunch 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.540
 so cut this one here 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.860
 piece of cap then the cap 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.780
 pretty tight on the head sits 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.250
 I've already prepared that 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.830
 then looks for example at 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.720
 my daughter's head circumference of 52 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.270
 centimeters I cut the picture 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.440
 with 50 centimeters so two 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.870
 centimeters less 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.220
 that I stretch that and yes it is in the 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.720
 Sitting around it makes you do that 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.700
 bit small it's like a rubber band 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.570
 pulls out yes we catch with the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.410
 covenant 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.300
 it will be cracked again so that 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.760
 the beautiful side so the right side 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.850
 lies down and lays the fabric 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.540
 superimposed read here now just 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.340
 I do it all with one whole 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.620
 normal've just random and 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.620
 stinglings from 2 to 2 5 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:22.970
 now I have the left here so the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:28.110
 ugly side and celebrated them together 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.549
 so that the nice side is outside and 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.280
 Now you can see already a 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.420
 bÃ¼ndchen 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.730
 now the baby will be back 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.500
 cut in the breast again 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.409
 Right on the right so the nice side 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.439
 lying and I had a jersey here 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.090
 he keeps himself terribly stuck i 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.319
 Just do it a bit with it 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.659
 the new result is just as nice 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.480
 neat is bini that is 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.930
 now so first the outside 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.930
 is sewn 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.810
 I'm doing here like one 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.790
 conventional sewing machine so first 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.519
 the burr engraving and then I still do 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.260
 times with an overlook the supply 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.730
 stich if you can not overlook 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.930
 you also with a normal machine 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.000
 actually a small one 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.480
 zigzagging around with the umpteenth time 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.989
 again enchant and go from 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.989
 back 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.909
 I'll put it this way with you now 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.159
 you know exactly what you do 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.629
 here, so to speak, the opposite one 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.040
 Side of the seam we are just approaching 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.499
 have closed 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.760
 Now we close the triangle 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:36.159
 dresden turns right again on the right 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.500
 my tips together and now sew 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.500
 from here to the top the piece 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:50.569
 Now you can these two seams here 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.299
 put on each other and then 1 once 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.069
 I always like to go around 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.549
 here's another French jerk 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.049
 purely 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.700
 I'll just do that here 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.819
 This again you take for it 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:08.709
 Just lay down such a piece of residue 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:08.709
 it here with in between and sewn 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.739
 now you are worried about the whole seams 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.359
 Just once again with a zigzag stitch 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.829
 or with a overlook machine 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.950
 if it has supplied then it will see 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.470
 so now you take the bunch 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.530
 there is always the big question how 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.390
 now comes the little cap so that 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.460
 looks nice too shows me that 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.510
 Bundle the beautiful side outside 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.220
 once bent and here is the cap 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.480
 the long we fooled just before 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.990
 have done at the beginning 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:47.070
 now it will be close to the covenant 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.450
 put on and pinned now 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.030
 we can start to take 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.760
 You always have to be careful that all over 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.240
 three fabric lay neatly on each other 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.250
 lie 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.220
 anyone who is unsure of that can do it 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.150
 Of course, just get stuck and go 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.150
 go back 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.949
 and always the covenant part so far 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.419
 take to take because that's one 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.419
 a bit shorter than that with the part 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.120
 I arrived downstairs next to the 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.870
 pin out again now only needs 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.419
 still here 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.310
 the fabric will be supplied and then 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.630
 also complete as never finished and 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.460
 now the eleventh child can bini 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.480
 French ease easy 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.760
 be turned around 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:34.270
 and that's done and my name is 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:36.320
 small enough then it fits her too 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.680
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.680
 check
