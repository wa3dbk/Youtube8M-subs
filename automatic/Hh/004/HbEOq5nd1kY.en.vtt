00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
that kind of stuff I have to think at

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.770 
that kind of stuff I have to think at
the<00:00:53.530> end<00:00:53.560> of<00:00:53.770> the<00:00:53.860> day<00:00:54.180> there's<00:00:55.180> more<00:00:55.450> people

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
the end of the day there's more people

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.150 
the end of the day there's more people
on<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:56.020> planet<00:00:56.260> now<00:00:56.530> than<00:00:56.740> there<00:00:56.890> ever<00:00:56.920> has

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
on the planet now than there ever has

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160 
on the planet now than there ever has
been<00:00:57.310> so<00:00:57.790> somebody's<00:00:58.420> getting<00:00:58.720> the<00:00:58.810> records

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
been so somebody's getting the records

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.660 
been so somebody's getting the records
somehow<00:00:59.590> so<00:00:59.860> I<00:00:59.890> think<00:00:59.980> when<00:01:00.310> you<00:01:00.460> make<00:01:00.640> it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
somehow so I think when you make it

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.880 
somehow so I think when you make it
obviously<00:01:01.270> we'd<00:01:01.750> like<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.110> get<00:01:02.260> paid<00:01:02.470> for<00:01:02.770> them

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
obviously we'd like to get paid for them

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.490 
obviously we'd like to get paid for them
so<00:01:03.070> we<00:01:03.220> can<00:01:03.400> pay<00:01:04.299> back<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.540> money<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:05.049> cost<00:01:05.290> us

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
so we can pay back the money it cost us

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.469 
so we can pay back the money it cost us
to<00:01:05.650> make<00:01:05.830> it<00:01:05.860> and<00:01:06.130> hopefully<00:01:06.310> you<00:01:06.640> know<00:01:06.820> pay

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
to make it and hopefully you know pay
