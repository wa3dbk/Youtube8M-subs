automatic<00:00:16.049> diamonds<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.310> let's<00:00:17.640> get<00:00:17.760> into

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
automatic diamonds so let's get into

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.359 
automatic diamonds so let's get into
seeing<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.600> works<00:00:18.740> this<00:00:19.740> machine<00:00:20.130> works

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
seeing how it works this machine works

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.519 
seeing how it works this machine works
by<00:00:20.580> automatically<00:00:21.150> creating<00:00:21.720> all<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.260> things

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
by automatically creating all the things

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.170 
by automatically creating all the things
needed<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.949> make<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> culture<00:00:23.519> which<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:24.060> be

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
needed to make a culture which can be

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.120 
needed to make a culture which can be
compressed<00:00:24.420> into<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.750> diamond<00:00:25.109> there<00:00:26.070> were

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
compressed into a diamond there were

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.349 
compressed into a diamond there were
three<00:00:26.160> things<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.640> needs<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.910> find<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> way<00:00:27.210> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
three things I needs to find a way to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.050 
three things I needs to find a way to
automate<00:00:27.750> called<00:00:28.230> us<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.500> flint<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.830> obsidian

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060

I use them was for youth of assuring you
the<00:00:38.250> different<00:00:38.579> sections<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.750> lets<00:00:40.020> take<00:00:40.379> a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the different sections so lets take a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.100 
the different sections so lets take a
look<00:00:40.620> HD<00:00:41.040> separate<00:00:41.399> parts<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.510> coldest<00:00:42.899> was

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
look HD separate parts the coldest was

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
look HD separate parts the coldest was
the<00:00:43.230> hardest<00:00:43.500> part<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.770> work<00:00:43.950> out<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.340> it's

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the hardest part to work out but it's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.069 
the hardest part to work out but it's
possible<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.120> create<00:00:45.300> coldest<00:00:45.690> from<00:00:45.899> blaze

that will work fine so now let's have a
look<00:01:36.689> at<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> way<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.200> produce<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> flips

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130

there<00:03:48.800> we<00:03:48.920> go<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:49.280> hundred<00:03:49.880> percent<00:03:50.060> automatic

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
there we go a hundred percent automatic

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.960 
there we go a hundred percent automatic
diamonds<00:03:51.110> production<00:03:51.590> I'm<00:03:52.520> going<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.850> give

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
diamonds production I'm going to give

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.850 
diamonds production I'm going to give
you<00:03:53.030> some<00:03:53.060> information<00:03:53.300> on<00:03:53.930> statistics<00:03:54.710> now

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
you some information on statistics now

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.270 
you some information on statistics now
about<00:03:55.520> how<00:03:55.550> many<00:03:56.000> diamonds<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.750> can<00:03:56.930> produce

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
about how many diamonds you can produce

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.920 
about how many diamonds you can produce
it<00:03:58.280> will<00:03:58.460> take<00:03:58.640> 16<00:03:59.060> minutes<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.510> be<00:03:59.630> used<00:03:59.810> upon

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
it will take 16 minutes to be used upon

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.430 
it will take 16 minutes to be used upon
diamond<00:04:00.530> this<00:04:01.400> is<00:04:01.610> due<00:04:01.820> to<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:02.090> fact<00:04:02.240> that<00:04:02.600> 64

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
diamond this is due to the fact that 64

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.640 
diamond this is due to the fact that 64
coal<00:04:03.790> dust<00:04:04.790> well<00:04:05.300> take<00:04:05.690> 60<00:04:06.290> minutes<00:04:06.560> to

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
coal dust well take 60 minutes to

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.280 
coal dust well take 60 minutes to
electrolyze<00:04:07.120> as<00:04:08.120> it<00:04:08.360> takes<00:04:08.510> 30<00:04:08.720> seconds<00:04:09.200> to

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
electrolyze as it takes 30 seconds to

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.250 
electrolyze as it takes 30 seconds to
create<00:04:09.560> two<00:04:09.910> so<00:04:10.910> one<00:04:11.360> diamond<00:04:11.750> can<00:04:11.960> the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
create two so one diamond can the

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.010 
create two so one diamond can the
production<00:04:12.650> time<00:04:12.860> can<00:04:13.370> be<00:04:13.640> decreased<00:04:14.570> quite

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
production time can be decreased quite

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.010 
production time can be decreased quite
easily<00:04:15.290> by<00:04:15.710> adding<00:04:16.010> more<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.700> more<00:04:17.150> or<00:04:17.870> less

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
easily by adding more and more or less

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.130 
easily by adding more and more or less
able<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.470> be<00:04:18.560> more<00:04:19.030> electrolyzers<00:04:20.140> although

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
able to be more electrolyzers although

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.930 
able to be more electrolyzers although
this<00:04:21.530> setup<00:04:21.770> here<00:04:22.040> will<00:04:22.280> only<00:04:22.520> actually

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
this setup here will only actually

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.130 
this setup here will only actually
support<00:04:23.270> two<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.720> three<00:04:23.960> maximum

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
support two to three maximum

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.320 
support two to three maximum
electrolyzers<00:04:25.070> because<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.610> user<00:04:25.760> no<00:04:26.030> fault

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
electrolyzers because the user no fault

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.220 
electrolyzers because the user no fault
of<00:04:26.420> power<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:28.610> means<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:28.970> overall<00:04:29.390> 90

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
of power that means that overall 90

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.290 
of power that means that overall 90
diamonds<00:04:30.620> will<00:04:30.740> be<00:04:30.950> created<00:04:31.340> every<00:04:31.580> 24<00:04:32.030> hours

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
diamonds will be created every 24 hours

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.030 
diamonds will be created every 24 hours
so<00:04:32.840> if<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:33.050> have<00:04:33.170> this<00:04:33.290> constantly<00:04:33.740> running

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
so if you have this constantly running

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.800 
so if you have this constantly running
