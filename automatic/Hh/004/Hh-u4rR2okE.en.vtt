00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
 chapter 15 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.180
 I also declare to you brothers the gospel that I have preached to you 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.129
 which you also received in which also perseveres iss 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.960
 by which also if you hold the word that I have preached to you 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.609
 I'm saved if I did not believe stays in vain 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.659
 because first I taught you what I also received 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.179
 that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.739
 and that he was buried and that he rose again on the third day according to the scriptures 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.800
 and that appeared makes fans 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.670
 and then at 12 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.910
 later appeared more than 500 Alava brothers 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.989
 of which many still live 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.680
 and others are already sleeping 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.560
 later appeared to jacobo 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.740
 then to all the apostles 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.559
 and the last of all as an abortifacient 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.060
 it has seemed to me 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.100
 because I am the smallest of the apostles that I am not worthy to be 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 called an apostle because he persecuted the church of God 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.199
 but by the grace of God I am what I am 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.850
 and his grace has not been in vain with me 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.510
 before I worked more than all of them but not me 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.990
 if not the grace of God with me 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.119
 because that is me or they are them 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.470
 so we preach 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.390
 and so you have believed 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.479
 but if you preach Christ who rose from the dead as they say 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.840
 some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.710
 because if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither will Christ be resurrected 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.190
 and if Christ did not rise 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.670
 they go to that then our preaching 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.930
 bana your faith is fine 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.630
 and we are false allies witnesses of God 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.130
 because we have testified of God that he resurrected Christ 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.170
 to which he did not rise if in truth the dead do not resurrect 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.210
 because if the dead do not rise again, Christ did not rise again 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.110
 and if Christ did not rise 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.110
 your faith is futile now you are in your sins 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.740
 then also those who slept in Christ perished 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.390
 if in this life we ​​only wait in Christ 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.580
 we are the most worthy of commiseration of all men 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.439
 more now Christ has risen from the dead 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.340
 first fruits of those who slept that fact 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.009
 because as death entered by a man 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.199
 also by a man the resurrection of the dead 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.979
 because just as in Adam all die also in Christ all were direct 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:18.889
 Charles 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.579
 but each in its proper place christ the first fruits 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.579
 then those who are Christ's coming 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.700
 then the end 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.160
 when I gave the kingdom to god and father 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.060
 when all dominion has suppressed all authority and power 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.279
 because - he said - is that the king or until he has put all his enemies 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.169
 under your feet 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.169
 and the last enemy that will be destroyed is death 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.959
 because all things held her under her feet 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:51.039
 and when he says that all things have been subjected to him clearly he 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.039
 except that he who subjected all things to him 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.719
 but after all things are subject to him 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.010
 then also the son himself will hold on to the one who subjected him to all 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.869
 things 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.359
 so that God is all in all 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.399
 else 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:08.730
 there are those who are baptized for the dead 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.529
 without any way the dead resuscitate 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.269
 because he can be baptized by the dead 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.559
 and because we are in danger at all times 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:21.499
 I assure you brothers for the glory that I have in our Lord 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:22.479
 Jesus Christ 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.479
 what every day dies or 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.389
 If as a man, battle in Ephesus against wild beasts 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.579
 who takes advantage if the dead do not resuscitate 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.809
 Let's eat and drink because tomorrow we'll die 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:34.899
 noah kings 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.949
 bad conversations corrupt good manners 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.579
 in front of life mind and do not sin ellis 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.819
 because some do not know God 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.099
 to your shame I say it 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.249
 but of some 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.419
 how to resurrect the dead with what body they will come 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:52.179
 foolish 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:54.489
 what you sow is not directed and k 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.239
 if he does not die before 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.759
 and what you sow is not the body that has to come out if not the bare grain either 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.559
 of wheat of another grain 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:05.120
 but God gives him the body as he wanted 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.079
 and even the seed his own body 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.230
 not all flesh is the same flesh 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.619
 if not that one flesh is that of men 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:16.079
 another carmel of the beasts another that of the fish 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.809
 and another one of the birds 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.749
 and there celestial bodies and earthly bodies 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.070
 but one is the glory of the heavenly 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.139
 and another that of the terrestrials 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.659
 one is the glory of the sun another the glory of the moon 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.789
 and another the glory of the stars 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.590
 because one star is different from another in glory 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.469
 So also is the resurrection of the dead 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.139
 corruption is sown 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.479
 resuscitate to hanin corruption 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.030
 it is sown in dishonor 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.699
 will rise in glory 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.250
 sow weakness 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.999
 will rise in power 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:50.479
 If sow animal body, will be resurrect a spiritual body 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.139
 there is no body or evil and there is a spiritual body 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:55.840
 so it is written 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.879
 was made the first man adam living soul 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.189
 the last adam spirit vivifying 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:05.170
 more respirito to the animal is not first 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.020
 then the spiritual 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.870
 the first men of the earth 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.770
 earthly 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.879
 the second man who is of the Lord 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:13.279
 from the sky 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.490
 what the earthly 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.259
 such also the terrestrials 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.259
 and what is the summer such also the heavenly ones 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.070
 and just as we have brought the image of the earthly 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.379
 we will also bring the image of the celestial 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:27.930
 but this I say brothers 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.509
 that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.539
 nor inherited corruption and corruption 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.539
 here I tell you a mystery 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.070
 we will not all sleep 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.180
 but we will all be transformed 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.330
 in a moment 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.580
 in the blink of an eye to the final trumpet 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.449
 because the trumpet will be blown and the dead were resurrected incorruptible 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.949
 and we will be transformed 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.550
 because it is necessary for this corruptible to wear incorruption 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.099
 and this mortal is clothed with immortality 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.800
 and when this corruptible has dressed in impropriety 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.960
 and this mortal has put on immortality 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.879
 then the word that is written will be fulfilled 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.689
 soro vida is death in victoria 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:13.849
 where is your sting or death 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.150
 where eleven neat your victory 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.729
 since the sting of death is sin 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.409
 and the power of sin the law 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.449
 more thanks be to God 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.449
 that gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:29.330
 so my beloved brothers 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.539
 be firm and constant 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.029
 growing in the work of the Lord always 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:36.889
 knowing that your work in the Lord is not in
