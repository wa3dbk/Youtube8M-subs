00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 so that's how to print very 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.549
 simply in airprint way cable with 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:18.869
 an epson stylus sx525wd so just 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:24.289
 to take your ipad and you do 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:30.510
 send print via printer 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:36.079
 printed they send it sends a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.079
 side we receive from each other 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.050
 until then everything is going well 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.149
 make noise 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.230
 this is a bit long 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.270
 knits then fine end of paper or 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.090
 stuffing here loaded paper or remove 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:12.960
 corner papers so this is the paper 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:17.970
 there's the paper that's set 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.900
 it's a little hard to adjust says well 1 1 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:26.700
 you set on the sides and that one 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.039
 here is that it's done then check 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 if there are jams then obviously there 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.140
 there we do not have to stomp 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.700
 make sure there are jams 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.780
 would be at the limit there behind 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.440
 here behind and nothing has been 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.130
 there behind so the form and gently 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.110
 said to go back to the beginning so start 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.869
 then swore star says press 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.420
 star sent jamie sector that's it 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.170
 do not come back so that's already a little 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.079
 swelling could once again we went 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.640
 a lot of acclimatization do not know what he 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:08.070
 happens things turn it turns 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:13.680
 early it's been two minutes if that 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:16.200
 that I launched the thing it thinks know 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.959
 not what's happening she's new 27 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.820

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:26.579
 epson stylus sx130 5 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.060
 wd So here the he thought again 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.620
 it's not what he does 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.540
 then avenge still support orange a 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.579
 since he says to press there to start 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:42.900
 we started marked started at pace it's okay 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:46.190

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:54.170
 actually easy he received the info 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.170
 what olala that always turns out good 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.470
 so things are happening to 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.910
 inside a gas plant 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:07.160
