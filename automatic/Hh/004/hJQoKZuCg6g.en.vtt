00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.560
 Hello, Welcome to Modest Tastes Cuisine 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.280
 in this section we will reach Rize, our famous city with tea gardens 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.280
 and "The Delight of Enişte" 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.760
 But as always before the materials 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.720
 half a pack of butter or margarine (125 grams) 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.720
 1 cup powdered sugar 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 1 tea cup of milk 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 1 piece of egg 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.880
 and as much flour as possible 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.640
 we have learned the necessary ingredients for cookie cookies 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.120
 we also melted our oil in the meantime 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.440
 while our oil is hot, we transfer it to kneading bowl 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.720
 immediately upon powder 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720
 not using powdered sugar 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.920
 melting sugar with finger tips 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.360
 15 minutes in this situation 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.680
 Mix if you have more time 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 add milk now 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.800
 we continue to mix with milk for a short time 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 now we're breaking the egg 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.240
 and a little more mixing 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:49.120
 slowly start to add flour until the dough 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.080
 our dough came to a good consistency 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.080
 Let's take it out now 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.640
 and divide it into 3 parts 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.480
 extend each piece in cylindrical shape 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.360
 now we're cutting 3 fingers 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.840
 now we put the oil paper on the tray 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.160
 in the meantime we started heating the oven at 190 degrees 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.240
 Now, finally, on our delight ... 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.680
 3 scratches in parallel 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.280
 this is not the mark of the cookie 3 scratch, without 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.080
 Now we give it to the oven that we have preheated to 190 degrees 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.720
 and cooking for 15 minutes 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.040
 15 minutes later 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.000
 stew 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.760
 Now is the service time 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.560
 a simple and delicious cookie 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.560
 you will notice when you try 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.680
 no longer send it to the side of the girl side of the girl 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.680
 so we can put it on the plate 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.880
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
 We shared Rize's recipe "Enişte Lokumu" 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.800
 I wish you to try and remember us as soon as possible 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.120
 Goodbye sir ...
