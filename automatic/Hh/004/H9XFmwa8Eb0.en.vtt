00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
6 project drifting series episodes so

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.840 
6 project drifting series episodes so
hopefully<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.160> guys<00:00:38.220> are<00:00:38.280> enjoying<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.730> new

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
hopefully you guys are enjoying a new

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
hopefully you guys are enjoying a new
setup<00:00:39.180> or<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.449> basically<00:00:39.780> show<00:00:39.960> off<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.620> stats

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
setup or I basically show off the stats

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.729 
setup or I basically show off the stats
and<00:00:41.220> whatever<00:00:41.370> off<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.910> car<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:43.470> it

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and whatever off the car I think it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.139 
and whatever off the car I think it
looks<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.160> lot<00:00:44.280> better<00:00:44.399> than<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> previous<00:00:44.850> one

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
looks a lot better than the previous one

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.460 
looks a lot better than the previous one
where<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.720> literally<00:00:46.079> go<00:00:46.199> through<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
where I just literally go through the

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.590 
where I just literally go through the
menu<00:00:46.739> sort<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:47.760> little<00:00:47.879> bit<00:00:48.059> boring<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
menu sort of a little bit boring and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.420 
menu sort of a little bit boring and
bland<00:00:48.839> so<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.199> thought<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.980> know<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:50.339> bit

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
bland so I thought you know a little bit

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.189 
bland so I thought you know a little bit
of<00:00:50.519> lightening<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.210> was<00:00:51.629> needed<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.110> this

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
of lightening up was needed for this

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.500 
of lightening up was needed for this
series<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.769> hopefully<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:54.000> helped<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.420> out

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
series and hopefully that helped it out

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.910 
series and hopefully that helped it out
a<00:00:54.570> little<00:00:54.780> bit<00:00:54.930> right<00:00:55.320> now<00:00:55.470> I<00:00:55.500> still<00:00:55.710> want<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
a little bit right now I still want to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.079 
a little bit right now I still want to
talk<00:00:56.100> over<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> gameplay<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:56.940> it's

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
talk over the gameplay because it's

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.399 
talk over the gameplay because it's
someone<00:00:57.300> explain<00:00:57.659> to<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.839> guys<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.110> talk<00:00:58.260> to

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
someone explain to you guys to talk to

00:00:58.409 --> 00:00:59.869 
someone explain to you guys to talk to
you<00:00:58.470> guys<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.589> little<00:00:58.769> bit<00:00:58.890> about<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.159> car<00:00:59.309> so

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you guys a little bit about the car so

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.460 
you guys a little bit about the car so
this<00:01:00.150> little<00:01:00.449> bit<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.720> always<00:01:01.050> gonna<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.350> in

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
this little bit is always gonna be in

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.799 
this little bit is always gonna be in
the<00:01:01.559> videos<00:01:01.860> but<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> starting<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the videos but I think the starting a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.350 
the videos but I think the starting a
bit<00:01:03.960> looks<00:01:04.410> pretty<00:01:04.890> decent<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.759> think<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
bit looks pretty decent and I think that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
bit looks pretty decent and I think that
should<00:01:06.690> be<00:01:06.899> a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.619> bit<00:01:07.710> better<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.070> my<00:01:08.190> for

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
should be a little bit better for my for

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.710 
should be a little bit better for my for
my<00:01:08.580> project<00:01:08.880> rifting<00:01:09.090> episodes<00:01:09.420> hopefully

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
my project rifting episodes hopefully

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.880 
my project rifting episodes hopefully
you<00:01:09.810> guys<00:01:09.899> like<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.259> tell<00:01:10.410> me<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> comments

if you guys like if you don't then I

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.389 
if you guys like if you don't then I
will<00:01:13.110> definitely<00:01:13.320> go<00:01:13.649> back<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> old<00:01:14.190> set

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
will definitely go back to the old set

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:15.980 
will definitely go back to the old set
up<00:01:14.520> its<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.940> you<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.539> does<00:01:15.660> really<00:01:15.840> matter

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
up its it you know it does really matter

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.340 
up its it you know it does really matter
to<00:01:16.200> me<00:01:16.229> but<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.910> so<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.960> really

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
to me but I like it so I think I really

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.460 
to me but I like it so I think I really
wanted<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.280> stay<00:01:21.060> anyway<00:01:21.780> let's<00:01:22.200> talk<00:01:22.289> a<00:01:22.350> bit

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
wanted to stay anyway let's talk a bit

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.469 
wanted to stay anyway let's talk a bit
about<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.860> cache<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.520> course<00:01:23.940> a<00:01:24.119> has<00:01:24.240> over

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
about the cache so of course a has over

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.669 
about the cache so of course a has over
a<00:01:24.509> thousand<00:01:24.840> horsepower<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.560> gonna

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
a thousand horsepower so this is gonna

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.440 
a thousand horsepower so this is gonna
be<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.130> more<00:01:26.250> difficult<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:26.789> tricky

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
be a little bit more difficult or tricky

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.389 
be a little bit more difficult or tricky
to<00:01:27.630> drift<00:01:27.899> in<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.950> compared<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
to drift in you know compared to the

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.450 
to drift in you know compared to the
lower<00:01:29.640> horsepower<00:01:30.090> cars<00:01:30.330> so<00:01:30.539> I<00:01:31.229> didn't<00:01:31.950> decide

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
lower horsepower cars so I didn't decide

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.070 
lower horsepower cars so I didn't decide
like<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.390> brought<00:01:33.539> up<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> horsepower

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
like if I brought up the horsepower

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.480 
like if I brought up the horsepower
because<00:01:34.440> I<00:01:34.470> did<00:01:34.710> bring<00:01:34.860> down<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.159> horsepower

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
because I did bring down the horsepower

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.980 
because I did bring down the horsepower
at<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.850> stage<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> decided<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> drift<00:01:36.930> with

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
at one stage and I decided to drift with

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.530 
at one stage and I decided to drift with
it<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.380> drifts<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:38.340> fine<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.270> drifts

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
it and I drifts just fine and it drifts

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.510 
it and I drifts just fine and it drifts
very<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:40.079> well<00:01:40.290> how's<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> perfect<00:01:41.159> like

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
very very well how's the perfect like

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.789 
very very well how's the perfect like
amount<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.000> grip<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.530> onto<00:01:43.650> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
amount of grip you can go onto the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.260 
amount of grip you can go onto the
corners<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.250> fast<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.700> want<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.090> whatever

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
corners as fast as you want and whatever

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.700 
corners as fast as you want and whatever
and<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> still<00:01:45.869> have<00:01:45.990> loads<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.259> control<00:01:46.530> over

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and you still have loads of control over

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.080 
and you still have loads of control over
the<00:01:46.770> car<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> tails<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.850> horsepower

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the car but with the tails in horsepower

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.280 
the car but with the tails in horsepower
of<00:01:48.329> course<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.780> take<00:01:48.990> into

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
of course you have to take into

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.859 
of course you have to take into
consideration<00:01:49.439> all<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.520> power<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> when

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
consideration all of that power so when

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.230 
consideration all of that power so when

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
you're gonna know that this is gonna

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.090 
you're gonna know that this is gonna
it's<00:01:57.720> gonna<00:01:57.960> try<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.259> spin<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.979> you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it's gonna try to spin out on you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980 
it's gonna try to spin out on you
because<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.850> obviously<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> thousand

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
because of that obviously a thousand

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.050 
because of that obviously a thousand
horsepower<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.700> it's<00:02:02.700> still<00:02:03.000> very

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
horsepower but it's still very

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.670 
horsepower but it's still very
controllable<00:02:03.780> if<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.229> leave<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.500> with<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
controllable if you leave up with the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.440 
controllable if you leave up with the
standard<00:02:05.189> or<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.399> stock<00:02:05.729> transmission<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
standard or the stock transmission and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.479 
standard or the stock transmission and
just<00:02:06.899> drift<00:02:07.170> around<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.680> third<00:02:08.280> gear

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
just drift around in third gear

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.219 
just drift around in third gear
especially<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.360> track<00:02:09.570> works<00:02:09.840> very

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
especially for this track works very

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
drift on but for the moment on Suzuka it

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.400 
drift on but for the moment on Suzuka it
drifted<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.480> fine<00:02:18.690> with<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.019> standard

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
drifted just fine with the standard

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.890 
drifted just fine with the standard
transmission<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.360> that's<00:02:21.360> pretty<00:02:21.570> much<00:02:21.690> it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
transmission and that's pretty much it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.509 
transmission and that's pretty much it
