you<00:01:18.740> logically<00:01:19.220> speaking<00:01:19.960> no<00:01:20.960> that's<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.710> day

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
you logically speaking no that's a day

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.770

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
so they are smarter than I thought they

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.070 
so they are smarter than I thought they
would<00:01:25.250> be<00:01:25.430> but<00:01:26.420> that's<00:01:26.630> cool
