or<00:01:33.749> something<00:01:34.109> but<00:01:34.319> i<00:01:34.499> think<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.969> it<00:01:36.179> also

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329

or something but i think that it also
helps<00:01:36.749> taste<00:01:37.529> kind<00:01:38.429> of<00:01:38.520> better<00:01:38.849> because<00:01:39.270> water

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
helps taste kind of better because water

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.099 
helps taste kind of better because water
matter<00:01:40.289> itself<00:01:40.649> is<00:01:40.889> sweet<00:01:41.219> but<00:01:41.939> salt<00:01:42.299> kind<00:01:42.990> of

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
matter itself is sweet but salt kind of

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.919 
matter itself is sweet but salt kind of
creates<00:01:43.799> contrast<00:01:44.639> if<00:01:45.419> you<00:01:45.539> know<00:01:45.659> what<00:01:45.749> I<00:01:45.779> mean

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
creates contrast if you know what I mean

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.999 
creates contrast if you know what I mean
so<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.619> idea<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.240> salty<00:01:48.240> water<00:01:48.959> meadow<00:01:49.169> at
