00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
is the power supply and this looks cool

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.470 
is the power supply and this looks cool
I'm<00:00:07.410> upgrading<00:00:07.620> my<00:00:07.859> power<00:00:08.040> supply<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.480> 750

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.340 

the<00:00:41.910> card<00:00:42.149> itself<00:00:42.450> looks<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:42.960> nice<00:00:43.079> like

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the card itself looks really nice like

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.139 
the card itself looks really nice like
this<00:00:43.500> thing<00:00:43.710> looks<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.520> pretty<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.030> know

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
this thing looks it's pretty you know

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.910 
this thing looks it's pretty you know
and<00:00:45.390> then<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.920> thing<00:00:47.160> wait<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:48.030> it

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
and then and this thing wait to see it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.130 
and then and this thing wait to see it
yeah<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> graphics<00:00:50.730> card<00:00:51.020> it's<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
yeah this is the graphics card it's a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.680 
yeah this is the graphics card it's a
it's<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.940> fastest<00:00:54.420> card

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it's it's a like the the fastest card

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.310 
it's it's a like the the fastest card
that<00:00:54.960> Nvidia<00:00:55.920> makes<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> 680<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.719> what

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
that Nvidia makes is the 680 and what

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.340 
that Nvidia makes is the 680 and what
this<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.609> two<00:00:59.969> 680<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.780> put<00:01:00.960> into<00:01:01.079> one

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
this is is it's two 680 is put into one

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.189 
this is is it's two 680 is put into one
card<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> fastest<00:01:02.879> single<00:01:03.660> card<00:01:04.049> in

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
card so it's the fastest single card in

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.730 
card so it's the fastest single card in
the<00:01:04.290> world<00:01:05.510> if<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.720> had<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.080> 680<00:01:07.530> s<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.710> your

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the world if you had to 680 s in your

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
the world if you had to 680 s in your
computer<00:01:08.159> they'd<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.729> little<00:01:09.210> bit<00:01:09.330> faster

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
computer they'd be a little bit faster

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.350 
computer they'd be a little bit faster
than<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:10.950> they<00:01:11.220> these<00:01:11.700> are<00:01:11.760> two<00:01:11.970> 680

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
than this because they these are two 680

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.789 
than this because they these are two 680
s<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.540> been<00:01:12.570> tuned<00:01:12.840> down<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> little<00:01:13.350> bit<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
s have been tuned down a little bit to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.780 
s have been tuned down a little bit to
run<00:01:14.460> more<00:01:14.640> efficiently<00:01:14.880> together<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:16.790> this

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
run more efficiently together and this

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.429 
run more efficiently together and this
is<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> big<00:01:18.150> step<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.720> my<00:01:18.840> last<00:01:19.110> card

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
is a big step up because my last card

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.870 
is a big step up because my last card
was<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> 285<00:01:20.400> which<00:01:21.390> scores<00:01:22.049> about<00:01:22.560> 1500<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.549> 3d

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
was a 285 which scores about 1500 on 3d

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.270 
was a 285 which scores about 1500 on 3d
mark<00:01:24.090> 3d<00:01:24.450> mark<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> program<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.009> kind<00:01:26.220> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
mark 3d mark is a program that kind of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.179 
mark 3d mark is a program that kind of
rates<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.630> graphics<00:01:28.140> cards<00:01:28.470> power<00:01:28.770> your

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
rates your graphics cards power your

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.899 
rates your graphics cards power your
systems<00:01:29.640> graphic<00:01:30.329> power<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
systems graphic power and and the the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.719 
systems graphic power and and the the
285<00:01:33.600> gets<00:01:33.900> about<00:01:34.110> 1500<00:01:34.650> s<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.490> gets

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
285 gets about 1500 s and this gets

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.859 
285 gets about 1500 s and this gets
about<00:01:35.970> 50,000<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.619> roughly<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.780> know

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
about 50,000 so this is roughly you know

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.230 
about 50,000 so this is roughly you know
three<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.220> than<00:01:41.430> three<00:01:41.640> times<00:01:41.939> as

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
three it's more than three times as

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.060 
three it's more than three times as
powerful<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.899> my<00:01:42.990> last<00:01:43.170> graphics<00:01:43.619> card<00:01:43.829> which

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
powerful as my last graphics card which

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.890 
powerful as my last graphics card which
was<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.960> pretty<00:01:45.960> powerful<00:01:46.200> card

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.350 

and<00:01:52.900> that's<00:01:53.080> my<00:01:53.230> case

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and that's my case

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.300 
and that's my case
my<00:01:55.360> case<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:56.020> made<00:01:56.620> by<00:01:56.770> NZXT<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.910> so<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.450> my<00:01:59.310> my
