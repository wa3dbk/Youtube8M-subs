00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.139 
are alone it's happened so suddenly but
I<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:56.070> think<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.340> me<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.820> rue<00:00:56.969> has<00:00:57.000> come

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
I really think that me to rue has come

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.119 
I really think that me to rue has come
to<00:00:57.510> love<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.960> she<00:00:58.199> sure<00:00:58.350> has<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> funny<00:00:58.620> way<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
to love you she sure has a funny way of

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.160 
to love you she sure has a funny way of
showing<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.789> maybe<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:01.020> it's

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
showing it maybe it's just that it's

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.680 
showing it maybe it's just that it's
more<00:01:01.410> obvious<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.039> me<00:01:02.219> maybe<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> reason<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
more obvious to me maybe the reason I

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.600 
more obvious to me maybe the reason I
can<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.439> clearly<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.979> because<00:01:05.339> she's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
can see it so clearly is because she's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
can see it so clearly is because she's
my<00:01:05.820> other<00:01:05.970> half<00:01:06.330> other<00:01:06.780> half<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:08.990> guess<00:01:09.990> I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
my other half other half I guess I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.690 
my other half other half I guess I
should<00:01:10.380> explain<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.040> call<00:01:11.369> her<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
should explain that I call her that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.399 
should explain that I call her that
because<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:12.210> spend<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.720> much<00:01:12.869> time<00:01:12.930> together
