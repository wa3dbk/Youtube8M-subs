00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.010 

okay<00:00:02.399> I<00:00:02.429> got<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.760> wire<00:00:03.090> connector<00:00:03.540> pushed<00:00:03.810> in

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
okay I got the wire connector pushed in

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.820 
okay I got the wire connector pushed in
and<00:00:05.299> had<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> thought<00:00:06.569> that<00:00:06.680> before<00:00:07.680> I<00:00:07.710> put

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
and had a thought that before I put

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.660 
and had a thought that before I put
everything<00:00:07.980> about<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.309> other<00:00:08.460> would

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
everything about the other would

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.640 
everything about the other would
probably<00:00:09.059> make<00:00:09.300> sense<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.870> test<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.380> out<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
probably make sense to test this out and

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.339 
probably make sense to test this out and
make<00:00:11.099> sure<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.330> it's<00:00:12.330> actually<00:00:12.809> making<00:00:13.170> good

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
make sure that it's actually making good

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.870 
make sure that it's actually making good
contact<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.490> headlights<00:00:14.730> are

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
contact and that the headlights are

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.060 
contact and that the headlights are
working<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.780> temporarily<00:00:16.560> hooked<00:00:16.800> up<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
working so I temporarily hooked up the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.150 
working so I temporarily hooked up the
battery<00:00:17.369> cable<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.560> I'm<00:00:19.560> going<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.740> test<00:00:19.949> out

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
battery cable and I'm going to test out

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.650 
battery cable and I'm going to test out
the<00:00:20.430> headlights<00:00:21.410> turn<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> switch<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:23.539> if<00:00:24.539> you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the headlights turn the switch on if you

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.700 
the headlights turn the switch on if you
can<00:00:24.779> see<00:00:24.900> on<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> fence<00:00:25.289> there<00:00:25.500> but

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
can see on the fence there but

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.580 
can see on the fence there but
headlights<00:00:26.670> are<00:00:26.849> shining<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.529> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
headlights are shining on it you see and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.069 
headlights are shining on it you see and
go<00:00:28.710> out<00:00:29.660> go<00:00:30.660> out<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.800> working<00:00:32.040> thankfully

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
go out go out so it's working thankfully

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.060 
go out go out so it's working thankfully
so<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.200> gonna<00:00:34.290> disconnect<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.800> battery

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
so I'm gonna disconnect the battery

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.200 
so I'm gonna disconnect the battery
again<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:35.700> start<00:00:35.969> reassembling

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
again and then start reassembling

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.060 
again and then start reassembling
everything<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> reverse<00:00:37.800> process

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
everything just in the reverse process

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.000 
everything just in the reverse process
of<00:00:38.520> how<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> came<00:00:39.300> off<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.930> I'll<00:00:40.649> show<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
of how it came off so I'll show you this

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.000 
of how it came off so I'll show you this
step<00:00:41.219> by<00:00:41.340> step<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.700> next<00:00:45.110> alright<00:00:46.110> ready

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
step by step of that next alright ready

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
step by step of that next alright ready
to<00:00:47.160> start<00:00:47.309> putting<00:00:47.460> things<00:00:47.670> back<00:00:47.760> together

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to start putting things back together

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.729 
to start putting things back together
you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.510> see<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.660> added<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.960> couple<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.379> cable

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you can see I added a couple of cable

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.090 
you can see I added a couple of cable
ties<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:51.079> just<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.170> keep<00:00:52.320> everything<00:00:52.649> sort

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
ties here just to keep everything sort

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.979 
ties here just to keep everything sort
of<00:00:53.160> bundled<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.969> hopefully<00:00:54.660> will<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.899> I'll

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
of bundled and hopefully will that I'll

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.540 
of bundled and hopefully will that I'll
keep<00:00:55.170> these<00:00:55.440> wires<00:00:55.710> from<00:00:55.890> getting<00:00:56.160> tugged<00:00:56.340> on

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
keep these wires from getting tugged on

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.270 
keep these wires from getting tugged on
where<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.090> connect<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:58.859> want<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> make<00:00:59.190> them

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
where they connect you want to make them

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.360 
where they connect you want to make them
too<00:00:59.520> tight<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.930> sort<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.980> sense<00:01:02.160> them

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
too tight but you sort of sense them

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.810 
too tight but you sort of sense them
snug<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.120> clip<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> ends<00:01:03.870> off<00:01:04.670> alright<00:01:05.670> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
snug and clip the ends off alright so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.640 
snug and clip the ends off alright so
the<00:01:05.909> next<00:01:06.090> step<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:08.990> setting<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.200> back<00:01:10.409> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the next step is setting this back in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
the next step is setting this back in
place<00:01:11.270> lining<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> screw<00:01:12.840> holes

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
place lining it up with the screw holes

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.740 
place lining it up with the screw holes
again<00:01:13.590> there's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.840> t20<00:01:15.840> tamper-proof<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.950> top

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
again there's a t20 tamper-proof up top

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.460 
again there's a t20 tamper-proof up top
one<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.869> bottom<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.900> need<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.229> those

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
one at the bottom so I need to get those

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
one at the bottom so I need to get those
in<00:01:22.770> place<00:01:24.619> I'm<00:01:25.619> gonna<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.040> screwed<00:01:26.340> in

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
in place I'm gonna get that screwed in

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.060 
in place I'm gonna get that screwed in
and<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:27.270> show<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> next<00:01:27.840> step<00:01:30.979> okay<00:01:31.979> I've

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
and then show the next step okay I've

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.890 
and then show the next step okay I've
got<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> turn<00:01:32.520> signal<00:01:33.030> assembly<00:01:33.600> mounted

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
got the turn signal assembly mounted

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.760 
got the turn signal assembly mounted
back<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:38.490> also<00:01:39.390> added<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:40.110> other<00:01:40.350> cable

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
back on and I also added one other cable

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.679 
back on and I also added one other cable
tie<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.670> harness<00:01:41.909> under<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.420> there's<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
tie to this harness under here there's a

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.940 
tie to this harness under here there's a
couple<00:01:42.810> different<00:01:42.960> bundles<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.590> wires<00:01:43.770> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
couple different bundles of wires that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.490 
couple different bundles of wires that
were<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.430> sagging<00:01:44.850> down<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:46.110> added

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
were just sagging down and I added

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.679 
were just sagging down and I added
another<00:01:46.649> zip<00:01:47.189> tie<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.790> keep<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.600> from

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
another zip tie just to keep it from

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.859 
another zip tie just to keep it from
drooping<00:01:49.640> also<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.880> forgot<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.420> mention<00:01:51.600> during

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
drooping also I forgot to mention during

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.139 
drooping also I forgot to mention during
the<00:01:52.170> disassembly<00:01:52.619> portion<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.399> when<00:01:54.119> I

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
the disassembly portion that when I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.920 
the disassembly portion that when I
removed<00:01:54.689> everything<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.930> what's

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
removed everything there was a what's

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.109 
removed everything there was a what's
supposed<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> sort<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.640> wire<00:01:59.880> harness

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
supposed to be a sort of a wire harness

supposed to be a sort of a wire harness
clip<00:02:00.680> that<00:02:01.680> fell<00:02:01.979> out<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.430> wasn't<00:02:03.119> actually

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
clip that fell out it wasn't actually

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.940 
clip that fell out it wasn't actually
connected<00:02:03.930> anything<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.409> my<00:02:04.530> case<00:02:06.320> it's<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
connected anything in my case it's it

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.910 
connected anything in my case it's it
basically<00:02:08.489> clamps<00:02:08.959> around<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> wires<00:02:10.259> like

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
basically clamps around the wires like

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.670 
basically clamps around the wires like
that<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:11.940> slotted<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> back

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that and it's slotted on the back

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.710 
that and it's slotted on the back
and<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.610> supposed<00:02:14.939> to<00:02:15.000> slide<00:02:15.269> onto<00:02:15.450> this

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and it's supposed to slide onto this

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.780 
and it's supposed to slide onto this
metal<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.290> mean<00:02:16.860> plastic<00:02:17.480> receiver<00:02:18.480> right<00:02:18.750> here

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
metal I mean plastic receiver right here

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.759 
metal I mean plastic receiver right here
you<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:20.970> see<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.329> or<00:02:21.450> not<00:02:23.780> but<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.079> tried<00:02:25.680> to

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
you can see that or not but I tried to

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.380 
you can see that or not but I tried to
put<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:25.920> back<00:02:26.069> on<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.579> I<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:27.120> didn't<00:02:27.329> like

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
put it back on and I just didn't like

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.580 
put it back on and I just didn't like
the<00:02:27.480> way<00:02:27.629> that<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.930> was<00:02:27.989> putting<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.439> lot<00:02:28.560> of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
the way that it was putting a lot of

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.309 
the way that it was putting a lot of
tension<00:02:29.010> on<00:02:29.159> the<00:02:29.280> wires<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.959> feeling

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
tension on the wires I have a feeling

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.869 
tension on the wires I have a feeling
that<00:02:31.409> that<00:02:31.709> may<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:31.980> contributed<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
that that may have contributed to the

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.670 
that that may have contributed to the
problem<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> first<00:02:33.689> place<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.140> I'm<00:02:34.530> not

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
problem in the first place so I'm not

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.289 
problem in the first place so I'm not
gonna<00:02:34.829> put<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.159> right<00:02:35.730> now

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
gonna put it on right now

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.020 
gonna put it on right now
if<00:02:36.599> a<00:02:36.750> problem<00:02:37.140> arises<00:02:37.290> later<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:38.069> can<00:02:38.760> always

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
if a problem arises later I can always

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.569 
if a problem arises later I can always
drop<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.079> lower<00:02:40.530> portion<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> dash<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
drop this lower portion of the dash and

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.250 
drop this lower portion of the dash and
add<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.180> back<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.569> but<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:42.959> now<00:02:43.049> I'm<00:02:43.170> gonna

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
add this back on but for now I'm gonna

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.940 
add this back on but for now I'm gonna
leave<00:02:43.439> it<00:02:43.590> off

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
leave it off

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.220 
leave it off
all<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:44.909> something<00:02:45.659> else<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:45.989> forgot

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
all right something else that I forgot

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.890 
all right something else that I forgot
to<00:02:46.290> mention<00:02:46.409> during<00:02:46.889> disassembly<00:02:47.310> was<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
to mention during disassembly was on the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.330 
to mention during disassembly was on the
backside<00:02:49.349> of<00:02:49.379> this<00:02:49.560> terminal<00:02:49.950> block<00:02:50.129> where

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
backside of this terminal block where

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.849 
backside of this terminal block where
the<00:02:50.370> wires<00:02:50.579> connect<00:02:51.170> there's<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.349> plastic

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
the wires connect there's a plastic

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.930 
the wires connect there's a plastic
cover<00:02:53.069> looks<00:02:53.790> like<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:55.980> snaps<00:02:56.730> into

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
cover looks like this it just snaps into

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:06.080 
cover looks like this it just snaps into
place<00:03:03.620> gonna<00:03:04.620> take<00:03:04.829> two<00:03:04.980> hands<00:03:05.189> to<00:03:05.430> get<00:03:05.849> it<00:03:05.909> in

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
place gonna take two hands to get it in

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.000 
place gonna take two hands to get it in
I<00:03:06.209> think<00:03:06.239> but<00:03:06.659> that's<00:03:07.200> where<00:03:07.409> it<00:03:07.500> goes<00:03:07.650> like

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
I think but that's where it goes like

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.460 
I think but that's where it goes like
that<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.970> let<00:03:09.060> me<00:03:09.150> get<00:03:09.269> that<00:03:09.389> put<00:03:09.599> on<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.349> I'll

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
that so let me get that put on and I'll

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.119 
that so let me get that put on and I'll
show<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.769> next<00:03:10.920> step<00:03:12.889> all<00:03:13.889> right<00:03:13.950> got

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
show you the next step all right got

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.789 
show you the next step all right got
that<00:03:14.250> cover<00:03:14.459> put<00:03:14.730> on<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.349> next<00:03:16.530> thing<00:03:16.680> you

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
that cover put on so the next thing you

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.439 
that cover put on so the next thing you
want<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.010> do<00:03:17.159> if<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.910> haven't<00:03:18.090> already<00:03:18.299> done

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
want to do if you haven't already done

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.860 
want to do if you haven't already done
so<00:03:18.569> is<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.230> remove<00:03:19.440> this<00:03:20.419> tilt<00:03:21.419> to<00:03:21.540> gesture

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
so is to remove this tilt to gesture

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.809 
so is to remove this tilt to gesture
lever<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:25.650> know<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:25.799> had<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> take<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.519> apart

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
lever you know I had to take it apart

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.000 
lever you know I had to take it apart
take<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.930> off<00:03:28.049> when<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.290> disassembled

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
take it off when I disassembled

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.649 
take it off when I disassembled
everything<00:03:29.280> but<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.519> had<00:03:29.819> put<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.060> back<00:03:30.180> on<00:03:30.359> so

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
everything but I had put it back on so

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.000 
everything but I had put it back on so
I'd<00:03:30.750> have<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.930> ability<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.349> raise<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:31.980> lower

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
I'd have the ability to raise and lower

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.379 
I'd have the ability to raise and lower
the<00:03:32.220> steering<00:03:32.489> well<00:03:32.609> test<00:03:32.909> out<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.180> wiring

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
the steering well test out the wiring

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.119 
the steering well test out the wiring
and<00:03:33.599> make<00:03:33.690> sure<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.930> was<00:03:34.049> not<00:03:34.680> gonna<00:03:34.799> hang<00:03:35.010> up

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
and make sure it was not gonna hang up

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.979 
and make sure it was not gonna hang up
on<00:03:35.280> anything<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.790> you've<00:03:36.329> got<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:36.629> attached

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
on anything so you've got this attached

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.699 
on anything so you've got this attached
still<00:03:37.290> go<00:03:38.129> ahead<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.400> unscrew<00:03:38.849> that<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:40.620> you

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
still go ahead and unscrew that and you

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.569 
still go ahead and unscrew that and you
can<00:03:40.859> take<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.220> top<00:03:41.400> cover<00:03:43.159> of<00:03:44.159> the<00:03:44.340> steering

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
can take the top cover of the steering

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.509 
can take the top cover of the steering
column<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.150> drop<00:03:45.629> it<00:03:45.780> into<00:03:45.900> place<00:03:46.199> and<00:03:46.709> the

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
column and drop it into place and the

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.939 
column and drop it into place and the
hazard<00:03:48.510> light<00:03:50.150> switch<00:03:51.150> will<00:03:51.859> stick<00:03:52.859> up

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
hazard light switch will stick up

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.099 
hazard light switch will stick up
through<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.220> top<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.729> then<00:03:54.359> at<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:54.870> point

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
through the top and then at this point

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:01.039 
through the top and then at this point
you<00:03:55.260> can<00:03:55.579> rethread<00:03:57.049> this<00:03:58.049> lever<00:03:58.889> arm<00:04:00.049> back

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
you can rethread this lever arm back

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:09.409 
you can rethread this lever arm back
into<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.440> hole<00:04:01.590> at<00:04:01.859> least<00:04:02.010> get<00:04:02.159> it<00:04:02.250> started<00:04:08.419> of

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
into the hole at least get it started of

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.569 
into the hole at least get it started of
course<00:04:09.510> it's<00:04:09.810> got<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.199> like<00:04:11.099> I<00:04:11.159> said<00:04:11.310> earlier

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
course it's got this like I said earlier

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.069 
course it's got this like I said earlier
the<00:04:11.729> knotch<00:04:11.940> section<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:12.690> shaft<00:04:12.930> that

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
the knotch section of the shaft that

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.830 
the knotch section of the shaft that
allows<00:04:13.349> you<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.590> put<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.799> wrench<00:04:13.949> on<00:04:14.129> it<00:04:14.840> all

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
allows you to put a wrench on it all

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.270 
allows you to put a wrench on it all
right<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.370> next<00:04:17.400> step<00:04:17.760> is<00:04:17.909> going<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.150> be

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
right so the next step is going to be

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.209 
right so the next step is going to be
install<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:20.510> rear<00:04:21.710> portion<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:23.039> the
