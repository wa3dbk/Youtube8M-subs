00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 the people, it's okay that you're well 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.180
 coming to the easy technical area 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.540
 the name rodolfo and where it has her name 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.759
 For you about creative power are in the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.830
 previous classes are the links 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.080
 up here we learn a little 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.850
 about what powers are not in 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.680
 alternating current and also a little 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.600
 more about active power 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.699
 Are you willing to be alone? 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.970
 Click today a little gun on the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 conceptualization applied to latin power 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.910
 only active power will be divided into two 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.090
 different areas the first is the power 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.520
 applied in the generation of magnetic fields 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.879
 and the power applied to the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.070
 energy that the personal field generation 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.710
 magnetic we remember to induce 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.649
 magnetic field induce magnetic field 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.770
 has a component that is the main one that 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.440
 It's work that's our job. 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.180
 inductors and doctors and induce 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.629
 magnetic field 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.969
 ok first shirt eg motor 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.739
 as beneficial in the other class that 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.340
 I talked about the active power of people 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.610
 said that an engine apart from 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.549
 rotation of the motor shaft of the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.990
 ibm is our active power that is 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.030
 generating the work that was 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.600
 operating the equipment making a 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 treadmill run and mush is but for 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.369
 this rotating axis and I had to have a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.479
 generation of magnetic field and how 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.759
 this works 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.340
 the magnetic field generated through the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.860
 passing an electric current ii and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.040
 three with a chain runs through a 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.500
 coil to its surroundings generates a field 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.780
 magnetic field and this magnetic 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.299
 perform an action for example in the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.140
 equipment called relay it has a 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.350
 contact and contact me 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.740
 ordinary flame in the huge closed middle 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.960
 also initially the contract closed and 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.990
 the common so interconnected 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.360
 however when a current flows and 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.909
 here generates a magnetic field that 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.360
 magnetic field attracts this key to 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.360
 this position 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.280
 and now the contact to close between the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.800
 common is mother also you're this by 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.760
 For example, we have a lamp that 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.610
 volts 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.100
 there is no way to emphasize the theme of 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.100
 The band is the neutral when it 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.950
 current generates a magnetic field contact 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.260
 beautiful lamp party're then that 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.630
 generation of magnetic field occurs 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.380
 that will generate active 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.600
 ok did not show the same thing on the engine 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.140
 mainly were three-phase will have 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.700
 three reels here I introduced two 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.150
 surgeries the coil generates a field 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.459
 magnetic or otherwise acted just caught 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.610
 waved to the coil since the magnetic 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.740
 rotates a little more only in this coil generates 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.660
 a magnetic field the author is turning and 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.520
 so on 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.800
 remembering that the three-phase system with the 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.959
 partner to make 120 degrees 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.700
 This generates a field for 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.400
 generate the engine but this is natural 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.650
 ok then magnetic field generation 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.140
 another component that needs to be 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.900
 magnetic field transformer generation 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.300
 how the transformer induced the attention 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.580
 from primary to secondary who needed 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.560
 transformer clicks the link that has 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.269
 several also who, as I was already the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.250
 champion as it was already a magnetic field 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.670
 just a chain 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.730
 every time I apply 127 volts 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.880
 in the primary passing a current goes 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.200
 Here see the lines of a field 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.640
 which will induce a voltage 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.000
 that from the number of 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.690
 has been programmed for 12 volts and 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.030
 to induce 127 through a field 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.640
 enjoyment i stepped on it generation of 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.030
 magnetic field plus a coil that the 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.650
 our inductor all this power 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:05.230
 latina that is nothing to see the quiet r &amp; i 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.750
 and the other part of creative power is the 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.920
 personal energy storage always 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.560
 when we need 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.420
 despite the electrical voltage a component 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.090
 people put a bank of capacitors 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.609
 have stopped with it or to correct the 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.829
 called a power factor that in the other 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.240
 We will learn then 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.730
 time we put a bank of 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.560
 capacitors to stabilize attention 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.980
 the system or to correct the factor 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.190
 What happens, I do too. 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.940
 generating a power that calls ether 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.220
 any difference is that for load 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.790
 Inductive are the inductors 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.310
 we love it here is a view air 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.440
 positive and for carlos that will store 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.040
 energy that the case capacitors 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.070
 this is a negative vr to us 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.610
 learn how this marriage will be 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.300
 ok then the staff here at our power 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.910
 creative conceptualization and the next hour 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.010
 to learn from the country together with 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.850
 active power and all other factors 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.130
 OK 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.050
 I hope they understood me. 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.780
 I always intend to help the 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.940
 how much more can I help you, ok? 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.500
 remembering that we always work in 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.700
 the improvement of the education of our 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.160
 parents 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.870
 God bless you, sign up. 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.750
 on our channel to receive more videos 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.280
 of a mix you liked and share with 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.270
 your friends so that more people can 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.100
 learn 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.570
 stay with god, strong embrace of exchange 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.570
 easy and even more
