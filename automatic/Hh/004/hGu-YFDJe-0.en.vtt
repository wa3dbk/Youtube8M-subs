00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.480
 two 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.690
 hello friends to give you new videoguide 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.299
 dedicated to the game give shader 2 in this 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.370
 I'm going to help you get the 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.650
 achievement or trophy I bring you a present that 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.230
 we have to unlock in the maze 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.810
 of the arbiter of souls 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.250
 we have 10 levels ahead in the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.199
 end of the sun and the level is the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.970
 final showdown with the referee 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.009
 the souls as much as you can imagine 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.250
 we have an arduous task ahead of us 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.410
 and complicated to get by as much as 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.710
 I always tell you, I advise you to play 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.720
 this part this labyrinth in difficulty 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.900
 easy for everything to be a little more 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.900
 simple 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.559
 and is that friends the enemies at 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.570
 principle in the first levels are 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.850
 very easy to defeat but as we go 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.140
 advancing through each of the levels the 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.140
 thing gets pretty complicated 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.580
 another thing that you have to keep in mind 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.070
 to be able to advance through this labyrinth is 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.290
 that we need to know a combination 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.310
 exact 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.500
 to be able to continue advancing and reach 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.630
 the next level 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.690
 for this labyrinth uses the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.970
 cardinal points north south west and east 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.220
 and with these cardinal points we have 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.560
 that get to do that combination 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.180
 exact to be able to advance to the next 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.770
 level 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.440
 those codes that you need you have 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.420
 at the beginning of each level as you see 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.000
 right now on screen on one side in 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.910
 the first row you have the combination 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.220
 exact to advance to the next level and 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.770
 the one below is the combination for 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.270
 access the secret levels of each 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.270
 one of the levels 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.580
 and how to use these codes it is 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.920
 very simple there you have marked by 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.900
 numbers the order you have to choose 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.820
 of each of the 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.920
 confrontations in this case first 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.890
 we would have to go west after 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.410
 this later to the north and later to 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.410
 north to move to the next level 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.440
 choosing in that order in the outputs of 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.760
 each of the clashes 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.860
 we will get to the next level 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.390
 or if you prefer and you are looking for 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.340
 secret numbers for the same if you have 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.320
 the combination of the mode group and 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.520
 you will access the secret level of each one 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.520
 of the levels 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.200
 good and for all those who want 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.109
 get the combinations that you 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.469
 we facilitate in the dream channel for their 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.579
 own means to tell them that throughout 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:02.959
 of the whole game 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:06.180
 you have distributed the parchments of 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.129
 Referee of Souls 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.890
 what can you pick up like pick up 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.870
 the pages of the book of the dead or 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.510
 the in relics each of those 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.390
 scrolls contains a combination of 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.390
 one level in particular of this maze 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.310
 they are not hard to find the truth 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.900
 they are much easier to find than 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.900
 the rest of the game's collectables 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.700
 but well you know that if you do not want 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.100
 waste time since this is not 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.930
 essential then logically here 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.160
 you have the exact combinations 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.190
 correct for you to come out of your 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:49.580
 confrontation with all the enemies of 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.580
 this labyrinth of the arbiter of souls 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.590
 and to end this commented video 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.040
 friends just advise you in addition to 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.960
 that you play on easy difficulty 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.960
 advised not to equip you is with 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.450
 some of those weapons that make you 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.170
 fill them both the life bar and 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.170
 the bar of anger 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.160
 in order to lengthen our resistance without 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.930
 have need to use is always 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.970
 the limited number that we have of 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.330
 potions and that we can carry in our 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.520
 Inventory 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.439
 for this we can not take advantage 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.780
 of the enemies obviously that every time 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:35.470
 that are eliminated 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.690
 they give us this type of item 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.240
 sometimes it is even better to leave 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.490
 small enemies at the end so that a 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.110
 once we finish with the biggest 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.330
 recover some life and some of that 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:51.240
 anger rod we need to 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.240
 apply our most powerful attacks 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.340
 and until here this video has arrived 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.020
 commented friendly friends as always 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.300
