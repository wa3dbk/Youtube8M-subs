00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.400
 hi guys your free adonis make and a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.350
 A little while ago I taught you how 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.119
 to clean a glass of enamel promising 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.800
 also teach what to do with the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.699
 clean glass 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.269
 Today I bring another tip that is you. 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:32.130
 make a door with the glass 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.160
 People do not look nice and it's 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.000
 super easy you will need a 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.329
 clean enamel glass of a clips or 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.500
 piece of wire from a nose plier 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.110
 fine items to decorate with the glass and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.260
 enamels of your choice can be 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.210
 those bad ones that are out of date 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.850
 and a top coat to help dry most 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.090
 fast with the help of pliers say 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.789
 cake all clips until it looks good 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.369
 quietly he will not be able to take away 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.210
 all the marquinhas but this will not 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.210
 disrupt're 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.450
 now you will get the empty glass and the 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.600
 glazes you have chosen and start 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.020
 paint a therapy 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.690
 While not all the glass you can 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.320
 pass as many layers as you want 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:37.880
 the ideal is to always allow to dry well between 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.910
 one layer and another because if you do not 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.550
 do this it will end up dragging the 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:53.570
 layer of bass and then if you had 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:56.990
 painted nail okay I wanted to decorate this 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.080
 glass with an enamel placed on it 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.600
 It's very bright, it did not appear for you. 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.560
 all the shine but it looked beautiful and 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.160
 I got people with the top coaching 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.680
 because it helps encircle the enamel 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.140
 just like he does in our fingernail 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.930
 I left a little glass on the side to dry 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.840
 enough and let's start doing our 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:26.290
 even with clips and the pliers 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.360
 turning like a snail 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.140
 tapa makes a little bit of strength but it's okay 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.799
 easy people to do is very quiet alone 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.799
 rolling 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.000
 If you 're a kid, you 're watching me. 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.180
 Ask your mother to go to an adult. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.670
 help in this part that is 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.950
 clips to people power 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.950
 put on the enamel cover 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.870
 the door and cadu are ready and now 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.150
 You just have to use your imagination and 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.340
 spruce up the book the way you do 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.760
 want and if I will put those traits 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.120
 stickers 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.250
 I bought stationery, okay? I 'll put it. 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.190
 on the lid to decorate 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.020
 but you can do it anyway 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.709
 can put so can not put 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:40.150
 income uses creativity to embellish and 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.830
 from your personality to your short message 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.250
