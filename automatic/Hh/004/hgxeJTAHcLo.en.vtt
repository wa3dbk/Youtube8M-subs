00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
worth getting I like it but as I said in

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.010 
worth getting I like it but as I said in
my<00:01:38.250> previous<00:01:38.490> goal<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> lot<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.330> hype<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
my previous goal a lot of hype for the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.770 
my previous goal a lot of hype for the
red<00:01:40.200> ones<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.580> is<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.270> know<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
red ones and really is I know it's a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.000 
red ones and really is I know it's a
very<00:01:42.930> simplistic<00:01:43.260> they're<00:01:43.590> very<00:01:43.770> good<00:01:43.890> for

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
very simplistic they're very good for

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.830 
very simplistic they're very good for
Carla<00:01:44.340> story<00:01:44.580> but<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> red<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
Carla story but the red one for the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.420 
Carla story but the red one for the
price<00:01:46.080> I<00:01:46.320> don't<00:01:46.590> believe<00:01:46.830> is<00:01:46.920> worth<00:01:47.010> it<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.340> I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
price I don't believe is worth it as I

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.430 
price I don't believe is worth it as I
mentioned<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> deck<00:01:48.180> itself<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.110> nice

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
mentioned but the deck itself is a nice

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.530 
mentioned but the deck itself is a nice
deck<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.830> cards<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> has<00:01:51.060> gained

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
deck of cards and I think it has gained

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.050 
deck of cards and I think it has gained
its<00:01:51.750> way<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.230> to<00:01:52.860> me<00:01:53.010> a<00:01:53.040> little<00:01:53.280> bit<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.850> it's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
its way and to me a little bit but it's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.760 
its way and to me a little bit but it's
not<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> best<00:01:54.570> deck<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.020> world<00:01:55.230> but<00:01:55.650> it's

to<00:06:42.039> black<00:06:42.220> when<00:06:42.430> I<00:06:42.460> compare<00:06:42.879> a<00:06:42.909> ferry<00:06:43.599> because

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:48.069 
it compared to the red and blue because

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:49.230 
it compared to the red and blue because
