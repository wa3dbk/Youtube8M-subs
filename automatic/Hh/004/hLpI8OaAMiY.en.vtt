00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.150
 new video 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.250
 In this video I give you ten tips 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.160
 So that the battery of your iphones ipods or 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.349
 ipads longer keeps so much fun 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.370
 The first tip is the location services 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.260
 to reactivate 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.510
 especially use apps like facebook 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.670
 like your location data and that too 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.720
 if facebook runs in the background so 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.519
 goes into the setting 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.170
 privacy and regulatory data and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.279
 deactivated apps according to your opinion 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.390
 do not necessarily need your location 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.210
 Tip number two background 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.260
 disable updates 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.420
 the same goes for the background 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.489
 updating apps their background 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.500
 activities that also consume battery 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.540
 you want to stop it you can 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.320
 Settings under general 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.649
 background updates 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.450
 deactivate 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.700
 Tip3 apps do not switch off the app 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.710
 removing it may sound a bit strange 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.360
 but also removing apps from the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.670
 app switcher you often need 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.260
 consumed on a long term battery by that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.820
 every time the app restarts, the data is restored 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.109
 loaded into the main memory 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.609
 is a higher battery consumption 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.390
 caused as if he did not use the app 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.280
 finished typing number four automatic e 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.950
 disable mail update 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.659
 You should have automatic updating 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.150
 or push for e-mail mailboxes 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.979
 necessarily disable it or if you have it 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.680
 absolutely needed at least one 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.000
 make the smallest possible interval 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.640
 by the way, that could be in the settings 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.780
 under mail contacts and calendars and 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.549
 then do data reconciliation 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.360
 Tip number 5 foot notifications 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.369
 reactivate 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.799
 also push notifications of apps 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.570
 should consume unnecessary battery because of that 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.979
 the apps you do not have any news from 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.960
 wanted to receive in the settings 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.500
 below messages from the notification 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.970
 remove center 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.079
 Tip number six battery indicator 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.780
 deactivate 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.270
 it is recommended to use the battery indicator 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.829
 turn off because then user more often 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.689
 the device is looking at the battery status 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.079
 check and keep turning on the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.939
 screen also consumes battery 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.570
 Tip number 7 aircraft mode when loading 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.579
 activate 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.770
 this tip has nothing directly to it 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.310
 save battery but rather with battery charge 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.110
 to do 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.220
 namely the battery of the device loads namely 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.569
 much faster if that 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.569
 airplane mode is activated 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.610
 Tip number 83 g in regions with 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.280
 disable bad reception 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.380
 in regions where you do not have 3g anyway 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.390
 or you could have this on 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.800
 disable battery to save this 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.630
 option is in the settings below 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 activate mobile network at 3g 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.330
 Tip number 9 screen brightness 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.069
 bluetooth and wifi 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.769
 just before the end a few older ones 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.060
 but still very good tips would be there 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.860
 on the one hand the decrease of the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.900
 screen brightness disable this 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.000
 of bluetooth and voters 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.980
 You should also have your iphone before 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.030
 he put it in his pocket lock and 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.940
 Do not wait for the screen 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.709
 automatically goes out 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.200
 Tip number 10 apple contact and 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.700
 All these tips should be the most acute 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.319
 it can not have worked 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.239
 of course still be that your battery 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.700
 is broken or nearing his 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.349
 life is about to test the battery 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.330
 your device does not even have to diverge 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.250
 it will be taken only one 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.090
 software installs the information 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.280
 to the battery supplies 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.569
 If necessary , the battery could also directly 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.930
 at apple for little money swap 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.930
 to let 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.400
 So you get ten tips for your battery 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.440
 I hope I could help you if so 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.390
 rated this video cute and up 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.390
