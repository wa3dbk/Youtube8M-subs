breaking<00:01:06.330> stereotypes<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:07.380> something<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
breaking stereotypes is something that I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
breaking stereotypes is something that I
love<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> show<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.210> women<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.930> be

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.140 
love to do and to show that women can be
empowered<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.040> there's<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> misnomer

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
empowered and I think there's a misnomer

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.390 
empowered and I think there's a misnomer
with<00:01:12.659> gamers<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.470> all<00:01:13.619> boys<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.310> all

with gamers that it's all boys and all

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.340 
with gamers that it's all boys and all
men<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.000> women<00:01:15.270> play<00:01:15.570> too<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.990> think<00:01:16.229> it's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
men but women play too and I think it's

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.660 
men but women play too and I think it's
really<00:01:16.590> important<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.189> us<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.549> have
