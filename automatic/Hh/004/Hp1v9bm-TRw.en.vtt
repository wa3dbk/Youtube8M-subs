now we have million vasive techniques

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.150 
now we have million vasive techniques
where<00:00:58.390> we<00:00:58.480> use<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.660> lot<00:00:58.899> smaller<00:00:59.140> incisions<00:00:59.649> we

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
where we use a lot smaller incisions we

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.470 
where we use a lot smaller incisions we
work<00:01:00.340> through<00:01:00.520> tubes<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.059> we<00:01:01.149> get<00:01:01.270> a<00:01:01.300> lot<00:01:01.420> more

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
to accomplish the work that we need to

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.410 
to accomplish the work that we need to
whether<00:01:18.099> that<00:01:18.340> be<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.520> disc<00:01:18.759> ectomy<00:01:19.060> or<00:01:19.149> fusion

with the advances in technology I think

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.970 
with the advances in technology I think
patients<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.110> lot<00:02:20.260> more<00:02:20.440> confident<00:02:20.890> and

okay<00:02:23.049> so<00:02:23.110> on<00:02:23.560> these<00:02:24.040> models<00:02:24.310> we<00:02:24.640> have<00:02:24.790> right

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
okay so on these models we have right

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.990 
okay so on these models we have right
here<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.269> show<00:02:25.840> us<00:02:26.040> minimally<00:02:27.040> invasive

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
here can you show us minimally invasive

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.880 
here can you show us minimally invasive
spine<00:02:28.150> surgery<00:02:28.330> exactly<00:02:29.230> what<00:02:29.440> would<00:02:29.590> be<00:02:29.709> done

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
spine surgery exactly what would be done

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.559 
spine surgery exactly what would be done
because<00:02:30.489> of<00:02:30.760> course<00:02:30.970> shown<00:02:31.150> tell<00:02:31.360> us<00:02:31.450> much

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
because of course shown tell us much

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.300 
because of course shown tell us much
more<00:02:31.629> absolutely<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.099> most<00:02:33.220> common

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
more absolutely so the most common

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.470 
more absolutely so the most common
procedure<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.909> do<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.180> called<00:02:34.360> a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
procedure a do is called a

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.809 
procedure a do is called a
microdiscectomy<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:36.190> i'll<00:02:36.340> make<00:02:36.549> about<00:02:36.670> a

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
microdiscectomy so i'll make about a

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.119 
microdiscectomy so i'll make about a
2-centimeter<00:02:37.420> incision<00:02:37.480> on<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.019> skin<00:02:38.379> doc

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
2-centimeter incision on the skin doc

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.860 
2-centimeter incision on the skin doc
tubes<00:02:39.459> on<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.239> part<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.629> bone<00:02:40.720> which

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
tubes on to this part of the bone which

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.020 
tubes on to this part of the bone which
is<00:02:40.959> called<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.200> lamina<00:02:41.620> I'd<00:02:42.280> cut<00:02:42.730> through<00:02:42.909> the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
is called the lamina I'd cut through the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.880 
is called the lamina I'd cut through the
bone<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.269> little<00:02:43.569> bit<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.930> make<00:02:44.590> my<00:02:44.739> way<00:02:44.769> down

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
bone a little bit and make my way down

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.819 
bone a little bit and make my way down
to<00:02:45.280> find<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.579> nerve<00:02:45.900> retract<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.019> nerve<00:02:47.230> in

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
to find the nerve retract the nerve in

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.920 
to find the nerve retract the nerve in
words<00:02:48.099> find<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.819> disc<00:02:49.060> remove<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
words find the disc remove the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.930 
words find the disc remove the
herniation<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.680> pretty<00:02:51.310> much<00:02:51.340> i'm<00:02:51.579> done<00:02:51.760> that

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
herniation and pretty much i'm done that

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.319 
herniation and pretty much i'm done that
usually<00:02:52.720> takes<00:02:52.900> me<00:02:52.959> about<00:02:53.049> an<00:02:53.410> hour<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.329> this

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
usually takes me about an hour so this

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.849 
usually takes me about an hour so this
can<00:02:55.510> be<00:02:55.629> done<00:02:55.750> in<00:02:55.900> an<00:02:56.019> hour<00:02:56.109> it<00:02:56.410> used<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.739> take

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
can be done in an hour it used to take

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.800 
can be done in an hour it used to take
you<00:02:57.040> how<00:02:57.220> long<00:02:57.280> now<00:02:57.940> if<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.239> do<00:02:58.359> it<00:02:58.450> open

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
you how long now if you do it open

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.300 
you how long now if you do it open
usually<00:02:59.409> that<00:02:59.500> takes<00:02:59.620> about<00:02:59.769> an<00:02:59.980> hour<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.220> a

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
usually that takes about an hour and a

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.039 
usually that takes about an hour and a
half<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.609> two<00:03:00.640> hours<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.269> it's<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:01.959> lot

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
half to two hours and it's just a lot

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.780 
half to two hours and it's just a lot
more<00:03:02.200> cutting<00:03:02.530> if<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.010> go<00:03:03.129> open<00:03:03.519> you<00:03:03.579> have<00:03:03.700> to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
more cutting if you go open you have to

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.699 
more cutting if you go open you have to
go<00:03:03.879> through<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.150> midline<00:03:04.329> take<00:03:05.170> down<00:03:05.319> muscle

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
go through the midline take down muscle

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.380 
go through the midline take down muscle
on<00:03:05.799> both<00:03:05.920> sides<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.549> just<00:03:07.090> do<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.209> lot<00:03:07.329> more

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
on both sides and just do a lot more

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.390 
on both sides and just do a lot more
work<00:03:07.720> just<00:03:08.109> to<00:03:08.200> get<00:03:08.319> that<00:03:08.440> same<00:03:08.650> job<00:03:08.890> done<00:03:09.099> so

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
work just to get that same job done so

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.830 
work just to get that same job done so
you're<00:03:09.549> saying<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.879> don't<00:03:10.030> have<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.420> cut<00:03:10.599> all

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
you're saying you don't have to cut all

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.839 
you're saying you don't have to cut all
the<00:03:11.019> way<00:03:11.140> into<00:03:11.409> that<00:03:11.769> bone<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.579> what<00:03:12.700> I'm

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
the way into that bone is that what I'm

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.479 
the way into that bone is that what I'm
saying<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.569> take<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.170> lot<00:03:14.379> less<00:03:14.560> muscle<00:03:15.010> down<00:03:15.159> and

I'm visualizing my work through a

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.500 
I'm visualizing my work through a
microscope<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:18.099> a<00:03:18.310> tube<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.120> lot<00:03:19.269> less

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
microscope and a tube so so a lot less

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.449 
microscope and a tube so so a lot less
to<00:03:19.660> section<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.590> can<00:03:20.739> see<00:03:20.919> exactly<00:03:21.190> what<00:03:21.430> I

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
to section and I can see exactly what I

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.220 
to section and I can see exactly what I
need<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.849> and<00:03:21.970> get<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.209> same<00:03:22.359> work<00:03:22.540> done<00:03:22.720> when

need to and get the same work done when

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.589 
need to and get the same work done when
is<00:03:23.470> spine<00:03:23.709> surgery<00:03:24.220> absolutely<00:03:25.060> necessary

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
is spine surgery absolutely necessary

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
anymore most patients I say maybe about

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.629 
anymore most patients I say maybe about
ten<00:03:32.829> to<00:03:32.950> fifteen<00:03:33.040> percent<00:03:33.430> of<00:03:33.549> patients

surgery well dr. bro you just talked
about<00:03:47.739> one<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.190> your<00:03:48.280> patients<00:03:48.549> 36<00:03:49.359> years<00:03:49.599> old

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
about one of your patients 36 years old

about one of your patients 36 years old
what<00:03:50.379> about<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.739> older<00:03:51.250> patients<00:03:51.730> patients

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
what about the older patients patients

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.509 
what about the older patients patients
who<00:03:52.329> typically<00:03:52.690> are<00:03:53.079> at<00:03:53.319> risk<00:03:53.530> for<00:03:53.889> any<00:03:54.250> type

who typically are at risk for any type

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.089 
who typically are at risk for any type
of<00:03:54.549> surgery<00:03:54.940> are<00:03:55.299> you<00:03:55.660> still<00:03:56.049> practicing<00:03:56.919> this

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
of surgery are you still practicing this

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.490 
of surgery are you still practicing this
on<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.609> absolutely<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.900> most<00:03:59.079> common

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
on that absolutely the most common

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.110 
on that absolutely the most common
pathology<00:03:59.949> and<00:04:00.069> all<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.340> patients<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:00.879> called

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
pathology and all the patients is called

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.599 
pathology and all the patients is called
lumbar<00:04:01.629> stenosis<00:04:02.310> usually<00:04:03.310> that's<00:04:03.489> a

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
lumbar stenosis usually that's a

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.339 
lumbar stenosis usually that's a
multi-level<00:04:04.329> disease<00:04:04.840> where<00:04:05.079> you<00:04:05.169> have

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
multi-level disease where you have

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.860 
multi-level disease where you have
compression<00:04:06.129> at<00:04:06.370> different<00:04:06.760> levels<00:04:06.879> usually

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
compression at different levels usually

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.000 
compression at different levels usually
that's<00:04:08.019> a<00:04:08.139> little<00:04:08.319> more<00:04:08.440> complex<00:04:08.829> and<00:04:08.889> you

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
that's a little more complex and you

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.500 
that's a little more complex and you
have<00:04:09.099> to<00:04:09.190> do<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.340> little<00:04:09.519> more<00:04:09.669> cutting<00:04:10.030> with

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
have to do a little more cutting with

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.300 
have to do a little more cutting with
them<00:04:10.629> with<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.870> movie<00:04:11.139> invasive<00:04:11.590> but<00:04:12.129> you

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
them with the movie invasive but you

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.530 
them with the movie invasive but you
there<00:04:12.579> are<00:04:12.699> techniques<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.180> we<00:04:13.359> can<00:04:13.510> use

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
there are techniques that we can use

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.000 
there are techniques that we can use
where<00:04:13.840> we<00:04:13.930> can<00:04:14.049> work<00:04:14.169> through<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.440> tubes<00:04:14.680> and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
where we can work through the tubes and

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.759 
where we can work through the tubes and
just<00:04:15.609> undercut<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.690> beast<00:04:16.930> bones<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.380> lamina

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
just undercut the beast bones the lamina

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.529 
just undercut the beast bones the lamina
and<00:04:17.949> get<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.459> same<00:04:18.639> work<00:04:18.820> done<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.329> is<00:04:19.419> an

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
and get the same work done so it is an

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:20.490 
and get the same work done so it is an
option<00:04:19.780> for<00:04:19.810> those<00:04:19.989> patients<00:04:20.199> as<00:04:20.470> well

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
option for those patients as well

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.709 
option for those patients as well
another<00:04:21.489> procedure<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:22.090> called<00:04:22.240> kyphoplasty

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:22.719 
another procedure is called kyphoplasty

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:25.080 
another procedure is called kyphoplasty
where<00:04:23.680> patients<00:04:24.159> have<00:04:24.219> fractures<00:04:24.849> in<00:04:24.969> these

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
where patients have fractures in these

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.180 
where patients have fractures in these
bones

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
bones

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.220 
bones
and<00:04:26.310> we<00:04:26.850> make<00:04:27.030> very<00:04:27.360> tiny<00:04:27.630> incisions<00:04:28.080> on<00:04:28.200> the

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
and we make very tiny incisions on the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.670 
and we make very tiny incisions on the
skin<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.880> inject<00:04:29.880> cement<00:04:30.110> into<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.290> bone<00:04:31.470> and

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
skin and inject cement into the bone and

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.320 
skin and inject cement into the bone and
that<00:04:31.860> gets<00:04:32.070> patients<00:04:32.520> up<00:04:32.640> and<00:04:32.760> about<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:33.180> lot

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
that gets patients up and about a lot

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.910 
that gets patients up and about a lot
quicker<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:34.020> that's<00:04:34.170> something<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:34.530> okay

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
quicker so that's something that okay

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.490 
quicker so that's something that okay
absolutely<00:04:35.490> yeah<00:04:35.580> cement<00:04:36.540> yes<00:04:36.930> what<00:04:37.260> type<00:04:37.470> of

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
absolutely yeah cement yes what type of

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.230 
absolutely yeah cement yes what type of
cement<00:04:38.010> you<00:04:38.370> know<00:04:38.490> if<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:38.790> told<00:04:38.970> me<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.180> were

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
cement you know if you told me you were

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.760 
cement you know if you told me you were
going<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.480> inject<00:04:39.810> cement<00:04:40.050> my<00:04:40.320> back<00:04:40.530> of<00:04:40.710> you

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
going to inject cement my back of you

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.850 
going to inject cement my back of you
all<00:04:41.190> right<00:04:41.370> dr.<00:04:41.520> Bowe<00:04:41.820> hold<00:04:42.270> on<00:04:42.470> wait<00:04:43.470> just<00:04:43.740> a

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
all right dr. Bowe hold on wait just a

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.680 
all right dr. Bowe hold on wait just a
second<00:04:44.160> what<00:04:44.280> do<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.430> mean<00:04:44.610> um<00:04:44.820> calcium

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
second what do you mean um calcium

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.530 
second what do you mean um calcium
phosphate<00:04:46.140> so<00:04:46.580> if<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:47.790> have<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:47.970> compression

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
phosphate so if you have a compression

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.660 
phosphate so if you have a compression
fracture<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:49.710> means<00:04:49.890> this<00:04:50.070> bone<00:04:50.340> may<00:04:50.580> have

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
fracture that means this bone may have

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.030 
fracture that means this bone may have
broken<00:04:50.910> down<00:04:51.030> because<00:04:51.540> your<00:04:52.380> bone<00:04:52.560> is<00:04:52.710> brittle

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
broken down because your bone is brittle

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.640 
broken down because your bone is brittle
yep<00:04:53.610> osteoporosis<00:04:54.260> so<00:04:55.260> we<00:04:55.380> have<00:04:55.500> this

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
yep osteoporosis so we have this

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.780 
yep osteoporosis so we have this
procedure<00:04:55.800> where<00:04:56.370> we<00:04:56.790> dock<00:04:57.300> too<00:04:57.990> small

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
procedure where we dock too small

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.910 
procedure where we dock too small
trocars<00:04:59.790> and<00:05:00.090> through<00:05:00.900> these<00:05:01.020> we<00:05:01.380> insert<00:05:01.890> a

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
trocars and through these we insert a

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.490 
trocars and through these we insert a
balloon<00:05:02.280> inflate<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.360> balloon<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:04.170> occupy

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
balloon inflate the balloon to occupy

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.930 
balloon inflate the balloon to occupy
the<00:05:04.560> space<00:05:04.890> and<00:05:05.070> then<00:05:05.160> just<00:05:05.340> put<00:05:05.520> cement<00:05:05.700> in

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
the space and then just put cement in

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.370 
the space and then just put cement in
that<00:05:06.060> space<00:05:06.300> what<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:07.050> does<00:05:07.200> is<00:05:07.230> it

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
that space what that does is it

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.710 
that space what that does is it
stabilizes<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.100> bone<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:08.640> peaches<00:05:09.480> get<00:05:09.630> it

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
stabilizes the bone and peaches get it

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.880 
stabilizes the bone and peaches get it
up<00:05:09.810> put<00:05:09.960> about<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.170> lot<00:05:10.320> quicker<00:05:10.500> I've<00:05:10.740> actually
