 electrical sputtering and that's why it's not 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.930
 it was strange that rumors and

 ensures an apex dispatch dated on

 cat called oscar that and apparently 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.950
 knows in advance when the spectrum of 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.190
 death is going to charge a victim the

 five minutes touring our world 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.060
 surprising a national production 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.010

 certificate number three thousand 664 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.130
 that premonitory cat named Oscar 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.200
 was picked up and adopted by the staff 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.619
 in the geriatric care center 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.710
 steere house in providence rotates island 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.319
 when I was newborn 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.780
 as he grew older he became used to 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.149
 stay in the third floor unit 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.969
 where people who suffer from 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.420
 alzheimer parkinson and other problems 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:02.109
 pediatric as reported by the doctor 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.329
 David dosa in an emotional essay that 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.459
 published in the prestigious journal of 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.340
 new england medicine 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:12.099
 Oscar since he was six months old 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.640
 He used to go through the pavilions 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.560
 as doctors and nurses do 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.989
 stopping to observe the patients in 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.010
 each one of the beds continuing 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.010
 after his journey 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.290
 but on certain occasions he seemed to score 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.590
 something in particular in certain 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.050
 sick and instead of continuing to give 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.570
 few turns around to 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.520
 then lie on the floor next to you and 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.640
 stay there all night 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.190
 it is almost certain in such cases that the 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.190
 patient will soon die 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.780
 rarely he has been wrong assures 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.689
 doctor dosa and that strange ability to 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.409
 intuit the presence of death has 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:05.239
 done that already the staff of the institute 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:08.959
 when I see oscar standing guard 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.810
 next to the bed of some sick person 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.790
 to the relatives of who are prepared 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.790
 for an imminent death 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.019
 according to doctor dosa many relatives 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.110
 They appreciate that gesture because it allows them 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:29.050
 be with your debt before they die 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.090
 the doctor joanne tino of the university 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.510
 brown that treats patients in state 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.990
 terminal in the center still said and 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.960
 we visit oscar seems to take very into 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.780
 its function and is more precise in 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.400
 recognize the imminence of death that 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.400
 the professionals who work there 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.069
 once a sick person in charge 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.560
 it looked so bad that she warned the 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.040
 guard staff be prepared 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.730
 well in a matter of ten or twelve hours when 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.940
 I was going to die 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.920
 I miss you however, that the cat 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.099
 I was not lying at the feet of 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.010
 patient and he thought that the little 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:18.459
 feline was not infallible after all 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.330
 but his estimate was the one that was 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.729
 wrong because after a while the cat approached 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.660
 to the bed and lying on the floor 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:33.240
 He remained reclined there 45 minutes 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.240
 after the patient died 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.620
 the divinatory phenomenon of oscar has 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.840
 called so much attention that the doctor 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.880
 nicolÃ¡s dot man who leads a 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.650

 veterinary of tufts university 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.320
 commented after reading the article of 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.810
 doctor because if that pattern of 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.960
 premonitory behavior of the cat 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.540
 is still so successful deserves to be 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.560
 make a statistical study of it the 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:12.310
 successful circuit presented our
