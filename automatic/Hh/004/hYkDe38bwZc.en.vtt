00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
they couldn't go back off the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.619

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
Mississippi they only could jump because

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.750 
Mississippi they only could jump because
it<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.170> current<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.129> strong<00:00:53.160> so

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it was so current was so strong so

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.819 
it was so current was so strong so
that's<00:00:54.030> why<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.360> had<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.660> stay<00:00:55.410> would<00:00:55.559> sell

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that's why they had to stay would sell

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
that's why they had to stay would sell
their<00:00:55.860> boats<00:00:56.219> when<00:00:56.489> they<00:00:56.579> got<00:00:56.730> down<00:00:56.910> here<00:00:56.969> for
