00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
not like I'm going through the motions

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.509 
not like I'm going through the motions
that's<00:02:53.440> not<00:02:53.620> what<00:02:53.739> my<00:02:53.829> days<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.160> like<00:02:54.280> I'm<00:02:54.400> not

going<00:02:55.060> through<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.510> motions<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.079> am<00:02:56.380> erasing

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
going through the motions I am erasing

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.750 
going through the motions I am erasing
through<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.180> motions<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.810> am<00:02:59.170> struggling<00:03:00.130> to

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
through the motions I am struggling to

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.720 
through the motions I am struggling to
keep<00:03:01.030> grasp<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.959> motions<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:02.799> my<00:03:03.069> life<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
keep grasp of the motions of my life the

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.020 
keep grasp of the motions of my life the
motions<00:03:04.180> are<00:03:04.299> moving<00:03:05.049> at<00:03:05.200> such<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.220> rate<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:06.549> I

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
motions are moving at such a rate that I

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.640 
motions are moving at such a rate that I
am<00:03:07.180> hanging<00:03:07.660> on<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.319> I<00:03:09.280> am<00:03:09.760> hoping<00:03:10.090> that<00:03:11.079> it<00:03:11.410> is

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
am hanging on and I am hoping that it is

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.449 
am hanging on and I am hoping that it is
going<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.160> come<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.549> some<00:03:12.730> type<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:13.030> fruition

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
going to come to some type of fruition

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.970 
going to come to some type of fruition
