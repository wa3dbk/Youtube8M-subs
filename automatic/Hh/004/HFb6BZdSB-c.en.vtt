00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.750
 if you want to know how I made this rosette 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.790
 to hold this plate to close this 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.340
 about so special with a card 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.080
 equally special 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.080
 please watch the video 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.330
 I have this card 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.669
 that you have seen in other videos that you 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.670
 I leave here below the links too 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.949
 here here look below the good video and 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.680
 I have made it up to the envelope 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:42.820
 special and everything but I want to finish the 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.070
 with a badge that I also made of 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.829
 the communion for the girl that I'm going to 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.500
 give away and I wanted to not only put here the 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.530
 chapita but close this with a kind 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.070
 of rosette then matching with the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.619
 inside with the vegetable paper to make 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.670
 the rosette I need a strip of paper 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:06.460
 vegetable about an inch wide yes 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.390
 and then I'm going to cut it for it 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.560
 placed the paper here 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.560
 to an inch 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.120
 and I cut it 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.390
 and so does a rosette not excessively 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.390
 big now I'm going to mark 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.250
 every quarter inch 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.340
 I'm going to mark a cleft 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.390
 and now I have marked all 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.240
 senses 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.870
 and with this tool that is the same 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.400
 that I used in the postcard to do this 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:02.280
 lace here this valance i 'm going to make 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.560
 I'm going to cut this border too 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.090
 we started here 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.090
 and now we place 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.560
 we place in a way that matches 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.750
 this 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.750
 this I have agreed here in the drawing 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.650
 and so this will also match us now 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.650
 we see it 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.959
 and now this last one that is hidden 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.930
 the latter that was hidden and this 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:40.450
 that is here that matches the drawing 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.450
 which is of reference there 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.120
 and we keep cutting and that's how we're going 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.400
 stay all the time we are doing 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.160
 lace the last we've done what 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.990
 we hide and this one that stays here has 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.610
 that match the drawing of 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.290
 reference 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.200
 and this side supported there 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.409
 and we are doing the whole string now 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.500
 I already have all the string drilled and 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:11.629
 I only have to double one to 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.960
 up another one down in accordion plan 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.830
 one for 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.710
 up and another down to fold me 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.270
 easy because I have marked I have marked the 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.270
 Folds already with the board 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.690
 do not 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:33.610
 I already have all this as an accordion I'm going 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.740
 to have prepared these cards as 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.210
 lan to go for envelope I'll have 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.750
 prepared about 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.180
 two circles can have prepared two 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.420
 circles that are more or less the size 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.390
 from the center of what I want 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.170
 put 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.170
 I'm going to make another 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.530
 to hold well this first thing 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.569
 I'm going to join these two parts 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.190
 so I throw a little bit of silicones 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:11.920
 hot 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:15.820
 they made fast go backward kachin 10 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.820
 well we do well 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.190
 and it looks good 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.330
 and now we double this part again 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.120
 where the 3 and licona 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.580
 now we put this like this 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.760
 so this is already peeled we put like this 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.270
 we sink and accept and the 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.270
 circulito 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.660
 we put this like that on the little circle and 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.740
 we throw silicone centered as much as 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.870
 we can throw hot silicone there 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.920
 and we already joined 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:56.750
 thus closing the rosette on top of the 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.750
 circle and we wait for it to dry 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.599
 and we hit another little circle on this side 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.599
 we put silicone on this side too 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.900
 and we paste 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.970
 we make another circle more 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:23.639
 and this is going to be the one that holds the sheet 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:26.539
 so for that we do two 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.539
 holes 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.470
 with a tool of these 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.980
 boring we make a hole for a 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.210
 side 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:43.000
 and another hole for the other and then 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.000
 to these holes we fasten the sheet 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:56.889
 we close it and we put a point here 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.879
 hot silicone and another point here 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.879
 and we paste 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:09.800
 and we have the rosette in this way 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:13.250
 the girl can 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.139
 break instead of pasting this directly 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.139
 to the rosette in this way the girl can 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.100
 break the paper and keep the sheet 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.500
 and take advantage of it 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.620
 this glue serves so that what you 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.390
 stick with it can take off and paste 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.030
 take off and paste several times without 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.540
 problem as a post-it then we go 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.960
 to throw here here the envelope a little bit 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.960
 from this 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.700
 and let it dry 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:46.249
 how I got too much glue the 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:48.550
 I'm really going to remove a little bit 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:51.160
 with a paper 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:54.690
 that if there is not much left and I will try 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.690
 put it back here 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:02.060
 when the glue is dry that is left 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:06.230
 so sticky to the touch is that you can already 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:09.350
 close the envelope and we could open it and 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:12.470
 close it so many times I do not know 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.810
 how many times so that so 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.510
 I can save the postcard then now 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:21.550
 already with hot silicone we are going to place 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.550
 here the rosette 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:33.090
 and that's how I think it's the perfect 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.890
 stamp for such a special envelope with a 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.009
 inside card also likewise 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.409
 special 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:41.839
