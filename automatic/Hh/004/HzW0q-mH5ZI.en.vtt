00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.000 

I<00:02:53.180> think<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.690> may<00:02:53.900> have<00:02:53.930> had<00:02:54.200> some<00:02:54.440> impact<00:02:54.620> on

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.020 

well<00:03:21.109> I<00:03:21.140> again<00:03:21.739> Jim<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.099> think<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.489> relates<00:03:22.849> to

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
well I again Jim I think that relates to

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.229 
well I again Jim I think that relates to
a<00:03:23.060> certain<00:03:23.390> extent<00:03:23.749> too

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239
