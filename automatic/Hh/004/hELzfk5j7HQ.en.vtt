00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:10.170
 chocolate brownie did not like it 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:12.450
 liking the idea then let's go there 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.799
 preheat the oven to 180 degrees celsius 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.690
 average temperature 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.400
 I do not know if I've asked any more here 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.170
 I did not understand the samba of this one. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.260
 serious here is this 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.570
 in itu gustavo imagine the following the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.539
 oven takes about 15 minutes 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.730
 to reach 180 degrees and not so 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.250
 that we were not going to put the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.290
 Bun in the oven is the temperature 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.250
 environment after five minutes in 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.770
 degrees after 10-150 has already wrong 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.290
 recipe so that preheats the oven 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.200
 understood and in the case of meat 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 example imagine you have to be there 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.510
 In other words, you have to give that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.079
 temperature at roast beef at 200 degrees 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.100
 if you put it in the oven off it 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.230
 warming up with the oven in a sky 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.890
 Meat also goes wrong, you have to 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.840
 heat 15 minutes or so 1 x 1 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.780
 with butter a rectangular baking sheet 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.780
 medium and sprinkle with wheat flour 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.840
 Gustavo, you just made me rethink. 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.960
 in a classic expression the whole 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.140
 cake recipe there has a kick with 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.850
 butter and sprinkle with flour the way 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.579
 that you put on I realized that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.040
 formed a very uniform layer it has 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.799
 k uniform best way is to get a 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.299
 spoon of flour put into the chair of the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.759
 good shake 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.040
 maybe the best way to express it 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.840
 do not be told heard because it sprinkled 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.729
 even it is not by the sieve for the flour 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.320
 and the baking powder to a chopped bowl 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.320
 thick white chocolate mix with 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.439
 flour the yeast cooking reserve 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.180
 requires a certain is not anyone and I think 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.540
 that the person who cooks can already 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.270
 to consider an intelligent person with qi 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.740
 above the average is then through the sieve 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.340
 I need to pass fire and the 'la olla' that gives 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.470
 only started from the sieve make the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.810
 flour and baking powder for a 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.290
 she smile would do in here and now 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.470
 again in the same series frescuras da 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:27.060
 kitchen type pre heat the oven to that 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.860
 you need to sift it here and that thick 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.600
 white chocolate mix with flour and 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.100
 yeast reserve I'm going to do water bath and 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.870
 bitter chocolate to transfer to 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.970
 a bowl and add the butter place 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.490
 two fingers of water in the pan and 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.170
 high heat when boiling bring the heat down 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.650
 bowl boxes with your help that is 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.480
 in her 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.130
 The secret is not to let water touch the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.740
 bottom of the bowl and take care that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.860
 the fitting of the containers is perfect 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.180
 which is serotonin freshness and there the fitting 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.920
 have not people look this is not possible 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.709
 has a habit of eating very little 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.410
 Gustavo funny this way you are 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.750
 doing water bath is like I saw in the 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.280
 my childhood people doing more 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.980
 Right way is the next you have to get 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.320
 a pan smaller than the bowl for the 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.240
 bowl does not fit and does not 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.959
 more rigid grandfather filled with water because 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:22.130
 from there it will touch water in the bottom of the bowl 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.130
 there's no way 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:33.980
 Ah my God, churn because that 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:37.310
 battery is as heavy as possible 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.159
 you do not complain says edstrom bago full 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.620
 everybody keeps an eye on your 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:50.480
 mixer and you complaining about weight 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:53.360
 A wonderful cup of tea is wonderful. 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.060
 Our tea half is sugar enough 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.040
 like that a cup of tea 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.459
 Our people are right. 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.459
 for three minutes 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.790
 I'm good, it's not because your mix 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:14.550
 whitened my ex and can do 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.739
 a degree i do not swear a lot of pride 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.019
 you can come across sparring motherland 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.340
 silicone is very good for me I just 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:26.220
 I get 14 silicone and irritate sure that 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.920
 need to have others I think it's good to have 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.980
 wooden spoon or bamboo spoon is not 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.200
 which replaced the old wooden spoon 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.080
 because some recipes the spatula of 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.830
 silicone is a little too flexible is 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.390
 which is something a little more good firm 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.330
 in the bowl with the chocolate dough 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.830
 that there gradually add the mixture 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.030
 of flour with white chocolate 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.030
 leaving to stir gently 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:57.590
 The candidate told me how you can 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.670
 do not do at the same time the 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.260
 who moves with the left who no longer 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.500
 have business coordination does not stop 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.070
 move on a tip for you like 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.680
 Whenever you stir a bowl it's with 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.690
 anything you put under cloth 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.850
 wet for her not to dance and the 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.880
 same thing on the cutting board and 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.470
 a piece of paper towel dipped wet 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.260
 for the cutting board do not keep dancing 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:29.810
 Also cool is nice 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.810
 transfer the mass to know a taboo 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.520
 ready now 20 minutes 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.470
 our 1 mouth water total but I am 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.200
 thinking that doing a little big and 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:06:00.920
 takes the size you ask for in the recipe 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:05.210
 I think it worked very well in one of ours. 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:08.600
 has grown then but does not have a 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.540
 business advance side stick that puts 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:15.470
 Lord, I do it, Rita begins to 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.690
 History of the toothpick Gina does not like it 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.270
 Cabral does not have a palette trick, it's just for 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.220
 cake that we put the little pin to 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.250
 see if treated strip was here then 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.440
 How can you get the cake the brownie he has? 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.240
 which leave damp from the oven a face of which 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.280
 has not yet finished afar 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.080
 That's the big difference from a brownie. 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.140
 and a chocolate egg 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:40.970
 it was not I'm going to trust the time it is 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:43.790
 in the book and then the rita speaks to shoot and 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.620
 let cool guy but I think it gave 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:52.060
 Why do you know when to go? 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:52.060
 For what side, look there, people are hot. 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.770
 You see what you're playing? 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:14.580
 Look, he's a good looking guy. 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.900
 likely the photon is a little higher 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.680
 but I think maybe baking because it is 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.600
 smaller 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.510
 exactly baking had to be a 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.790
 the smallest and highest in Brazil and 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.400
 to be more chubby but for what I 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:29.970
 I'm looking, it 's perfect 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.010
 Congratulations gustavo so tell me 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.380
 that's just the way it is 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.930
 He looks like he appeared in the club. 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:41.729
 Even though I'm done ready 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:44.520
 I can die happy I liked it too I am 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:50.030
 it was amazing to see its evolution 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.030
 in eight recipes very nice congratulations
