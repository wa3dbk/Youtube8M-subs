 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.869
 video he is gamer 2 and today here we are 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.519
 with the very special Christmas special 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.890
 25 12 2014 and today precisely this 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.650
 video will be a little more special because there 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.329
 i will show how and download minecraft 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.789
 version 1.3.1 the last one that came out on 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.940
 your computer for free 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:43.449
 then the tv link will put in 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.230
 description you will see a page of 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.789
 let 3 3 seconds wait and then that 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.160
 it appears from this page 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:55.359
 on the other page of mediafire and with i 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.600
 download in the launcher and 1.8 megabytes 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:01.629
 which it is one of very few truly inspired 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.089
 you've downloaded it from you by taking 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:08.259
 download as always fascinating on 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.470
 desktop then extract the file I recommend 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.090
 extract it because otherwise it counts for nothing 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.590
 the squeezes will appear to you four 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.110
 elements 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.000
 and between one of these there will necessarily be 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.119
 this kn launcher scene 404 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.689
 here is you and the doors that download everything 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.570
 game 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:32.590
 this is the minecraft game you there 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:37.689
 double click it will appear 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.990
 this other window or you do ok then 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.689
 via truth here you do a little training 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.770
 because otherwise you don't get it right 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:50.079
 you have to put your username I have 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.049
 so I did n't see it I didn't do it 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:56.289
 to put our nickname back 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.969
 so let's put replay after you 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.070
 sign in 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:04.210
 then here as we could see now we can 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.759
 click on it and this bar 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.040
 you will have to wait for it to complete what it has 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.960
 wanted maximum type two minutes depends 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.310
 has had so little 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.300
 now it obviously took little 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.790
 why 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.400
 I've already started the king of rescues 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.850
 they are essays that are precisely those of the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.860
 videos from here and with the writing 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.720
 changes every time it doesn't fall though 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.120
 okay i say 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.150
 and then here he unloaded pancreas with 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:36.270
 played the single all players and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:42.730
 I thank the options where it is the same 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:45.160
 bielsa is the of the world I created 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.530
 the other time I created precisely for the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.940
 gameplay 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:55.300
 so this video is finished we finished 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.460
 because I give you shorter than the 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.130
 others that last a quarter of an hour twenty 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.780
 minutes a quarter of an hour is because there 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.870
 I wanted to make you in this video because 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.450
 maybe if some people maybe are 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.480
 a little more in difficulty who does not know where 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:17.110
 find the latest version of minecraft 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:20.080
 that also beautiful additions and nothing 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.730
 so I hope as it has been so useful 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.730
 hello everyone and merry christmas
