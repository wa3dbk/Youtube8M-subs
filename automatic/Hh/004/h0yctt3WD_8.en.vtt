00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.880 
card and warranty this looks like it's
in<00:01:35.820> Japanese<00:01:36.689> there<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.409> go<00:01:40.280> okay<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.890> the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.800 
camera comes with a pretty thick manual
and<00:01:47.549> looks<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.619> software<00:01:50.159> CD<00:01:50.689> now<00:01:51.689> I'm

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and looks like the software CD now I'm

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.380 
and looks like the software CD now I'm
going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.170> using<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.799> via<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.390> firewire

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
going to be using this via a firewire

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.050 
going to be using this via a firewire
connection<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> 24-inch<00:01:55.979> imac<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.909> so

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
connection to the 24-inch imac and so

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.370 
connection to the 24-inch imac and so
i'll<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.329> using<00:01:58.159> imovie<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.430> it's<00:02:00.030> imovie<00:02:00.600> 06

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
i'll be using imovie the it's imovie 06

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.399 
i'll be using imovie the it's imovie 06
the<00:02:01.530> HD<00:02:01.920> version<00:02:02.130> rather<00:02:02.610> than

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
the HD version rather than

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.630 
the HD version rather than
the<00:02:03.710> iMovie<00:02:04.490> 08<00:02:05.679> I'm<00:02:06.679> not<00:02:06.799> hurt<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.009> lot<00:02:07.219> good

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
the iMovie 08 I'm not hurt a lot good

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.070 
the iMovie 08 I'm not hurt a lot good
about<00:02:07.999> the<00:02:08.300> newest<00:02:08.810> version<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.229> iMovie<00:02:09.739> so

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
about the newest version of iMovie so

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.880 
about the newest version of iMovie so
but<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.140> think<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.500> will<00:02:12.560> probably<00:02:12.739> get

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
but I think that will probably get

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.650 
but I think that will probably get
better<00:02:13.129> so<00:02:13.519> that<00:02:13.549> when<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:13.970> next<00:02:14.120> version<00:02:14.390> of

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
better so that when the next version of

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.520 
better so that when the next version of
ilife<00:02:14.810> comes<00:02:15.349> out<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.590> may<00:02:15.950> may<00:02:17.170> upgrade<00:02:18.170> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
ilife comes out I may may upgrade to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.160 
ilife comes out I may may upgrade to

hv20 i believe which was in silver and

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.270 
hv20 i believe which was in silver and
this<00:04:01.160> is<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.519> black<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:03.290> that's<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.709> camera

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
this is in black so that's the camera

built-in<00:04:06.579> lens<00:04:07.579> cover<00:04:08.540> right<00:04:08.870> there

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
built-in lens cover right there

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.160 
built-in lens cover right there
and<00:04:11.520> we've<00:04:12.520> got<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.760> little<00:04:12.910> bit<00:04:13.000> more<00:04:13.270> in<00:04:13.570> the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.380 

think<00:04:41.620> this<00:04:41.800> might<00:04:42.100> be<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.520> battery<00:04:42.760> cover

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
think this might be the battery cover

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.950 
think this might be the battery cover
not<00:04:44.080> sure<00:04:44.470> what<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:45.250> right<00:04:45.750> here<00:04:46.750> this

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
piece for the battery charging

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.700 
piece for the battery charging
electrical<00:04:55.600> power<00:04:55.780> right<00:04:56.260> there<00:05:01.620> here's<00:05:02.620> a

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
electrical power right there here's a

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:10.470 
electrical power right there here's a
battery<00:05:07.680> more<00:05:08.680> ok<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:09.670> is<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:09.910> electrical

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
battery more ok this is the electrical

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.570 
battery more ok this is the electrical
cord<00:05:10.750> itself<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:13.350> finally<00:05:14.350> looks<00:05:15.100> like<00:05:15.310> some

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
cord itself and finally looks like some

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.460 
cord itself and finally looks like some
more<00:05:15.760> video<00:05:16.150> cables<00:05:16.690> in<00:05:16.900> there<00:05:17.170> and<00:05:17.880> that<00:05:19.470> put
