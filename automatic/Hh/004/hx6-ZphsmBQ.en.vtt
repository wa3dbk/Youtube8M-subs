00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
is about and I keep avoiding answering

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.540 
is about and I keep avoiding answering
that<00:00:50.309> because<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.590> hard<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.280> explain

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that because it's really hard to explain

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.010 
that because it's really hard to explain
the<00:00:53.730> premise<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> because<00:00:54.750> kind<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the premise of it because kind of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.660 
the premise of it because kind of
complicated<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.739> I'm<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.520> right

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
complicated but I'm going to do it right

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.970 
complicated but I'm going to do it right
now<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.660> basically<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.260> story<00:00:58.500> takes<00:00:58.859> place

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
now so basically the story takes place

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.080 
now so basically the story takes place
in<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.609> kind<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.410> other<00:01:01.520> dimension<00:01:02.520> kind<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
in this kind of other dimension kind of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.789 
in this kind of other dimension kind of
thing<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.840> our<00:01:03.960> world<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.589> very
