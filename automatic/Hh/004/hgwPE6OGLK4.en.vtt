not put in some coconut rum into the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.660 
not put in some coconut rum into the
cream<00:03:02.560> as<00:03:02.680> well<00:03:02.830> we've<00:03:02.980> done<00:03:03.100> that<00:03:03.220> before<00:03:03.550> you

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
can do but I think there should be

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.870 
can do but I think there should be
enough<00:03:05.440> on<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.620> put<00:03:05.830> on<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.040> pineapple<00:03:06.250> okay

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
enough on the put on the pineapple okay

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.550
