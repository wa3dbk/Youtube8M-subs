00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
basically what I'll do is I'll shut off

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.999 
basically what I'll do is I'll shut off
the<00:01:45.720> video<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.290> I'll<00:01:46.560> set<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the video here and I'll set up and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.850 
the video here and I'll set up and
actually<00:01:47.159> throw<00:01:47.689> throw<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.930> atlatl<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
actually throw throw the atlatl and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.120 
actually throw throw the atlatl and
explain<00:01:50.369> how<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.759> works<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.560> let<00:01:52.710> me<00:01:52.799> stop<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
explain how it works so let me stop the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
explain how it works so let me stop the
video<00:01:53.340> here<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.549> we'll<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:58.320> we

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
video here and we'll do that so what we

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.410 
video here and we'll do that so what we
have<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.740> an<00:01:58.890> atlatl<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.610> basically<00:02:00.060> an

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
have is an atlatl is basically an

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.719 
have is an atlatl is basically an
extension<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.590> your<00:02:01.740> arm<00:02:01.799> if<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.310> were<00:02:02.430> had<00:02:02.579> an

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
extension of your arm if you were had an

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.270 
extension of your arm if you were had an
arm<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.149> was<00:02:03.270> say<00:02:03.810> six<00:02:04.649> or<00:02:04.770> seven<00:02:05.040> feet<00:02:05.250> long

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
arm that was say six or seven feet long

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.190 
arm that was say six or seven feet long
you'd<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.850> able<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.149> throw<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> spear<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.930> lot

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you'd be able to throw a spear a lot

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.430 
you'd be able to throw a spear a lot
longer<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.160> lot<00:02:08.310> faster<00:02:08.509> if<00:02:09.509> you're<00:02:10.259> if

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
longer and a lot faster if you're if

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.290 
longer and a lot faster if you're if
you're<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.489> hadn't<00:02:11.760> armed<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.030> was<00:02:12.180> long

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
you're if you hadn't armed that was long

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.430 
you're if you hadn't armed that was long
so<00:02:12.480> basically<00:02:12.840> using<00:02:13.230> these

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
so basically using these

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.620 
so basically using these
the<00:02:13.620> extension<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.220> your<00:02:14.370> arm<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.090> what<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.540> is

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
the extension of your arm and what it is

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.840 
the extension of your arm and what it is
you're<00:02:16.110> actually<00:02:16.290> pushing<00:02:16.740> pushing<00:02:17.550> the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
you're actually pushing pushing the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.110 
you're actually pushing pushing the
spear<00:02:18.360> through<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.110> air<00:02:19.580> from<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> back<00:02:20.910> so

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
spear through the air from the back so

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.090 
spear through the air from the back so
it's<00:02:21.270> hooks<00:02:21.840> into<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.140> back<00:02:22.320> there's<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.680> what

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
it's hooks into the back there's it what

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.260 
it's hooks into the back there's it what
you<00:02:23.220> do<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.490> get<00:02:23.640> yourself<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.060> piece<00:02:24.210> of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
you do is you get yourself a piece of

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.200 
you do is you get yourself a piece of
cane<00:02:24.570> or<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.870> bamboo<00:02:25.230> or<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.920> stick<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.790> try

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
cane or a bamboo or a stick and you try

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.820 
cane or a bamboo or a stick and you try
to<00:02:27.240> hollow<00:02:27.570> out<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.020> end<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.410> make<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.560> little

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
to hollow out the end and make a little

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.740 
to hollow out the end and make a little
socket<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.520> that's<00:02:29.970> what<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.210> fits<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.660> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
socket and that's what it fits in the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.650 
socket and that's what it fits in the
back<00:02:30.960> here<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.380> then<00:02:31.860> you're<00:02:32.010> basically<00:02:32.660> your

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
back here and then you're basically your

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.800 
back here and then you're basically your
your<00:02:33.990> stance<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.310> you're

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
your stance is like this and you're

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.030 
your stance is like this and you're
thrusting<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.900> through<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.170> air<00:02:37.260> pushing<00:02:37.920> it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
thrusting it through the air pushing it

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.660 
thrusting it through the air pushing it
from<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.460> back<00:02:38.700> out<00:02:39.540> out<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:41.010> then<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.640> next

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
from the back out out and then the next

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.580 
from the back out out and then the next
shot<00:02:42.030> get<00:02:42.300> all<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.810> can<00:02:42.840> actually<00:02:43.320> see<00:02:43.500> it

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
shot get all you can actually see it

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.020 
shot get all you can actually see it
going<00:02:43.740> through<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.070> air<00:02:44.190> here<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.520> I'm<00:02:44.880> going

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
going through the air here so I'm going

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.260 
going through the air here so I'm going
like<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.390> I'm<00:02:45.630> pushing<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.440> out<00:02:47.180> into<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
like this I'm pushing it out into the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.330 
like this I'm pushing it out into the
air<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.630> basically<00:02:49.290> ad<00:02:49.680> allows<00:02:49.920> were<00:02:50.130> used

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
air and basically ad allows were used

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.160 
air and basically ad allows were used
before<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.360> invention<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.870> bow<00:02:51.990> and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
before the invention of the bow and

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.920 
before the invention of the bow and
arrow<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:53.070> hunting<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.460> large<00:02:54.150> megafauna<00:02:54.690> like

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
arrow for hunting a large megafauna like

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.440 
arrow for hunting a large megafauna like
like<00:02:55.560> bison<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.370> mammoths<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.060> things<00:02:57.240> and

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
like bison and mammoths and things and

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.000 
like bison and mammoths and things and
then<00:02:57.510> eventually<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.080> bow<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.680> arrow<00:02:58.740> was

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
then eventually the bow and arrow was

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.190 
then eventually the bow and arrow was
developed<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.490> in<00:02:59.670> North<00:02:59.820> America<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.600> then

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
developed here in North America and then

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.860 
developed here in North America and then
the<00:03:01.980> atlatl<00:03:02.340> came<00:03:02.760> it's<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.180> lot<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:03.450> use<00:03:03.570> but<00:03:03.750> it

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
the atlatl came it's a lot of use but it

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.270 
the atlatl came it's a lot of use but it
is<00:03:03.900> still<00:03:04.200> used<00:03:04.560> by<00:03:05.750> Aborigines<00:03:06.750> or<00:03:07.110> was<00:03:08.010> used

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
is still used by Aborigines or was used

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.660 
is still used by Aborigines or was used
by<00:03:08.730> Aborigines<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.810> people<00:03:10.260> up<00:03:10.380> in<00:03:10.530> the

by Aborigines and and people up in the
Arctic<00:03:11.670> region<00:03:12.030> for<00:03:12.630> hunting<00:03:12.990> in<00:03:13.940> kayaks<00:03:14.940> and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
Arctic region for hunting in kayaks and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.150 
Arctic region for hunting in kayaks and
things<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.570> so<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.620> was<00:03:16.710> used<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.040> all

throughout the world and and and it's a
very<00:03:19.770> valuable<00:03:20.180> instrument<00:03:21.180> for<00:03:21.330> pushing<00:03:22.080> our

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
very valuable instrument for pushing our

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.320 
very valuable instrument for pushing our
thrusting<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.770> spear<00:03:23.130> through<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:23.940> air<00:03:24.060> at

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
thrusting of spear through the air at

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.880 
thrusting of spear through the air at
great<00:03:24.630> distances<00:03:25.140> as<00:03:25.350> you'll<00:03:25.470> see<00:03:25.620> here<00:03:25.800> in

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
great distances as you'll see here in

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.670 
great distances as you'll see here in
just<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.100> second

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.589 

so<00:03:33.280> I'm<00:03:33.370> gonna<00:03:33.459> walk<00:03:33.670> out<00:03:33.849> here<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.120> shoot
