be singing for us a few months since say
the<00:00:16.750> tree<00:00:16.990> came<00:00:17.260> down<00:00:17.640> there<00:00:18.640> is<00:00:18.760> a<00:00:18.789> time<00:00:19.090> to

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:19.269 
the tree came down there is a time to

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:28.010 
the tree came down there is a time to
look<00:00:19.390> at<00:00:19.570> it<00:00:19.689> and<00:00:19.810> see<00:00:20.460> what<00:00:21.460> it's<00:00:21.699> like<00:00:21.970> now

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.470 

here<00:00:29.020> are<00:00:29.260> some<00:00:29.650> bits<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:31.200> cut<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.640> use<00:00:33.880> it<00:00:34.150> not

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
here are some bits I cut to use it not

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.000 
here are some bits I cut to use it not
like<00:00:34.810> so<00:00:35.380> I<00:00:35.410> want<00:00:35.770> use<00:00:35.980> of<00:00:36.190> it<00:00:36.370> as<00:00:39.480> 12<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:41.739> may

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
like so I want use of it as 12 that may

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.450 
like so I want use of it as 12 that may
be<00:00:42.070> enough<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.760> get<00:00:45.940> me<00:00:46.150> going<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:48.309> I'll<00:00:48.430> be

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
be enough to get me going what I'll be

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.479 
be enough to get me going what I'll be
trying<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:49.000> do<00:00:49.180> as<00:00:49.989> possible<00:00:50.739> is<00:00:50.949> to<00:00:50.980> get<00:00:51.309> a

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
trying to do as possible is to get a

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.420 
trying to do as possible is to get a
front<00:00:51.790> rail<00:00:52.059> by<00:00:52.989> cutting<00:00:53.410> this<00:00:53.559> carefully<00:00:54.220> I

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
front rail by cutting this carefully I

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.250 
front rail by cutting this carefully I
might<00:00:54.640> be<00:00:54.790> able<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:55.059> get<00:00:55.270> a<00:00:55.300> front<00:00:55.629> rail<00:00:55.870> age<00:00:56.080> of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
might be able to get a front rail age of

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.450 
might be able to get a front rail age of
it<00:00:56.379> as<00:00:56.530> well<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.850> produce<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.559> layouts<00:00:59.949> thedum

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
it as well to produce the layouts thedum

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.390 
it as well to produce the layouts thedum
and<00:01:00.809> these<00:01:01.809> have<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.110> be<00:01:02.290> far<00:01:02.680> before<00:01:02.860> mill

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
and these have to be far before mill

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.380 
and these have to be far before mill
wide<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.780> fourth<00:01:05.320> fourth<00:01:06.070> day<00:01:06.430> long<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
wide and fourth fourth day long and

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.710 
wide and fourth fourth day long and
since<00:01:10.659> 500<00:01:11.409> so<00:01:11.680> that's<00:01:11.860> fine<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.610> would<00:01:13.180> like<00:01:13.510> it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
since 500 so that's fine I would like it

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.070 
since 500 so that's fine I would like it
to<00:01:13.990> be<00:01:14.170> too<00:01:15.120> too<00:01:16.120> big<00:01:17.370> this<00:01:18.370> will<00:01:18.909> start<00:01:19.299> by

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
to be too too big this will start by

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.880 
to be too too big this will start by
putting<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.530> straight<00:01:20.860> edge<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.370> this<00:01:22.890> with

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
putting a straight edge on this with

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.990 
putting a straight edge on this with
that<00:01:24.100> straight<00:01:24.520> inch<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:26.049> begin<00:01:26.409> with<00:01:26.880> then<00:01:27.880> we

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
that straight inch to begin with then we

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.660 
that straight inch to begin with then we
can<00:01:28.180> start<00:01:28.479> squaring<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.170> off<00:01:29.400> cutting<00:01:30.400> it

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
can start squaring it off cutting it

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.650 
can start squaring it off cutting it
down<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:31.630> I'm<00:01:32.140> going<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.440> use<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:33.660> scrub

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
down and I'm going to use the scrub

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.720 
down and I'm going to use the scrub
playing<00:01:35.520> discard<00:01:36.520> this<00:01:36.730> off<00:01:39.300> there's<00:01:40.300> no<00:01:40.690> God

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
playing discard this off there's no God

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:48.720 
playing discard this off there's no God
still<00:01:42.730> got<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.150> get<00:01:43.330> down<00:01:43.540> a<00:01:43.600> bit<00:01:43.900> more<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:48.610> I

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
still got to get down a bit more if I

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.390 
still got to get down a bit more if I
leave<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.150> wood<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.480> little<00:01:49.750> bit<00:01:49.930> long<00:01:50.400> it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
leave the wood a little bit long it

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.980 
leave the wood a little bit long it
means<00:01:51.730> that<00:01:51.940> I've<00:01:52.120> got<00:01:53.010> options<00:01:54.570> as<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.630> have<00:01:55.960> a

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
means that I've got options as to have a

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.740 
means that I've got options as to have a
trim<00:01:56.410> it<00:01:56.560> off<00:01:56.680> if<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.580> plane<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.120> tooth<00:01:58.420> in

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
trim it off if I plane this tooth in

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.680 
trim it off if I plane this tooth in
here<00:01:59.050> then<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.770> may<00:02:00.100> be<00:02:00.160> able<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.580> get<00:02:00.910> that<00:02:03.690> the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
here then I may be able to get that the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.870 
here then I may be able to get that the
extra<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:05.290> I've<00:02:05.440> lost<00:02:05.650> by<00:02:06.100> cutting<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.610> close

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
extra that I've lost by cutting it close

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:27.050 
extra that I've lost by cutting it close
to<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.450> end<00:02:07.690> there

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:36.950 

no<00:02:31.740> let<00:02:32.740> them<00:02:32.920> dry<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> bit<00:02:33.460> more<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.320> final

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
no let them dry a bit more for the final

no let them dry a bit more for the final
final<00:02:37.960> fitting<00:02:38.680> together<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.400> chair<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:40.000> a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.010 

the<00:02:50.100> goal<00:02:50.340> is

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.360 

the<00:02:54.020> benefits<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.770> showering<00:02:56.470> alone<00:02:57.470> long<00:02:58.130> we

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
the benefits of showering alone long we

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:08.730 
the benefits of showering alone long we
often<00:02:58.700> leave<00:02:58.910> things<00:02:59.800> until<00:03:00.800> we<00:03:00.950> sharpen<00:03:01.490> them

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:21.000 

this<00:03:09.740> jack<00:03:10.250> plane<00:03:10.840> has<00:03:12.190> also<00:03:13.190> been<00:03:13.700> sharpened

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.130 

although<00:03:22.010> that's<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.400> bit<00:03:22.550> rough<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:23.980> think<00:03:24.980> I

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
although that's a bit rough I think I

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.170 
although that's a bit rough I think I
believe<00:03:27.140> my<00:03:27.380> options<00:03:27.860> open<00:03:28.040> now<00:03:28.490> until<00:03:31.180> a

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
believe my options open now until a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.949 
believe my options open now until a
couple<00:03:32.810> months<00:03:33.020> down<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.590> line<00:03:34.570> we're<00:03:35.570> making

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
couple months down the line we're making

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.160 
couple months down the line we're making
have<00:03:36.380> another<00:03:36.680> look<00:03:36.860> at<00:03:37.010> it
