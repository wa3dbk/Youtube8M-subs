tires we're going to carry out two tests
the<00:00:54.640> first<00:00:55.269> is<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.540> braking<00:00:56.019> test<00:00:56.229> which<00:00:56.589> will

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
the first is a braking test which will

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.410 
the first is a braking test which will
show<00:00:56.949> clearly<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.489> difference<00:00:57.850> in<00:00:58.000> stopping

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
show clearly the difference in stopping

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.660 
show clearly the difference in stopping
distances<00:00:58.900> for<00:00:59.080> the<00:00:59.199> two<00:00:59.379> tires<00:00:59.710> the<00:01:00.250> second

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
distances for the two tires the second

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.549

is<00:01:00.790> a<00:01:00.820> cornering<00:01:01.360> test<00:01:01.659> which<00:01:02.019> will<00:01:02.170> show<00:01:02.350> how

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
is a cornering test which will show how

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.170 
is a cornering test which will show how
effective<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.220> different<00:01:03.549> tires<00:01:03.790> are<00:01:04.030> at
