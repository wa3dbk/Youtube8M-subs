00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
a little more extreme you can knock it

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.960 
a little more extreme you can knock it
out<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.740> it<00:03:19.830> holds<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> moisture<00:03:20.520> away<00:03:20.850> from

out and it holds the moisture away from
