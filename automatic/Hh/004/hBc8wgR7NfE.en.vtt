in<00:03:24.450> everyday<00:03:24.720> conversation<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:25.530> might<00:03:25.560> hear

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
in everyday conversation you might hear

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.740 
in everyday conversation you might hear
something<00:03:26.100> like<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.790> where<00:03:27.510> we<00:03:27.600> have

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
something like this where we have

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.660 
something like this where we have
somebody<00:03:27.990> in<00:03:28.200> alpha<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:29.040> what<00:03:29.490> they're

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
somebody in alpha and what they're

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.550 
somebody in alpha and what they're
really<00:03:29.820> asking<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.480> course<00:03:30.660> is<00:03:30.959> do<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.290> love

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
really asking of course is do you love

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.470 
really asking of course is do you love
me<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.680> these<00:03:34.830> mismatches<00:03:35.490> are<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.970> source<00:03:36.240> of

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
me so these mismatches are the source of

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.690 
me so these mismatches are the source of
a<00:03:36.600> lot<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.840> pain<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.470> our<00:03:37.590> lives<00:03:37.860> you<00:03:38.400> know<00:03:38.520> it

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
a lot of pain in our lives you know it

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.430 
a lot of pain in our lives you know it
pay<00:03:39.450> attention<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.930> this<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.290> course

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
pay attention to this and of course

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.180 
pay attention to this and of course
online<00:03:40.910> we<00:03:41.910> inadvertently<00:03:42.270> are<00:03:43.110> dishing<00:03:44.070> each

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
online we inadvertently are dishing each

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.560 
online we inadvertently are dishing each
other<00:03:44.370> all<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.610> law<00:03:44.820> all<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.180> time<00:03:45.390> because

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
other all the law all the time because

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.030 
other all the law all the time because
you<00:03:45.660> have<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.080> fill<00:03:46.290> in<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.530> missing<00:03:46.650> body

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
you have to fill in the missing body

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.670 
you have to fill in the missing body
language<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.850> tone<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.330> voice<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.530> it's

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
language and tone of voice and so it's

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.590 
language and tone of voice and so it's
really<00:03:49.920> easy<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.400> flame<00:03:50.730> people<00:03:51.060> without<00:03:51.270> even

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
really easy to flame people without even

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.210 
really easy to flame people without even
meaning<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.290> if<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:52.440> mean<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.770> it's<00:03:52.950> even

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
meaning to and if you mean to it's even
