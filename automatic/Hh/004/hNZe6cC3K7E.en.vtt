00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.900
 at that time, it was already playing 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.089
 but not with a pedagogical practice 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:10.519
 that occurred after him 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.289
 in the conception of basic education 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.849
 which ranges from the child's first months of age 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.810
 until almost the end of adolescence 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.320
 the longer you stay in the photo and good quality 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.769
 the more you learn 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.149
 but you work hard there 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.890
 and - you submit to certain temptations 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.890
 outside the walls 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.800
 the basic guideline law 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.100
 published in 1996 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.240
 organized teaching in brazil so 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.810
 child education 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.770
 Elementary School 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.260
 child education 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.560
 which before the new ldb was seen as a pre-school phase 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.880
 became part of basic education 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.250
 early childhood education first stage of basic education 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.200
 has the purpose of integral development of the child up to 5 years of 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.100
 age in its physical psychological and social aspects 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.580
 complementing family action 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.860
 and community 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.730
 the crisis actually has 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.570
 is very clear goals for six 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.760
 and nowadays 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.240
 what you want and what are 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.310
 is to make children develop their autonomy 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.740
 is that they actually booth 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.380
 also developing identity 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.609
 and as well as the possibility of greater world knowledge 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.039
 the barbarian teacher 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.680
 director of children's center vila praia that stays são paulo 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.340

 of early childhood education 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.510
 within basic education 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.260
 child education 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.250
 What are you going to do? 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.840
 to make the child 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.960
 that a greater repertoire of language 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.280
 through what 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.670
 in a divided with the stocking 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.950
 eide storytelling 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.700
 the teacher prepared she can he wants to reach the child the account 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.090
 victory is already a character 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.190
 there we will see there is an increase in repertoire 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.719
 in the language 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.029
 Let's be there I do not know 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.029
 this is my best phase 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:32.180
 was she suffered despite her selection are wanting very strong in 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.689
 child education 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.239
 is very 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.349
 but refused to explain how to avoid fines 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.269
 in exchange for payment 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.700
 I do not have preference almost totally 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.700
 a black T-shirt presents too much 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.269
 who climbs 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.659
 to anatel 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:56.999
 he reported 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.389
 they have to reach something we have to work with the child 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.309
 do something in the front 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:04.059
 when it started here I do not know 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.609
 well before ldb 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.909
 The teacher Claudia worked differently. 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.849
 this was in 1981 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.729
 I entered almost without study 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:16.629
 I had to be in the selection 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.370
 then we found page time then we looked more acinturado the shaman 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.370
 or caring for the child than for the education for me was a 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.289
 a big whole 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:30.060
 that's where I started 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.489
 I graduated from school 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.829
 I told the truth that I'm not going to stop there, what I want a little more 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.989
 I had the opportunity of college there I got carried away Taliban I'm going to college 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.119
 I do pedagogy 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.119
 the upset son 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:49.469
 red 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:51.189
 it's not him 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.189
 not 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:58.219
 there was a formation and at this moment in the formation of the professional 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:01.239
 smart ass 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.130
 but they had to shoot the leandrão striker to study 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.330
 had to tender again we began to look 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.669
 education 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.849
 child development 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.459
 learning to coexist social integration the lack of waves 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:21.680
 here o 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.229
 they started with garments 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.229
 started with the practice to later seek theory 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.870
 things that today does not happen with the teachers 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:36.840
 the most sought after tests 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.960
 and went back for them because they wanted their children to be cared for somewhere 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.710
 and this does not guarantee you security 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.120
 it was food is good 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.120
 besides the day it was we did not go there 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.759
 sr offers seats 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.520
 we worked a lot for myself 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.780
 their creativity they have to learn how to create things there is 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.569
 caution 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.460
 but he can not be dissociated from education 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.460
 at that time, it was already playing 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.639
 but not with a pedagogical practice 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.509
 that occurred after him 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.210
 go a child 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.610
 do not pass 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.509
 by cei 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.180
 I'll be very honest. 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.389
 He left a lot of samba from dianafm. 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.939
 carried in the luggage 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.860
 for the next stages of teaching 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.490
 is part of the concept brought by ldb 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.250
 of integration between the levels of basic education it is constituted 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.089
 three-step 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:46.759
 sequence reche articulated with each other this is very important here 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.729
 technician 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.050
 more than the change of denomination is the question of the concept of what is 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.389
 basic 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.939
 What is basic? 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:01.610
 should be for all teachers of neopolis who is professor lurdes 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.869
 Marcelino Machado 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:05.719
 are authors of analysis on ldb 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:07.600
 the two agree to affirm 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.830
 that basic education is one of the advances of the law 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.909
 we have a conception of basic education 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:18.169
 which ranges from the child's first months of age 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.130
 until almost the end of adolescence 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.250
 17 18 years we come to this 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:29.029
 year by the confluence of two 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.279
 the first she brings life 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:37.809
 by the rapid urbanization process through which the country has 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.210
 it can not be said 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.889
 the more you think 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:47.770
 anywhere 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.650
 to accommodate me to clog the child after the four months she was born 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.520
 and until then the mother has there 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.669
 it's not for the clt 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:58.009
 breastfeeding or 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.210
 breastfeeding 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.259
 but after four months 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:06.259
 the labor force today is constituted 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.320
 by the female arm by the male arm 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.339
 there is no such space anymore 

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:19.179
 traditional families this same urbanization within the current 

00:07:19.179 --> 00:07:20.629
 capitalism 

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:26.309
 it requires of people the development of the enem and segments 

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:29.050
 ability skills 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.960
 no show 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.180
 Compulsory elementary school does not 

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:36.550
 hence the need and movies 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.169
 basic education is intended to 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:43.460
 developing the learner would ensure the training is indispensable for the 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.150
 exercise of citizenship and provide food to advance in work and 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.990
 in later studies
