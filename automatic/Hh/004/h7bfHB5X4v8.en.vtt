00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.130 
what that's what most likely will be
four<00:02:13.350> point<00:02:13.620> four<00:02:13.770> yards<00:02:14.070> per<00:02:14.190> carry<00:02:15.140> enter

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
four point four yards per carry enter

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.540 
four point four yards per carry enter
Peterson<00:02:16.620> still<00:02:17.040> only<00:02:17.250> got<00:02:18.080> 1,600<00:02:19.080> yards

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
Peterson still only got 1,600 yards

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.080 
Peterson still only got 1,600 yards
that's<00:02:20.550> 400<00:02:21.270> short<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:22.800> what<00:02:23.550> Chris<00:02:23.730> Johnson

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
that's 400 short of what Chris Johnson

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.510 
that's 400 short of what Chris Johnson
put<00:02:24.240> up<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.630> same<00:02:24.780> amount<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.140> carries

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
put up with the same amount the carries

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.940 
put up with the same amount the carries
and<00:02:26.520> then<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:26.970> was<00:02:27.030> like<00:02:27.120> okay<00:02:27.680> let's<00:02:28.680> flip

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
and then I was like okay let's flip

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.010 
and then I was like okay let's flip
let's<00:02:29.280> give<00:02:29.430> Chris<00:02:29.640> Johnson<00:02:30.000> only<00:02:30.210> 314

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
let's give Chris Johnson only 314

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.080 
let's give Chris Johnson only 314
carries<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:31.470> agent<00:02:31.800> Peterson<00:02:32.070> but<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
carries like agent Peterson but the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.030 
carries like agent Peterson but the
thing<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.330> Johnson<00:02:34.080> tires<00:02:34.260> flat<00:02:34.620> from<00:02:34.800> six

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
thing is Johnson tires flat from six

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.670 
thing is Johnson tires flat from six
yards<00:02:35.190> per<00:02:35.460> carry<00:02:36.200> therefore<00:02:37.200> appearance<00:02:37.590> to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
yards per carry therefore appearance to

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.640 
yards per carry therefore appearance to
14<00:02:38.100> hip<00:02:38.430> carries<00:02:39.209> because<00:02:39.780> Johnson<00:02:40.170> had<00:02:40.410> over

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
14 hip carries because Johnson had over

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.090 
14 hip carries because Johnson had over
1700<00:02:41.459> yards<00:02:41.810> which<00:02:42.810> would<00:02:42.990> have<00:02:43.050> put<00:02:43.200> them<00:02:43.380> in

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
1700 yards which would have put them in

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.760 
1700 yards which would have put them in
almost<00:02:44.580> four<00:02:45.300> hundred<00:02:45.450> yards<00:02:45.900> more<00:02:46.140> than

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
almost four hundred yards more than

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.320 
almost four hundred yards more than
Adrian<00:02:47.250> Peterson<00:02:47.959> you<00:02:48.959> see<00:02:49.110> how<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.320> works

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
Adrian Peterson you see how it works

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.210 
Adrian Peterson you see how it works
Chris<00:02:51.330> Johnson<00:02:51.720> will<00:02:51.990> just<00:02:52.020> be<00:02:52.500> still<00:02:53.010> a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
Chris Johnson will just be still a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.000 
Chris Johnson will just be still a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
have more touchdowns and that's why the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.620
