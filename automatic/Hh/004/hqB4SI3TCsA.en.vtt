make origami newspaper pots to plant
seedlings<00:00:07.350> in<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.610> pot<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.000> we're

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
seedlings in this is the pot that we're

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.700 
seedlings in this is the pot that we're
gonna<00:00:09.210> make<00:00:09.480> note<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.200> over<00:00:10.380> has<00:00:10.530> only

two layers of newspaper on the back the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.129 
two layers of newspaper on the back the
front<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.700> bottom<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.599> that'll<00:00:15.929> allow

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
front and on the bottom so that'll allow

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.320 
front and on the bottom so that'll allow
the<00:00:16.199> seedlings<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.830> have<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.609> penetrate<00:00:18.060> roots

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
the seedlings to have it penetrate roots

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.670 
the seedlings to have it penetrate roots
through<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.660> when<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.930> plant<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.380> whole

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
through it when you plant the whole

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.150 
through it when you plant the whole
thing<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> garden<00:00:21.050> now<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.439> start<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
thing in the garden now you start with a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.279 
thing in the garden now you start with a
half<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.730> sheet<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> newspaper<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:25.080> cut<00:00:25.260> a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
half a sheet of newspaper just cut a

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.920 
half a sheet of newspaper just cut a
full<00:00:25.590> sheet<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.859> newspaper<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.490> half<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.779> make

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
full sheet of newspaper in half to make

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.710 
full sheet of newspaper in half to make
a<00:00:28.170> nice<00:00:28.529> big<00:00:28.890> long<00:00:29.189> rectangle<00:00:29.970> we're<00:00:30.630> gonna

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
a nice big long rectangle we're gonna

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.760 
a nice big long rectangle we're gonna
fold<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.380> half<00:00:31.489> three<00:00:32.489> times<00:00:33.000> right<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
fold it in half three times right up and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.549 
fold it in half three times right up and
then<00:00:35.280> right<00:00:35.489> again<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> first<00:00:36.960> fold<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.380> in

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
then right again so the first fold is in

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.729 
then right again so the first fold is in
half<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.250> right<00:00:39.140> you<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.170> make<00:00:40.440> sharp

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
half to the right you can make sharp

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.410 
half to the right you can make sharp
creases<00:00:41.070> better<00:00:41.309> by<00:00:41.520> using<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> knife<00:00:42.120> or<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
creases better by using a knife or a

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:57.319 
creases better by using a knife or a
letter<00:00:42.960> opener<00:00:47.719> up<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:55.489> then<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.640> half<00:00:57.000> again

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
letter opener up and then in half again

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.380 
letter opener up and then in half again
so<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:58.050> fold<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.530> half<00:00:58.559> three<00:00:59.070> times<00:00:59.370> to<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
so we fold it in half three times to the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.729 
so we fold it in half three times to the
right<00:01:00.829> up<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> right<00:01:03.149> making<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.439> much

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
right up and to the right making a much

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.240 
right up and to the right making a much
smaller<00:01:05.129> rectangle<00:01:06.000> yeah<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> first

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
smaller rectangle yeah now the first

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.980 
smaller rectangle yeah now the first
origami<00:01:08.700> move<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.950> open<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:13.549> this<00:01:14.549> side<00:01:14.990> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
origami move you open up this side to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
origami move you open up this side to
make<00:01:16.170> kind<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.590> paper<00:01:16.860> airplane<00:01:17.130> shape<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
make kind of a paper airplane shape to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
make kind of a paper airplane shape to
make<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> triangle<00:01:24.710> now<00:01:25.710> you're<00:01:25.799> gonna<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
make a triangle now you're gonna do the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.010 
make a triangle now you're gonna do the
same<00:01:26.369> thing<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> turn<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> over<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
same thing a turn it over you do the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:38.230 
same thing a turn it over you do the
same<00:01:28.320> thing<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> other<00:01:29.130> side

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.529 

hmm<00:01:40.609> not<00:01:41.609> as<00:01:41.789> anything<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.149> looks<00:01:42.350> okay

hmm not as anything it looks okay
yeah<00:01:47.539> just<00:01:48.539> keep<00:01:48.719> the<00:01:48.869> folds<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.530> nice<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
yeah just keep the folds as nice as you

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.590 
yeah just keep the folds as nice as you
can<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.549> has<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.060> really<00:01:51.390> very

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
can this has this is really very

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.440 
can this has this is really very
forgiving<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.789> don't<00:01:53.789> make<00:01:54.000> perfect

forgiving if you don't make perfect

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.510 
forgiving if you don't make perfect
folds<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.079> doesn't<00:01:55.590> matter<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:56.069> so<00:01:56.280> those

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
folds it doesn't matter it's so those

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370

together okay maybe that kind of a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.319 
together okay maybe that kind of a
little<00:01:58.560> paper<00:01:58.799> airplane<00:01:59.250> shape<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.030> next

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
little paper airplane shape the next

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.690 
little paper airplane shape the next
thing<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.479> we're<00:02:00.659> gonna<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.289> open<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
thing that we're gonna do is open the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.599 
thing that we're gonna do is open the
fan<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.179> other<00:02:03.390> way<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.469> you're<00:02:05.280> gonna<00:02:05.369> take

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
fan the other way so you're gonna take

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.089 
fan the other way so you're gonna take
these<00:02:05.819> two<00:02:06.090> triangles<00:02:06.630> pick<00:02:07.049> them<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.289> hold

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
these two triangles pick them up hold

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.180 
these two triangles pick them up hold
them<00:02:08.899> take<00:02:09.899> these<00:02:10.140> two<00:02:10.380> triangles<00:02:10.590> pick<00:02:11.069> them

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
them take these two triangles pick them

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.979 
them take these two triangles pick them
up<00:02:11.310> hold<00:02:11.700> them<00:02:11.849> there<00:02:12.269> we<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.690> turned<00:02:12.870> it

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
up hold them there we just turned it

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.970 
up hold them there we just turned it
inside<00:02:13.319> out<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.420> toughest<00:02:15.750> part

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
inside out that is the toughest part

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.289 
inside out that is the toughest part
making<00:02:16.980> those<00:02:17.099> two<00:02:17.280> words<00:02:17.579> on<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.849> folds<00:02:18.209> and

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
making those two words on the folds and

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.240 
making those two words on the folds and
then<00:02:18.599> turning<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:19.410> inside<00:02:19.590> out<00:02:19.769> it's<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
then turning it inside out it's the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.190 
then turning it inside out it's the
hardest<00:02:20.519> part<00:02:20.610> now<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.720> making<00:02:21.989> a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
hardest part now it's just making a

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.199 
hardest part now it's just making a
paper<00:02:22.379> airplane<00:02:22.530> you're<00:02:22.980> gonna<00:02:23.069> make<00:02:23.849> two

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
paper airplane you're gonna make two

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.410 
paper airplane you're gonna make two
paper<00:02:24.629> airplane<00:02:25.140> folds<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.769> each<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:27.120> four

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
paper airplane folds on each of the four

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:37.339 
paper airplane folds on each of the four
wings<00:02:27.690> one<00:02:29.720> two<00:02:34.549> turn<00:02:35.549> around<00:02:35.940> paper<00:02:36.900> airplane

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
wings one two turn around paper airplane
