 Thank you for signing up and 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.190
 continue to try for you and do 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.610
 good video quality but as far as 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.610
 in our power 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.590
 then run 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.960
 which growth you asked this question 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.930
 number one is what texture pack texture like 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.940
 he is called Raid Stoner 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.730
 popular enough I think you are without 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.350
 problems will find it through any 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.210
 search engine 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.050
 pick up under his version we 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.100
 conversions 152 and by the way i plan 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.790
 soon 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.510
 go to the new texture pack and version 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.380
 17 I do not know exactly when it will be well 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.730
 opportunities 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.800
 I would like to do it as much as possible 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.590
 faster so from this card to which 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.240
 we now play on which we run 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.510
 which you actually see me with her 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.920
 will have to say goodbye and go for 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:01.840
 new but it's not scary i think you 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.840
 also like the new card more 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:14.330
 the second question is very very popular on 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:17.150
 our not very tasty here and just to 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.550
 kind of when the assistant speaks guys 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.190
 assistant for speaking then when 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.290
 they will consider it necessary for me to go 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.489
 meet these your wishes 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.320
 but nevertheless it is not always possible 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.190
 assistant wanted and plus this chip 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:38.150
 of our show he is silent and this silence 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.260
 these notes are more eloquent than my words 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:46.659
 so for now this is our chip 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.280
 We will not cancel it assistant if 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.579
 will ever want to talk but 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.970
 again do not push when to speak 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.659
 then it will therefore speak well 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.690
 something like this 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:03.610
 Well, and the last question with perspectives 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.569
 and with future plans we have plans 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.709
 still shoot theme achivok 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.480
 there may be some experiments 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.939
 creative series if we have them 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.200
 get on not such places oak by us 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:19.569
 as now here we want to start a new one 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.190
 a project that we call 2 nifiga all 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.870
 details here will be in the new series 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.409
 details have us this topic itself that 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.560
 there will be 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.629
 and of course I would like to take off the field 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.420
 but if you shoot letplaya but for this 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.250
 On soul women's voices with this until trouble 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.560
 That is, we can not find it with a flyer 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.170
 anyone have any thoughts please write 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.269
 In principle, the idea is left to find 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.970
 such a person I think over time 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.859
 find and it will be an interesting project 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.299
 because we want to shoot him well 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.919
 potter live 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.919
 well, so full 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.299
 and in the end I would like to thank 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.549
 all of our fans because we have 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.590
 not so many viewers yet 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.200
 less fans already have thanks guys 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.010

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.659
 positive 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.090
