00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:18.039
 hello and welcome to this video of advice andrÃ© collage then in 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.620
 general to paint 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.999
 it's messy 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.909
 But there is worse 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.739
 in the pasture on the crowd 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.929
 the good news is exactly what awaits us today indeed the 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.380
 player did on the German debt ceiling 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.860
 but what to do when we leave to effectively protect these noble 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.860
 or those elements that we can not move that it's one of the nuts 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.410
 a shower cubicle castrated elements or in the case that we 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.990
 I'm interested in the cauldron behind me 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.620
 and so far in a common mail all done to avoid it 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.530
 splash is 28 years old 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.090
 but it was not always glorious 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.700
 but that was before I discovered the product we were able to use 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.290
 today 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.180
 this product is the basis of protection here as elsewhere 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.159
 the rise is really revolutionary sheeting 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.579
 it was a gift along its length an adhesive tape and be able to attach to 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.220
 Wall 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.830
 so when you have it parried you do not need both and she holds 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920
 single demonstration 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.549
 the use of this base that will no longer worry us 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.680
 for furniture painting projections 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.140
 indeed adhesive sand is applied in the same way as one to daisy's 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.280
 masking used during different painting jobs 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.360
 put this bomb at the flower of the age I did not want to talk about the rolling 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.170
 gently and take care of marouf and the adhesive 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.310
 once in place it will be sufficient to deploy it to provide protection 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.050
 effective 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.840
 you just have to tackle the painting and wait 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 that it will happen to attract your mother's music 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.899
 There you go 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.799
 as I'm told to see that savior use is done 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.579
 quickly 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.860
 and simply 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.999
 know more that this tarpaulin resists audet surgery 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.709
 but especially that it does not deteriorate at different contact on the bench we 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.500
 thought you could use it 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.680
 like what it would really say we are in the room 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.590
 I only have to tell me soon but also to remind you 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.240
 that a job well done is above all a meeting of six to know he says 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.960
 performing 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.749
 but especially 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:04.389
 tailored to your needs
