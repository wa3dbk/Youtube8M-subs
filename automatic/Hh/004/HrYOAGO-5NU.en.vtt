00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.840 
man that bird the new one for you on the
Vince<00:00:43.930> Gironda<00:00:44.230> curl<00:00:44.590> so<00:00:45.100> what<00:00:45.579> do<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:45.699> think

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
Vince Gironda curl so what do you think

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.549 
Vince Gironda curl so what do you think
of<00:00:45.910> it<00:00:46.030> I<00:00:46.239> love<00:00:46.690> it<00:00:46.750> up<00:00:46.930> there<00:00:47.019> you've

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
of it I love it up there you've

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.369 
of it I love it up there you've
definitely<00:00:47.860> felt<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.640> stretch<00:00:49.120> yeah<00:00:49.839> and

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
definitely felt the stretch yeah and

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.920 
definitely felt the stretch yeah and
definitely<00:00:50.589> more<00:00:51.339> contraction<00:00:52.089> yeah<00:00:52.480> so<00:00:52.809> this

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
definitely more contraction yeah so this

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.780 
definitely more contraction yeah so this
is<00:00:52.989> not<00:00:53.260> one<00:00:53.410> I<00:00:53.440> made<00:00:53.649> up<00:00:53.800> this<00:00:54.010> is<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.220> this<00:00:54.610> is<00:00:54.760> a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
is not one I made up this is a this is a

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.430 
is not one I made up this is a this is a
different<00:00:55.510> version<00:00:55.570> of<00:00:56.110> a<00:00:56.229> barbell<00:00:56.649> curl<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
different version of a barbell curl and

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.310 
different version of a barbell curl and
it<00:00:59.589> was<00:00:59.820> created<00:01:00.820> by<00:01:00.970> Vince<00:01:01.540> Gironda<00:01:01.839> who<00:01:02.140> was

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
it was created by Vince Gironda who was

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.469 
it was created by Vince Gironda who was
a<00:01:02.519> bodybuilder<00:01:03.519> in<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:03.850> I<00:01:04.059> think<00:01:04.239> he<00:01:04.300> was<00:01:04.449> a

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
a bodybuilder in the I think he was a

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.109 
a bodybuilder in the I think he was a
bodybuilder<00:01:05.080> in<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.259> 60s<00:01:05.830> and<00:01:06.580> then<00:01:06.790> he<00:01:06.880> went

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
bodybuilder in the 60s and then he went

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.660 
bodybuilder in the 60s and then he went
on<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.360> become<00:01:07.509> a<00:01:07.890> trainer<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.220> bodybuilding

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
on to become a trainer and bodybuilding

celebrities and trained Arnold trained
all<00:01:14.200> these<00:01:14.380> different<00:01:14.710> guys<00:01:14.830> so<00:01:15.330> he<00:01:16.330> was<00:01:16.450> all

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
all these different guys so he was all

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.370 
all these different guys so he was all
about

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
about

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.770 
about
he<00:01:17.710> was<00:01:17.860> bodybuilding<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:19.060> in<00:01:19.360> body

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
he was bodybuilding and in body

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.359 
he was bodybuilding and in body
composition<00:01:20.110> training<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.710> in<00:01:20.890> his<00:01:20.979> purest

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
composition training and in his purest

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.910 
composition training and in his purest
form<00:01:21.610> meaning<00:01:22.000> that<00:01:22.149> he<00:01:23.110> was<00:01:23.259> he<00:01:23.500> was<00:01:23.619> training

form meaning that he was he was training
people<00:01:24.460> specifically<00:01:25.090> for<00:01:25.450> physique

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
people specifically for physique

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.169 
people specifically for physique
development<00:01:26.440> and<00:01:26.619> so<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.100> lot<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.640> he

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
development and so a lot of the he

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.120 
development and so a lot of the he
didn't<00:01:28.360> do<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.479> lot<00:01:28.539> of<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.780> power<00:01:28.960> lifts<00:01:29.380> he

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
didn't do a lot of the power lifts he

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.029 
didn't do a lot of the power lifts he
did<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.340> lot<00:01:30.610> of<00:01:30.789> these<00:01:31.350> sort<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.440> isolated

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
did a lot of these sort of isolated

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.980 
did a lot of these sort of isolated
movements<00:01:33.670> we<00:01:34.330> were<00:01:34.420> talking<00:01:34.690> about<00:01:34.810> this

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
movements we were talking about this

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.770 
movements we were talking about this
off-camera<00:01:35.140> like<00:01:35.590> he<00:01:36.039> was<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.520> big<00:01:36.729> advocate<00:01:37.450> of

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
off-camera like he was a big advocate of

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.630 
off-camera like he was a big advocate of
the<00:01:37.929> sissy<00:01:38.259> squat<00:01:38.530> because<00:01:39.100> he<00:01:39.190> felt<00:01:39.460> it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
the sissy squat because he felt it

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.969 
the sissy squat because he felt it
targeted<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.240> quads<00:01:40.509> even<00:01:41.440> more<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.800> than<00:01:41.950> a

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
targeted the quads even more so than a

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.229 
targeted the quads even more so than a
traditional<00:01:42.220> squat<00:01:42.759> which<00:01:43.030> would

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:43.239 
traditional squat which would

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:44.940 
traditional squat which would
incorporate<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.899> glutes<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.349> hams<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.739> little

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
incorporate the glutes and hams a little

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.889 
incorporate the glutes and hams a little
more<00:01:45.099> lower<00:01:45.310> back<00:01:45.580> so<00:01:45.849> this<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.509> one<00:01:46.660> of<00:01:46.780> those

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
more lower back so this is one of those

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.779 
more lower back so this is one of those
this<00:01:47.110> is<00:01:47.170> one<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.530> those<00:01:47.679> where<00:01:47.950> he<00:01:48.220> used<00:01:48.520> the

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
this is one of those where he used the

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.300 
this is one of those where he used the
barbell<00:01:49.179> curl<00:01:49.890> instead<00:01:50.890> of<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.039> way<00:01:51.130> most

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
barbell curl instead of the way most

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.010 
barbell curl instead of the way most
people<00:01:51.459> do<00:01:51.789> it<00:01:51.940> whether<00:01:52.420> they're<00:01:52.509> using<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:52.929> as

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
people do it whether they're using it as

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.440 
people do it whether they're using it as
a<00:01:53.080> full<00:01:53.379> body<00:01:53.590> exercise<00:01:53.759> he<00:01:54.759> really<00:01:55.119> wanted<00:01:55.360> to

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
a full body exercise he really wanted to

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.380 
a full body exercise he really wanted to
isolate<00:01:55.599> the<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.860> biceps<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.550> you<00:01:58.030> felt<00:01:58.300> a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
isolate the the biceps and you felt a

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.089 
isolate the the biceps and you felt a
difference<00:01:58.750> huh<00:01:58.899> yeah<00:01:59.170> okay<00:01:59.709> so<00:01:59.770> let<00:02:00.069> me

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:00.099 
difference huh yeah okay so let me

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.729 
difference huh yeah okay so let me
explain<00:02:00.459> how<00:02:00.640> you're<00:02:01.030> gonna<00:02:01.119> do<00:02:01.330> this<00:02:01.450> one<00:02:01.739> the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:02.739 
explain how you're gonna do this one the

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.740 
explain how you're gonna do this one the
key<00:02:02.979> is<00:02:03.129> you're<00:02:03.369> using<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.239> principles<00:02:04.660> of

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
key is you're using the principles of

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.919 
key is you're using the principles of
physics<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.379> sort<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:05.950> maximize<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:07.720> tension

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
physics to sort of maximize the tension

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.589 
physics to sort of maximize the tension
in<00:02:08.229> both<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.590> stretch<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:10.060> contracted

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
in both the stretch and the contracted

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.940 
in both the stretch and the contracted
position<00:02:10.629> which<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.319> hard<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.560> do<00:02:11.739> on<00:02:11.920> a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
position which is hard to do on a

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.860 
position which is hard to do on a
freeway<00:02:12.400> movement<00:02:12.910> but<00:02:13.090> that's<00:02:13.540> where<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
freeway movement but that's where the

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.589 
freeway movement but that's where the
torso<00:02:14.260> position<00:02:14.680> comes<00:02:14.920> into<00:02:15.790> play<00:02:15.970> here<00:02:16.180> so

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
torso position comes into play here so

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.940 
torso position comes into play here so
essentially<00:02:17.379> what<00:02:17.500> you're<00:02:17.590> doing<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.890> a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
essentially what you're doing is a

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.740 
essentially what you're doing is a
regular<00:02:18.400> barbell<00:02:18.730> curl<00:02:18.970> but<00:02:19.120> you're<00:02:19.330> you're

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
regular barbell curl but you're you're

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.479 
regular barbell curl but you're you're
leaning<00:02:20.290> away<00:02:20.379> from<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.709> bar<00:02:20.980> in<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.220> stretch

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
leaning away from the bar in the stretch

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.309 
leaning away from the bar in the stretch
position<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.569> is<00:02:22.750> going<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.930> maximize

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
position and that is going to maximize

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.070 
position and that is going to maximize
the<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.160> tension<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.209> stretch<00:02:25.900> position

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the the tension and the stretch position

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.710 
the the tension and the stretch position
of<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.470> bicep<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.099> then<00:02:27.370> as<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.760> curl<00:02:28.060> what

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
of the bicep and then as you curl what

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.360 
of the bicep and then as you curl what
you're<00:02:28.900> doing<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.230> you're<00:02:29.379> leaning<00:02:29.800> into<00:02:30.099> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
you're doing is you're leaning into the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.670 
you're doing is you're leaning into the
curl<00:02:30.760> leaning<00:02:31.239> towards<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.720> bar<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.290> you're

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
curl leaning towards the bar and you're

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.380 
curl leaning towards the bar and you're
bringing<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.010> bar<00:02:33.220> up<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.580> about<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.910> sternum

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
bringing the bar up to about the sternum

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.690 
bringing the bar up to about the sternum
so<00:02:34.750> it's<00:02:34.930> it's<00:02:35.170> it's<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.860> bar<00:02:36.069> staying<00:02:36.459> really

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
so it's it's it's the bar staying really

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.630 
so it's it's it's the bar staying really
close<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.300> on<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.540> one<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.709> so<00:02:39.250> you're

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
close to you on this one and so you're

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.339 
close to you on this one and so you're
leaning<00:02:39.940> away<00:02:40.239> from<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.629> stretch<00:02:41.050> and

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
leaning away from the stretch and

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.650 
leaning away from the stretch and
leaning<00:02:42.160> into<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.550> contraction<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.450> again

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
leaning into the contraction and again

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.020 
leaning into the contraction and again
the<00:02:43.780> way<00:02:43.900> physics<00:02:44.349> works<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.580> contracted

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
the way physics works in the contracted

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.610 
the way physics works in the contracted
position<00:02:46.090> with<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.480> torso<00:02:46.870> leaning<00:02:47.170> forward

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
position with a torso leaning forward

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.199 
position with a torso leaning forward
you're<00:02:48.069> getting<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.400> lot<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.670> tension<00:02:49.090> on<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
you're getting a lot of tension on the

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.250 
you're getting a lot of tension on the
bicep<00:02:49.450> as

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
bicep as

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.589 
bicep as
as<00:02:50.349> gravity<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:51.159> pulling<00:02:51.430> straight<00:02:51.819> down<00:02:51.879> so

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
as gravity is pulling straight down so

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.050 
as gravity is pulling straight down so
again<00:02:52.750> it's<00:02:52.900> leaning<00:02:53.319> away<00:02:53.670> from<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.790> bar<00:02:55.030> and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
again it's leaning away from the bar and

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.339 
again it's leaning away from the bar and
the<00:02:55.269> stretch<00:02:55.540> leaning<00:02:56.049> in<00:02:56.170> in<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
the stretch leaning in in the

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.149 
the stretch leaning in in the
contraction<00:02:57.450> how'd<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.599> feel<00:02:58.659> to<00:02:58.959> you

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
contraction how'd that feel to you

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.399 
contraction how'd that feel to you
compared<00:03:00.159> to<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.340> regular<00:03:00.879> barbell<00:03:01.390> curl<00:03:01.659> while

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
compared to a regular barbell curl while

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:03.960 
compared to a regular barbell curl while
definitely<00:03:02.799> it<00:03:02.860> was<00:03:02.950> more<00:03:03.159> intense<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:03.790> was

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
definitely it was more intense and I was

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.520 
definitely it was more intense and I was
going<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.239> using<00:03:04.510> about<00:03:04.689> thirty<00:03:04.959> pounds

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
going to using about thirty pounds

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.920 
going to using about thirty pounds
typically<00:03:05.829> I<00:03:05.920> got<00:03:06.370> for<00:03:06.909> regular<00:03:07.269> barbell<00:03:07.629> curl

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
typically I got for regular barbell curl

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.979 
typically I got for regular barbell curl
about<00:03:08.230> 60<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.890> 70<00:03:08.920> pounds<00:03:09.760> right<00:03:09.970> right<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.750> was

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
about 60 to 70 pounds right right I was

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.020 
about 60 to 70 pounds right right I was
definitely<00:03:11.200> doing<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.860> job<00:03:12.159> right<00:03:12.489> I<00:03:12.760> mean

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
definitely doing the job right I mean

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.880 
definitely doing the job right I mean
the<00:03:13.180> first<00:03:13.599> time<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:13.900> give<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.379> people<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.739> mean

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
the first time I give this people I mean

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.979 
the first time I give this people I mean
I<00:03:14.980> train<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:16.920> 205<00:03:17.920> pound<00:03:18.280> bodybuilder<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.150> he

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
I train a 205 pound bodybuilder and he

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.160 
I train a 205 pound bodybuilder and he
was<00:03:20.620> doing<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.220> know<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.659> movement<00:03:22.930> he's

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
was doing you know in this movement he's

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.589 
was doing you know in this movement he's
like<00:03:23.290> I've<00:03:23.409> never<00:03:23.620> felt<00:03:23.769> my<00:03:24.730> biceps<00:03:25.209> like<00:03:25.359> this

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
like I've never felt my biceps like this

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.970 
like I've never felt my biceps like this
so<00:03:25.810> you're<00:03:26.200> gonna<00:03:26.290> have<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.620> lighten<00:03:26.829> the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
so you're gonna have to lighten the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.009 
so you're gonna have to lighten the
weight<00:03:27.129> from<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.579> traditional<00:03:28.420> barbell<00:03:28.810> curl

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
weight from a traditional barbell curl

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.289 
weight from a traditional barbell curl
but<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.680> think<00:03:30.370> if<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:30.519> try<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:30.819> one<00:03:31.120> you're

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
but I think if you try this one you're

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.890 
but I think if you try this one you're
really<00:03:31.480> gonna<00:03:31.750> feel<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.230> difference<00:03:32.849> and

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
really gonna feel the difference and

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.210 
really gonna feel the difference and
feel<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.019> burn<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.560> pump<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.010> all<00:03:36.069> that

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
feel the burn and the pump and all that

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.800 
feel the burn and the pump and all that
good<00:03:36.370> stuff<00:03:36.430> that<00:03:36.849> comes<00:03:37.060> along<00:03:37.150> with<00:03:37.599> arm

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
good stuff that comes along with arm

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.729 
good stuff that comes along with arm
training<00:03:38.200> so<00:03:38.730> Vince<00:03:39.730> Gironda<00:03:40.060> curl<00:03:40.680> try<00:03:41.680> it

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
training so Vince Gironda curl try it

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.180 
training so Vince Gironda curl try it
out<00:03:41.920> let<00:03:42.639> us<00:03:42.730> know<00:03:42.849> what<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.060> think
