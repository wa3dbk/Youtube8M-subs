you'll get a little bit of oil dribbling
just<00:01:14.580> clean<00:01:14.789> it<00:01:14.910> up<00:01:15.030> make<00:01:15.570> sure<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.930> there's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
just clean it up make sure that there's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.770 
just clean it up make sure that there's
non<00:01:16.910> stuck<00:01:17.910> inside<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> piston<00:01:20.520> crown<00:01:20.910> just

here for when you reassemble a good idea
is<00:01:28.679> just<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> quick<00:01:29.550> inspection<00:01:29.819> well

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
is just have a quick inspection well

is just have a quick inspection well
this<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.720> off<00:01:30.899> and<00:01:32.750> make<00:01:33.750> sure<00:01:34.429> that

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
this is off and make sure that

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.620 
this is off and make sure that
everything<00:01:36.000> seems<00:01:36.300> fine

door what you can do with this something
you<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.509> more<00:01:42.660> careful<00:01:43.080> of<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.259> an

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you have to be more careful of with an

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the bore then with a cam engine you can

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.449 
the bore then with a cam engine you can
do<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.380> be<00:02:10.500> careful<00:02:10.979> that

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
do that they have to be careful that

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.449 
do that they have to be careful that
your<00:02:11.580> timing<00:02:11.880> marks<00:02:12.450> are<00:02:12.980> replaced<00:02:13.980> back<00:02:14.220> to

their original positions for the simple
reason<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.910> have<00:02:18.060> timing<00:02:18.480> marks<00:02:18.750> on

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
reason that you have timing marks on

your camshafts turn marks on your
crankshaft<00:02:20.670> what<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.780> actually<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.319> is

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
crankshaft what you can actually do is

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.209 
crankshaft what you can actually do is
get<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> timing<00:02:23.489> marks<00:02:23.849> 180<00:02:24.420> degrees<00:02:24.930> out<00:02:25.219> so

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
get the timing marks 180 degrees out so

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.800 
get the timing marks 180 degrees out so
while<00:02:26.969> it<00:02:27.540> may

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
while it may

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.120

actually<00:02:28.080> all<00:02:28.170> line<00:02:28.410> up<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.709> look<00:02:28.920> as<00:02:29.040> if

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
actually all line up and look as if

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.229 
actually all line up and look as if
they're<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.459> right<00:02:29.580> place<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.209> find

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
they're in the right place you can find

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.630 
they're in the right place you can find
them<00:02:30.630> reassembly<00:02:31.319> that<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.069> timing<00:02:32.340> is

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640

them reassembly that the timing is
actually<00:02:32.940> 180<00:02:33.450> degrees<00:02:33.870> out<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.380> you'll<00:02:35.130> find

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
actually 180 degrees out and you'll find

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
they should be exhausting and so on and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.160 
they should be exhausting and so on and
so<00:02:38.310> forth<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.910> we've<00:02:39.390> got<00:02:39.510> potential<00:02:39.810> valve

another quick note with regards to
valves<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:54.000> little<00:03:54.299> one<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:55.730> is<00:03:56.730> always<00:03:57.420> the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
valves the little one is is always the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.229 
valves the little one is is always the
exhaust<00:03:57.989> valve<00:03:58.400> because<00:03:59.400> it's<00:03:59.579> easier<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.150> get

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
exhaust valve because it's easier to get

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.360 
exhaust valve because it's easier to get
exhaust<00:04:00.690> gasses<00:04:01.410> out<00:04:02.060> then<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.329> to<00:04:03.540> get<00:04:03.690> the

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
exhaust gasses out then it is to get the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.099 
exhaust gasses out then it is to get the
inlet<00:04:05.370> gases<00:04:05.700> in<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.090> big<00:04:06.269> one<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.660> always<00:04:06.959> the

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
inlet gases in the big one is always the

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.670 
inlet gases in the big one is always the
inlet<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.650> on<00:04:08.519> some<00:04:08.790> engines<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:10.290> will<00:04:10.440> have

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
inlet and on some engines you will have

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.430 
inlet and on some engines you will have
more<00:04:11.069> than<00:04:11.250> one<00:04:11.459> of<00:04:11.609> each<00:04:12.109> you<00:04:13.109> might<00:04:13.290> have<00:04:13.410> a

more than one of each you might have a

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.830 
more than one of each you might have a

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
the the cylinder head is open there so

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.980 
where the gaskets been blowing of it is
just<00:05:33.410> marked<00:05:33.740> it<00:05:33.860> it's<00:05:34.640> erm<00:05:35.000> just<00:05:35.330> cleaning

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
just marked it it's erm just cleaning

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.950 
just marked it it's erm just cleaning
off<00:05:36.050> as<00:05:36.230> you<00:05:36.350> can<00:05:36.380> see<00:05:36.710> there<00:05:36.980> so<00:05:37.060> obviously<00:05:38.060> if

off as you can see there so obviously if

off as you can see there so obviously if
you<00:05:39.200> have<00:05:39.320> a<00:05:39.350> head<00:05:39.560> gasket<00:05:39.710> leak<00:05:40.040> or<00:05:40.250> very<00:05:40.700> very

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
you have a head gasket leak or very very

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.850 
you have a head gasket leak or very very

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
evident because your gasket will be

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.100 
evident because your gasket will be
physically<00:05:43.610> damaged<00:05:44.090> and<00:05:44.540> it<00:05:44.840> will<00:05:44.960> have

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.060 
particular areas on the gasket it will
be<00:05:50.150> very<00:05:50.450> very<00:05:50.630> obvious<00:05:50.840> you<00:05:52.780> know<00:05:53.950> when<00:05:54.950> you

be very very obvious you know when you

well and just get your hands and work
and<00:06:29.570> try<00:06:29.720> and<00:06:29.810> zoom<00:06:29.930> in<00:06:30.140> so<00:06:30.320> you<00:06:30.380> can<00:06:30.530> see<00:06:30.680> that

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
and try and zoom in so you can see that

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.490 
and try and zoom in so you can see that
finally<00:06:31.550> got<00:06:32.000> a<00:06:32.060> little<00:06:32.300> Inlet<00:06:32.930> circuit<00:06:33.320> out

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
finally got a little Inlet circuit out

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.950 
finally got a little Inlet circuit out
there<00:06:33.770> fur<00:06:34.190> that's<00:06:34.610> where<00:06:34.790> your<00:06:34.910> valves<00:06:35.330> sit

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
there fur that's where your valves sit

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.430 
there fur that's where your valves sit
when<00:06:36.590> the<00:06:36.710> heads<00:06:36.920> on<00:06:37.130> and<00:06:37.960> so<00:06:38.960> yeah<00:06:39.140> as<00:06:39.290> you<00:06:39.380> can

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
when the heads on and so yeah as you can

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.920 
when the heads on and so yeah as you can
see<00:06:39.710> not<00:06:39.920> not<00:06:40.220> very<00:06:40.250> big<00:06:40.610> at<00:06:40.730> all<00:06:40.880> but<00:06:41.600> us

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
see not not very big at all but us

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.340 
see not not very big at all but us
that's<00:06:42.500> 125<00:06:43.190> CC<00:06:43.400> the<00:06:43.970> reason<00:06:44.360> water<00:06:44.990> cooled

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
that's 125 CC the reason water cooled

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.450 
that's 125 CC the reason water cooled
ones<00:06:45.680> look<00:06:46.670> physically<00:06:47.240> smaller<00:06:47.540> is<00:06:47.840> because

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
ones look physically smaller is because

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.279 
ones look physically smaller is because
no<00:06:48.639> need<00:06:48.850> for<00:06:49.060> all<00:06:49.150> these<00:06:49.300> cooling<00:06:49.630> fins<00:06:49.990> and

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:50.289 
no need for all these cooling fins and

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:52.439 
no need for all these cooling fins and
it's<00:06:51.069> these<00:06:51.340> that<00:06:51.520> carry<00:06:51.759> the<00:06:51.880> heat<00:06:51.970> oil<00:06:52.030> an

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:52.449 
it's these that carry the heat oil an

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:53.939 
it's these that carry the heat oil an
air-cooled<00:06:52.720> engine<00:06:53.199> and<00:06:53.500> that's<00:06:53.560> why<00:06:53.770> they

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:53.949 
air-cooled engine and that's why they

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:55.529 
air-cooled engine and that's why they
always<00:06:54.160> look<00:06:54.340> bigger<00:06:54.669> than<00:06:54.880> that<00:06:55.210> than<00:06:55.419> they

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:55.539 
always look bigger than that than they

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:58.439 
always look bigger than that than they
actually<00:06:55.630> are<00:06:56.069> this<00:06:57.069> why<00:06:57.280> you<00:06:57.759> buy<00:06:58.150> to<00:06:58.210> fight

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:58.449 
actually are this why you buy to fight

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.120 
actually are this why you buy to fight
me<00:06:58.599> of<00:06:58.720> your<00:06:58.930> big<00:06:59.050> haul<00:06:59.289> is<00:06:59.470> what<00:06:59.710> happy<00:06:59.979> the

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
me of your big haul is what happy the

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.189 
me of your big haul is what happy the
engines<00:07:00.430> looking<00:07:00.729> on<00:07:00.880> us<00:07:01.090> on<00:07:01.270> them<00:07:01.449> so<00:07:02.139> you

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 
engines looking on us on them so you

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.659 
engines looking on us on them so you
could<00:07:02.530> remove<00:07:02.650> a<00:07:02.889> cylinder<00:07:03.220> head<00:07:03.310> for<00:07:03.520> many

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:03.669 
could remove a cylinder head for many

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:04.850 
could remove a cylinder head for many
reasons

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
reasons

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.890 
reasons
just<00:07:05.860> as<00:07:06.009> a<00:07:06.039> for<00:07:06.280> example<00:07:06.400> if<00:07:07.210> you<00:07:07.630> want<00:07:07.810> to

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
just as a for example if you want to

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.140 
just as a for example if you want to
decode<00:07:08.650> the<00:07:08.919> head<00:07:09.099> if<00:07:09.340> it's<00:07:09.490> if<00:07:09.669> it's<00:07:09.759> fairly

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
decode the head if it's if it's fairly

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.820 
decode the head if it's if it's fairly
high<00:07:10.270> mileage<00:07:10.599> and<00:07:11.169> there's<00:07:11.319> a<00:07:11.349> lot<00:07:11.500> of<00:07:11.530> carbon

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:11.830 
high mileage and there's a lot of carbon

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.400 
high mileage and there's a lot of carbon
buildup<00:07:12.460> for<00:07:12.759> example<00:07:13.270> you<00:07:13.660> want<00:07:13.780> to<00:07:13.930> fit<00:07:14.169> a

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.410 
buildup for example you want to fit a

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.490 
buildup for example you want to fit a
large<00:07:14.949> bore<00:07:15.280> and<00:07:15.520> piston<00:07:16.139> to<00:07:17.139> make<00:07:17.319> it<00:07:17.440> a

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
large bore and piston to make it a

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.100 
large bore and piston to make it a
bigger<00:07:17.729> bigger<00:07:18.729> capacity<00:07:18.940> machine<00:07:19.599> then<00:07:20.080> the

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
bigger bigger capacity machine then the

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.100 
bigger bigger capacity machine then the
next<00:07:20.650> step<00:07:20.830> would<00:07:20.949> be<00:07:21.009> to<00:07:21.130> remove<00:07:21.280> this<00:07:22.110> this

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110 
next step would be to remove this this

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.520 
next step would be to remove this this

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530 
is already unbolted you may as in this

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.080 
is already unbolted you may as in this
one<00:07:26.710> have<00:07:26.889> to<00:07:26.919> undo<00:07:27.220> a<00:07:27.250> couple<00:07:27.310> of<00:07:27.699> bolts<00:07:27.880> just

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090 
one have to undo a couple of bolts just

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.810 
one have to undo a couple of bolts just
there<00:07:28.570> to<00:07:29.229> pop<00:07:29.470> this<00:07:29.680> off<00:07:29.919> and<00:07:30.190> there's<00:07:30.610> a<00:07:30.639> base

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:30.820 
there to pop this off and there's a base

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.339 
there to pop this off and there's a base
gasket<00:07:31.060> underneath<00:07:31.630> there<00:07:31.870> that's<00:07:31.900> what<00:07:32.259> you

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:32.349 
gasket underneath there that's what you

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:34.560 
gasket underneath there that's what you
need<00:07:32.530> to<00:07:32.650> do<00:07:32.770> to<00:07:32.919> replace<00:07:33.160> the<00:07:33.430> piston<00:07:33.639> in<00:07:34.449> this

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:34.570 
need to do to replace the piston in this

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.939 
need to do to replace the piston in this
case<00:07:34.750> I<00:07:34.870> won't<00:07:35.050> be<00:07:35.110> doing<00:07:35.289> that<00:07:35.320> I've<00:07:35.620> no<00:07:35.770> need

case I won't be doing that I've no need

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:38.730 
case I won't be doing that I've no need
to<00:07:36.130> remove<00:07:36.400> that<00:07:36.669> and<00:07:37.199> you'd<00:07:38.199> pop<00:07:38.380> that<00:07:38.590> off

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:38.740 
to remove that and you'd pop that off

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.920 
to remove that and you'd pop that off
you<00:07:39.099> take<00:07:39.340> out<00:07:39.550> the<00:07:39.639> good<00:07:39.820> jump<00:07:40.000> in<00:07:40.240> you'd<00:07:40.659> fit

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.930 
you take out the good jump in you'd fit

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.080 
you take out the good jump in you'd fit
the<00:07:41.020> new<00:07:41.169> piston<00:07:41.710> with<00:07:41.860> you<00:07:42.039> with<00:07:42.340> a<00:07:42.370> with<00:07:42.940> new

barrel new head gasket and in most cases

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.960 
barrel new head gasket and in most cases
you'd<00:07:50.259> reuse<00:07:50.650> the<00:07:50.830> old<00:07:50.860> cylinder<00:07:51.580> head<00:07:51.789> if

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:51.970 
you'd reuse the old cylinder head if

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.430 
you'd reuse the old cylinder head if
nots<00:07:52.240> obviously<00:07:52.659> you<00:07:52.750> get<00:07:52.900> all<00:07:53.020> the<00:07:53.110> new<00:07:53.259> stuff

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 
nots obviously you get all the new stuff

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.100 
nots obviously you get all the new stuff
in<00:07:53.590> the<00:07:53.680> kit<00:07:53.919> and<00:07:54.130> you'd<00:07:54.520> reassemble<00:07:55.090> the<00:07:55.930> main
