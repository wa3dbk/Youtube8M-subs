 inquire examine explore explore 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.130
 inquire investigate 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.060
 which in turn is to clarify or follow 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.369
 a track 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.800
 rather, asking questions is a 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.130
 pretty common exercise that we practice 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.200
 everyone from small but there are questions 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.420
 of questions there are those who are dedicated 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.590
 professionally to that matter of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.590
 try to solve them 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.310
 as william chemical rubbish 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.410
 mathematician and teacher and researcher a 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.600
 Bogota, despite his young age 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.700
 has a doctorate in science from a 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.720
 German university and also two 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.760
 doctorates 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.400
 despite this he is still a man 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.550
 simple that does not forget its origin was born 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.550
 in Bogota in 1976 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.130
 in a family within a family 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.909
 very humble my grandmother washed clothes my 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.490
 Grandpa worked in construction after 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.979
 worked on the magnet my uncles my aunts my 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.970
 mom had to go out and sell food and 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.940
 things like that my boy dream was 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.770
 not being superhero I wanted to be the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.420
 spiderman and superman and that's why I 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.310
 I opened my head several times because 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.899
 fell from the trees 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.899
 I am thinking that I could speak 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.890
 Miguelito says that pure orthopedics 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.890
 that is not natural in us 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.130
 I wanted to be a doctor like all 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.140
 students of colombia of baccalaureate 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.110
 I wanted to be an engineer 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.090
 and I applied to various universities 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.070
 for medicine and it does not happen because I grew up 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.229
 very bad as I was doing well in chemistry I'm going 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.630
 to study chemistry I introduced myself to chemistry 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.159
 only once and in the uis and as in 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.860
 Colombian god presents himself to study 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.570
 basic sciences because to be and is that 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.729
 so that Guillermo would realize 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.830
 what was his future had to leave until 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.679
 the habana cuba where he met a 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.200
 Colombian there I met a teacher 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.510
 Colombian and I think that at that moment 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.360
 my life changed my life with my life 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.810
 personal and my work and scientific life 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.670
 academic in every way changed 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.500
 and I think it's very interesting 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.480
 because I had to leave Colombia to 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.060
 know a Colombian and that shows that 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.920
 in Colombia we do not talk so much 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.730
 I enjoy a lot dictating my classes 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.080
 because in the classes and in fact I take the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.330
 classes as a tool for 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.569
 discover new questions for 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.730
 discover what others have not done or 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.620
 what could be done better is to say in 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.200
 the same class one by one they come up 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.300
 research questions and then 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.410
 can go back with the students of 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.330
 annie very interesting one can 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.940
 integrate students in the 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.620
 resolution of those questions and boots 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.170
 the investigation and then one leads 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.510
 forward the knowledge and who says 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.959
 that from chemistry there are no contributions to the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.959
 society 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.510
 not only chemistry is in the 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.520
 laboratory but that chemistry is a 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.570
 way of seeing the world and that same way 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.190
 to see the world can not apply 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.260
 even in the market place when a 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.060
 buy things or when the newsletter I 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.550
 always when one sees the reality of 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.230
 turn one can be very critical and that 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.510
 criticism is left one the thought 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.550
 scientific if Colombia had 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.010
 scientific thinking we would not kill ourselves 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.350
 so much good teacher at the end of the day that 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.570
 it is mathematical chemistry that brings you 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.390
 to whom this is a complex issue 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.240
 mathematical chemistry is to try to see the 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.970
 chemistry from the point of view the 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.830
 mathematics is to think chemistry with with 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.690
 mathematical structure try 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.260
 find the basics of chemistry 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.120
 with a mathematical support is not to use the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.940
 mathematics just because that does it 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.590
 many people use a for example a 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.990
 statistical software that he developed 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.760
 some statistic or use some 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.830
 mathematical methodology apply to the 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.900
 chemistry that's not mathematical chemistry 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.330
 many say that that's me I think it's 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.670
 something else is to use mathematics but 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.230
 think chemistry mathematically 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.730
 analytically 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.590
 so trying to find 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.660
 relationships between things that's what 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.430
 I believe that mathematical chemistry is 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.470
 science has not been an easy subject for 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.630
 many but for William apply his 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.320
 critical thinking is your living that 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.050
 good that my family life is like that so 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.810
 unless I'm newly married not here what 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.460
 you can see 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.260
 and I got married on June 18 and my wife 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.820
 has two children and already had a first 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.940
 married and he has two children and I 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.880
 I have a lot of fun with them because they do not have 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.710
 ten years and the other has six 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.080
 because in children he does not find 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.080
 questions as long as for adults 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.750
 are usually annoying but there's the 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.730
 as fresh questions about the 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.070
 which one can work one 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.410
 can create scientific thinking in 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.470
 children and that seems to me 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.910
 fantastic with my wife too 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.070
 we discuss many things we read books 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.710
 together and we discuss them we do not advance very 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.810
 fast because we get to discuss 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:19.490
 three lines but well that 's the idea 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.990
 and teacher the student exceeds the teacher 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.480
 results that we show in 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.520
 Canada are now part of the new 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.230
 edition of the book that I studied when 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.600
 I was in college that seems to me 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.850
 something very beautiful and I think it's good 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.040
 tell it because those books that one 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.020
 think they are made in europe in usa and 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.460
 they have things from Colombia and it's not just my 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.590
 case there are many people in Colombia who 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.650
 does science and that is in the books 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.870
 but that people do not know about that and 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.900
 that's why these things these interviews 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.370
 these means of disseminating what he does 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.370
 the people nolan and I find it very good
