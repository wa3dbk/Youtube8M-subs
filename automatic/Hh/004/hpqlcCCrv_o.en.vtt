obviously our output jack or jack socket
and<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.259> input<00:01:11.590> jack<00:01:11.800> sockets<00:01:12.250> nice<00:01:12.550> and

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
and the input jack sockets nice and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.169 
and the input jack sockets nice and
conveniently<00:01:13.090> located<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.550> top<00:01:15.819> here

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
conveniently located on the top here

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.949 
conveniently located on the top here
there's<00:01:16.509> an<00:01:16.660> 9<00:01:17.050> volt<00:01:18.009> DC<00:01:18.190> inputs<00:01:18.910> which<00:01:19.840> is

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
there's an 9 volt DC inputs which is

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.290 
there's an 9 volt DC inputs which is
sent<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.229> negative<00:01:20.619> as<00:01:20.770> usual<00:01:21.099> we've<00:01:22.060> got

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
sent to negative as usual we've got

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.520 
sent to negative as usual we've got
Drive<00:01:23.190> tone<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:25.240> level<00:01:25.599> so<00:01:26.319> obviously

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
Drive tone and a level so obviously

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.800 
Drive tone and a level so obviously
drive<00:01:26.800> is<00:01:27.009> like<00:01:27.099> our<00:01:27.310> gain<00:01:27.520> control<00:01:27.970> control

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
drive is like our gain control control

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.540 
drive is like our gain control control
see<00:01:28.929> math<00:01:29.080> distortion<00:01:29.770> or<00:01:29.920> overdrive<00:01:29.950> I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
see math distortion or overdrive I

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.830 
see math distortion or overdrive I
should<00:01:30.700> say<00:01:30.849> really<00:01:31.030> in<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.509> case<00:01:31.660> of<00:01:31.780> this

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
should say really in the case of this

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.809 
should say really in the case of this
pedal<00:01:32.140> tone<00:01:32.920> that's<00:01:33.250> exactly<00:01:33.610> what<00:01:33.729> you'd

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
pedal tone that's exactly what you'd

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.410 
pedal tone that's exactly what you'd
expect<00:01:34.560> from<00:01:35.560> all<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.429> way<00:01:36.520> down<00:01:36.759> being<00:01:37.149> the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
expect from all the way down being the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.320 
expect from all the way down being the
warmest<00:01:38.349> or<00:01:38.759> basest<00:01:39.759> setting<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.209> all<00:01:40.270> the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
warmest or basest setting and all the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.400 
warmest or basest setting and all the
way<00:01:40.420> up<00:01:40.509> being<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.780> most<00:01:40.929> trouble<00:01:41.289> or

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
way up being the most trouble or

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.440 
way up being the most trouble or
brightest<00:01:41.860> setting<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:43.060> then<00:01:43.179> the<00:01:43.239> level

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
brightest setting and then the level

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
brightest setting and then the level
again<00:01:43.630> is<00:01:43.869> exactly<00:01:44.200> what<00:01:44.319> you'd<00:01:44.410> expect

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
again is exactly what you'd expect

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.559 
again is exactly what you'd expect
increases<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.459> level<00:01:45.729> of<00:01:45.789> signal<00:01:46.149> coming<00:01:46.390> out

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
increases the level of signal coming out

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.080 
increases the level of signal coming out
of<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.840> pedal<00:01:47.110> into<00:01:47.259> your<00:01:47.440> amplifier<00:01:48.090> we've

with the toad works delay pedals I'll
keep<00:03:08.150> on<00:03:08.300> for<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.600> first<00:03:08.720> few<00:03:08.870> examples<00:03:09.260> and

keep on for the first few examples and

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.480 
keep on for the first few examples and
switch<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.740> off<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.070> can<00:03:10.160> hear<00:03:10.340> exactly

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490

she's got a lovely lovely expressive so
in<00:03:55.349> this<00:03:55.530> battle<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:55.950> really<00:03:56.370> responds<00:03:56.819> to

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
in this battle it really responds to

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.259 
in this battle it really responds to
your<00:03:57.030> pick<00:03:57.239> dynamics<00:03:57.780> for<00:03:58.650> example<00:03:59.040> if<00:03:59.129> I<00:03:59.310> like

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
your pick dynamics for example if I like

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:10.839 
your pick dynamics for example if I like
fairly<00:04:00.569> lightly

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:31.540 

if<00:04:11.299> I<00:04:11.480> take<00:04:11.689> in<00:04:11.810> a<00:04:11.840> bit<00:04:12.019> more

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.010 

really<00:04:32.550> really<00:04:32.640> nice<00:04:32.850> increase<00:04:33.270> in<00:04:33.450> game

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
really really nice increase in game

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.770 
really really nice increase in game
there<00:04:34.320> from<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.620> drive<00:04:34.860> control<00:04:35.460> okay<00:04:36.390> so

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
there from the drive control okay so

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.390 
there from the drive control okay so
let's<00:04:37.170> increase<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.650> drive<00:04:37.980> a<00:04:38.010> little<00:04:38.190> bit

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
let's increase the drive a little bit

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.650 
let's increase the drive a little bit
and<00:04:38.520> see<00:04:38.760> what<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.000> sounds<00:04:39.240> like<00:04:39.300> we<00:04:39.450> really

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
and see what it sounds like we really

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.490 
and see what it sounds like we really
cranked<00:04:40.020> it<00:04:40.170> up

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.340 

so<00:04:43.500> now<00:04:43.650> engage<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.520> driver<00:04:44.790> about<00:04:45.350> four

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
so now engage the driver about four

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.770 
so now engage the driver about four
o'clock<00:04:46.490> almost<00:04:47.490> all<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.760> way<00:04:47.880> up<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.690> this

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
o'clock almost all the way up and this

00:04:48.780 --> 00:05:32.830 
o'clock almost all the way up and this
is<00:04:48.900> what<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.110> sounds<00:04:49.380> like

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.090 

you

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.070 

okay<00:05:37.100> so<00:05:37.160> I've<00:05:37.639> now<00:05:37.819> rolled<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:38.449> drive

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
okay so I've now rolled the drive

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.460 
okay so I've now rolled the drive
control<00:05:39.530> down<00:05:39.830> to<00:05:40.340> about<00:05:41.300> nine<00:05:41.720> o'clock<00:05:41.930> so

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
control down to about nine o'clock so

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.439 
control down to about nine o'clock so
it's<00:05:43.039> almost<00:05:43.400> all<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.639> way<00:05:43.729> down<00:05:44.000> this<00:05:44.240> gives

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
it's almost all the way down this gives
