as<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.930> develop<00:00:31.290> into<00:00:31.440> adults<00:00:31.700> we<00:00:32.700> also

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
as we develop into adults we also

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.200 
as we develop into adults we also
develop<00:00:33.570> lots<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.020> inhibitions<00:00:34.560> and<00:00:35.000> we<00:00:36.000> have

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
develop lots of inhibitions and we have

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.350 
develop lots of inhibitions and we have
to<00:00:36.390> learn<00:00:36.600> how<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.560> be<00:00:37.890> playful<00:00:38.160> again<00:00:38.670> which

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
to learn how to be playful again which

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.900 
to learn how to be playful again which
well<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.350> don't<00:00:40.650> know<00:00:40.770> about<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.400> I<00:00:41.550> found

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
well I don't know about you but I found

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.880 
well I don't know about you but I found
it<00:00:42.090> really<00:00:42.210> really<00:00:42.840> difficult<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.530> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
it really really difficult and I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.530 
it really really difficult and I
certainly<00:00:44.220> found<00:00:44.580> it<00:00:44.670> difficult<00:00:44.790> when<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> was

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
certainly found it difficult when I was

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.870 
certainly found it difficult when I was
learning<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.989> paint<00:00:46.380> I<00:00:46.680> always<00:00:47.430> had<00:00:47.610> somebody

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
learning to paint I always had somebody

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.260 
learning to paint I always had somebody
wanting<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.230> what<00:00:49.530> I'd<00:00:49.680> been<00:00:49.920> doing<00:00:50.270> which

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
wanting to see what I'd been doing which

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.750 
wanting to see what I'd been doing which
made<00:00:51.480> me<00:00:51.660> even<00:00:51.690> more<00:00:51.989> inhibited<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.460> found

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
made me even more inhibited and I found

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.410 
made me even more inhibited and I found
it<00:00:53.910> really<00:00:53.940> difficult<00:00:55.130> so<00:00:56.130> in<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.550> video<00:00:56.850> I'd

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
it really difficult so in this video I'd

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.470 
it really difficult so in this video I'd
like<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> show<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.290> how<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.010> practice<00:01:00.000> how<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
like to show you how to practice how to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.110 
like to show you how to practice how to
be<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.900> little<00:01:01.199> bit<00:01:01.410> playful<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:02.670> we're<00:01:02.970> going

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
be a little bit playful but we're going

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.479 
be a little bit playful but we're going
to<00:01:03.239> try<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:03.870> practice<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> purpose

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to try and practice with a purpose

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.260 
to try and practice with a purpose
without<00:01:06.450> any<00:01:06.690> kind<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.110> pressure<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.270> through

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
without any kind of pressure and through

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.440 
without any kind of pressure and through
that<00:01:09.540> practice<00:01:10.170> we're<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.520> build<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
that practice we're going to build a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.800 
that practice we're going to build a
knowledge<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.470> pestles<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.310> resource<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.690> we

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
knowledge of pestles a resource that we

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.890 
knowledge of pestles a resource that we
can<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:17.340> develop<00:01:17.610> pastel<00:01:18.420> paintings

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
can then use to develop pastel paintings

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.530 
can then use to develop pastel paintings
at<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> later<00:01:19.380> date<00:01:19.850> I'm<00:01:20.850> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.330> demonstrate

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
at a later date I'm going to demonstrate

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.130 
at a later date I'm going to demonstrate
for<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.560> how<00:01:22.790> versatile<00:01:23.790> pastels<00:01:24.420> are<00:01:24.690> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
for you how versatile pastels are and

for you how versatile pastels are and
you'll<00:01:25.860> quickly<00:01:26.220> learn<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:27.060> pastels<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
you'll quickly learn that pastels is a

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.710 
you'll quickly learn that pastels is a
wonderful<00:01:28.740> medium<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.370> work<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.880> let's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
wonderful medium to work with let's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.550 
wonderful medium to work with let's
first<00:01:31.050> of<00:01:31.200> all<00:01:31.320> establish<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:33.360> underneath<00:01:34.110> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
first of all establish the underneath of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.650 
first of all establish the underneath of
the<00:01:34.710> clumps<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.880> foliage<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:38.510> then<00:01:39.510> the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
the clumps of foliage and then the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:50.110 
the clumps of foliage and then the
middle<00:01:39.930> tone<00:01:44.090> here

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.790 

we've<00:01:51.120> got<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.450> start<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.960> look<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.230> lot<00:01:52.560> more

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
we've got to start to look a lot more

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
we've got to start to look a lot more
carefully<00:01:53.370> now<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.810> sunlight<00:01:55.820> that's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
carefully now if it's sunlight that's

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.610 
carefully now if it's sunlight that's
bouncing<00:01:57.420> onto<00:01:57.720> our<00:01:57.870> subject

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.660 

the<00:02:01.620> lightest<00:02:02.520> areas<00:02:03.560> will<00:02:04.560> obviously<00:02:05.280> be

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the lightest areas will obviously be

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.960 
the lightest areas will obviously be
warmer<00:02:06.240> sunlight<00:02:06.840> sunlight<00:02:07.320> itself<00:02:08.100> is<00:02:08.399> warm

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
warmer sunlight sunlight itself is warm

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.420 
warmer sunlight sunlight itself is warm
it's<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.020> logical<00:02:10.530> thing<00:02:10.770> isn't<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.460> greens

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
it's a logical thing isn't it and greens

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.160 
it's a logical thing isn't it and greens
warm<00:02:14.430> greens<00:02:14.850> if<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.300> think<00:02:15.660> back<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
warm greens if you think back to the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.050 
warm greens if you think back to the
lesson<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:16.530> looked<00:02:16.709> at<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> few<00:02:17.070> minutes<00:02:17.550> ago

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
lesson we looked at a few minutes ago

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.630 
lesson we looked at a few minutes ago
warm<00:02:18.690> greens<00:02:19.080> are<00:02:19.470> yellower<00:02:21.830> we<00:02:22.830> move<00:02:23.100> towards

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
warm greens are yellower we move towards

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.900 
warm greens are yellower we move towards
a<00:02:23.730> yellow<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.470> get<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.920> impression<00:02:26.280> of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
a yellow so to get the impression of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.570 
a yellow so to get the impression of
warm<00:02:27.330> light<00:02:27.390> on<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.020> tree<00:02:28.290> I'm<00:02:28.770> now<00:02:29.100> going<00:02:29.400> to

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
warm light on the tree I'm now going to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.750 
warm light on the tree I'm now going to
start<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.090> build<00:02:30.300> in<00:02:30.660> some<00:02:30.989> touches<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.130> much

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
start to build in some touches of much

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.880 
start to build in some touches of much
more<00:02:33.060> yellow<00:02:33.630> green<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:40.260> really<00:02:40.590> start

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
more yellow green and we really start

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.300 
more yellow green and we really start
now<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.250> get<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.790> impression<00:02:42.830> because<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
now to get the impression because of the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.500 
now to get the impression because of the
blue<00:02:44.550> against<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:46.310> brightly<00:02:47.310> lit<00:02:47.610> foliage<00:02:48.360> at

blue against the brightly lit foliage at
the<00:02:48.630> top<00:02:48.900> here<00:02:49.260> we<00:02:49.950> really<00:02:50.100> do<00:02:50.370> start<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.790> get

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
the top here we really do start to get

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.790 
the top here we really do start to get
the<00:02:51.120> impression<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.660> sunlight<00:02:52.140> on<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.410> scene

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
