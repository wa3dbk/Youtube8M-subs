00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.539 
minutes and put another light coat on we
also<00:02:46.140> get<00:02:46.410> about<00:02:46.560> three<00:02:46.830> light<00:02:47.010> coats<00:02:47.280> on

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
also get about three light coats on

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.310 
also get about three light coats on
that's<00:02:47.910> good<00:02:48.120> enough<00:02:48.150> for<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.600> background<00:02:48.840> to

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
that's good enough for the background to

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.229 
that's good enough for the background to
make<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.620> other<00:02:49.709> letters<00:02:50.040> stand<00:02:50.310> out<00:02:50.640> it's

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
make the other letters stand out it's

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.479 
make the other letters stand out it's
called<00:02:51.390> highlighting<00:02:51.930> them<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.769> they'll<00:02:53.370> be

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
called highlighting them and they'll be

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.220 
called highlighting them and they'll be
all<00:02:53.640> set<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.120> see<00:02:54.299> we<00:02:54.480> don't<00:02:54.630> have<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:54.959> tape

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
all set and see we don't have this tape

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.380 
all set and see we don't have this tape
down<00:02:55.440> tight<00:02:55.799> because<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.280> nonstick<00:02:56.820> background

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
down tight because a nonstick background

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.050 
down tight because a nonstick background
but<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.500> gives<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.950> foggy<00:02:59.280> effect<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.940> an

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
but that gives it the foggy effect of an

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.420 
but that gives it the foggy effect of an
actual<00:03:00.450> real<00:03:00.690> shadow<00:03:01.049> which<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.829> perfect<00:03:02.280> so

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
actual real shadow which is perfect so

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.520 
actual real shadow which is perfect so
when<00:03:02.549> we<00:03:02.700> do<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.000> next<00:03:03.209> coat<00:03:03.540> with<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.780> well

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
when we do the next coat with the well

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.290 
when we do the next coat with the well
enough<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.040> Xcode<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.519> final<00:03:05.940> thing<00:03:06.090> with

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
enough and Xcode the final thing with

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.080 
enough and Xcode the final thing with
the<00:03:06.420> bright<00:03:06.630> chrome<00:03:07.550> will<00:03:08.550> have<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.849> stuck

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
the bright chrome will have it stuck

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.270 
the bright chrome will have it stuck
down<00:03:09.330> so<00:03:09.599> it<00:03:09.690> fits<00:03:09.930> tight<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.830> then<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.099> get<00:03:11.250> a

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
down so it fits tight and then we get a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.870 
down so it fits tight and then we get a
sharp

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
sharp

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.490
