hello<00:00:01.500> everyone<00:00:02.629> first<00:00:03.629> today<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.200> think<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.640> am

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
hello everyone first today I think I am

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.900 
hello everyone first today I think I am
going<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.359> finish<00:00:07.290> putting<00:00:07.849> on<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.840> throttle

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
going to finish putting on the throttle

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.529 
going to finish putting on the throttle
setup<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:13.009> still<00:00:14.009> keep<00:00:14.219> thinking<00:00:14.759> about<00:00:15.920> the

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
setup I still keep thinking about the

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.230 
setup I still keep thinking about the
drivetrain<00:00:18.539> setup<00:00:19.020> at<00:00:19.350> its<00:00:19.529> current<00:00:19.740> state<00:00:20.240> so

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
drivetrain setup at its current state so

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.759 
drivetrain setup at its current state so
I<00:00:21.600> don't<00:00:21.869> know<00:00:22.020> if<00:00:22.109> I'm<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> play<00:00:22.619> with

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
I don't know if I'm going to play with

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.290 
I don't know if I'm going to play with
it<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.010> week<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.340> I'm<00:00:23.460> still<00:00:23.699> thinking<00:00:23.939> on

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
it this week and I'm still thinking on

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.589 
it this week and I'm still thinking on
my<00:00:24.740> plan<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.859> attack<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.460> know<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.390> I'm<00:00:27.480> going

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
my plan of attack I know what I'm going

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.759 
my plan of attack I know what I'm going
to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.960> get<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> clutch<00:00:28.410> finished<00:00:28.970> but<00:00:30.769> as

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
to do to get the clutch finished but as

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.090 
to do to get the clutch finished but as
far<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.099> ratios<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.940> sprockets<00:00:33.450> go<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.930> think<00:00:34.890> I

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
far as ratios and sprockets go I think I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.690 
far as ratios and sprockets go I think I
have<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:36.050> decisions<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.320> make<00:00:37.469> as<00:00:38.370> far<00:00:38.610> as

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
have some decisions to make as far as

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.060 
have some decisions to make as far as
that<00:00:38.850> goes<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.989> well<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.440> brakes<00:00:40.710> too

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
that goes and as well for the brakes too

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.700 
that goes and as well for the brakes too
so<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> think<00:00:42.570> I'm<00:00:42.840> going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> hold<00:00:43.230> off<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.379> that

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
so I think I'm going to hold off on that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.090 
so I think I'm going to hold off on that

who<00:01:01.500> would<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.739> guessed<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.039> um<00:01:02.390> making<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
who would have guessed that um making a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.850 
who would have guessed that um making a
throttle<00:01:03.989> linkage<00:01:04.260> could<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.530> been<00:01:04.650> so

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
throttle linkage could have been so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.240 
throttle linkage could have been so
complicated<00:01:08.630> as<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:10.200> was<00:01:10.380> voting<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:10.979> boat

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
complicated as I was voting on this boat

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
complicated as I was voting on this boat
up<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.909> shroud<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.830> I<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.119> did

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
up to the shroud here I just kind of did

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.850 
up to the shroud here I just kind of did
one<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> those<00:01:15.600> blind<00:01:15.990> bulb<00:01:16.229> deals<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
one of those blind bulb deals and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.609 
one of those blind bulb deals and
completely<00:01:17.670> missed<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.240> put<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> big<00:01:19.380> hole<00:01:19.590> in

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
completely missed and put a big hole in

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.730 
completely missed and put a big hole in
the<00:01:20.390> shroud<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.259> had<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.470> take<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the shroud here so I had to take the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.469 
the shroud here so I had to take the
shot<00:01:22.770> off<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.310> make<00:01:23.400> sure<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.610> didn't<00:01:23.880> first<00:01:24.330> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
shot off to make sure I didn't first of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.510 
shot off to make sure I didn't first of
all<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:25.170> anything<00:01:25.500> onto<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.009> file<00:01:26.280> because

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
all not anything onto the file because

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.830 
all not anything onto the file because
that<00:01:26.700> would<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.909> caused<00:01:27.090> problems<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that would have caused problems and

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.690 
that would have caused problems and
second<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.670> a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
yeah throttle hook-up is over here this

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.899 
yeah throttle hook-up is over here this
is<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.469> carburetor<00:02:23.909> this<00:02:24.909> is<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.150> original

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
is the carburetor this is the original

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.610 
is the carburetor this is the original
linkage<00:02:27.909> piece<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:29.079> I<00:02:29.200> drilled<00:02:29.469> a<00:02:29.530> little

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
linkage piece and I drilled a little

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.699 
linkage piece and I drilled a little
hole<00:02:29.769> here<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.689> the<00:02:31.900> return<00:02:32.439> spring

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
hole here and this is the return spring

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.349 
hole here and this is the return spring
that's<00:02:33.040> off<00:02:33.159> the<00:02:33.189> governor<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.849> won't<00:02:34.120> be<00:02:34.180> using

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
that's off the governor I won't be using

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.170 
that's off the governor I won't be using
it<00:02:34.569> anymore<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.709> I'm<00:02:36.250> going<00:02:36.579> to<00:02:36.639> this<00:02:36.879> is<00:02:37.030> going

to<00:02:37.269> be<00:02:37.329> our<00:02:37.450> return<00:02:37.750> spring<00:02:38.079> I'm<00:02:38.200> going<00:02:38.319> to

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
to be our return spring I'm going to

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.619 
to be our return spring I'm going to
hook<00:02:38.469> it<00:02:38.620> up<00:02:38.849> over<00:02:39.849> here<00:02:40.000> somewhere<00:02:40.299> with

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
hook it up over here somewhere with

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
I can use that right angle piece that I

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.409 
I can use that right angle piece that I
used<00:03:02.829> and<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:04.389> cable<00:03:04.870> will<00:03:04.989> run<00:03:05.500> right<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.919> it

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
used and the cable will run right to it

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.599 
used and the cable will run right to it
going<00:03:07.419> around<00:03:07.510> right<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.989> here<00:03:08.349> so<00:03:09.189> when<00:03:09.579> I

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
setup I just have the governor sitting

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:35.550 
setup I just have the governor sitting
off<00:03:34.689> to<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.900> side<00:03:35.229> here

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
off to the side here

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.580 
off to the side here
the<00:03:36.009> governor<00:03:36.370> arm<00:03:36.519> while<00:03:37.419> later<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:37.989> am<00:03:38.319> going

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
the governor arm while later I am going

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.589 
the governor arm while later I am going
to<00:03:38.739> remove<00:03:38.919> the<00:03:39.549> governor<00:03:39.909> arm<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.419> the

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
to remove the governor arm and the

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.929 
to remove the governor arm and the
internal<00:03:41.109> components<00:03:41.680> for<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.609> governor

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
internal components for the governor

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.050 
internal components for the governor
because<00:03:43.180> it's<00:03:43.750> not<00:03:44.079> I'm<00:03:44.889> running<00:03:45.250> my<00:03:45.609> engine

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
because it's not I'm running my engine

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.990 
because it's not I'm running my engine
right<00:03:46.180> now<00:03:46.359> on<00:03:46.569> governed<00:03:46.959> which<00:03:47.169> will

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
right now on governed which will

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.789 
right now on governed which will
ultimately<00:03:49.000> give<00:03:49.239> me<00:03:49.829> more<00:03:50.829> power<00:03:52.799> better

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
ultimately give me more power better

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.959 
ultimately give me more power better
power<00:03:54.129> delivery<00:03:54.639> so<00:03:56.459> I'm<00:03:57.459> going<00:03:57.669> to<00:03:57.759> remove

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:57.969 
power delivery so I'm going to remove

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.030 
power delivery so I'm going to remove
this<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.419> actually<00:03:59.109> remove<00:03:59.259> it<00:03:59.530> internally

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
this and actually remove it internally

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.559 
this and actually remove it internally
at<00:04:00.879> a<00:04:00.909> later<00:04:01.209> date<00:04:01.599> and<00:04:01.840> time<00:04:02.530> so<00:04:04.229> all<00:04:05.229> right

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
looking pretty good here so I got this a

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.420 
looking pretty good here so I got this a
little<00:04:11.409> connector<00:04:11.799> piece<00:04:12.069> that's<00:04:12.340> wills

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
little connector piece that's wills

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.300 
little connector piece that's wills
here's<00:04:15.430> my<00:04:15.549> return<00:04:15.849> spring<00:04:16.299> just<00:04:16.989> a<00:04:17.310> looped

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
here's my return spring just a looped

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.979 
here's my return spring just a looped
around<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.849> have<00:04:18.969> some<00:04:19.209> mechanics<00:04:19.630> wire<00:04:19.780> looped

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
around I have some mechanics wire looped

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.779 
around I have some mechanics wire looped
around<00:04:20.079> to<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:20.979> back<00:04:21.130> of<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.340> carburetor

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
around to the back of the carburetor

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.080 
around to the back of the carburetor
here<00:04:23.099> then<00:04:24.099> you<00:04:24.250> can<00:04:24.370> see<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.699> linkage<00:04:25.060> that

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
here then you can see the linkage that

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.160 
here then you can see the linkage that
actually<00:04:25.539> goes<00:04:25.690> into<00:04:25.870> the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
actually goes into the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.960 
actually goes into the
our<00:04:26.230> breath<00:04:26.440> sorry<00:04:27.100> for<00:04:27.310> light<00:04:27.520> conditions
