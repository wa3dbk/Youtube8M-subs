00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 so my dear but the welcome 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.069
 or new series of slaps 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.930
 commented and so on the title 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.330
 So today with the group f with the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.550
 third last day of the match and the duel 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.840
 between nigeria and argentina the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.120
 first against the second who today 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.740
 wins is the group winner nigeria 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.660
 may have to win if at the same time 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.949
 Iran should score against Bosnia 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.080
 and many gates does it theoretically 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.699
 Iran could also become second 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.350
 Bosnia from the group completely over 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.789
 So the games then only as a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.320
 bit with that only on the edge true so in 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.670
 the group happens we have 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.689
 also a little tension in front of us 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.520
 And today I want to go all the way 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.380
 come in a moment, just like you 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.420
 we could listen to have me in the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.070
 last two three will follow again 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.570
 a few written on how that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.969
 whole works and you can find that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.980
 in the description a link at 17 o'clock 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.570
 45 starts all saying, can 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.640
 you'll click on that very often below but 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.039
 From there it starts talking you get it 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.170
 On it makes a television to the first 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.920
 play today was in the area or in the area 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.590
 transfer 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.480
 does anyone but the sound from going 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.100
 then as I said again on marcel - 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 is the link of the bottom of the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.640
 description is chancellor on play 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.989
 next to it there is such a small - 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.439
 I will do some synchro checks 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.939
 so that your television picture, so to speak with 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.990
 My voice is in sync 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.790
 we baked everything then I will 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.060
 again explain then in the video or 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.530
 if it starts at 17 o'clock 45 of the he 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.340
 It is not difficult that everyone gets 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.720
 baked very clearly 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.340
 and then I would be happy if he 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.330
 since a bit more special 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 reform I can again quickly 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.340
 mention because today someone from ndr hears 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.960
 info to and maybe they want 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.610
 even a little interview after 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.509
 the game or whenever then 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.829
 I find myself through a bit 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.000
 Excited must be quite honest 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.530
 I am happy, but I am very happy 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.570
 the part Nigeria against Argentina 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.159
 Let's see what happens there and then 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.900
 i will probably think im in today 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.610
 video or when commenting one more 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.500
 Get rid of some info like the whole 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.840
 Expires tomorrow should contribute possibly 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.159
 come in early on ndr info so 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.540
 if you are somewhere near and 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.490
 the reception could even pass by 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.990
 I do not know tomorrow if you want to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.729
 Change or group appointment so far 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.790
 Also not further known except that 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.380
 at that time in my mind 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.719
 17.45 not forget down on the link 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.920
 click then could be there is no 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.960
 Just press hard thing on play 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.979
 and the thing works yes and then 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.140
 see what i hope you are again 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.340
 I hope you are numerous with 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.090
 with it and then we can think about it 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.770
 facebook again a bit 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.120
 communicate with regard to various 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.380
 situations where it may be 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.620
 bit stressed was to be in the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.600
 until 5 pm 45 and I'm off 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.600
 until then your slippers servus
