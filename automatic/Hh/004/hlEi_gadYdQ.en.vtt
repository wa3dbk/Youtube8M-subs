00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.910
 people I will come back from 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.370
 work and I thought about it 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.170
 had a few questions from you but 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.600
 First of all, thank you very much 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.920
 say for all the thumbs up and the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.570
 whole comments lately 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.670
 flown in is genuinely awesome 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.099
 and last time noticed 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.400
 I have at the video night ralf wilzer 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.430
 and summer and tour part four joyful 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.590
 us up there if you have not seen 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.870
 there has got that I have in the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.440
 written description 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.530
 I had in the description 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.390
 written that comments are desired 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.100
 or something like that or I have 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.520
 written because I got it shortly 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.660
 I have written 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.410
 for suggestions video wishes and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.640
 feedbacks necessarily the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.590
 Use comments and their comments 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.949
 Agents seem pretty taken seriously 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.969
 or 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.489
 I am pleased about the description 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.899
 can because as the comments are real 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.159
 explodes or 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.340
 well , that's me too 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.110
 so Kita picked quasi directly in 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.460
 So if that makes us happy that fits 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.229
 we have commented on this so much 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.280
 you also meanwhile many 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.340
 comments and many thumbs up 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.630
 arrived and come in advance 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.220
 if your question is still here 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 it was not answered then it lies 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.990
 either because the question is 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.020
 example has already been answered or 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.240
 that, for example, the simple question can 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.100
 no answer so that's it 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 just too stupid so ask the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.130
 answer them by yourself like let 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.460
 google also gets ready for us 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.869
 We simply overlook two such questions 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.430
 SpielbÃ¤lle then probably a funny 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.600
 Wise comments from you simply as 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.250
 runs from google 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.390
 Whatever it was, sometimes it was 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.100
 insult or something similar 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.759
 but simply marked as spam and 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.960
 they are too late or too late 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.140
 Anyway , I miss the comments 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.079
 also has as please remember as yours 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.890
 Comments were not answered 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.030
 So just answer the videos more 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.579
 see through we already uploaded 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.659
 maybe answered or we 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.560
 We also have the question because they 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.450
 especially good or because we just 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.090
 forgot to answer and now too 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.040
 see with video 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.569
 Today I want to say answered 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.000
 Come I was quickly asked to 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.950
 which he asked there was always the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.269
 Question from filip Cuba is believed I have 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.160
 me right he asked where we are 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:33.840
 all the money for have so horny 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.099
 and professional equipment so even 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.000
 Of course it does not exist 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.150
 then if I am the non-plus ultra 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.170
 equipment but we have to be honest 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.739
 Say we are giving our money meanwhile 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.900
 almost only the camera junk because 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.400
 We just found it easy now 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.549
 now here our hobby found in it and 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.030
 it just makes more fun and corner 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.370
 for example the hat his father 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.959
 sold his camera 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.170
 So you can all afford one 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:06.450
 must only set in principle or 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.040
 Setting priorities and that's how we do it 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.510
 actually the most money for 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.739
 I give myself what you are 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.780
 of course my bike out between 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.620
 if that breaks for example but 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.480
 otherwise we live film with it then 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.120
 there was a question here is belief 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.260
 I am the most asked question so far 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.609
 What use four cameras here 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.230
 this will be from the next main video 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.769
 So what we have filled from the outside with 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.900
 our cameras will be starting every video 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.489
 now it will come nipple 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.540
 equipment list in the description 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.120
 always be in it 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.470
 all post I had all of ours 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.790
 whole equipment in rows double 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.810
 It will definitely be an excuse 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.599
 be out of our equipment 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.010
 So there you can already prepare 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.919
 I'm also a link to 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.980
 make link to post where it point 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:55.769
 can find directly or because I am with 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.700
 program and so on and so on when 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.459
 I post into this list 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:07.260
 then there were a few more questions from 55 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:09.510
 0 55 if I have that right there 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.310
 I promised him that I would have a few 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.599
 ask from him answered because namely 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.730
 some asked i want everyone 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.639
 Answer there reached three raussuchen 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.169
 from him there was once the first question 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.609
 how has he started doing it has 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.909
 So you started that 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:27.570
 everything self-taught 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:30.270
 we have and when he needs it 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.680
 No course attended and hugged 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.719
 started or that we with our 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.300
 first funfair wheels almost as much 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.710
 forest and having really all right 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.409
 blatant tours made so to speak her 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.820
 typical one looks for example too 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.530
 Knowing the childhood I do not know yours 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.570
 childhood grew up but I am 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.530
 sooner than my father 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.789
 example kissed in the forest around and yes 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.610
 So made by the tour for example 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.950
 why nature like I lately in the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.740
 month before a few weeks months video 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.229
 had the odenwald and do video 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.840
 short is to do it briefly because 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.830
 made it clear and so it has 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.450
 started 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.560
 then we have bought only once 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.620
 and so on and so on 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.150
 actually different I would with one 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.270
 ride a bike but I'm uphill 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.560
 You can drive it reasonably well 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.630
 driving single trails somehow 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.979
 you can find something like that 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.320
 So of course I'm completely off 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.479
 start off when I have lessened something 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.390
 was usually a bike what 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.250
 only has a front fork and rear 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.919
 no suspension that is completely sufficient 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.590
 start from your own for example the 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.050
 I believe that with his hard 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:44.490
 Biggest jumps from the area at that time 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:46.560
 killed okay there is of course one 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.740
 real professional a bit disturbed 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.310
 but he has it now quite well 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.919
 mastered 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.630
 with a partner so it works or does 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.880
 I wonder one more bit 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.650
 many put is a classic 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.409
 Mountain bike downhill clothing needed 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.450
 or richau protector to give it 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:08.820
 sometimes as it attracts now , too 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:10.620
 withdraw of course enough is enough 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.680
 projectors completely out so you 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.240
 definitely does not need one 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.669
 professional equipment and right here the 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.610
 most expensive jerseys and so what that 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.950
 most important that europe has helmet and 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.659
 everything that goes with it and the clothes 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.600
 It does not matter if you feel 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:26.770
 you comfortable and 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.600
 I'm not supportive now because of me 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.000
 anything for example be no 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.570
 sounds that is the main thing 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.300
 you have to feel well the question 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.510
 was there again was the placement 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.540
 in steinach in the video in the race 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:45.310
 I can tell you if that is false 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.860
 it than now ask our tips 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.050
 have or to place my race 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.770
 for example our new website is 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.020
 now online 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.510
 we're just popping up here right now 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.490
 there you can drop by there 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.720
 there is now always to every race and 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.270
 probably also every day 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.800
 video for example the whole report 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.970
 what wants to have experienced everything and 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.340
 perhaps knows there already a 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.260
 few questions came out of the box 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.420
 steinach videos on the website my 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.610
 you can place it on top of that 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.230
 Also, just have a look 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.570
 very pleased 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.620
 yes and otherwise I think that always 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.590
 but will be open to ask more 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.910
 as I said calm again at max video 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.240
 or now the video or directly 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.290
 comment and get on your nerves 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.550
 and if she can just get it 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.800
 first wait maybe comes yes 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.810
 one more answer 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.490
 and who does not know you 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.170
 Maybe Diana Videos is through 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.040
 there's something or someone up to this 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.450
 next video is now to 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.890
 example and there you can your question 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.650
 possibly be answered if you 

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.460
 happiness you have otherwise resulted in meat 

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.020
 will comment 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.630
 with the diligent thumbs high zest for life 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.950
 real mega if we also x-men 

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.960
 videos on vinyl 

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.060
 That's why it's just super cool if you 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.230
 comments and thumbs up for it 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.230
 the national law negative
