00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
the biggest mistakes that I made was

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.230 
the biggest mistakes that I made was
trying<00:00:13.830> too<00:00:14.070> many<00:00:14.280> different<00:00:14.670> things<00:00:14.820> at<00:00:15.059> once

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
trying too many different things at once

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.050 
trying too many different things at once
and<00:00:15.599> these<00:00:15.960> were<00:00:16.109> natural<00:00:16.470> things<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.850> I

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
and these were natural things so so I

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.050 
and these were natural things so so I
did<00:00:18.300> think<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.600> they<00:00:18.840> was<00:00:19.080> safe<00:00:19.439> but<00:00:20.189> it's

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
did think that they was safe but it's

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.019 
did think that they was safe but it's
not<00:00:21.359> necessarily<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.230> case<00:00:22.410> your<00:00:23.010> skin<00:00:23.310> isn't

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
not necessarily the case your skin isn't

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.300 
not necessarily the case your skin isn't
as<00:00:24.420> tough<00:00:24.720> as<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.080> think<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> thought<00:00:26.070> my

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
as tough as you think is I thought my

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.540 
as tough as you think is I thought my
skin<00:00:26.609> was<00:00:26.730> very<00:00:26.789> thick<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.510> tough<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.400> and<00:00:29.400> it

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
skin was very thick and tough and and it

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.980 
skin was very thick and tough and and it
could<00:00:29.699> handle<00:00:29.910> pretty<00:00:30.330> much<00:00:30.390> anything<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
could handle pretty much anything that I

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.740 
could handle pretty much anything that I
put<00:00:31.260> put<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:31.859> my<00:00:31.949> face<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.489> thought<00:00:32.730> all<00:00:33.149> acne

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
put put on my face I thought all acne

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.069 
put put on my face I thought all acne
was<00:00:33.989> caused<00:00:34.290> by<00:00:34.640> internal<00:00:35.640> problems<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.840> my

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
was caused by internal problems in my

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.700 
was caused by internal problems in my
system<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.760> outside<00:00:39.239> stuff<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:39.930> didn't

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
system and the outside stuff was didn't

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.760 
system and the outside stuff was didn't
really<00:00:40.860> matter<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:42.170> that's<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.340> case<00:00:44.579> I

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
really matter but that's not the case I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.400 
really matter but that's not the case I
actually<00:00:46.770> gave<00:00:47.280> myself<00:00:47.840> cosmetic<00:00:48.840> acne<00:00:49.200> which

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
actually gave myself cosmetic acne which

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.020 
actually gave myself cosmetic acne which
is<00:00:49.620> probably<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> only<00:00:50.129> case<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.489> acne<00:00:50.640> that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
is probably the only case of acne that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.900 
is probably the only case of acne that
you<00:00:51.120> get<00:00:51.329> from<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:52.440> external<00:00:52.800> external<00:00:53.399> stuff

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you get from the external external stuff

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.520 
you get from the external external stuff
that's<00:00:54.449> something<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.170> happening

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that's something that's not happening

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.970 
that's something that's not happening
inside<00:00:55.800> your<00:00:55.860> body<00:00:56.180> so<00:00:57.260> if<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.500> had<00:00:58.649> left<00:00:58.859> my

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
inside your body so if I had left my

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950 
inside your body so if I had left my
skin<00:00:59.340> alone<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.059> had<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.329> used<00:01:00.449> very

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
skin alone if I had just used very

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.930 
skin alone if I had just used very
gentle<00:01:01.469> skin<00:01:01.739> care<00:01:01.980> routine<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.489> worked<00:01:02.699> on

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
gentle skin care routine and worked on

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.939 
gentle skin care routine and worked on
the<00:01:03.120> actual<00:01:03.329> cause<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.870> acne<00:01:04.170> which<00:01:04.650> from

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the actual cause of the acne which from

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.149 
the actual cause of the acne which from
in<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.250> case<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.729> stress<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.360> hormones<00:01:07.159> then

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
in my case was stress and hormones then

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.969 
in my case was stress and hormones then
my<00:01:09.000> acne<00:01:09.420> would<00:01:09.600> probably<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.439> completely

my acne would probably be completely

about which are really would outline for

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.140 
about which are really would outline for

your acne which are very dental on the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.210 
your acne which are very dental on the

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
skin and and won't cause further

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.949 
skin and and won't cause further
breakouts<00:03:33.850> for<00:03:34.150> other<00:03:34.270> reasons<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.620> that's<00:03:36.580> it

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
breakouts for other reasons so that's it

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.510 
breakouts for other reasons so that's it
so<00:03:37.959> probably<00:03:38.350> my<00:03:38.440> biggest<00:03:38.590> tip<00:03:38.860> is<00:03:39.069> don't<00:03:39.100> pick

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
so probably my biggest tip is don't pick

so probably my biggest tip is don't pick
and<00:03:39.670> squeeze<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:39.959> second<00:03:40.959> biggest<00:03:41.140> one<00:03:41.350> is

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
and squeeze and second biggest one is

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.020 
and squeeze and second biggest one is
just<00:03:41.830> be<00:03:41.980> careful<00:03:42.340> about<00:03:42.430> what<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.730> put<00:03:43.000> on

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030
