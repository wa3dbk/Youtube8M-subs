00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.519
 it is not so difficult to prepare a beautiful centerpiece using elements 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.519
 natural flowers such as today tricks 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.600
 before starting let's get a plate of a bowl on which I lay emo 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.960
 our decorative elements in the center of the plate 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.830
 we want a form of oz for the florist sponge that will serve as a support 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.250
 moistening with water to keep the centerpiece cool 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.710
 if we have chosen flowers or very thin flexible branches we reinforce 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.420
 reusing wire for florists 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
 which will also help us insert them into the os x 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.520
 we proceed by inserting an item we choose one by one 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.790
 let's start with the flowers and then continue with the leaves with the little flowers 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 small 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.310
 we avoid choosing flowers of many colors but we try to keep ourselves with 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.470
 only one shade of color to avoid getting an effect excessively 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.480
 messy a few touches with small white flowers can help us to 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.040
 to give light to the composition
