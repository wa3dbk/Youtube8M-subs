00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and you know they were pregnant I

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.690 
and you know they were pregnant I
haven't<00:00:37.440> seen<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.219> any<00:00:38.399> bigger

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.119 
haven't seen that they look any bigger
or<00:00:38.969> anything<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.989> really<00:00:40.680> don't<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:40.920> my

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
or anything so I really don't have my

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.830 
or anything so I really don't have my
hopes<00:00:41.340> up<00:00:41.520> right<00:00:41.760> now<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.690> that

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
hopes up right now I just think that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.060 
hopes up right now I just think that
maybe<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.260> winter<00:00:43.530> has<00:00:43.620> been<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.770> little<00:00:43.980> bit

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
maybe this winter has been a little bit

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
maybe this winter has been a little bit
too<00:00:44.219> harsh<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.520> them<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:45.360> maybe<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
too harsh for them and then maybe now I

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.330 
too harsh for them and then maybe now I
try<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.350> breed<00:00:46.620> now<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.800> temperature<00:00:47.309> is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
try to breed now the temperature is

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.619 
try to breed now the temperature is
starting<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> get<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> little<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.300> warmer

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
starting to get a little bit warmer

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.139 
starting to get a little bit warmer
maybe<00:00:49.230> I'll<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.590> better<00:00:49.620> luck<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.760> we're

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
maybe I'll have better luck but we're

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.340
