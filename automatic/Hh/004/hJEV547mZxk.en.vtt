like this which is pretty cool you know
and<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.620> shoots<00:02:04.980> tapes<00:02:05.480> like<00:02:06.480> this<00:02:06.720> these

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
and this shoots tapes like this these

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.729 
and this shoots tapes like this these
are<00:02:07.020> mini<00:02:07.440> DV<00:02:07.860> tapes<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.989> records<00:02:09.989> about<00:02:10.590> an

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
are mini DV tapes and records about an

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.830 
are mini DV tapes and records about an
hour<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.370> worth<00:02:11.579> the<00:02:11.609> footage

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
hour so worth the footage

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.050 
hour so worth the footage
this<00:02:13.050> one<00:02:13.230> looks<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.590> be<00:02:13.739> like<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.060> 60-minute

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
this one looks to be like a 60-minute

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.880 
this one looks to be like a 60-minute
and<00:02:15.209> regular<00:02:15.569> time<00:02:15.750> or<00:02:15.959> 90-minute<00:02:16.260> otherwise

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and regular time or 90-minute otherwise

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.979 
and regular time or 90-minute otherwise
but<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:19.590> way<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.800> hook<00:02:20.099> this<00:02:20.250> one<00:02:20.459> up

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
but the way you hook this one up

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.809 
but the way you hook this one up
typically<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.470> through<00:02:23.040> like<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> little<00:02:23.550> plug

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
typically is through like a little plug

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.410 
typically is through like a little plug
right<00:02:24.150> here<00:02:24.769> behind<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:26.280> small<00:02:26.790> compartment

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
right here behind a small compartment

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.790 
right here behind a small compartment
sorry<00:02:27.690> let<00:02:27.870> me<00:02:27.900> try<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.140> get<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.410> open<00:02:28.560> for

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
sorry let me try and get that open for

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.979 
sorry let me try and get that open for
you<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.040> small<00:02:29.640> compartment<00:02:30.239> on<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.450> side<00:02:30.840> of

you a small compartment on the side of
the<00:02:31.650> camera<00:02:32.280> right<00:02:32.519> there<00:02:32.580> in<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.180> case<00:02:33.420> it

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
the camera right there in this case it

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.710 
the camera right there in this case it
doesn't<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:34.709> one<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.280> fits<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.879> USB<00:02:36.450> but

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
doesn't have one that fits the USB but

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.420 
doesn't have one that fits the USB but
some<00:02:37.140> cameras<00:02:37.560> some<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.890> newer<00:02:38.010> cameras

some cameras some of the newer cameras

some cameras some of the newer cameras
do<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.480> case<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.900> has<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.049> little<00:02:40.580> platform

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
do in this case it has a little platform

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.699 
do in this case it has a little platform
that<00:02:42.030> sits<00:02:42.299> on<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> little<00:02:42.810> docking<00:02:43.230> station

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
that sits on a little docking station

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.069 
that sits on a little docking station
and<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.310> where<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.610> plug<00:02:44.819> in<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.840> power

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
and this is where you plug in the power

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.750 
and this is where you plug in the power
to<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.950> then<00:02:47.190> also<00:02:47.630> this<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.980> either<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.160> USB

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
to it and then also this is either a USB

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.839 
to it and then also this is either a USB
or<00:02:51.000> firewire<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:52.230> we<00:02:53.069> can<00:02:53.190> talk<00:02:53.370> about<00:02:53.549> that<00:02:53.790> a

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
or firewire and we can talk about that a

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.400 
or firewire and we can talk about that a
little<00:02:54.000> bit<00:02:54.120> firewire<00:02:54.780> used<00:02:55.079> to<00:02:55.170> be<00:02:55.290> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
little bit firewire used to be the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.770 
little bit firewire used to be the
preferred<00:02:55.739> method<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.730> transfer<00:02:57.569> just

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
preferred method of transfer just

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.569 
preferred method of transfer just
because<00:02:58.049> of<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.230> data<00:02:58.530> rate<00:02:58.739> was<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.069> fast<00:02:59.340> in

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
because of the data rate was so fast in

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.490 
because of the data rate was so fast in
the<00:02:59.670> video<00:02:59.910> looked<00:03:00.180> pretty<00:03:00.390> good<00:03:00.569> these<00:03:01.230> days

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
the video looked pretty good these days

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.589 
the video looked pretty good these days
it's<00:03:01.709> just<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.010> video<00:03:02.280> or<00:03:02.340> digital<00:03:03.030> transfer

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
it's just a video or digital transfer

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.539 
it's just a video or digital transfer
and<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.410> what<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.680> do<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.099> take<00:03:05.280> this

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
and so what I do is I just take this

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.910 
and so what I do is I just take this
little<00:03:05.849> guy<00:03:05.940> right<00:03:06.209> here<00:03:06.500> pop<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.650> right<00:03:07.769> on

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
little guy right here pop it right on

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.289 
little guy right here pop it right on
there<00:03:08.129> and<00:03:08.370> push<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.760> down<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.180> it

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
there and push it down and it

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.610 
there and push it down and it
automatically<00:03:10.610> connects<00:03:11.610> via<00:03:12.030> USB<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:13.470> my

called<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.410> flip<00:03:16.859> and<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.739> I've

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
called the flip and this is I've

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.289 
called the flip and this is I've
actually<00:03:19.920> got<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.370> flips<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.819> one<00:03:21.150> I'm<00:03:21.269> using

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
actually got to flips the one I'm using

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.390 
actually got to flips the one I'm using
right<00:03:21.750> now<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.680> one<00:03:22.829> I'm<00:03:22.920> holding<00:03:23.100> in<00:03:23.370> my

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400

right now and the one I'm holding in my
hand<00:03:23.700> right<00:03:23.760> here<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.600> called<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.079> minnow

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
hand right here this is called a minnow

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.640 
hand right here this is called a minnow
HD<00:03:25.950> but<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.310> reason<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.639> like<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.530> camera<00:03:28.530> in

HD but the reason I like this camera in

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.670 
HD but the reason I like this camera in
particular<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:30.090> forest<00:03:30.840> ability<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.410> plug

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
particular it is forest ability to plug

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.550 
particular it is forest ability to plug
right<00:03:32.040> into<00:03:32.420> your<00:03:33.420> computer<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.139> download
