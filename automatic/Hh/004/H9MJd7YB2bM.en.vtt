00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.210
 hello that such friends I am camus wang in the 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.370
 Today's video we are going to learn 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.709
 how to diagnose what is 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.599
 our graphics card we are going to 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.549
 do it in a very simple way without 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.490
 need to install any program 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.170
 extra but with your own tools 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.050
 of our operating system that in this 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.210
 case is windows 7 let's go to the menu 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.080
 start here in the search box we go 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.580
 to write from x world we will come out that 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.039
 on the top what is this 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.410
 icon with an X in yellow 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.690
 that's good, this is the tool 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.900
 microsoft diagnostics let's give it 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.900
 click 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.520
 we will go to the next window in 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.260
 where if we can realize in the 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.480
 bottom part begins to load 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.640
 automatically what is a bar what 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.650
 which means that he is reading and 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.489
 making sure they are in good condition 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.559
 the components of our team 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.940
 first on the good system tab 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.280
 that gives us a detailed information 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.500
 about the components and 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.839
 Direct drivers installed in 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.479
 our system where here in 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.880
 information as we can see date and 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.800
 current time the name of the computer system 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.130
 operative language system manufacturer 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.649
 avÃ­os memory processor in order we 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.620
 we are going to locate in the following 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.020
 tab that says screen 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.910
 where as here the good device 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.970
 gives us the name manufacturer type of 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.040
 approximate total memory chip that 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.340
 we have assigned as well as mode of 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.190
 monitor presentation in here in 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.860
 characteristics of the ex we can see that 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.110
 the acceleration of electro as well as 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.110
 criticized and everything is enabled 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.310
 here where it says notes we can see that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.920
 in my case good because it was not found 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.920
 no problem in a given case that 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.290
 your card has an error or is 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.360
 failing good well here it would come out that 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.790
 who has problems and I would tell them 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.940
 information about what what 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.040
 is causing this error ok this this 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.409
 can be very helpful to people 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.440
 what 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.260
 Well, they like to play video games 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.120
 your computer on your computer that's 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.209
 suddenly good because they buy them and then 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.730
 will show if they are compatible with 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.920
 devices or features of the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.989
 team with which they count good then 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.470
 here you can give them very information 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.690
 detailed about whether you can run them 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.580
 well or not this is because in some 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.560
 Sometimes they will run a video game 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.379
 perhaps they were distorted what is the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.510
 screen the colors this does not mean 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.220
 necessarily that your computer or in 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.530
 this case better said your card 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.440
 graphics is damaged simply that 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.329
 maybe it is not compatible with this 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.670
 video game that you are running 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.620
 how good they are 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.629
 attention to this kind of thing gives us 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.750
 also other information like what is 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:01.140
 the sound and the entrance as we can see 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.780
 here really this tool is very 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.560
 very good is a kind of everest for 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.390
 that look more or less a detail 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.220
 of what it is of what this is 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.340
 It is a very good tool 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.350
 which has our operating system of 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.660
 good way also good if it's 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.360
 failing your card d 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.270
 of video there are many programs that can 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.450
 install but give them to maybe in a 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.460
 most tedious way is further 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.730
 it may take longer to diagnose what 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.010
 it's video memory but finally yes 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.870
 It is damaged if you have any problems 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.760
 he's going to say it like this 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.770
 tool this type of programs is 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.480
 do exactly the same just 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.130
 that gives them another type of information 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.740
 even up to the temperature of it 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.390
 but it actually does exactly what 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.790
 same 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.800
 ok so that's good with that finished what 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.230
 which is the video of today waiting 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.850
 you liked command have served 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.850
 greetings to all my subscribers to 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.580
 all my facebook friends youtube 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:06.560
 let's drop one and we're in touch until 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.560
 the next video
