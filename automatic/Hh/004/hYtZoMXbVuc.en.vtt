00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 he is one of the two survivors of 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.029
 the previous holy war against des that 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.069
 along with little decided to train the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.260
 new generations of Athenian saints 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.360
 the great patriarch who was the victim of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.280
 betrayal of Gemini saga and that still 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.119
 after death he remained loyal 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.850
 to the goddess to had the old John 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.650
 Knight of Aries Jon de Aries is a 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.840
 character quite crucial for all the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.609
 saga dead is 6 she and although in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.019
 general does not have much appearance in the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.029
 original series of the Knights of the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.550
 zodiac besides being the master of 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.190
 much the gone co are the protagonists of 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.170
 the sleeves next dimension and the cambas and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.180
 in this box car we will do a review of 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.460
 the new figure of Zion that thanks to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 Adam will arrive in Mexico the truth is that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.390
 when they announced that john was going to leave 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.460
 in version and ex really surprised us 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.170
 because we were waiting for them to come out 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.390
 first all the golden knights 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.160
 current john is a character that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.440
 really appears very little in the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.329
 original series made of it only carries 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.760
 the golden ram armor in flash 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.829
 backs is in the cambas where really 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.690
 highlights and in ex dimension where we can 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.739
 see it act when it just becomes 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.079
 in golden knight 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.180
 In general, the piece is a huge improvement 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.460
 of the micro version is normal from the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.830
 hair to the face and not even the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.720
 clothes accessories are very similar 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.880
 to the de mou but do not worry because 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.409
 comes with enough faces and hands to 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.659
 that you can get creative with the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.399
 poses the packaging of this gentleman 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.110
 golden is very similar to the saga of 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.850
 Gemini short place version 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.399
 however the overall tones are more 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.530
 yellowish obviously in fact 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.049
 question of size is equal to that of saga and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.820
 smaller than that of radamantis by 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.069
 in front of the box we can see action 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.990
 posing in all its splendor as a whole 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.360
 with the already characteristic giant face 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.310
 on the one hand as in all boxes and 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.080
 variants of the micros and ex we can see 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.880
 the logos of the saga of hades chapter 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.009
 of the sanctuary of bandai and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.750
 machines jones can not miss the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.850
 of the 40th anniversary of Kurumada as 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.979
 mangaka and the only new thing that comes in the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.470
 box is a text in Japanese that says 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.390
 jodi world version that in our theory 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.700
 is that that subtitle is to justify 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.369
 the fact that the original series of 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.760
 gentlemen of the zodiac Zion never used the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.590
 golden area armor 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.230
 the back of the box shows 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.030
 action in various poses and with different 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.010
 faces but not all 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.990
 accessories it contains we can also 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.700
 see the armed object and with both 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.980
 different pairs of horns that you can 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.570
 use to train the ram already by 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.650
 last we can see the dynamic duo 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.870
 golden of 243 years ago and jon de aries and 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.790
 dock or pound the great patriarch has 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.160
 the body very similar if not that 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.110
 identical to my ex's what is 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.930
 completely new is green hair 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.610
 tousled so characteristic of sion 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.620
 this one looks much better than the previous one 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.140
 since it is practically removed 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.760
 anime direct another thing that stands out 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.920
 immediately are the strands that 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.170
 hang by the front similar 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.300
 the hair of milo and Aphrodite 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.160
 armor even though it is assumed that 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.870
 it should be the same used by mod 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.270
 It has its slight color changes with 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.130
 unreal elements in silver outside 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.560
 it this sacred clothing of Aries is 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.300
 totally equal to the previous something that 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.190
 we would have loved to have included 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.620
 the shoulder pads that appear in the manga 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.770
 original that for some reason chinguar 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.790
 here he decided to remove them for the anime 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.390
 surely those shoulder pads would have 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.210
 fact that 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.830
 super imposing the figure of that and what 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.780
 it will differ a little more from the 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.610
 armor mod the object of the ram 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.500
 golden is a little bit different from the one 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.380
 we're used to anime since 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.720
 incorporates shoulder pads without 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.610
 But something super cool is that you can 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.830
 form the object so much in the way that 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.140
 it was seen in the anime with the smooth horns 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.240
 as well as the way it appeared in 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.670
 the sleeve with a head that resembles 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.830
 more to the face of a ram both 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.020
 forms of the jets are pretty good and 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.970
 with the real ones in silver color is reflected 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.770
 very good light making this 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.500
 armor look a little prettier than 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.350
 the demo although obviously that is not going 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.730
 to like the purist fans of kurumada 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.500
 entering the detail of the painting and how 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.209
 we had previously commented 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.459
 easy to see that the armor tones 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.680
 They are more silver than the garb of 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.930
 mold what really impressed us the most 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.120
 it was the detail on the face and hair 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.070
 of the great patriarch is incredible as 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.989
 each strand of hair sion that is 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.150
 even the sideburns look like 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.190
 drawn by the very masami 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.900
 kurumada in fact there is an improvement 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.209
 very great in the hair color of 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.720
 sion version and ex action mid version 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.700
 cloud 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.860
 also the attention to detail of the 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.370
 eyes and wings super emblematic eyebrows 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.230
 lemuria nash is awesome happening 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.480
 The arias armchair accessories comes with 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.340
 three faces ten hands two sets of 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.500
 hair to put it with helmet and without 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.480
 helmet a layer an object and the 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.690
 tools to repair armor 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.980
 a mallet and a chisel the truth is that the 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.420
 accessories plus yes two are the 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.730
 tools that he gave to tena for 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.070
 fix the sacred garments though 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.140
 before we had seen them as is 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.000
 just as cool as the great 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.010
 patriarch since it gives him even more 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.560
 importance to his blacksmith lineage 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.210
 Lemuria could not miss the layer either 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.820
 that all the other previous gentlemen 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.770
 golden ones had actually brought only saga 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.590
 from Gemini version to Paris and Radamantis 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.360
 they do not bring them and with respect to the hands 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.520
 all of them are similar to those 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.190
 they bring by default the rest of them 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.350
 and ex thing that is pretty good since 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.889
 they allow you a range of super poses 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.080
 super broad and cool 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.969
 as expected in the micros figures 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.650
 and ex if john has joints of 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.900
 It's enough for you to get creative with the 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.849
 possibility although the hats and the 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.099
 hair is limited by the head and 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.900
 neck have enough Mobility 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.610
 arms have a ball joint in 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.830
 the shoulders with mobility towards all 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.749
 sides besides the double juncture in the 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.849
 elbow to bend it more realistically 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:40.770
 finally you have the ball joint 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.080
 on the wrists to rotate them and accommodate 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.509
 the best the torso can turn 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.669
 freely apart from being segmented in 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.409
 the chest to be able to bend the legs 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.969
 have the same joints as the 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.250
 arms with a ball on the hip and 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.289
 a double on the knees to bend them 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.909
 as well as the quite versatile ankle 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.310
 that bends well in front and back 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:02.129
 and to the sides and with the pivot in the 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.189
 tip for more stability in summary 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:09.180
 are Aries measures 19 centimeters and has 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:11.219
 a total of 38 joints the great 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.289
 Patriarch of Aries is the size 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:14.789
 average of the ex and in fact you can 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.889
 see that it is a little higher than 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.749
 andromeda zoom and almost the same flight 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.580
 that saggas to paris comparatively 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.379
 talking to other figures of bandai is 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.280
 you can see that it is much higher than 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:25.830
 the 66 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.720
 of dragon ball z and sailor moon and that 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.120
 is almost on par with the height of 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.860
 monsters arts obviously he has his 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.540
 please the golden armor that makes 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.480
 stand out much more than any other 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.940
 Figure thanks to the saga of hades yet 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.650
 more to the saga of the Cambas Zion is one 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.510
 of the characters that we respect most
