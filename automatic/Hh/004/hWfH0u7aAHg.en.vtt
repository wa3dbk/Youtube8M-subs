00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.640
 hello beauties then this begins 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.220
 make up tutorial derby by applying the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.099
 fondotinta ruralia on all my 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.390
 notice and then immediately went to the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.090
 eye makeup 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.219
 applying this kajal suffered 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.739
 waterproof color jeans spent as if 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.940
 it was an eyeliner at the top 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.920
 of my eye with this very small tail 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.630
 in pin up style that I later go 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.120
 to fade slightly using a 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.800
 then I apply the pencil to the small brush 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.329
 in the upper inner rim e 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.940
 later to give more 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.230
 depth this eyes look a lot 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.210
 simple 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.700
 I apply this brown eyeshadow 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.340
 in the well-shaded fold with a 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.930
 very large and subsequently small brush 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.180
 I intensify this nuance only ed 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.490
 exclusively at the outer corner e 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.740
 in the crease of the eye using a 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.810
 black eyeshadow but now make-up 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.579
 eyes is one of those I wear most 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.829
 frequently lately because 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.289
 really simple and quick to make 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.850
 and in fact to complete it will suffice me 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.280
 going to add a touch of light 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.959
 immediately below the eyebrows and in the middle 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.909
 of the mobile eyelid and of course 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:35.039
 optional false eyelashes 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.869
 by the way it is one of those eye tricks 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.229
 that can be adapted to the greater 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.030
 number of types of eye shapes e 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.029
 so I also like this 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.920
 really really very much and flies the 

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:49.649
 eye makeup is practically completed 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.350
 names will do more than add a 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.840
 touch of mascara and this oil one 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.939
 mascara one of my favorites 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.270
 of the last period and knows it to spread 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.279
 only on the upper lashes if the eyes 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.099
 this hint of blue color jeans 

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:07.859
 while regarding the cheeks 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.500
 I choose this plus slightly fished 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.620
 with a matte finish that is one of my own 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.459
 favorite 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.459
 and spread it with very light touches 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:22.180
 on the cheeks precisely but now we pass the 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:26.470
 different tests the earth and for this look 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.049
 I choose the new lists b map timing that 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.440
 they are a novelty that I love these 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:35.739
 pencils just very very easy to 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.470
 apply with a matte finish as before 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.940
 coloring I choose this rosÃ© news 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.329
 which I like very much 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.349
 in particular a way combined with al 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:49.540
 blue jeans that either on the eyes but 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.549
 then I choose to do several 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.739
 tests then try different shades 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.260
 on the lips to see if they are fine 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.840
 all of them with this look so I go 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.519
 to try a more orange color this 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.299
 it is a very red orange 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.190
 very intense and very bright detail 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.530
 almost as if it were a burnt red 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.980
 which I also like very much in 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.629
 combined with blue and slightly hinted 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.340
 on the eyes and I find this one 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.560
 so garish coloring really is 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.049
 very well with a tail then put 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.079
 particularly in evidence from the total 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:28.180
 look but last decided to try 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:31.900
 also an even more intense coloring 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.139
 this fuchsia is even more special 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.660
 very intense too beautiful 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.849
 beautiful with the girls I have 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.879
 applied were the three colors of 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.769
 lip dub my favorite derby map 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.699
 obviously there are many others because 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.030
 in the range 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:51.190
 I have come out a good 12 I really hope that 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.470
 you liked the look by referring a 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.069
 big kiss is as always see you at 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.069
 next life
