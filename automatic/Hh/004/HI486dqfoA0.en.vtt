00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.640 
the impression I have being a bit longer
how's<00:03:47.840> that<00:03:48.049> that's<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.620> top<00:03:48.799> tip<00:03:50.440> so<00:03:51.440> what

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
how's that that's a top tip so what

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.229 
how's that that's a top tip so what
subjects<00:03:52.129> did<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.459> do<00:03:52.579> in<00:03:52.730> school<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:53.120> you

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
subjects did you do in school that you

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.930 
subjects did you do in school that you
find<00:03:53.480> useful<00:03:53.750> being<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.590> hairdresser

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
find useful being a hairdresser

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.339 
find useful being a hairdresser
obviously<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.090> take<00:03:56.239> maths<00:03:56.540> Neil<00:03:56.989> English

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
obviously you take maths Neil English

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.649 
obviously you take maths Neil English
and<00:03:57.530> stuff<00:03:57.709> like<00:03:57.920> that<00:03:58.159> so<00:03:58.190> I<00:03:58.819> passed<00:03:59.239> both<00:03:59.480> of

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
and stuff like that so I passed both of

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.220 
and stuff like that so I passed both of
them<00:03:59.810> I<00:04:00.079> found<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.739> easier<00:04:01.549> with<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.150> maths<00:04:02.359> to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
them I found it easier with the maths to

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.470 
them I found it easier with the maths to
mix<00:04:03.500> up<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.739> ratios<00:04:04.430> with<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.940> colors<00:04:05.329> and

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
mix up the ratios with the colors and

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.379 
mix up the ratios with the colors and
the<00:04:05.540> peroxide<00:04:06.140> so<00:04:06.849> even<00:04:07.849> though<00:04:07.940> it's<00:04:08.090> on<00:04:08.239> the

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
the peroxide so even though it's on the

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.539 
the peroxide so even though it's on the
wall<00:04:08.569> next<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.079> you<00:04:09.230> yet<00:04:09.410> you<00:04:09.799> still<00:04:10.010> can<00:04:10.400> work

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
wall next to you yet you still can work

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.309 
wall next to you yet you still can work
it<00:04:10.730> out<00:04:10.790> in<00:04:10.970> your<00:04:11.060> head<00:04:11.180> how<00:04:11.480> much<00:04:11.750> Janine's<00:04:12.109> of

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
it out in your head how much Janine's of

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.229 
it out in your head how much Janine's of
how<00:04:12.470> much<00:04:12.650> you've<00:04:12.799> got<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:13.069> put<00:04:13.220> in<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.579> then

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
how much you've got to put in and then

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.180 
how much you've got to put in and then
with<00:04:14.540> your<00:04:14.750> English<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.470> think<00:04:15.500> really<00:04:15.950> it's

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
with your English I think really it's

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.890 
with your English I think really it's
just<00:04:16.340> worth<00:04:16.549> speaking<00:04:17.060> properly<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:17.810> the

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
just worth speaking properly to the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.779 
just worth speaking properly to the
clients<00:04:18.410> it's<00:04:18.680> not<00:04:18.919> much<00:04:19.099> change<00:04:19.430> in<00:04:19.579> how<00:04:19.729> you

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
clients it's not much change in how you

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.210 
clients it's not much change in how you
speak<00:04:20.239> or<00:04:20.450> making<00:04:21.139> yourself<00:04:21.410> sound<00:04:21.739> part

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
speak or making yourself sound part

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.190 
speak or making yourself sound part
it's<00:04:22.430> just<00:04:22.700> speaking<00:04:23.000> correctly<00:04:23.389> two<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.080> them

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
it's just speaking correctly two of them

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.500 
it's just speaking correctly two of them
