out so when you're blending with an

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.350 
out so when you're blending with an
I shadow<00:02:13.160> like<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:13.580> what<00:02:13.760> happens<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.270> you

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
I shadow like this what happens is you

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.630 
I shadow like this what happens is you
end<00:02:14.390> up<00:02:14.690> kind<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.990> moving<00:02:15.380> some<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.400> black

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
end up kind of moving some of the black

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.640 
end up kind of moving some of the black
around<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.300> gets<00:02:17.569> picked<00:02:17.900> up<00:02:18.050> by<00:02:18.110> your<00:02:18.440> brush

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
around it gets picked up by your brush

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.860 
around it gets picked up by your brush
so<00:02:19.130> creates<00:02:19.610> kind<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.090> smoky<00:02:20.660> look

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
so creates kind of a smoky look

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.660 
so creates kind of a smoky look
obviously<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.739> be<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.950> darkest<00:02:22.400> here

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
obviously going to be the darkest here

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.460 
obviously going to be the darkest here
