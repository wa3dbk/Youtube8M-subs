00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.180 

hello<00:00:00.390> my<00:00:00.630> name<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.810> Caroline<00:00:01.319> and<00:00:01.620> today<00:00:02.070> I'm

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hello my name is Caroline and today I'm

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.579 
hello my name is Caroline and today I'm
going<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.429> show<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.419> help<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.290> get<00:00:04.410> a

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
going to show you how to help to get a

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.190 
going to show you how to help to get a
nice<00:00:05.100> clear<00:00:05.670> articulation<00:00:05.970> with<00:00:06.839> your<00:00:06.960> cello

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
nice clear articulation with your cello

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.930 
nice clear articulation with your cello
so<00:00:07.950> we're<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.280> start<00:00:08.519> with<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.730> left

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
so we're going to start with the left

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.410 
so we're going to start with the left
hand<00:00:09.349> now<00:00:10.349> because<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.830> cello<00:00:11.099> has<00:00:11.340> such<00:00:11.700> long

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
hand now because the cello has such long

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.079 
hand now because the cello has such long
big<00:00:12.809> strings<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.860> unlike<00:00:14.370> toki<00:00:14.730> unlike<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
big strings and unlike toki unlike a

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.599 
big strings and unlike toki unlike a
violin<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.740> lot<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.070> people<00:00:17.340> feel<00:00:17.520> that

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
violin and a lot of people feel that

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.660 
violin and a lot of people feel that
they<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.000> press<00:00:18.480> down<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.590> get<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.070> clean

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
they have to press down to get a clean

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.210 
they have to press down to get a clean
sound<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:23.150> get<00:00:24.150> any<00:00:24.449> kind<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
sound and to get any kind of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.460 
sound and to get any kind of
articulation<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:27.180> exactly<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.170> opposite

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
articulation it's exactly the opposite

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.659 
articulation it's exactly the opposite
of<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:29.150> what<00:00:30.619> what<00:00:31.619> we<00:00:31.890> need<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
of that what what we need is that the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.990 
of that what what we need is that the
finger<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.510> string<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:34.050> relaxed<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.160> it's

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
finger on the string is relaxed as it's

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.360 
finger on the string is relaxed as it's
very<00:00:36.270> relaxed<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.230> sinking<00:00:37.980> into<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
very relaxed and it's sinking into the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.150 
very relaxed and it's sinking into the
string<00:00:38.760> not<00:00:39.360> pressing<00:00:40.170> into<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> string

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
string not pressing into the string

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.069 
string not pressing into the string
quite<00:00:41.399> quite<00:00:41.760> different<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.899> you

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
quite quite different because if you

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.490 
quite quite different because if you
press<00:00:43.730> you're<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.090> set<00:00:45.780> up<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.079> tension

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
press you're going to set up a tension

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.959 
press you're going to set up a tension
which<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> make<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.309> really

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
which is going to make it really

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.490 
which is going to make it really
difficult<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> play<00:00:48.899> fast<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
difficult for you to play fast in the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.819 
difficult for you to play fast in the
future<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.449> will<00:00:51.449> probably<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.410> painful

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
future and will probably be painful

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.130 
future and will probably be painful
because<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.309> would<00:00:53.969> think<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.510> would<00:00:54.690> of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
because I would think that that would of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.139 
because I would think that that would of
course<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.710> tightness<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.520> your<00:00:56.550> hands<00:00:56.910> that

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
course a tightness in your hands that

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.220 
course a tightness in your hands that
would<00:00:57.570> start<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.350> painful<00:00:58.699> so<00:00:59.930> what<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
would start to be painful so what I

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.329 
would start to be painful so what I
would<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> think<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.940> this

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
would like you to think of is that this

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.530 
would like you to think of is that this
this<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> show<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.420> my

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
this I'm going to show you with my

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.140 
this I'm going to show you with my
second<00:01:07.020> finger<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.760> easiest

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
second finger because it's the easiest

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.679 
second finger because it's the easiest
to<00:01:09.299> start<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.950> position<00:01:11.689> here

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
to start with that this position here

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.200 
to start with that this position here
isn't<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.890> there<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> coiled<00:01:15.000> spring

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
isn't like there is a coiled spring

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.770 
isn't like there is a coiled spring
inside<00:01:16.220> inside<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.580> finger<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.540> just

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
inside inside that finger and it's just

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
inside inside that finger and it's just
waiting<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.229> release<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.850> let<00:01:21.000> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
waiting for release and so if you let it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.080 
waiting for release and so if you let it
release<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.840> falls<00:01:22.380> onto<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.920> string<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.909> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
release it falls onto the string and it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.999 
release it falls onto the string and it
just<00:01:24.240> flies<00:01:24.600> onto<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.170> string<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.770> what

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
just flies onto the string and it what

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.789 
just flies onto the string and it what
if<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.580> practice<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.869> means<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
if you practice that it means that that

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.190 
if you practice that it means that that
you're<00:01:29.549> falling<00:01:30.000> fingers<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.630> very<00:01:30.869> very

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you're falling fingers get very very

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.770 
you're falling fingers get very very
clean<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:34.250> if<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.540> keep

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
clean so if you can if you can keep

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.109 
clean so if you can if you can keep
practicing<00:01:37.220> just<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.610> second<00:01:39.060> finger

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
practicing just with your second finger

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.120 
practicing just with your second finger
at<00:01:39.570> first<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.619> generalize<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
at first and then you can generalize it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.130 
at first and then you can generalize it
onto<00:01:41.670> your<00:01:41.820> your<00:01:42.270> other<00:01:42.420> things<00:01:42.689> because<00:01:42.990> it's

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
onto your your other things because it's

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.399 
onto your your other things because it's
the<00:01:43.259> easiest<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.860> feel<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.340> first<00:01:45.110> if<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.229> keep

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the easiest to feel at first if you keep

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.389 
the easiest to feel at first if you keep
practicing<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.250> could

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
practicing that and if you could

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.460 
practicing that and if you could
practice<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.060> also<00:01:48.299> away<00:01:48.780> from<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> child

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
practice that also away from the child

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.929 
practice that also away from the child
so<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:51.240> your<00:01:51.630> head<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.470> you're<00:01:52.649> visualizing<00:01:53.399> it

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
so in your head so you're visualizing it

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.480 
so in your head so you're visualizing it
this<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.479> coiled<00:01:55.140> spring<00:01:55.560> or<00:01:55.799> even<00:01:56.070> maybe

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
this this coiled spring or even maybe

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.859 
this this coiled spring or even maybe
like<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.740> piano<00:01:58.740> hammer<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.790> falls<00:02:00.149> so

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
like the piano hammer that falls so

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.560 
like the piano hammer that falls so
it's<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.990> similar<00:02:03.580> it's<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.729> similar<00:02:05.150> release

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
it's a similar it's a similar release

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.870 
it's a similar it's a similar release
and<00:02:06.080> that's<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.970> percussive<00:02:09.700> nature<00:02:10.700> of

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
and that's the the percussive nature of

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.610 
and that's the the percussive nature of
the<00:02:11.000> way<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.450> string<00:02:11.930> thought<00:02:12.380> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
the way that the string thought the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.770 
the way that the string thought the
finger<00:02:13.040> falls<00:02:13.310> on<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.640> string<00:02:13.910> also<00:02:14.270> starts

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
finger falls on the string also starts

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.830 
finger falls on the string also starts
the<00:02:15.110> string<00:02:15.920> vibrating<00:02:16.370> which<00:02:17.090> helps<00:02:17.510> again

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
the string vibrating which helps again

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.880 
the string vibrating which helps again
with<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.110> nice<00:02:18.350> clean<00:02:18.800> articulation<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.890> try

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
with a nice clean articulation so try

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.949 
with a nice clean articulation so try
both<00:02:22.310> doing<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:23.000> reality<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.400> try

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
both doing it in reality and try

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.390 
both doing it in reality and try
visualizing<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:27.140> really<00:02:27.709> hard<00:02:27.950> it's<00:02:28.190> not<00:02:28.250> a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
visualizing it really hard it's not a

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.550 
visualizing it really hard it's not a
passive<00:02:28.850> exercise<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.690> visualization

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
passive exercise the visualization

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.440 
passive exercise the visualization
excess<00:02:31.130> exercise<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:31.880> actually<00:02:32.209> really

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
excess exercise it's actually really

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.509 
excess exercise it's actually really
it's<00:02:32.989> kind<00:02:33.349> of<00:02:33.410> in<00:02:33.560> some<00:02:33.769> ways<00:02:33.950> harder<00:02:34.370> than

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
it's kind of in some ways harder than

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.199 
it's kind of in some ways harder than
than<00:02:35.450> doing<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.840> really<00:02:36.640> I'm<00:02:37.640> going<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.030> talk

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
than doing it really I'm going to talk

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.630 
than doing it really I'm going to talk
about<00:02:38.319> visualization<00:02:39.319> in<00:02:39.410> another<00:02:39.680> another
