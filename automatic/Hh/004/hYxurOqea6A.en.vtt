 the apparatus to eat ii stage now you often 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.760
 UAH is the factor that effects 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.460
 3 but if 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.360
 habit step is given

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.530
 among the dead they are not needed anymore 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.799

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.880
 voivodina clubs performance 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.760

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.180

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.750
 and what for this 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.940
 but rf, I know that it did not give 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.790
 this is a long-standing residence 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.270
 why not 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.789
 the case here can already be with his pony 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:00.950
 not 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.170
 shelter 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.170
 I was scared 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.719

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.989
 afanasyev it all 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.989

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.699
 tea and 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.519
 crew colossus 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.219
 all books he 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.659
 I'll go 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.819
 but who 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.319
 in vietnam so i just have some time 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.659
 searches 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.899
 here are butterflies 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.349
 the radar immediately went to Russia which is quite 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.779
 without Haev cis 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.789
 for foreign ports I do not understand 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.289
 so it became interesting to me 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.829
 share is now a riot these fashionable I decided 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.509
 explain why not 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.289
 so sick of feeling that 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:55.619
 chest he 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.369
 why not 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.139
 figase would be a clerk belt like this 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.249
 when 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:03.649
 and what we often think will even have to 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.469
 not how she will live 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.499
 Well, this data center 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:09.899
 this question 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:11.309
 and not even assures 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.399
 for major 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.619
 where did it appear 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:17.619
 Kay will sail 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.009
 I think the answer is the connection and the mother will not 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.289
 Sakhalinsk with see 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:57.689
 as for he said rams dollars i'm not 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:58.779
 was expecting 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:01.779
 so on sites 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.589
 iturup hand calls contact 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:10.359
 which they did mei in this party 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:14.099
 focus is prohibited 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.539
 tea I did not know about this 1 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.609
 hockey and it will remove 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.549
 if Putin would cheat 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.319
 okay, he has to answer hint 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:24.810
 this early on from the first versions 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.789
 bankruptcy 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.539
 but as I complete the kayani 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.520
 kaspersky son we briefly i found out 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.010
 one only with release ie version 1 dot 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:35.770
 0 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.919
 well and what a tubule like some yes 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.179
 but 1 but it seems to me almost the most 

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:44.759
 best and all because all the same it's like 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.509
 nothing like how they lived modestly 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.520
 there is a sense of very cool stuff 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.889
 Now comment in the bag 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.219
 diving keeps records we know who as 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:55.439

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.929
 rub add which do 

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:00.540
 sajad we don't like ourselves 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.350
 for some reason nobody changes and not 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.659
 Baku like this effect 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.780
 and so what do we do so on shift 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:10.330
 not even just why the archive 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.470
 urgent need to be some stones 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.900
 so now we will make ourselves 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.949
 paddle 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.449
 little sticks 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.870
 that will destroy that 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.400
 paddle 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.160
 then this series will be small it may 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.000
