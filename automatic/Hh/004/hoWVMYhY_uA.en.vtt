here in Washington your nation's capital

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:42.709 
here in Washington your nation's capital

anyway so don't buy them if you do you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.760 
anyway so don't buy them if you do you
better<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:43.500> prepared<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:45.500> or<00:00:46.500> whatever

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
better be prepared to like or whatever

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.950 
better be prepared to like or whatever
because<00:00:47.160> they're<00:00:47.550> gonna<00:00:47.670> mold<00:00:50.780> they're<00:00:51.780> not

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
because they're gonna mold they're not

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:09.880 
because they're gonna mold they're not
muffins<00:00:52.440> because<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.399> muffin<00:00:54.210> has<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> top

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:29.770 

marketing<00:01:10.890> wisdom<00:01:26.000> that's<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.180> Costco<00:01:27.540> is

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.539 

so<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> guess<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.380> their<00:01:31.560> marketing<00:01:32.100> wisdom

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
so I guess in their marketing wisdom

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:51.740 
so I guess in their marketing wisdom
they<00:01:32.700> decided<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:46.310> convex<00:01:50.210> but<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.390> not<00:01:51.570> it's

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
they decided to convex but it's not it's

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:01.010 
they decided to convex but it's not it's
and<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.439> would<00:01:53.040> assume<00:01:53.130> they're<00:01:53.490> probably<00:02:00.020> when

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
and I would assume they're probably when

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.580 
and I would assume they're probably when
I<00:02:01.049> eat<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> muffin<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:03.590> advocating

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
I eat a muffin like if you advocating

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.750 
I eat a muffin like if you advocating
that<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.979> buy<00:02:05.159> Starbucks<00:02:05.549> muffin<00:02:06.149> over

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
that you buy Starbucks muffin over

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.870 
that you buy Starbucks muffin over
for<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:06.970> Costco<00:02:07.480> muffin<00:02:08.140> but<00:02:08.979> when<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.670> go<00:02:09.820> to

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
for a Costco muffin but when I go to

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.370 
for a Costco muffin but when I go to
Starbucks<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.450> get<00:02:10.600> one<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.869> their<00:02:10.990> muffins

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
Starbucks and get one of their muffins

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:26.370 
Starbucks and get one of their muffins
which<00:02:11.620> has<00:02:11.860> someplace<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.910> see<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.780> get<00:02:25.990> you

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
which has someplace you see you get you

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.630 
which has someplace you see you get you
get<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:27.210> top<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.750> can<00:02:28.930> actually<00:02:29.640> like

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:51.300 

cake<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:05.140> guess<00:03:06.990> it's<00:03:07.990> kind<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.230> pasty

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.650 

I<00:03:51.850> don't<00:03:52.660> need<00:03:52.780> 12<00:03:53.170> but<00:03:53.590> they<00:03:53.680> sure<00:03:53.860> look<00:03:53.890> good

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
I don't need 12 but they sure look good

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.010 
I don't need 12 but they sure look good
they're<00:03:55.660> just<00:03:55.690> okay<00:03:56.050> they're<00:03:56.530> not<00:03:56.680> great
