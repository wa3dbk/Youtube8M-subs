00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.680
 one of the fairly frequently asked 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.500
 questions that guys ask me 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.020
 network for automatic 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.020
 tensioner pilot should not put it 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.800
 it's worth it to put 0 and so on, but I already 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.619
 did somehow review on this thing but 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.290
 is in the video for disassembling it 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.839
 rock engine there roller minutes for 50 and 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.960
 at the end he I literally spend two minutes 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:42.690
 This pilot therefore who saw who not 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.539
 saw therefore I decided to make a separate 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:53.940
 video and briefly tell 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:57.890
 your thoughts so here he is our pilot as 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:03.719
 have a box of 25 years warranty 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:09.630
 installation instructions and normal 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.679
 tensioner regular system you so if 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.920
 compare them in length 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:17.009
 approximately estimate but it will be by eye 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.819
 it is clear that the pilot is a little bit longer 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.000
 Of course, this moment was taken into account. 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:26.280
 time here put an extension cord on these 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.670
 But on the nose it was still possible 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.289
 its length is not the point here 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.550
 the idea here is she the pilot that is he 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.709
 it develops here it is in my 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.160
 initial position and now let's 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:46.649
 pay attention to this thing 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.039
 he must have missed his teeth 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.420
 there is a good play that is it 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.550
 there is a backlash but he does not jump but 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.390
 there is a free wheeling and only when 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.759
 too much to have something more 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.099
 becomes play on the chain 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.369
 wear out let's say or shoe prodyad 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.979
 he stupidly jumps and jumps but 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.819
 this is the position he still has 5 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.250
 backlash that is, the mechanism is this one 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.540
 provides chain stretch due 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.690
 In principle, that is, in general, he is all 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.270
 equals here it is 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.130
 backlash from all this I am this one this one 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.000
 backlash is equivalent to having a chain 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.340
 released 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.140
 and he must chain so much 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.540
 get loose so he jumped on 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.570
 the next step and still on 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.030
 the next rung he again has that 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.650
 the same gap 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.260
 so when you install this thing here 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.900
 the engine rattles the valve circuit 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.300
 governed youths thunders and this one 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.660
 legends appear that here's the motor 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.390
 classics he's noisy on all things here in 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.600
 of these here we say innovations and 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.130
 that's even in full stretched condition 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.220
 here you can see about 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.010
 even more than a millimeter here this elevator 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.680
 so here it is the device itself 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.480
 design in theory it should work 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.850
 as an automatic tensioner but by 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.850
 the fact that what is produced is made 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:23.200
 practice it does not work and the nation does not 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.320
 stretches so with such a tensioner in 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.410
 you chain will rattle on the car 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.790
 constantly regardless of the new chain and 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:37.690
 stars old star target no difference 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.230
 so I tell everyone that I am not 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.590
 I recommend to put such here 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.030
 tensioners better than standard VAZ 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.180
 tensioner there is nothing here 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.959
 gear shoe that's another thing he 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.090
 really useful and this thing to 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.470
 unfortunately the construction is crude 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.620
 unfinished in this video I 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.540
 demonstrated 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.880
 for Chery but also a pilot device which 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.390
 took off with a car and who shares 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.580
 cars bought it in 2011 new 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.070
 they initially set crime lacie 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.790
 and when I took apart what I saw 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.010
 took off so that there was no reason to say that I 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.280
 do someone anti-advertising or there are bad 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.520
 reviews specifically 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.250
 pouring mud various innovations here is 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.950
 what i showed here is this thing here it has 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.320
 such elevators on it work me like that 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.930
 here they wrote that when the new pilot 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.910
 he is new he is good there is no any 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.090
 backlash everything works fine so 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.520
 so that there are no empty charges 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.230
 that I'm not showing something 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.380
 something not only can you please 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.710
 show me send or though 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.930
 would show on the video here is the same pilot 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.960
 which does not have such sheets does not have 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.919
 such constructive flaws 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.919
 thank you for attention
