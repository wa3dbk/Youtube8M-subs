00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
cool things I think I have been using

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.780 
cool things I think I have been using
this<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.620> don't<00:02:37.799> use<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.159> very<00:02:38.220> much<00:02:38.579> but

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
this I don't use this very much but

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.490 
this I don't use this very much but
those<00:02:38.939> are<00:02:39.120> two<00:02:39.420> really<00:02:39.720> good<00:02:40.019> sources<00:02:40.379> of

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
those are two really good sources of

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.129 
those are two really good sources of
information<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.430> my<00:02:42.120> last<00:02:42.450> perler<00:02:42.959> bead

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139 
information and my last perler bead

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.069 
information and my last perler bead
supplies<00:02:43.709> tools<00:02:44.310> are<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.359> this<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.720> we

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
supplies tools are is of this and we

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.479 
supplies tools are is of this and we
actually<00:02:46.409> have<00:02:46.500> two<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.739> them<00:02:46.920> I'm<00:02:47.099> not<00:02:47.310> really

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
actually have two of them I'm not really

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.699 
actually have two of them I'm not really
oh<00:02:47.760> right<00:02:48.209> here<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.109> we<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.290> two<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.590> them

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
oh right here so we have two of them

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.020 
oh right here so we have two of them
actually<00:02:49.950> they<00:02:50.250> got<00:02:50.340> on<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.579> sunny<00:02:50.819> days

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
actually they got on the sunny days

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.849 
actually they got on the sunny days
packet<00:02:51.569> so<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.319> just<00:02:52.500> much<00:02:52.680> easier

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
packet so this is just much easier

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.679 
packet so this is just much easier
because<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.459> bases<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.939> pick<00:02:54.180> up<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.359> pearler

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
because the bases can pick up a pearler

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.300 
because the bases can pick up a pearler
beads<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.079> it's<00:02:55.500> easier<00:02:55.829> especially<00:02:55.950> if

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
beads and it's easier especially if

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.339 
beads and it's easier especially if
you're<00:02:56.430> doing<00:02:56.609> big<00:02:57.269> designs<00:02:57.659> and<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.139> just

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
you're doing big designs and you just

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.379 
you're doing big designs and you just
put<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.709> on<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.069> it's<00:02:59.189> so<00:02:59.489> much<00:02:59.669> easier<00:02:59.909> and

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
put it on it and it's so much easier and

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.879 
put it on it and it's so much easier and
makes<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.989> like<00:03:01.200> easy<00:03:01.379> especially<00:03:01.620> for

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
makes it like easy especially for

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.369 
makes it like easy especially for
beginners<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.700> for<00:03:02.879> toddlers<00:03:03.299> tip<00:03:03.599> first<00:03:04.139> i

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379
