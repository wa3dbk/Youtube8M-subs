00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.369
 well we have already learned to make a 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.279
 movie with the mobile now when you 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.779

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.340
 trailer let's see what a trailer is 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.619
 already knowing how a movie is made 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.509
 Well, you are going to see that it is very simple and 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.779
 brings a series of templates that are left 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.770
 Pretty cool you are going to see these are 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.770
 the templates that have 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:41.480
 trailers of ai movie are trailers 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.480
 for cinema type cinema no 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.890
 We can see 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.250
 adrenaline bollywood will be in plan 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.250
 action 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.320
 good on the basis of the trailers what 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.690
 let's create we choose a template and 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.850
 based on that, then we're going to design the 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.690
 cool trailer album we are going to do this 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.690
 as a teenager 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.220
 we have here now the screen is 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.470
 quite different from how we had it 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.660
 before with imovie but you will see that it 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.690
 it seems the title here we say it's already arrived 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.940
 the summer so here we are going to change it 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.710
 we put all this is edited and then 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.330
 we change all the names and everything 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.330
 that we want to put in our video 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.970
 this is to fill in all the data 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.970
 as if it were a movie 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.319
 as I did here I interpreted all this 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.319
 it would be filled we can put 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.569
 here we would put the name 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.650
 you can choose this 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.640
 the galaxy you can choose the incoming 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.640
 different 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.120
 once we have already filled all this 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.700
 template here that we liked that 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.489
 we have been filling in with the things that 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.819
 we want us as you see then we 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.769
 let's go here you see we have the part 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.500
 left what is what we have to 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.900
 go filling in to complete in 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.329
 trailer then tells us with seconds 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.769
 what each part lasts to know what 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:00.120
 we have to select if we click 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.530
 here we get the reel and we have all 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.290
 the videos here are the ones in the video 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.359
 that I rode before and we have the videos that 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.810
 I already had recorded would have to 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.390
 select a small part of the video 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.350
 that you do not like 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.350
 they indicate us 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.920
 the size it has 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.099
 Well, we can 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.680
 choose here we give the arrow the 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.440
 left and here it would already be added as 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.590
 you see 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.450
 so when we have filled this 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.980
 first part we go to the second the 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.630
 title of the second section of 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.520
 trailer says the holidays start 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.080
 like my video just not from 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.070
 vacation, what we put is 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.070
 another title 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.599
 and now here something of 15 seconds 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.420
 and the project is passed 15 seconds 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.459
 we take another section we select 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.819
 and we go to the part of the video that we 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.819
 like 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.440
 If we pass it, then you see a little 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.860
 little if we give the play let's see 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.050
 how is the project 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.969
 always displayed the part of 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.169
 history lessons 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.169
 in the part of 1 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.820
 i 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.940
 and 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.230
 clicking here I realize that what 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.340
 written wrong then then I go back to 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.340
 press and changes 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.469
 if we see that something we do not like we can 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:05.860
 select the clip and within the video 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:07.960
 it looks for us where what would be focused then 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.349
 in this case I want you to see this 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.349
 part 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.570
 I tell him to accept 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.570
 and ready 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.940
 good and once we have filled 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.190
 all the sections that we have with the 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.430
 letters and all the holes we can 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.560
 fill it as we said both with 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.780
 photos or videos and we have done the 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.870
 summary with all the data that we want 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.150
 put is as simple as power 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.940
 enjoy the trailer and you will see what 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.969
 is in a very professional way and I 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.449
 it has taken nothing 10 minutes 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.219
 in this case it seems of movies and 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.379
 I only made it based on some 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:56.009
 few photos and videos that I recorded is a 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:56.009
 only day in class 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:28.490
 once we have already done the project 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:30.710
 that we have enjoyed, we are going to the 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.139
 back arrow and the project is us 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:36.199
 saves automatically what we have in 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:38.869
 our project gallery and it's like 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:41.779
 previously explained with the mobile or what 

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:44.419
 we can see with the movies what 

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:47.149
 we can see or share it with that 

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:50.149
 that we want then in this case and 

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:51.559
 we decided and you see that we can make 

00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:53.869
 a quick way to any project 

00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:56.419
 video and show people how 

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:58.129
 we were working or also tell 

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:00.559
 the children who carry out these projects 

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:02.029
 of video and they look pretty good and then 

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:04.999
 they can present their work 

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:08.439
 this good way anything else already 

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:08.439
 you know where you have a greeting
