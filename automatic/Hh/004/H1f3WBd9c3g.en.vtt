00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.450
 Hello and welcome to enjoyment

 imagine that turned back on 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.540
 Today we make a delicious 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.759
 cold dog but not classic 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.130
 but one with raspberries and whiter 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.560
 chocolate too perfect too 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.570
 We give away for Valentine's Day and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.750
 Mother's Day and I'll show you 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.180
 first what she needs so the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.660
 Of course you need white chocolate then 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.370
 a bit of milk butterkeks volker 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.390
 Butter biscuits taken coconut fat 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.980
 frozen raspberries you can with 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.739
 there are always fresh ones over there 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.170
 no fresh a bit sugar and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.910
 a bit of water and first if 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.840
 we first the image to a sauce 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.960
 to process 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.430
 how that works I show you now me 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.620
 I already have a pot here today 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.620
 put and go there with the 1 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:13.340
 the water and the sugar all 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.440
 we can now first on roads yes 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:25.520
 So stir here it is from time to time 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:29.120
 times by the people now easily that 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:35.660
 let you now a bit to cook 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:39.200
 so to have about five minutes then 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.450
 many see so I have ten now 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.070
 minutes to break now the whole 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.270
 beautiful luck become liquid 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.640
 Now you have a short moment 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.140
 emphasize that by a sieve like that 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.020
 I now have the skies around 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.869
 count and let cool and give 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.490
 I now see through the step here 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.220
 Of course you can spare yourself too 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.950
 if you if you do not mind it 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.130
 but I personally recognize you 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.310
 Not at all like when the sieves 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.310
 depressed 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.860
 you have to sauce your nuts about now 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.320
 look and I'm already up to date 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.820
 placed in which water is made warm 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.570
 of course have the bowl on it now 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.570
 he gives the milk 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.990
 and the chocolate 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.320
 and the rossfeld 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.920
 This may now only be in peace 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.520
 down 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:13.210
 it all melts a homogeneous mass 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:16.000
 so the mass now like 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.830
 Everything is bound to be clear 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.390
 quiet a little bit of time for such a thing 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.820
 now has half an hour 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.310
 lasted until everything melted for you 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:29.050
 is and now if we are the story 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.880
 so I have the form now 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.370
 I put the silicone bad 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.470
 form if yes have no you submit 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.950
 before with fresh foil and 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.560
 baking paper so that the cake then 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.930
 can also be overthrown later and for 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.930
 children better with a layer of cream 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.560
 and then put the parcels on it 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.130
 oh so the shape is about 25 cm long 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.880
 So after you have the biscuits midnight 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.320
 there is still a layer of cream and so on 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:26.420
 it will continue to be the customer story 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.370
 everything consumes it, it looks like that 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.250
 when it finished layered is important 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.440
 that their layer with a pixilated 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.360
 ceases to be a new stable ground 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.350
 because then you will later on the head 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.230
 trodden completely in the 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.720
 fridge to festwirt and I would 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.760
 say four hours for three 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.610
 at least improves over night 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.870
 if you would do that evening then 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.600
 I say put in the fridge now 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.270
 to see us then when he is done like that 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.160
 I have the cold dog out of the now 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.770
 refrigerator brings theoretically would he 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.690
 Of course now finished but I want 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.860
 decorate a bit more 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.620
 That's why I have mine 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.939
 yes still so white quarters merged 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.250
 cover 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:22.849
 and then I'm still so sugar 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.849
 Cordial with those decorated the country 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.540
 so i have finished decorating there now 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.200
 Now off and then you would be quick times 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.800
 we look from the inside it looks like it 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.800
 folds 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:10.080
 yes, it looks like that , so I hope so 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.699
 video you liked if there goes 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.249
 it a thumbs up but 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.289
 and I think it's a really nice one 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:19.379
 idea before something different than that 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:24.119
 classic cold spot although just 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:28.289
 powerful but what was hiding was mine 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:30.239
 Tuesdays and Nuremberg just appetite a lot 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.749
 succeed and imitate and until the 

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:32.749
 next time
