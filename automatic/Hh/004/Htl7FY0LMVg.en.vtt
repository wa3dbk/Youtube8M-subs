 fashion magazine panthers application interview

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.970
 Technique 2 I only have one year 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.750
 and then I can do it 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.790
 what I want 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.110
 I would be a journalist 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.000
 not petty need ten or 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.390
 fifteen ruttgers rotted bored 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.950
 she ask someone else with her 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.430
 so may the bible ask his question 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.210
 okay hello where are my eggs 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.210
 dessous 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.670
 a million women would for this 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.549
 job I said come come of the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.060
 animales engage the intelligent fat 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.759
 girl 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.920
 she hates me I knew we knew you 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.380
 could have helped me once i am 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.360
 desperately knows it is tragic 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.240
 I would live with cream and that 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.890
 fishing line underallis device i am 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.340
 still the same ones have better part 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.560
 open 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.250
 I thought the old ones were great 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.640
 that's how he shoots I'm only left 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.640
 a name 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.330
 I'm so sorry about my privacy 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.680
 at the moment a thread 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.450
 that's what happens when you succeed in your job 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.170
 Assessing modest privacy says 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.920
 down the drain 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.450
 then it will be time for a promotion 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.250
 You know why I'm very set 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.840
 I have discovered a great deal of myself 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.230
 People believe that the success of 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.120
 alone does the good do not want them 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.120
 this life is your decision 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.010
 I must still home so 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.690
 please it is only the film of 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.760
 devil wears prada is for me the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.280
 absolute final resurrection 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.230
 from meryl streep since then she is back 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.510
 so fat in the business and the younger 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.760
 Target group finally knows them and that 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.220
 completely right because without meryl 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.190
 streep would not even be this movie 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.920
 worth half as much as it brings 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.069
 easy in every scene with every eye 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.040
 Beat this nasty this violent one 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.600
 Business oriented thinking about you 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.320
 is really an absolute beast and 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.930
 embodied in the film nr wintour though 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.970
 just loosely apply quite officially 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.400
 They never say I'm reminded of 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.200
 the original vogue from America but 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.420
 Everyone knows that also the book template 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.220
 is exactly what the name-based live 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.110
 but just deliberately changed and there 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.910
 you can see how some tick 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.040
 business people you can but also one 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.660
 a little bit behind the facade comes 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.440
 only if the protagonists then 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.750
 also to let 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.019
 this is really great in general is the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.000
 film is not that unbelievable 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.070
 strong because the story is relative 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.260
 is known as a bit Cinderella 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.360
 in modern times hathaway looks only 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.250
 completely fucked out then she is 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.200
 but in fashion imperium and will open 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.360
 once to have beautiful swan 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.160
 we've seen everything as well as 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.690
 the insights into the industry itself 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.329
 in my opinion a bit too 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.670
 I'm seeing clichés 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.549
 not a single intelligent one 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.110
 model in the movie as well as all types 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.970
 gay it may be that there completely 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.459
 Video games are also 90 of me 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.320
 but not all, especially me all 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.120
 so blatant and this reproach goes 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.940
 By the way, not to stanley tucci because he 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.269
 does his thing as extreme pink 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.549
 Dyeed consultants extremely good but that 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.500
 are just figures in there as well as the 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.789
 figurine of the christian thompson played by 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.010
 stephen baker is just like that 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.140
 difficult from the first second on there 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.060
 I know okay boy you are only 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.010
 lay flat so there are too many 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.350
 cliché then that is worked 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.160
 is somehow real at some places 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.440
 a bit tired 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.080
 but the art of the whole is similar 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.970
 if you look consciously and that 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.010
 You can also go through your head 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.600
 then come on this cliché 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.720
 the weaknesses of the film that's why 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.310
 that is massive but that does not matter 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.920
 because, for example, meryl streep as well 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.380
 Unbelievably strong is that the outside 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.060
 can be before or is 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.340
 do not cloud the entertainment value because 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.650
 This film is very entertaining 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.420
 not boring at all 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.420
 his has a fantastic narrative speed 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.740
 and do everything right 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.270
 entertainment cinema makes that important 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.610
 you can just let it run like that 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.040
 Right now for you eating on the sofa 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.450
 a perfect movie for sunday evening itself 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.880
 sprinkle on one side 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.320
 the other side such a bad one 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.690
 media criticism that works on everyone 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.790
 case and, interestingly, we have 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.310
 found that quite a lot of men to 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.930
 movie also very much like it though 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.930
 actually a classic women's movie 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.610
 is just fashion then we change ourselves 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.590
 want to realize ourselves and 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.250
 extremely many women in the main roles 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.600
 However, it is clear to me that 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.070
 Men are therefore addressed because 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.440
 meryl streep so the one in the après 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.980
 Ski reminds a typical male role 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.840
 This patriarch's boss in the armchair 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.640
 who sits where everyone else says 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.200
 somehow long and where we go for too long 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.060
 have run and that's why it works 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.190
 I think that's very good, too 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.470
 the film because of heating and attitude 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.810
 really very very very very good 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.210
 works despite the unique 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.560
 weaken 10 points at meryl 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.419
 streep is just so gigantic that 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.700
 you must have seen the movie 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.200
 But he just has his weaknesses because he 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.080
 too obvious is too many clichés 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.970
 for gigantic good acting one 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.650
 great soundtrack and also very much 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.669
 nice costumes if you're upset 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.990
 to become a tailor 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.780
 you probably look at that 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.580
 devil applies prada about 1000 times 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.400
 that was my revier to the devil wears 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.289
 prada of you I want to know where would 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.639
 you like it 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.199
 do a traineeship except the 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.990
 filmfabrik that does not want that 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.479
 everyone still has a thumb around it 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.889
 if you liked the review and 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.629
 even if through the whole execution and 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.849
 all the stuff is written as well 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:42.710
 gladly alone because I talked otherwise 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.719
 want to have from earlier 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.059
 We'll see you both soon 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:48.860
 new film criticism but before references 

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:49.219
 I like to keep that down here 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.319
 Left 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:53.089
 maybe the reviews tomorrow 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:54.770
 you can see if you say you want it 

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:56.330
 currently you would prefer to see what what 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.309
 Now in the cinema is running then look 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.719
 Go in here or see you now 

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:01.279
 characterized finally adopting 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:03.349
 make us back here soon 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:06.520
 film factory with a new film review 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:06.520
 with me the dominik
