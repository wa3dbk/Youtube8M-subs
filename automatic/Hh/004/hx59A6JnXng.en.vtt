00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
until the commentator was a little bit

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.290 
until the commentator was a little bit
more<00:00:16.769> bland<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.099> was<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.400> now<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.939> might<00:00:18.119> upload

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300

more bland I was like now I might upload
that<00:00:18.599> so<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.080> decided<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.830> go<00:00:19.949> ahead<00:00:20.039> and

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
that so I decided to go ahead and

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.249 
that so I decided to go ahead and
commentate<00:00:20.789> over<00:00:20.939> because<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.720> think<00:00:21.839> this

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
commentate over because I think this

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:23.839 
commentate over because I think this
Way's<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> little<00:00:22.800> bit<00:00:22.890> much<00:00:23.130> better<00:00:23.429> for<00:00:23.730> this

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
with it so let me go in to find a rate

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.910 
with it so let me go in to find a rate
right<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.990> looks<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.619> found<00:01:58.740> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
right now and it looks like we found a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.219 
right now and it looks like we found a
raid<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.340> now<00:01:59.490> magic<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.210> editing

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
raid right now magic of editing

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.120 
raid right now magic of editing
so<00:02:01.820> we<00:02:02.820> found<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.119> right<00:02:03.270> right<00:02:03.539> now<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.130> he

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
so we found this right right now and he

so we found this right right now and he
only<00:02:05.460> has<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> little<00:02:06.270> bit<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.479> elixirs<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
only has a little bit of elixirs but it

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.300 
only has a little bit of elixirs but it
doesn't<00:02:07.619> really<00:02:07.770> matter<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.039> we're<00:02:08.190> gonna

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
doesn't really matter so we're gonna

rate<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.900> tried<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.260> get<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.530> most<00:02:40.829> elixir<00:02:41.489> as

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
rate I tried to get the most elixir as

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.039 
rate I tried to get the most elixir as
possible<00:02:42.090> because<00:02:42.209> obviously<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.840> rate

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
possible because obviously this rate

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.190 
possible because obviously this rate
didn't<00:02:43.319> have<00:02:43.500> any<00:02:43.829> and<00:02:44.190> yes<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.989> should

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
didn't have any and yes so that should

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.319 
didn't have any and yes so that should
be<00:02:46.290> for<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.530> rate<00:02:46.739> we<00:02:47.220> still<00:02:47.730> got<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> prison

pretty<00:03:50.849> insane<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.450> that's<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.720> last<00:03:52.049> star

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
pretty insane and that's the last star

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.259 
pretty insane and that's the last star
for<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.620> achievement<00:03:52.819> obviously<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:53.940> next

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
for that achievement obviously the next

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.180 
for that achievement obviously the next
uh<00:03:54.420> trophy<00:03:54.930> achievement<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.440> think<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.829> like<00:03:56.040> to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
uh trophy achievement I think is like to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.289 
uh trophy achievement I think is like to
get<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.459> Crystal<00:03:56.819> Lake<00:03:56.910> or<00:03:57.060> something<00:03:57.239> like

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
get to Crystal Lake or something like

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.979 
get to Crystal Lake or something like
that<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.769> yeah<00:03:58.769> so<00:03:59.120> that<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.450> for<00:04:00.480> those

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
that and yeah so that is it for those

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.319 
that and yeah so that is it for those
achievements<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.040> we<00:04:02.099> still<00:04:02.790> have<00:04:02.910> one<00:04:03.180> more

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
achievements and we still have one more

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
builder which I did not forget about and

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.069 
builder which I did not forget about and
I'll<00:04:05.639> sort<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.880> see<00:04:06.030> what<00:04:06.239> we<00:04:06.359> can<00:04:06.510> do<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.840> so

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
enough gold and what I want to do is I

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.450 
enough gold and what I want to do is I
want<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.650> do<00:04:25.800> two<00:04:26.130> walls<00:04:26.520> two<00:04:27.360> walls<00:04:27.600> only<00:04:28.110> and

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
want to do two walls two walls only and

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.560 
want to do two walls two walls only and
then<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.700> air<00:04:29.880> defense<00:04:30.180> because<00:04:30.420> obviously

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
then the air defense because obviously

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.150 
then the air defense because obviously
the<00:04:30.900> air<00:04:31.050> defense<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.500> level<00:04:31.710> 3<00:04:31.920> and<00:04:32.070> we<00:04:32.130> have

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
the air defense is level 3 and we have

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.070 
the air defense is level 3 and we have
vulnerable<00:04:32.640> for<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.510> I<00:04:33.570> want<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.780> go<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.020> do

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
vulnerable for so I want to go and do

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.690 
vulnerable for so I want to go and do
that<00:04:34.260> last<00:04:34.620> air<00:04:34.890> defense<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.310> then<00:04:35.430> we<00:04:35.520> can

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
that last air defense and then we can

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.790 
that last air defense and then we can
start<00:04:35.880> going<00:04:36.150> them<00:04:36.480> to<00:04:36.840> about<00:04:37.020> five<00:04:37.260> obviously

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
start going them to about five obviously

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.530 
start going them to about five obviously
I<00:04:37.950> think<00:04:38.310> that's<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.730> max<00:04:39.030> for<00:04:39.240> them<00:04:39.330> so

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
I think that's the max for them so

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.720 
I think that's the max for them so
before<00:04:40.140> we<00:04:40.200> do<00:04:40.320> that's<00:04:40.470> two<00:04:40.950> walls<00:04:41.220> obviously

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
before we do that's two walls obviously

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.550 
before we do that's two walls obviously
we<00:04:42.240> stopping<00:04:42.600> off<00:04:42.690> for<00:04:42.720> one<00:04:42.960> wall<00:04:43.200> right<00:04:43.530> here

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
we stopping off for one wall right here

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.070 
we stopping off for one wall right here
I<00:04:44.280> think<00:04:44.640> I<00:04:44.760> forgot<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.150> was<00:04:45.270> like<00:04:45.390> oh<00:04:45.510> yeah<00:04:45.810> one

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
I think I forgot I was like oh yeah one

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.580 
I think I forgot I was like oh yeah one
wrong<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:46.950> right<00:04:47.640> here<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:48.810> then<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.440> air

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
wrong so right here and then the air

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.960 
wrong so right here and then the air
defense<00:04:49.830> right<00:04:49.980> here<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.460> should<00:04:50.880> be

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
defense right here so that should be

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.000 
defense right here so that should be
guys<00:04:51.210> for<00:04:51.690> this<00:04:51.810> episode<00:04:52.290> we<00:04:52.320> have<00:04:52.590> zero
