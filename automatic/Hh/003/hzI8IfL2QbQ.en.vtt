 channel josh wilkie in 1989 and in this 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.390
 Occasion I bring you sony ketchup or sony 4 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.950
 for the pf in Spanish will be the links 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.320
 will be down there is a single link if 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.230
 this mega 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.599
 let's start this seems to them is a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.599
 winrar file starts more than 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.220
 if it looks like 321 megas 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.710
 At the moment that it weighs on the dam this 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.780
 folder then of this folder 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.850
 two files appear 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.170
 this file is very important to some 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.150
 people will work with this 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.670
 because they are already installed or 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.910
 installed and other people work 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.290
 because they will need this west plugin 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.510
 of the good one to put this 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.660
 file for this file go 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.790
 directly to the computer to the disk 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.020
 Here we will teach you how to 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.460
 team is team after local we are 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:12.259
 let's go to windows 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:14.000
 there are 32 32 and here they stick it here what 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.690
 we can do it here 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.200
 I already have it here 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.200
 I'm cheating 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:34.700
 from 3 x 9 for what I already having in 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.770
 account and paying attention is a good we are going to 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.770
 this folder that these are and 4 x 2 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.799
 and they will give 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.000
 here 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.550
 and extra the goat 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.020
 the game well the settings can you 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.910
 put the type of suit they have if 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.290
 they have 234 what you want 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.700
 added the only one they have 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.330
 appears not going to give them last night in me 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.180
 as you can see, I do not have to pull 2400 h 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.090
 promise here in the resolution as you 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.800
 they want to put big 720 like you 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.870
 they want to put him and in full screen 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.530
 the moment that they are going to start playing 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.440
 if it's going to appear in full screen in 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.230
 player here the player 1 games is 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.709
 can play 2 I imagine what I played 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.709
 from one like that 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.720
 the keyboard here an important fact not 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.490
 the will grab any control 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.130
 in this any hand any world 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.410
 human this 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.700
 here it is mandatory to use one of 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.190
 xbox 360 or xbox 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.069
 I work for him I have no 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.920
 ours that use the keyboard that already 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.480
 has had all this if this one exists the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.340
 we will give you language in playing at 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.340
 configuration and insertion and 4 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.880
 they hope this is going well 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.120
 how are we doing 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.220
 we are at stake 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.410
 a border let's see how it's going 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.870
 they fly away as they can see the mail 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.490
 great as long as they have what 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.000
 necessary on my computer is an intel 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.820
 core 2 dual core 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.980
 and I have 3 gigas of ram so I do not 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.980
 it gives me problems like 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:43.720
 we will also see who is better and 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.470
 If they have more, this resource will be 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.580
 you will see much better 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.580
 also what there is 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.500
 let's move on 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.770
 they were from this 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.220
 I think if they have a weapons command the 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.810
 game since it has a clear niche more 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.110
 difficult but if you think you're capable of 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.740
 play it with keyboard forward a thousand times 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.740
 I would recommend 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.930
 the command 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.770
 are reaching the end of the game of 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.770
 level 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.230
 this is how you can see is running from 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.600
 wonder there are no faults there is no chs 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.180
 nothing 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.260
 As I say, you have to have the 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.520
 resources needed to be able to function 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.660
 why 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.660
 then it goes wonderfully 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.440
 here is half difficult 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.100
 I despair because I can not play well 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.880
 without a command as I say I can see 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.110
 with controls and will enjoy them will go 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.300
 to have a better experience than with a 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.120
 keyboard and well there you are 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.690
 we also with their own eyes is 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.690
 running well 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.090
 and we won the first level 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.930
 two days 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:27.389
 with closing this what 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.110
 already to arrive if any doubt or 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.930
 anything that had happened to him 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.310
 tell me again in the comments 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.410
 and then now because more than telling 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.580
 have a good time, take care of yourself and we 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.580
 we see in the following video
