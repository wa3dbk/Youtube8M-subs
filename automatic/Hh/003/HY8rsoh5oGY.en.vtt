that's kind of like trade routes in a

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.900 
that's kind of like trade routes in a
nutshell<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.740> then<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:28.010> can<00:04:28.190> also<00:04:28.340> send<00:04:28.820> them

nutshell and then you can also send them

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.719 
nutshell and then you can also send them
on<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:31.130> take<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.340> look<00:04:31.520> as<00:04:31.699> you<00:04:31.729> can<00:04:31.970> have<00:04:32.090> five

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
on you take a look as you can have five

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.159 
on you take a look as you can have five
ships<00:04:34.729> and<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.120> fleet<00:04:35.449> but<00:04:35.600> then<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.810> can<00:04:35.960> link

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
ships and a fleet but then you can link

together fleets and then make a group or
squadron<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:42.830> have<00:04:42.919> different<00:04:43.070> kinds<00:04:43.639> of

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
squadron and you have different kinds of

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.260 
squadron and you have different kinds of
ships<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:44.360> have<00:04:44.919> coastal<00:04:45.919> ships<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.610> they

ships you have coastal ships and they

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.020 
ships you have coastal ships and they
have<00:04:47.479> oceanic<00:04:48.110> ships<00:04:48.350> now<00:04:48.770> coastal<00:04:49.639> ships<00:04:49.850> can

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
have oceanic ships now coastal ships can

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.909 
have oceanic ships now coastal ships can
only<00:04:50.150> go<00:04:50.389> around<00:04:50.570> here<00:04:50.930> from<00:04:51.229> continent<00:04:51.860> from

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
only go around here from continent from

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.500 
only go around here from continent from
different<00:04:52.310> colonies<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:53.060> cannot<00:04:53.330> go

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
have a coastal ship in your fleet I

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.110 
have a coastal ship in your fleet I
found<00:04:57.800> that<00:04:57.889> out<00:04:58.039> to<00:04:58.160> heart<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.400> hard<00:04:58.610> way<00:04:58.789> I

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
found that out to heart the hard way I

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.870 
found that out to heart the hard way I
wanted<00:04:59.690> some<00:04:59.840> ships<00:05:00.050> in<00:05:00.200> a<00:05:00.260> battle<00:05:00.590> and<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:01.220> I

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
wanted some ships in a battle and and I

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.310 
wanted some ships in a battle and and I
could<00:05:01.940> have<00:05:02.150> here<00:05:02.210> why<00:05:02.419> can't<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.780> go<00:05:02.900> home<00:05:03.080> well

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
could have here why can't I go home well

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.820 
could have here why can't I go home well
that<00:05:03.470> was<00:05:03.590> why<00:05:04.990> also<00:05:05.990> you're<00:05:06.349> building<00:05:06.590> ships

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
that was why also you're building ships

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.250 
that was why also you're building ships
you<00:05:07.070> can<00:05:07.220> upgrade<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:08.090> do<00:05:08.599> some<00:05:08.750> upgrades<00:05:09.110> on

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
you can upgrade and do some upgrades on

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.719 
you can upgrade and do some upgrades on
them<00:05:09.530> it'll<00:05:09.740> cost<00:05:09.950> more<00:05:10.220> it'll<00:05:10.400> take<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.550> little

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
them it'll cost more it'll take a little

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.670 
them it'll cost more it'll take a little
longer<00:05:10.910> but<00:05:11.300> it's<00:05:11.450> often<00:05:11.630> worth<00:05:11.900> it<00:05:12.169> to<00:05:12.349> you

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
longer but it's often worth it to you

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.870 
longer but it's often worth it to you
know<00:05:12.800> get<00:05:12.979> better<00:05:13.130> hit<00:05:13.400> points<00:05:13.729> better

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
know get better hit points better

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.029 
know get better hit points better
maneuverability<00:05:15.250> things<00:05:16.250> like<00:05:16.490> that<00:05:18.039> okay

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
maneuverability things like that okay

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.760 
maneuverability things like that okay
and<00:05:19.160> there's<00:05:19.370> diplomacy<00:05:20.349> right<00:05:21.349> now<00:05:21.530> I'm

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
and there's diplomacy right now I'm

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.800 
and there's diplomacy right now I'm
ranked<00:05:22.099> number<00:05:22.130> five<00:05:24.580> and<00:05:25.580> that<00:05:25.849> fluctuates<00:05:26.510> I

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
ranked number five and that fluctuates I

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.270 
ranked number five and that fluctuates I
think<00:05:27.110> it's<00:05:27.200> because<00:05:27.410> I<00:05:27.440> don't<00:05:27.770> have<00:05:28.010> as<00:05:28.160> much

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
think it's because I don't have as much

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.279 
think it's because I don't have as much
gold<00:05:28.550> as<00:05:28.700> I<00:05:28.820> used<00:05:29.000> to<00:05:29.150> have<00:05:29.300> I<00:05:29.660> spent<00:05:30.050> a<00:05:30.139> lot<00:05:30.229> of

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
gold as I used to have I spent a lot of

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:31.420 
gold as I used to have I spent a lot of
money<00:05:30.410> upgrading<00:05:30.919> buildings<00:05:30.950> that's

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
money upgrading buildings that's

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.250 
money upgrading buildings that's
probably<00:05:31.729> why<00:05:31.880> and<00:05:32.780> I'll<00:05:32.870> show<00:05:32.990> you<00:05:33.050> who

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
probably why and I'll show you who

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.930 
probably why and I'll show you who
you're<00:05:33.440> at<00:05:33.560> war<00:05:33.710> with<00:05:33.770> who<00:05:34.729> you're<00:05:34.880> an
