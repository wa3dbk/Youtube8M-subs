00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.130

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.000
 teach a crack cos in the live pool 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.170
 tour 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.530
 good this taco this hack consists of 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.930
 change an old cue for a new one 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.400
 good for this we need the browser 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.090
 mozilla firefox 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 elche of 16.3 has to be this version 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.180
 of 6.3 in a new one has worked well 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.500
 and we have to do it from the page 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.790
 official of the public that is and I think good 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.329
 I'll leave it the same in the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.260
 description of the video below the link 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.649
 good 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.670
 now let's start let's see what the 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.399
 tacos that I have 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:54.210
 but I contain the bamboo 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.210
 the totem 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.720
 with not very good tacos 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.010
 well I'm going to do in this case I'm going to 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.940
 change the bamboo for the good dragon 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.700
 to do this we open the challenger and 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.070
 we select the second adobe flash 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.890
 player plugin the one below 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.790
 well now you talk to me treehouse we put 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.060
 in 0 to 4 by we change it for strings 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.730
 now we minimize it we load the page 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.000
 again but it's loading right in the 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.330
 Perez half give you almost try the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.330
 weather 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.960
 when the advantage comes 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:49.610
 well there now we put taco bum bum bum 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.170
 boom bum now let's do is that 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:58.030
 we select all 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.620
 we went down pressed the girl intro and now 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.750
 bamboo we erase it we put dragon 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.630
 we give intro 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.970
 and now we remove the writing 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.630
 good 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.819
 but that you load 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.900
 and we delete everything from below 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.900
 for now we minimize 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:29.120
 let's see the tacos that I have 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:33.019
 As you can see, bamboo does not appear 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.210
 and we lay down as you can see the 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:40.020
 dragon 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:43.170
 the dragon of the dragon has everything and he 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.830
 well now let's see 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.830
 a warning this taco hack 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:54.569
 it only works if you do not want to play 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:56.400
 in practice and in tournaments the games do not 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.580
 work is going to disappear the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.260
 heel only in tournaments if they want 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.480
 play a tournament out there with this with 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.850
 flight can play any where 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.520
 they were split none 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.290
 they are not going to leave us and they turn to 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.000
 load the page and then you will also 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.630
 will come out 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.750
 well now let's check the tournament 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.270
 I'm going to play this tournament 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.100
 and let's see the taco if it works 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.100
 only in tournaments and in practice 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.010
 we'll see 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.959
 well let's see and as you can see is the 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:48.590
 dragon taco worked perfectly or the 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:52.480
 duck being the force the aim the 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.480
 effect I will burst 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.010
 it works in tournaments 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.799
 in practice but in batches 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.849
 and not only can you eat taco 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:12.840
 you can also change the blue Greek 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:14.540
 by flight 8 this baby goes only for the 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.810
 8 Ball 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.639
 the bamboo by the dragon and does not remember 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.750
 another name but if it does not leave me in the 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.300
 description of the video so I want 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.900
 try to win and it's the same 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.400
 good procedure 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.660
 And that's all 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.270
 for now 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.800
 give him like he was served comment 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.800
 any problem they have 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.080
 then seeing itself written like that they find out 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.069
 when only videos 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.069
 And until next time
