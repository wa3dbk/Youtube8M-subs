not<00:05:27.430> too<00:05:27.640> concerned<00:05:27.850> about<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.360> back<00:05:28.510> because

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
not too concerned about the back because

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.690 
not too concerned about the back because
again<00:05:29.290> when<00:05:29.620> do<00:05:29.740> I<00:05:29.770> ever<00:05:29.860> see<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.370> back<00:05:30.520> of<00:05:30.669> my

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
again when do I ever see the back of my

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.370 
again when do I ever see the back of my
head<00:05:30.970> exactly<00:05:32.400> okay<00:05:33.540> does<00:05:34.540> this<00:05:34.690> look<00:05:34.840> okay<00:05:34.960> I

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
head exactly okay does this look okay I

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.530 
head exactly okay does this look okay I
can't<00:05:35.800> tell<00:05:36.040> okay<00:05:36.640> so<00:05:36.700> I'm<00:05:37.090> thinking<00:05:37.419> that

or maybe even a beaded one a little
bling<00:06:23.170> bling<00:06:23.500> in<00:06:23.740> though<00:06:23.920> I<00:06:24.190> bet<00:06:24.400> you<00:06:24.490> could

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
bling bling in though I bet you could

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.640 
bling bling in though I bet you could
kind<00:06:24.940> of<00:06:25.000> bring<00:06:25.270> some<00:06:25.750> of<00:06:25.810> this<00:06:25.900> down<00:06:26.200> to<00:06:26.530> just

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
kind of bring some of this down to just

kind of bring some of this down to just
reveal<00:06:27.070> the<00:06:27.280> headband<00:06:27.640> even<00:06:28.000> further<00:06:28.240> you<00:06:28.540> had

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720
