month<00:00:38.610> usually<00:00:39.570> what<00:00:39.809> happens<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> paint

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
month usually what happens is the paint

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500 
month usually what happens is the paint
around<00:00:40.770> here<00:00:41.070> gets<00:00:41.340> really<00:00:41.730> burnished<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
around here gets really burnished and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.880 
around here gets really burnished and
just<00:00:43.170> keeps<00:00:43.320> getting<00:00:43.559> more<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.800> more

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
just keeps getting more and more

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.380 
just keeps getting more and more

on<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.719> white<00:00:45.899> plate<00:00:46.200> that's<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.129> see

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
on this white plate that's what we see

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.029 
on this white plate that's what we see
in<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.430> really<00:00:47.940> extremely<00:00:48.539> high<00:00:48.840> mileage<00:00:49.379> 35

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
in the really extremely high mileage 35

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.790 
in the really extremely high mileage 35
that<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.520> run<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:51.090> day<00:00:51.350> this<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.500> does<00:00:52.649> not

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
that just run all day this one does not

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:08.840 
that just run all day this one does not
show<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:56.960> close<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.140> real<00:00:58.379> fast<00:01:07.850> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
show that just close this real fast the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.280 
show that just close this real fast the
only<00:01:08.970> reason<00:01:09.150> why<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.720> clearance<00:01:09.930> is

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
only reason why it's on clearance is

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.500 
only reason why it's on clearance is
because<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.680> not<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.430> hundred<00:01:12.360> percent

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
because it's just not a hundred percent

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.969 
because it's just not a hundred percent
is<00:01:13.020> pretty<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.860> we'd<00:01:14.010> want<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:17.689> if

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
is pretty is what we'd want it to be if

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.320 
is pretty is what we'd want it to be if
you<00:01:19.979> listen<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.520> holding<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> hundred<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you listen it is holding a hundred and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.510 
you listen it is holding a hundred and
