00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.850
 the main problem in preserving the value of classics, and always notes 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.320
 still there 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 he did not just stay supporting roles 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.219
 We are driving according to Rambow 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.509
 the old unpacked and underbody protection gets cracks and gets damp 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.679
 infiltrated 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.399
 after all, the damage is at least discovered too late with Dieter Brosz long 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.259
 in secret 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.390
 and when it breaks through to the outside 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.399
 it gets expensive 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.899
 So old underbody protection is a risk a must have way though 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.440
 so far the only chance from scratching or burning with the flame 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.280
 Both processes take a long time and are therefore costly 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.330
 In addition, so irreparable consequential damage to the sheet 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.430
 an example of how it feels better then we came from the sixties 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.170
 Balzheim Exten the problem should be solved elegantly 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.560
 you came from the bottom 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.799
 all Black 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.700
 equal to several millimeters, the underbody protection is thick 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.010
 what to do 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.710
 at Time for Prosecutors WHO demands radiation 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.710
 that's how it looks 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.530
 a real innovation or it does not lead to anything 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 What does the man allowed to do? How does the powder work? 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.040
 in addition to the fighting, the solution to the problem 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.420
 what looks like snow 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.970
 give birth to reality 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.100
 a harmless gas from the air 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.100
 outdated cooled to minus 70 degrees like 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.170
 Kaltenkirchen 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.170
 that have it in them 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.160
 and with this machine succeeds the honorary gate 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.660
 a dry ice steel machine 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.290
 1 caraway called loses up 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.790
 and then immediately before you 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.790
 it gets loud 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.990
 the dry ice Vettel cursed accelerated and through this lance 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.030
 hunted 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.050
 formal com platform is sufficient for this compliance 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.400
 almost off 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.730
 better for the result 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.570
 when the drought helpers close to load as well as in their victory that 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.259
 means they will be guest in the accounts fractions 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.189
 and therefore also the indescribable one 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.679
 the cold gas sprayed underbody protection lightning fast 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.339
 and let the extreme air pressure flow 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.339
 so easy and at the same time for the car is to distribute 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:29.149
 five hours later 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.299
 what we have now 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.299
 lying on the ground was a real danger 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:40.399
 the result does not last long and rubbers remain undamaged 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.589
 After saving it becomes clear how good the car really is 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.540
 Lucky had only a few rust under the thick underbody protection 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:52.429
 a perfect base for a destination or small parts of Mexico 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:54.709
 guardrails 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.539
 Results like this are no coincidence 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:01.349
 behind it is not only the experience of TA next but also the ones used 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.349
 technology 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.649
 First the air supply is probably the largest compressor 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:12.619
 Plant for this purpose throughout Germany 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:14.499
 a lot helps a lot 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:19.069
 A whopping 9000 liters of air per minute are delivered by this 11 in front of screw compressors 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:23.719
 one of the main reasons 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.069
 and then there is one of the rails themselves being used the latest equipment 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.139
 from the pedestal 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.079
 optically superior technology 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.989
 the special down in the machine the patented as we already led 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.079
 It guarantees high performance in continuous operation 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.729
 Advantage for the customer 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.909
 the penalty time leads as usual finds missed 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.039
 his age underbody protection is so efficient and again Timex is gutted 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.089
 longer with the classic 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.919
 Timex 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.070
 Dry ice is an important building block of many 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.809
 on the day x St 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:00.329
 for the safe 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:00.930
 from the classic
