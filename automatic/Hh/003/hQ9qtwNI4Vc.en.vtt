00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
two Autobots against them and he won't

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.719 
two Autobots against them and he won't
get<00:01:18.930> defeated<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:19.799> he's<00:01:20.189> effing<00:01:20.520> sound

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
probably the coolest figure out of all

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.420 
probably the coolest figure out of all
of<00:01:25.740> them<00:01:25.860> um<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.780> do<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.350> rod<00:01:29.009> mess<00:01:29.280> because

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
of them um I do like rod mess because

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.030 
of them um I do like rod mess because
he's<00:01:29.759> Rodimus<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.570> mean<00:01:30.869> he's<00:01:31.049> pretty<00:01:31.470> awesome

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.990 
he's Rodimus I mean he's pretty awesome
but<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.420> mean<00:01:34.130> he<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.159> says<00:01:35.400> who<00:01:35.490> he<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.729> but

best<00:01:36.840> part<00:01:37.020> about<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.530> they

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
best part about this is that they

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.410 
best part about this is that they
actually<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.549> pretty<00:01:38.670> good<00:01:38.759> articulation<00:01:39.030> for

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
actually a pretty good articulation for

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.120 
actually a pretty good articulation for
their<00:01:39.509> further<00:01:39.810> size<00:01:40.079> except<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.740> bone<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:41.009> I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
their further size except for bone be I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.819 
their further size except for bone be I
really<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.490> home<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.850> home<00:01:42.060> be<00:01:42.570> he's<00:01:43.380> pretty

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
really like home be home be he's pretty

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.030 
really like home be home be he's pretty
lacking<00:01:44.430> he's<00:01:44.939> got<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.479> tribulation<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
lacking he's got a tribulation here and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.469 
lacking he's got a tribulation here and
a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.189> bit<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.270> kind<00:01:48.420> of

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
a little bit like that and it kind of

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.139 
a little bit like that and it kind of
moves<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.200> head<00:01:49.860> doesn't<00:01:50.040> move<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.790> moves<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
moves and head doesn't move this moves a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.550 
moves and head doesn't move this moves a
little<00:01:51.270> bit<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.990> legs<00:01:53.960> backwards<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.290> floors

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
little bit and legs backwards and floors

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.289 
little bit and legs backwards and floors
and<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.579> about<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.590> pretty<00:01:58.590> simple

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
and that's about it pretty simple

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.319 
and that's about it pretty simple
Rodimus<00:02:00.770> kind<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> same<00:02:02.180> backwards<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
rate on the same edge as the wheel so

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.700 
rate on the same edge as the wheel so
that<00:05:19.240> really<00:05:19.540> does<00:05:19.810> like<00:05:20.140> track<00:05:20.380> across<00:05:20.590> the

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.870 
releasing it again because it's crappy I
guess<00:05:41.020> Soundwave<00:05:42.010> has<00:05:42.430> a<00:05:42.460> really<00:05:42.700> awesome

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
guess Soundwave has a really awesome

guess Soundwave has a really awesome
transformation<00:05:43.690> even<00:05:44.020> his<00:05:44.710> transform<00:05:45.160> is

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
transformation even his transform is

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.560 
transformation even his transform is
exactly<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.640> same<00:05:45.730> as<00:05:45.790> the<00:05:46.030> original<00:05:46.090> fallen

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
exactly the same as the original fallen

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.850 
exactly the same as the original fallen
once<00:05:46.720> you<00:05:46.840> already<00:05:47.020> have<00:05:47.200> that<00:05:47.230> you<00:05:47.620> know<00:05:47.740> what

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
once you already have that you know what

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.830 
once you already have that you know what
the<00:05:47.920> transformation<00:05:48.460> is<00:05:48.690> basically<00:05:49.690> what<00:05:49.780> you

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
the transformation is basically what you

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.390 
the transformation is basically what you
want<00:05:49.900> to<00:05:49.990> do<00:05:50.080> is<00:05:50.230> when<00:05:50.380> take<00:05:50.560> his<00:05:50.710> feet<00:05:50.950> you

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
want to do is when take his feet you

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.660 
want to do is when take his feet you
want<00:05:51.550> to<00:05:51.610> fold<00:05:51.790> them<00:05:51.880> up<00:05:52.000> like<00:05:52.210> this<00:05:53.520> then<00:05:54.520> you

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:22.799 
don't know but anyways take the side
wings<00:07:17.079> fold<00:07:17.799> them<00:07:17.919> flat<00:07:20.519> fold<00:07:21.519> this<00:07:21.809> forward

00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:22.809 
wings fold them flat fold this forward
