00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.440 

now<00:00:04.580> we<00:00:04.640> talked<00:00:04.910> a<00:00:04.940> little<00:00:05.150> bit<00:00:05.330> about

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
now we talked a little bit about

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.360 
now we talked a little bit about
technique<00:00:06.080> on<00:00:06.319> actually<00:00:06.740> how<00:00:06.859> to<00:00:06.890> kick<00:00:07.220> the

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
technique on actually how to kick the

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.610 
technique on actually how to kick the
ball<00:00:07.660> another<00:00:08.660> thing<00:00:08.990> that<00:00:09.290> is<00:00:09.440> very

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
ball another thing that is very

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.020 
ball another thing that is very
important<00:00:10.250> is<00:00:10.340> accuracy

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
important is accuracy

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.160 
important is accuracy
a<00:00:11.710> good<00:00:12.710> fun<00:00:12.950> way<00:00:13.160> to<00:00:13.190> practice<00:00:13.940> this<00:00:14.389> is<00:00:14.630> that

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
a good fun way to practice this is that

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.570 
a good fun way to practice this is that
you're<00:00:15.320> actually<00:00:15.440> take<00:00:15.800> the<00:00:15.950> ball<00:00:16.189> you<00:00:16.369> move

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
you're actually take the ball you move

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.519 
you're actually take the ball you move
it<00:00:16.670> out<00:00:16.759> on<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.060> sidelines<00:00:17.570> and<00:00:17.990> then<00:00:18.349> you<00:00:18.410> can

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
it out on the sidelines and then you can

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.260 
it out on the sidelines and then you can
now<00:00:18.650> see<00:00:18.890> that<00:00:18.950> the<00:00:19.160> goalpost<00:00:19.670> is<00:00:19.939> a<00:00:19.970> little

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
now see that the goalpost is a little

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.540 
now see that the goalpost is a little
bit<00:00:20.390> more<00:00:20.660> narrow<00:00:20.900> and<00:00:21.259> it's<00:00:21.980> a<00:00:22.070> fun<00:00:22.310> way<00:00:22.489> to

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
bit more narrow and it's a fun way to

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.760 
bit more narrow and it's a fun way to
actually<00:00:22.849> practice<00:00:23.419> how<00:00:24.020> accurate<00:00:24.500> you<00:00:24.590> are

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
actually practice how accurate you are

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.909 
actually practice how accurate you are
so<00:00:25.040> you<00:00:25.099> start<00:00:25.460> maybe<00:00:26.329> 20<00:00:26.840> 30<00:00:26.869> yards<00:00:27.320> out<00:00:27.590> and

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
so you start maybe 20 30 yards out and

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.130 
so you start maybe 20 30 yards out and
then<00:00:28.340> you<00:00:28.460> move<00:00:28.669> into<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.180> goal<00:00:29.360> line<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:29.840> as

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
then you move into the goal line and as

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.109 
then you move into the goal line and as
you<00:00:30.259> can<00:00:30.439> see<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:31.070> goal<00:00:31.279> post<00:00:31.550> is<00:00:31.730> getting

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
you can see the goal post is getting

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.299 
you can see the goal post is getting
more<00:00:32.720> narrow<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.380> now<00:00:33.590> I<00:00:33.620> will<00:00:33.920> show<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:34.190> how

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
more narrow and now I will show you how

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:53.370 
more narrow and now I will show you how
it's<00:00:34.460> done

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.960 

so<00:00:54.380> as<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:54.620> can<00:00:54.740> see<00:00:54.980> we<00:00:55.160> actually<00:00:55.520> moved<00:00:55.760> up

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
so as you can see we actually moved up

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.760 
so as you can see we actually moved up
the<00:00:56.150> ball<00:00:56.330> we're<00:00:56.960> actually<00:00:57.080> standing<00:00:57.410> right

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
the ball we're actually standing right

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.920 
the ball we're actually standing right
on<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.040> goal<00:00:58.190> line<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.610> as<00:00:59.360> you<00:00:59.480> can<00:00:59.630> see<00:00:59.780> the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
on the goal line and as you can see the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.920 
on the goal line and as you can see the
goalpost<00:01:00.380> is<00:01:00.530> extremely<00:01:01.250> narrow<00:01:01.570> now<00:01:02.570> let's

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
goalpost is extremely narrow now let's

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:20.490 
goalpost is extremely narrow now let's
see<00:01:03.050> if<00:01:03.140> we<00:01:03.230> can<00:01:03.350> make<00:01:03.500> it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.550 

not<00:01:21.500> exercise<00:01:22.010> standing<00:01:23.000> on<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.360> in<00:01:23.509> line<00:01:23.780> and

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
not exercise standing on the in line and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.980 
not exercise standing on the in line and
as<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:24.860> can<00:01:25.009> see<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.400> goalposts<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.270> the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
as you can see the goalposts and the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.200 
as you can see the goalposts and the
only<00:01:27.140> thing<00:01:27.470> that<00:01:28.280> really<00:01:28.460> matters<00:01:28.880> here<00:01:29.060> is

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
only thing that really matters here is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:47.290 
only thing that really matters here is
that<00:01:29.300> you<00:01:29.600> actually<00:01:29.720> hit<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.350> post

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.850 

when<00:01:48.300> you're<00:01:48.420> punting<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.810> ball<00:01:48.900> it's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
when you're punting the ball it's

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.290 
when you're punting the ball it's
extremely<00:01:50.460> important<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.820> you're<00:01:51.000> actually

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
extremely important that you're actually

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.120 
extremely important that you're actually
drop<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.690> ball<00:01:51.870> straight<00:01:52.230> down<00:01:52.260> if<00:01:52.950> you've

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
drop the ball straight down if you've

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770 
drop the ball straight down if you've
tilled<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.760> little<00:01:53.940> bit<00:01:54.120> backward<00:01:54.570> or

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
tilled it a little bit backward or

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.930 
tilled it a little bit backward or
forward<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.620> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> put<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.160> rotation<00:01:56.820> on

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
forward it's going to put a rotation on

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.280 
forward it's going to put a rotation on
the<00:01:57.030> ball<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.420> what<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.720> actually<00:01:57.930> want<00:01:58.229> to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the ball and what you actually want to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.380 
the ball and what you actually want to
do<00:01:58.440> is<00:01:58.680> had<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> nice<00:01:59.070> spin<00:01:59.460> just<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.300> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
do is had a nice spin just like with the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.630 
do is had a nice spin just like with the
quarterback<00:02:00.840> throws<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> ball<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:02.160> therefore

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
quarterback throws the ball so therefore

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.820 
quarterback throws the ball so therefore
when<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.000> drop<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.900> has<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.290> dropped

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
when you drop it it has to be dropped

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:18.510 
when you drop it it has to be dropped
straight<00:02:05.250> down

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.860 

so<00:02:19.520> there's<00:02:19.970> many<00:02:20.420> different<00:02:20.510> ways<00:02:20.840> to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
so there's many different ways to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.960 
so there's many different ways to
actually<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.410> kick<00:02:21.590> an<00:02:21.710> onside<00:02:22.070> kick<00:02:22.340> I'll<00:02:22.580> now

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
actually to kick an onside kick I'll now

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.910 
actually to kick an onside kick I'll now
just<00:02:23.240> demonstrate<00:02:23.810> one<00:02:24.110> way<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.350> actually<00:02:24.620> do

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
just demonstrate one way to actually do

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.430 
just demonstrate one way to actually do
it<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.280> that's<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.640> same<00:02:26.450> approach<00:02:26.600> as<00:02:27.140> when

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
it and that's the same approach as when

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.100 
it and that's the same approach as when
you<00:02:27.530> kick<00:02:27.740> a<00:02:27.770> field<00:02:28.460> goal<00:02:28.600> three<00:02:29.600> steps<00:02:29.840> back

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
you kick a field goal three steps back

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.200 
you kick a field goal three steps back
to<00:02:30.320> steps<00:02:30.740> out<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.190> then<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.820> kick<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.120> as

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
to steps out and then you kick it as

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.010 
to steps out and then you kick it as
hard<00:02:32.420> as<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.600> can

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
hard as you can

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.200 
hard as you can
coming<00:02:33.320> from<00:02:33.440> upside<00:02:33.950> down<00:02:34.520> through<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.030> ball

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
coming from upside down through the ball

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.990 
coming from upside down through the ball
and<00:02:35.480> get<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.900> nice<00:02:36.140> big<00:02:36.410> rebound<00:02:36.860> it's<00:02:37.790> very

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
and get a nice big rebound it's very

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000 
and get a nice big rebound it's very
important<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.510> open<00:02:38.750> up<00:02:38.870> your<00:02:38.990> hip<00:02:39.230> you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
important that you open up your hip you

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.190 
important that you open up your hip you
flex<00:02:40.340> your<00:02:40.520> foot<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:41.360> hit<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.660> with<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.930> toe

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
flex your foot you hit it with the toe

00:02:42.200 --> 00:03:19.840 
flex your foot you hit it with the toe
as<00:02:42.410> far<00:02:42.620> as<00:02:42.740> you<00:02:42.830> can

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.910 

you
