00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
like this as you can see the screws

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.160 
like this as you can see the screws
don't<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> slot<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.780> them<00:01:03.930> they're<00:01:04.140> just

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
don't have a slot in them they're just

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.570

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
blind on the edges as you can see here

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.950 
blind on the edges as you can see here
so<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> way<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.880> works<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.570> insert

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
so the way it works is you just insert

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.080 
so the way it works is you just insert
your<00:01:10.140> tool<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.830> fits<00:01:11.100> nice<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.430> perfectly

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
your tool and it fits nice and perfectly

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.929 
your tool and it fits nice and perfectly
over<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> screws<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.549> adjust

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
over the screws and then you just adjust

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.120 
over the screws and then you just adjust
them<00:01:15.799> and<00:01:18.049> this<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> screws<00:01:19.799> look

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
them and this is what the screws look

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.800 
them and this is what the screws look
like<00:01:20.340> these<00:01:20.520> ones<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.939> slots<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.509> them<00:01:21.659> it's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
like these ones have slots in them it's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.420 
like these ones have slots in them it's
a<00:01:21.869> different<00:01:22.200> carburetor<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> same

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
a different carburetor but it's the same

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.160 
a different carburetor but it's the same
idea<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:24.689> carb<00:01:24.960> tool<00:01:25.200> would<00:01:25.350> fit<00:01:25.650> right<00:01:26.070> over

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
idea the carb tool would fit right over

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.690 
idea the carb tool would fit right over
so<00:01:28.170> when<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.439> adjust<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.829> carburetor<00:01:29.250> even

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so when you adjust this carburetor even

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.100 
so when you adjust this carburetor even
though<00:01:29.820> there's<00:01:30.060> slots<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> slotted

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
though there's slots for a slotted

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560 
though there's slots for a slotted
screwdriver<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.220> still<00:01:32.520> use<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.210> tool

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
screwdriver you can still use this tool

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.929 
screwdriver you can still use this tool
here<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.560> address<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> carburetor<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.490> find<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
here to address the carburetor I find it

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.999 
here to address the carburetor I find it
stays<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> screw<00:01:36.840> much<00:01:37.020> better<00:01:37.290> than<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
stays on the screw much better than the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.770 
stays on the screw much better than the
slotted<00:01:38.400> screwdriver<00:01:38.939> especially<00:01:39.479> when<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
slotted screwdriver especially when the
