00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:22.889
 each other 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.359
 beautiful to see a clear deadline

 I'll leave you the moment you're looking or waiting. 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.479

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:42.709
 this year 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.709
 since they were lost in the cloud in the Brazilian case 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.150
 I'll stay here 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.150

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:18.179
 this letter 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.059
 I remember he got his career. 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:35.799
 marquinhos 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.799
 by chance 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.909
 the ruffle 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.439
 it's because he 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.439
 berta cabral for those who do not like him 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.589

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:13.589
 routing 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.449
 our patience does not kill the treasure robbing bayeux 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.460
 not worth it 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.849
 and she then on top 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.580
 hence it would leave him away 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.669
 Murray, I hope so. 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.039
 He arrives here. 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.089

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.089

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.749

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:18.039
 worse than the other exhausted 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:21.039

 whether or not he can offer European asylum eads this country 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:55.719
 whether or not he is in the middle of the field the team played in addition to 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:58.770
 Why? 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.719
 cube orbit 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:02.419
 or why such an act 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.850
 I know that now I am me 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.850

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.520
 This is where I want to stay. 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.259

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:16.259
