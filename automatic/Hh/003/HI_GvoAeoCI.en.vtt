00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.229 
busy so I have the cheats version again
and<00:00:36.449> I<00:00:36.510> use<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.989> ready-made<00:00:37.320> pastry<00:00:38.280> rolled

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239

it out put it over this tin I use the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
it out put it over this tin I use the
cake<00:00:42.059> tin<00:00:42.390> because<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.900> a<00:00:43.019> lot<00:00:43.199> deeper<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:43.860> I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
cake tin because it's a lot deeper and I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.220 
cake tin because it's a lot deeper and I

can get more filling in and also this

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.470 
can get more filling in and also this
catch<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.920> means<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.340> easier<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> get<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
really I normally have just a little

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.840 
really I normally have just a little
drop<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.100> soya<00:03:11.730> milk<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:13.160> if<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.340> want<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.700> add

and<00:03:27.129> just<00:03:28.129> pull<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:28.459> on<00:03:28.910> top<00:03:31.239> of<00:03:32.239> your<00:03:32.420> dish

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.309 

so<00:03:36.319> just<00:03:36.560> pour<00:03:36.769> the<00:03:36.920> mixture<00:03:37.540> all<00:03:38.540> over<00:03:38.599> the

the<00:03:45.319> bass<00:03:45.560> up<00:03:46.010> as<00:03:46.989> much<00:03:47.989> as<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.349> possibly<00:03:48.769> can

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.670 

and<00:03:58.050> if<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.260> have<00:03:58.410> any<00:03:58.620> mixture<00:03:59.070> over<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:01.470> can

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
and if you have any mixture over you can

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.860 
and if you have any mixture over you can
still<00:04:01.860> make<00:04:02.250> use<00:04:02.520> of<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:05.210> but<00:04:06.210> actually<00:04:06.690> this

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
still make use of that but actually this

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.430 
still make use of that but actually this
is<00:04:06.930> just<00:04:07.530> about<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.820> right<00:04:09.290> amount<00:04:10.290> of

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
is just about the right amount of

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:21.770 
is just about the right amount of
mixture<00:04:18.470> hmm<00:04:19.790> little<00:04:20.790> sprinkling<00:04:21.390> of<00:04:21.450> cheese

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
what we did we left it to call for an

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.560 
what we did we left it to call for an
hour<00:05:36.690> because<00:05:37.169> the<00:05:37.500> tofu<00:05:38.060> tends<00:05:39.060> to<00:05:39.300> firm<00:05:39.539> up

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
hour because the tofu tends to firm up

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.589 
hour because the tofu tends to firm up
more<00:05:40.169> as<00:05:40.410> it<00:05:40.560> gets<00:05:40.740> cooler<00:05:41.039> as<00:05:41.400> well<00:05:41.639> so<00:05:42.330> here

more as it gets cooler as well so here

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.339
