00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
looked at it yet but I'm assuming this

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.810 
looked at it yet but I'm assuming this
is<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> Episode<00:01:33.930> four<00:01:35.299> poster<00:01:37.610> good<00:01:38.610> I'll<00:01:38.700> be

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
is the Episode four poster good I'll be

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.940 
is the Episode four poster good I'll be
able<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> hang<00:01:39.090> these<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:40.020> might<00:01:40.680> actually

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
able to hang these up I might actually

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.179 
able to hang these up I might actually
hang<00:01:41.490> them<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:41.810> right<00:01:42.810> there<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.560> think<00:01:43.890> that

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
hang them up right there I I think that

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.310 
hang them up right there I I think that
would<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.340> cool<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.090> hung<00:01:45.299> them<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.780> in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
would be cool if I hung them up like in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.440 
would be cool if I hung them up like in
order<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.700> could<00:01:47.880> measure<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.240> out

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
order and like if I could measure it out

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.819 
order and like if I could measure it out
so<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.960> symmetrical<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.680> looks

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
so that it's symmetrical and it looks

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.170 
so that it's symmetrical and it looks
good<00:01:50.040> I'm<00:01:50.189> totally<00:01:50.430> gonna<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
good I'm totally gonna do that that

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.020 
good I'm totally gonna do that that
would<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:51.780> cool<00:01:51.960> background

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
would be a really cool background

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.929 
would be a really cool background
instead<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> bland<00:01:54.420> tan<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.820> like<00:01:56.820> these

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
instead of the bland tan I like these

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.280 
instead of the bland tan I like these
posters<00:01:57.149> these<00:01:57.509> are<00:01:57.659> cool<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:57.899> glad<00:01:58.049> they're

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
posters these are cool I'm glad they're

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.910 
posters these are cool I'm glad they're
doing<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.909> next<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:01.770> I

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
doing this so the next one is as I

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.190 
doing this so the next one is as I
mentioned<00:02:02.000> episode<00:02:03.000> 5<00:02:03.299> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
mentioned episode 5 and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.899 
mentioned episode 5 and
like<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:04.829> I'm<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.130> I'd<00:02:05.520> assume

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
like that and then I'm just I'd assume

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.670 
like that and then I'm just I'd assume
that<00:02:06.149> when<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.140> would<00:02:07.259> be<00:02:07.350> episode

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
that when I for that would be episode

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.740 
that when I for that would be episode
six<00:02:07.979> maybe<00:02:08.580> they'll<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> prequels<00:02:09.599> I'm

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
six maybe they'll do the prequels I'm

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.250 
six maybe they'll do the prequels I'm
not<00:02:09.869> sure<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:11.310> yeah<00:02:11.489> then<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.360> next<00:02:13.019> thing<00:02:13.140> I

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
not sure so yeah then the next thing I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.690 
not sure so yeah then the next thing I
got<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.510> UCS<00:02:16.050> slave<00:02:16.440> water<00:02:16.950> which<00:02:17.489> I'm

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
got is the UCS slave water which I'm

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.470 
got is the UCS slave water which I'm
also<00:02:18.180> very<00:02:18.840> excited<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.530> build<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:20.700> had<00:02:21.300> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
also very excited to build I had the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.020 
also very excited to build I had the
2006<00:02:22.319> slave<00:02:22.590> one<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.950> used<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.580> then<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.760> sold

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
2006 slave one I used to and then I sold

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.860 
2006 slave one I used to and then I sold
it<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.300> said<00:02:24.569> that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
it I said that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.920

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
so the 2006 model I had it was a pretty

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.360 
so the 2006 model I had it was a pretty
good<00:02:28.080> model<00:02:28.230> but<00:02:28.680> from<00:02:28.860> what<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.010> saw<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
good model but from what I saw in the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.030 
good model but from what I saw in the
Lego<00:02:29.550> store<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:30.060> thing<00:02:30.239> is<00:02:30.360> pretty<00:02:30.540> massive

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
Lego store this thing is pretty massive

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.250 
Lego store this thing is pretty massive
because<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.220> had<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.489> on<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.730> play<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:34.140> thing

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
because I had it on this play this thing

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.620 
because I had it on this play this thing
is<00:02:34.379> pretty<00:02:34.530> massive<00:02:34.799> so<00:02:35.549> it's<00:02:36.269> gonna<00:02:36.420> be

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
is pretty massive so it's gonna be

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.630 
is pretty massive so it's gonna be
really<00:02:36.840> cool<00:02:37.140> fun<00:02:37.410> build<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.830> think<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.310> think<00:02:38.549> it

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
really cool fun build I think I think it

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.130 
really cool fun build I think I think it
would<00:02:38.730> be<00:02:38.819> it'll<00:02:39.120> be<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.209> much<00:02:39.450> more<00:02:39.660> fun<00:02:39.900> build

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
would be it'll be a much more fun build

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.780 
would be it'll be a much more fun build
than<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.440> TIE<00:02:40.620> fighter<00:02:40.890> which<00:02:41.160> looks<00:02:41.489> like<00:02:41.549> it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
than the TIE fighter which looks like it

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.900 
than the TIE fighter which looks like it
could<00:02:41.970> get<00:02:42.090> repetitive<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:44.220> yeah<00:02:44.430> but

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
could get repetitive so yeah but

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.430 
could get repetitive so yeah but
nonetheless<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.569> yeah<00:02:45.750> they're<00:02:46.019> gonna<00:02:46.260> be

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
nonetheless I yeah they're gonna be

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.440 
nonetheless I yeah they're gonna be
