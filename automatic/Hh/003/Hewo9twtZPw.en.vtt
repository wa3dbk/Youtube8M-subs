00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 very good guys how are you safe 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.370
 low street and we are in what you do 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.230
 with subscribers listed our mx 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.360
 orange color we are as you see in 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.820
 playstation 3 that today was already playing and we are going 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.219
 to make a super chunga race 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.240
 you are seeing that it is super strange we are going 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.740
 and this is a super difficult and that puts 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.630
 so let's see why I put 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.670
 because I have put the break today we are going to 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 let's see let's see calm flow 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.170
 calm to see little camera up close, let's go 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.240
 to follow because we are going the last ones already and 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.800
 this can be cago in milk we 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.300
 is that it is difficult as it runs 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.790
 too much you know how it happens 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.280
 the dots fall you know it's like super 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.260
 bike after no no cool to see around here 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.899
 remove remove remove from the middle to see 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.520
 despacito if it has been preceded and 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.420
 have saved it mate this has been 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.850
 there flying, it's worth it, we're still worth it 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.489
 perfect we take this so be careful with 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.170
 this wall because the point should be 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.690
 here and here is the point then no no 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.699
 is the point here the cones go down to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.500
 the kid that teams put it is worth not 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.320
 do not do it does not go in shit I've gone to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.550
 my mother to shit measured to shit see 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.630
 slowly 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.810
 I do not like this, I'm not cool about this 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.540
 sing for now yes it's worth I actually did 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.840
 a challenge with this for the games the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.070
 first I play because I'm the only one who 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.310
 I have passed 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.680
 the living point of my mother lad is 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 fallen I'm leaving first my mother is that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.570
 has done with that point I think I 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.570
 has finished 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.150
 now if it does not bust me against the ground 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.729
 Well possibly win now I'm going 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.409
 second the first actually be careful with 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.090
 This applies certainly as despacito 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.340
 we said good ok we go good we go well 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.710
 ok we caught this here pim pam us 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.240
 we put first we jump jumps jumps 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.009
 jump through the hole is not worth worth 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.630
 not by the hole no uncle and he gave himself or 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.530
 there is a half meter hole and 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.530
 you have to cut through the hole 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.710
 Let's go again 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.119
 slowly the wall is the whole race 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.070
 by the point wall is the goal of 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.540
 be the goal and I have taken the point and 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.820
 that endured a lot of eye of your second 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.220
 number I think uncle as I won in the 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.739
 last moment I shit in the milk not 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.050
 recharge is your uncle does not recharge no no no 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.850
 you ask for the goal let's go new companion 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.370
 things 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.370
 has not won me at the last second by 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.440
 shit from every good all uncle or was 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.360
 the whole race for back down by 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.430
 walls with the bicycle is super 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.290
 I miss everything and at the last second I have 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.360
 caught the point the last point or not the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.530
 penultimate point and I shit on everything because 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.930
 they go ahead and the span all 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.420
 race and see where the 3rd will be 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.460
 third because it goes a lot is that I have 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.600
 removed the race in the face for the 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.250
 third is for the same step 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.170
 way is this point arrives and has not 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.670
 is that guys caught me has been 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.850
 nothing to catch that point and I could not 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.070
 catch and it's been like that seriously and I 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.570
 I've really screwed up the truth is that I do 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.700
 in the milk but good to me has 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.650

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.740
 The truth is that I love

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.310
