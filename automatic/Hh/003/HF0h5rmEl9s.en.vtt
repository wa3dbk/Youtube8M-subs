00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.210
 friends, hello, I welcome you to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.920
 youtube channel all products 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.410
 simultaneously with the advent of thin models 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.750
 for example nokia 6500 classic 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.070
 The company has created an analogue of this device with 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.020
 musical component and 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.900
 positioned him as a youth 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.770
 nokia 5310 solution opening line 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.230
 xpressmusic 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.520
 added separate sound chip rendered 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.280
 additional control keys 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.489
 playlist washed down a bright design 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.489
 shells 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.629
 me he just black in 2009 price 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.719
 This unit at the start in Europe cost 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.429
 230 euros let's see the package bundle 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.280
 here the bundle is just crazy by 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.949
 compared to what the headset was 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.550
 simply 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:03.440
 just divine you look better 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:08.760
 visible and not tangling wires 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:12.180
 handed down to the office god my God here 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.000
 even but they wrote thanks to the Chinese for 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.990
 such for such cool headphones and more 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.380
 individual tinsel stuck well done 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:26.189
 I already like this phone so much 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.299
 we put off but the phone battery itself 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.840
 they are covered by him 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.170
 the wire 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.229
 with such a plastic nokia thing 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:45.969
 hinting at the originality of the wire 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:48.880
 charging charging charging submit here 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.219
 like charging super chinese and in general 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.159
 it is dangerous to even insert it into the socket 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:59.159
 be there anything else yet 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:03.310
 nothing else okay would clean it up 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.670
 let's look at the phone itself on 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:12.090
 the subject of the integrity of the buttons landed 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.290
 very good well almost very good 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.769
 here here there are uneven buttons here 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.450
 recessed here do not stick out but it is low 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.450
 not critical thing to keep 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.060
 the phone become very thin very very 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.940
 similar to a chocolate bar chocolate bar 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.640
 there are no complaints about the body but 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:42.930
 here until the end of the type until the end is not 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:45.240
 closes see what he has under 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:51.860
 the roof under the lid is all very clean 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.860
 very well made in hungary 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.890
 no parts loose 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.049
 you can try to remove this one here 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.370
 look at the panel as a page 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.370
 the company now I will take off 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.440
 So 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.200
 and so so 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.180
 sock it up with a big button 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.640
 all is well enough i would say 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.859
 that the phone itself is tolerant I don't disassemble 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.439
 I will be as his very dreary and long 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:42.579
 disassemble and also dreary long it 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:45.370
 collect this very nice reef to me 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.370

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:19.239

 let's go into the settings and see 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:35.680
 I wonder what period of her purse 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.720

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.720

 very unusual with this phone 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.289
 use and in this menu dig through 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.360

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.560
 now something 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.560
