recession<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.420> think<00:00:21.600> that's<00:00:21.779> probably

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
recession and I think that's probably

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.200 
recession and I think that's probably
conception<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.130> most<00:00:23.340> people<00:00:23.640> have<00:00:23.789> there's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
conception that most people have there's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.900 
conception that most people have there's
another<00:00:24.689> alternate<00:00:25.310> form<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.430> schooling<00:00:26.760> that

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
another alternate form of schooling that

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.450 
another alternate form of schooling that

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
you're going to understand both of them

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.490 
you're going to understand both of them
in<00:00:39.059> traditional<00:00:39.570> schooling<00:00:39.809> as<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.110> mentioned

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
in traditional schooling as I mentioned

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.139 
in traditional schooling as I mentioned
it's<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.280> go<00:00:41.430> through<00:00:41.640> months<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
it's you go through months you have a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.639 
it's you go through months you have a
break<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> fall<00:00:42.930> break<00:00:43.170> somewhere<00:00:43.559> in

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
break get a fall break somewhere in

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.650 
break get a fall break somewhere in
there<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.129> go<00:00:44.700> another<00:00:44.940> three<00:00:45.239> months<00:00:45.539> you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
there you go another three months you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
there you go another three months you
have<00:00:45.750> another<00:00:45.930> spring<00:00:46.260> break<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:47.700> you

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
have another spring break and then you

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.160 
have another spring break and then you
get<00:00:48.090> off<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.390> summer<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.960> three

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
get off for summer and you have three

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.830 
get off for summer and you have three
months<00:00:49.440> off<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.059> kind<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.780> know

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
months off and you just kind of you know

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.979 
months off and you just kind of you know
hanging<00:00:52.379> free<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> guess<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.930> is

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
hanging free I guess and this this is

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.900 
hanging free I guess and this this is
you<00:00:55.680> know<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.460> probably<00:00:56.640> what

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
you know I think this is probably what

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.160 
you know I think this is probably what
most<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.239> us<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.390> done<00:00:57.660> throughout<00:00:57.960> our

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
most of us have done throughout our

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.860 
most of us have done throughout our
schools<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.489> what<00:00:59.670> our<00:00:59.969> College<00:01:00.539> today

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
schools this is what our College today

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020 
schools this is what our College today
is<00:01:01.020> based<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.920> pretty<00:01:02.190> much<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.699> think

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
is based on it's pretty much I think

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.850 
is based on it's pretty much I think
this<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.510> most<00:01:03.629> common<00:01:04.140> experience<00:01:04.710> with

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
this is the most common experience with

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.730 
this is the most common experience with
school<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.720> you're<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:06.900> school<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.619> go

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
school and you're out school as you go

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.289 
school and you're out school as you go
three<00:01:08.040> months<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.580> take<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> month<00:01:09.060> off

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
three months and you take a month off

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.330 
three months and you take a month off
and<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:10.530> three<00:01:10.799> months<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.220> then

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and then you go three months and then

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.039 
and then you go three months and then
you<00:01:11.400> take<00:01:11.580> another<00:01:11.700> month<00:01:12.030> off<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.900> do

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you take another month off and you do

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.340 
you take another month off and you do
that<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> same<00:01:13.890> duration<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.540> school<00:01:15.540> so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that for the same duration of school so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.460 
that for the same duration of school so
you<00:01:16.409> go<00:01:16.590> summer<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.040> summer<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you go summer to summer and you get the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.929 
you go summer to summer and you get the
same<00:01:19.650> amount<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.979> class<00:01:20.189> time<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.790> would

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
same amount of class time as you would

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.210 
same amount of class time as you would
otherwise<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:22.200> take<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> same<00:01:22.710> breaks<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
otherwise you take the same breaks and

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.880 
otherwise you take the same breaks and
stuff<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:25.020> learn<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.470> class<00:01:25.680> for

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
stuff so you really learn in class for

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.590 
stuff so you really learn in class for
the<00:01:25.950> same<00:01:26.130> amount<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.490> time<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.450> they<00:01:27.570> have

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the same amount of time and they have

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.330 
the same amount of time and they have
two<00:01:27.900> ways<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.259> they<00:01:28.380> break<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.740> down<00:01:28.950> want

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
two ways that they break this down want

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.249 
two ways that they break this down want
a<00:01:29.369> single<00:01:29.729> track<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.299> other<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.630> multi

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
a single track and the other is multi

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.270 
a single track and the other is multi
track<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.799> means<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.189> different

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
track and that means that different

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.240 
track and that means that different
people<00:01:32.700> are<00:01:32.790> off<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.119> different<00:01:33.390> times<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:35.220> now

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
people are off at different times so now

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.469 
people are off at different times so now
that<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.549> understand<00:01:35.970> these<00:01:36.060> I'd<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.390> to

that's<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.970> huge<00:02:53.000> point<00:02:54.580> but<00:02:55.580> when<00:02:56.060> we<00:02:56.120> think

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
that's a huge point but when we think

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.840 
that's a huge point but when we think
about<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.690> worse<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.230> cons<00:02:57.470> of<00:02:57.800> going<00:02:58.580> to

all been there at the beginning of a

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.350 
all been there at the beginning of a
class<00:03:15.500> where<00:03:15.860> we<00:03:16.190> don't<00:03:16.730> have<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.000> have<00:03:17.150> two

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
class where we don't have to have two

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.850 
class where we don't have to have two
weeks<00:03:17.570> review<00:03:17.959> because<00:03:18.260> we<00:03:18.500> don't<00:03:18.650> know<00:03:18.739> what

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
weeks review because we don't know what

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.270 
weeks review because we don't know what
was<00:03:19.010> going<00:03:19.250> on<00:03:19.340> last<00:03:19.610> year<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.299> I<00:03:21.290> think<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:22.130> lot

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
was going on last year and I think a lot

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.920 
was going on last year and I think a lot
of<00:03:22.310> people<00:03:22.640> would<00:03:22.760> consider<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.690> summer

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
of people would consider the summer

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.370 
of people would consider the summer
weather<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:25.070> be<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.250> pro<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.299> personally<00:03:26.989> don't

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
weather to be a pro I personally don't

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.170 
weather to be a pro I personally don't
I<00:03:27.440> mean<00:03:27.680> it's<00:03:27.830> Colorado<00:03:28.280> but<00:03:28.459> gets<00:03:28.580> over<00:03:28.820> 100

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
I mean it's Colorado but gets over 100

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.390 
I mean it's Colorado but gets over 100
degrees<00:03:29.299> here<00:03:29.720> means<00:03:30.470> during<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.950> hours<00:03:31.250> of

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
degrees here means during the hours of

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.330 
degrees here means during the hours of
you<00:03:31.670> know<00:03:31.760> 11:00<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.570> 3:00<00:03:33.019> o'clock<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:34.130> just

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
you know 11:00 to 3:00 o'clock you just

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.729 
you know 11:00 to 3:00 o'clock you just
can't<00:03:34.640> be<00:03:34.850> outside<00:03:35.209> because<00:03:35.660> it's<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.290> hot

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
can't be outside because it's so hot

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.740 
can't be outside because it's so hot
some<00:03:37.610> people<00:03:37.880> like<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.060> I'm<00:03:38.420> not<00:03:38.570> really

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
some people like that I'm not really

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.210 
some people like that I'm not really
into<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.080> that<00:03:39.380> much<00:03:39.530> that<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.739> consider<00:03:40.160> that

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
into that that much that I consider that

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.360 
into that that much that I consider that
I<00:03:40.340> come<00:03:40.549> on<00:03:40.670> but<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:41.930> feel<00:03:42.230> that<00:03:42.470> traditional

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
I come on but I feel that traditional

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.860 
I come on but I feel that traditional
schooling<00:03:43.610> has<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.850> lot<00:03:44.209> of<00:03:44.239> really<00:03:44.510> more

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
schooling has a lot of really more

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.660 
schooling has a lot of really more
strong<00:03:45.320> things<00:03:45.620> going<00:03:45.980> for<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.250> than<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.519> does

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
strong things going for it than it does

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.630 
strong things going for it than it does
negative<00:03:47.030> things<00:03:47.450> going<00:03:47.870> for<00:03:48.110> it<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.489> we<00:03:49.489> need

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
negative things going for it and we need

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.690 
negative things going for it and we need
to<00:03:49.730> talk<00:03:49.820> about<00:03:50.090> multi-track<00:03:50.720> schools<00:03:51.700> some

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
to talk about multi-track schools some

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.310 
to talk about multi-track schools some
of<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.820> cons<00:03:53.030> for<00:03:53.299> that<00:03:53.480> are<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:53.780> it's<00:03:53.959> a

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
of the cons for that are is it's a

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.020 
of the cons for that are is it's a
little<00:03:54.920> bit<00:03:55.040> more<00:03:55.160> difficult<00:03:55.579> to<00:03:55.670> organize

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
little bit more difficult to organize

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.550 
little bit more difficult to organize
singletrack<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:56.930> easier<00:03:57.230> because<00:03:57.410> you're

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
singletrack is easier because you're

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.050 
singletrack is easier because you're
having<00:03:57.890> everyone<00:03:58.130> follow<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.579> same<00:03:58.790> schedule

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
having everyone follow the same schedule

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.100 
having everyone follow the same schedule
it's<00:03:59.870> like<00:04:00.019> kind<00:04:00.230> of

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
it's like kind of

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.050 
it's like kind of
it's<00:04:01.230> it's<00:04:01.620> sort<00:04:01.860> of<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.040> same<00:04:02.220> idea<00:04:02.700> as<00:04:02.790> that

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
it's it's sort of the same idea as that

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.950 
it's it's sort of the same idea as that
but<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:03.870> if<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.680> talk<00:04:04.830> about<00:04:04.980> multitrack

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
but it's if you talk about multitrack

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.720 
but it's if you talk about multitrack
you<00:04:06.960> have<00:04:07.080> three<00:04:07.560> different<00:04:07.620> sets<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.370> people

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
you have three different sets of people

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.150 
you have three different sets of people
going<00:04:08.940> on<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.140> off<00:04:10.230> on<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.680> off<00:04:10.800> that's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
going on and off on and off that's

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.710 
going on and off on and off that's
that's<00:04:11.460> difficult<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.970> keep<00:04:12.090> organized<00:04:12.570> but

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
that's difficult to keep organized but

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.210 
that's difficult to keep organized but
it<00:04:12.810> does<00:04:13.050> help<00:04:13.290> with<00:04:13.470> overcrowding<00:04:14.130> in

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
it does help with overcrowding in

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.780 
it does help with overcrowding in
schools

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
schools

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.940 
schools
it<00:04:15.390> does<00:04:15.630> help<00:04:15.870> eliminate<00:04:16.170> some<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.680> time

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
it does help eliminate some of that time

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.030 
it does help eliminate some of that time
in<00:04:17.250> between<00:04:18.019> like<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.290> downtime<00:04:19.739> in<00:04:20.010> between

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
in between like the downtime in between

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.070 
in between like the downtime in between
summer<00:04:20.670> in<00:04:20.850> your<00:04:20.970> classes<00:04:21.480> so<00:04:21.600> it's<00:04:21.720> easier<00:04:22.019> to

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
summer in your classes so it's easier to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.830 
summer in your classes so it's easier to
retain<00:04:22.440> all<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.710> information<00:04:23.570> but<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:24.720> is

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
retain all the information but it is

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.780 
retain all the information but it is
just<00:04:25.110> it's<00:04:25.560> difficult<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.100> organize<00:04:26.490> you

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
just it's difficult to organize you

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.280 
just it's difficult to organize you
can't<00:04:27.000> have<00:04:27.150> those<00:04:27.300> family<00:04:27.540> vacations<00:04:28.230> that

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
can't have those family vacations that

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.200 
can't have those family vacations that
are<00:04:28.500> month-long<00:04:28.890> you<00:04:29.310> can't<00:04:29.520> hold<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.790> long<00:04:29.940> job

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
are month-long you can't hold a long job

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.510 
are month-long you can't hold a long job
for<00:04:30.570> a<00:04:30.630> long<00:04:30.780> time<00:04:31.160> so<00:04:32.160> there's<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.460> many

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
for a long time so there's so many

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.550 
for a long time so there's so many
things<00:04:32.760> I'd<00:04:32.910> like<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.270> think<00:04:33.330> about<00:04:33.560> what

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
breaks just like all throughout the year

breaks just like all throughout the year
and<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:58.710> then<00:04:59.190> 24<00:04:59.550> -<00:04:59.940> tips<00:05:00.060> of<00:05:00.180> evening

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
whatnot so I don't know I really found

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.630 
whatnot so I don't know I really found
it<00:05:05.610> very<00:05:05.700> helpful<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:06.120> my<00:05:06.210> schooling<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:07.640> just

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
it very helpful to my schooling to just

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.790 
it very helpful to my schooling to just
you<00:05:08.910> know<00:05:08.940> easy<00:05:09.630> things<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:10.110> my<00:05:10.230> brain<00:05:10.470> engaged

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
you know easy things to my brain engaged

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.980 
you know easy things to my brain engaged
all<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:11.130> time<00:05:11.280> so<00:05:11.760> maybe<00:05:12.360> something<00:05:12.690> more

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
all the time so maybe something more

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.530 
all the time so maybe something more
like<00:05:13.200> that<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.880> with<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.000> breaks<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.480> I

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
like that and with the breaks and I

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.330 
like that and with the breaks and I
wasn't<00:05:15.780> able<00:05:16.169> to<00:05:16.350> keep<00:05:16.530> a<00:05:16.650> job<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:17.160> still

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
wasn't able to keep a job and I still

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.190 
wasn't able to keep a job and I still
have<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.580> job<00:05:17.669> one<00:05:18.120> in<00:05:18.330> school<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:18.840> things<00:05:19.050> like

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
have a job one in school and things like

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.440 
have a job one in school and things like
that<00:05:19.410> so<00:05:19.680> I<00:05:19.919> think<00:05:20.400> you<00:05:20.910> can

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.510 

most<00:05:24.450> things<00:05:24.660> are<00:05:24.780> saying<00:05:25.050> because<00:05:25.740> I<00:05:26.190> mean

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
most things are saying because I mean

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.850 
most things are saying because I mean
I'm<00:05:26.760> going<00:05:27.060> year<00:05:27.420> round<00:05:27.480> -<00:05:27.900> but<00:05:28.230> I'm<00:05:28.650> a

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
I'm going year round - but I'm a

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.070 
I'm going year round - but I'm a
business<00:05:29.220> I<00:05:29.340> might<00:05:29.430> have<00:05:29.550> kids<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.120> so<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:30.750> me

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
business I might have kids and so to me

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.170 
business I might have kids and so to me
is<00:05:31.139> the<00:05:31.410> same<00:05:31.620> type<00:05:31.889> of<00:05:32.040> thing<00:05:32.280> I<00:05:32.550> like<00:05:33.000> the

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
is the same type of thing I like the

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.480 
is the same type of thing I like the
year<00:05:33.360> round<00:05:33.540> a<00:05:33.810> lot<00:05:34.350> of<00:05:34.470> people<00:05:34.770> are<00:05:34.980> taught

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
year round a lot of people are taught

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.790 
year round a lot of people are taught
very<00:05:35.730> early<00:05:36.210> you<00:05:37.050> know<00:05:37.169> that<00:05:37.410> they<00:05:37.530> get<00:05:37.680> the

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
very early you know that they get the

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.680 
very early you know that they get the
summer<00:05:38.010> break<00:05:38.280> but<00:05:38.490> I<00:05:38.970> think<00:05:39.270> one<00:05:39.419> channel

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
summer break but I think one channel

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:53.800 
summer break but I think one channel
family<00:05:40.050> you<00:05:40.169> don't<00:05:40.290> never<00:05:40.710> don't<00:05:40.950> write<00:05:41.389> to<00:05:42.389> me

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:01.390 

because<00:05:54.810> I<00:05:57.770> and<00:05:59.240> so<00:06:00.240> I<00:06:00.300> just<00:06:00.450> kind<00:06:00.660> of<00:06:00.720> think

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
because I and so I just kind of think

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.140 
because I and so I just kind of think
what<00:06:02.400> I<00:06:02.460> would<00:06:02.760> prefer

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
what I would prefer

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.690 
what I would prefer
it's<00:06:04.080> kind<00:06:04.290> of<00:06:04.350> a<00:06:04.440> tough<00:06:04.740> decision<00:06:07.700> present

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
it's kind of a tough decision present

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.420 
it's kind of a tough decision present
common<00:06:09.000> for<00:06:09.180> both<00:06:09.300> I<00:06:09.800> feel<00:06:10.800> like<00:06:10.950> there's<00:06:11.160> just

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
common for both I feel like there's just

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.480 
common for both I feel like there's just
as<00:06:11.580> many<00:06:13.790> but<00:06:14.790> yeah

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
as many but yeah

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.960 
as many but yeah
get<00:06:16.729> out<00:06:17.030> of<00:06:17.180> Utah<00:06:17.509> because<00:06:18.729> it's<00:06:19.729> just

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
get out of Utah because it's just

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.460 
get out of Utah because it's just
thinking<00:06:20.150> about<00:06:20.419> this<00:06:21.910> and<00:06:22.910> I<00:06:23.060> think<00:06:23.470> I've

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
thinking about this and I think I've

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.680 
thinking about this and I think I've
never<00:06:24.650> had<00:06:25.099> your<00:06:25.580> own<00:06:25.759> schooling<00:06:26.090> but<00:06:26.419> I<00:06:26.449> think

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
never had your own schooling but I think

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.350 
never had your own schooling but I think
I'd<00:06:26.780> like<00:06:26.960> to<00:06:27.020> try<00:06:27.380> sometime<00:06:28.030> maybe<00:06:29.030> if<00:06:29.180> I<00:06:29.270> ever

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
I'd like to try sometime maybe if I ever

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.659 
I'd like to try sometime maybe if I ever
got<00:06:29.569> the<00:06:29.630> opportunity<00:06:29.870> cuz<00:06:30.770> I<00:06:30.860> feel<00:06:31.190> like<00:06:31.370> I'd

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
got the opportunity cuz I feel like I'd

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.290 
got the opportunity cuz I feel like I'd
be<00:06:31.880> able<00:06:31.910> to<00:06:32.150> work<00:06:32.330> it<00:06:32.509> better<00:06:32.780> than<00:06:34.300> just

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
be able to work it better than just

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.839 
be able to work it better than just
going<00:06:35.539> to<00:06:35.660> school<00:06:35.750> working<00:06:36.319> hard<00:06:36.590> for<00:06:36.889> eight

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
going to school working hard for eight

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.550 
going to school working hard for eight
or<00:06:38.030> nine<00:06:38.090> months<00:06:38.419> out<00:06:38.690> of<00:06:38.720> the<00:06:38.870> year<00:06:38.990> then<00:06:39.259> just

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
or nine months out of the year then just

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.240 
or nine months out of the year then just
stopping<00:06:40.130> for<00:06:40.430> three<00:06:41.289> kind<00:06:42.289> of<00:06:42.349> seems<00:06:42.620> like<00:06:43.930> I

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
stopping for three kind of seems like I

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.499 
stopping for three kind of seems like I
have<00:06:46.250> that<00:06:46.490> person<00:06:46.550> here's<00:06:47.120> all<00:06:47.300> of<00:06:47.330> you<00:06:47.479> I

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
think year round the models a little bit

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.189 
think year round the models a little bit
