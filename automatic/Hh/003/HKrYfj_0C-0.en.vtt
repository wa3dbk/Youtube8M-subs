00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.040
 channel that I hope you like 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.260
 of course it's called a collection of 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.660
 engine ryser you may like them all in 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.400
 truth is very good and good I have it 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.769
 the links of the downloads so that 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.750
 you can easily 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.360
 have it on your computer and we're also going 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.570
 to explain how to install it then 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.430
 we go quickly in our browser 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.050
 I'll leave a link or two ways 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.000
 so you can download it for 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.110
 course would be the direct download as 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.960
 you can see it here 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.520
 leave between it and the link that link 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.590
 so you can enter and you can 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.110
 download the three parts by the 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.489
 corresponding computer that has 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.460
 each course 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.800
 and good the other way to download them 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.420
 by torrent for which I have done it and 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.729
 good point I will leave this file 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.350
 torrent that of course they will have to 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.360
 install a program like this one that 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.759
 Torrent is called any version 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.259
 You could be serving and good when and 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.850
 install that program that also 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.610
 I will leave in the description then open 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.920
 this file point towers when what 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.710
 open up here will come out downloading acp 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.110
 turn off your computer it will not happen 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.110
 nothing with the download they will be 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.539
 good will be the discharge when 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.490
 you slow down the computer again 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.250
 then to accelerate the putting 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.780
 Electrical truth I have explained to us 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.509
 it can be very useful 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.740
 some tutorials that serve to 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.840
 Advance the torrent or downloads 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.819
 same our depends on the speed of 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.890
 internet then food is downloaded and 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.710
 we just work it and we're going to open the 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.259
 folder we're going to give you continue where 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.210
 the game is downloaded of course 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.679
 are all these parts and we are going to take 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.470
 the r point to point to r 00 and we're going to 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.700
 put him in extract at this point a 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.739
 motor ryser connection 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.769
 and it will develop from a rap and good 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.450
 will be extracting the files while 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.930
 they are extracted because we put on pause and 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.879
 we come back 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.890
 and good when you have finished extracting 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.420
 for the place 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.219
 then it will leave us a folder like 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.260
 this one that you are seeing you can leave a 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.819
 iso point file we will need a 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.349
 image editor could be us 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.209
 anybody in it also what 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.819
 I will leave a description called damon 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.329
 tools and in this case I will use the mount 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.540
