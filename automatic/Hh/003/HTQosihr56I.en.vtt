00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
to start doing a twist on my left side

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.760 
to start doing a twist on my left side
first<00:01:22.760> so<00:01:23.420> I'm<00:01:23.630> gonna<00:01:23.869> separate<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.530> bangs

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
first so I'm gonna separate the bangs

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.070 
first so I'm gonna separate the bangs
it's<00:01:25.280> optional<00:01:25.850> of<00:01:26.000> course<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.479> prefer<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.930> have

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
it's optional of course I prefer to have

you're pulling it back as you're
twisting<00:01:57.260> it<00:01:57.410> back<00:01:57.440> otherwise<00:01:58.100> it's<00:01:58.460> going<00:01:58.670> to

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
twisting it back otherwise it's going to

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.800
