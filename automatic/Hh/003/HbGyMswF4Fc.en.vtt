 He gave laughter, crying and pain, a program 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.000

 story that will keep you with your eyes 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.660
 open my name is ariel lÃ³pez married 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.390
 and with two children one day I was in 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.520
 house resting after an accident 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.680
 in boring work and I decide to see the 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.660
 television and I just see that there is the channel 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.790
 infinite I fixed in its programming 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.100
 because I wanted to see a show that I saw 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.350
 when I was young called a thousand ways 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.149
 die I fixed the schedule and this program 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.399
 I gave at 12 at night to me 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.440
 that schedule was weird because it gave 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.600
 noon and evening at about 7 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.880
 but as the dessert cherry said 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.090
 new episodes after a day 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.040
 boring were 11 and 59 at night and 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.470
 I was anxious about the program 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.780
 I was nostalgic but how was it going to be 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.240
 new episode was as if I saw it by 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.070
 first time finally the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.530
 program with the intro of always and the 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.080
 narrator of always after a great 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.850
 episode there were about 5 minutes for the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.010
 final and therefore that gave time 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.530
 enough for one or two more deaths 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.960
 a new death appears and in that 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.610
 moment I was still anxious and now 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.040
 I regret not having gone to the bathroom in 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.740
 that time the date said June 6 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.960
 of 2006 and the place in my country and city 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.970
 I was curious to hear the date 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.420
 of that death and it made me remember my 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.490
 curiosity about how death would be 666 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.619
 since as many know is the number 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.899
 of the devil in that death there was a kid 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.330
 addicted to porn also addicted to horror 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.430
 and wings so famous crepe and pasta east 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.410
 boy was hours on the computer and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.600
 a day at work this has a 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.580
 accident with a machine I started to 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.040
 say what chance the same thing that you 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.110
 happened to me except for porn and 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.690
 Since he was married, he could not see 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.640
 my wife and my children that guy 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.860
 I found watching horror videos and 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.690
 Despite being sore, he goes down to the living room 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.090
 to be 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.950
 his family was not at home and 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.840
 he gets to watch television and out of nowhere 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.390
 start talking in weird words 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.030
 unintelligible and the room becomes 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.100
 macabre and devilish red and the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.530
 devil while the kid saw that the 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.810
 things were very weird and he tried to leave 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.240
 from the house but I could not since I was 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.400
 injured and the devil killed him from a 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.890
 as brutal as the deaths 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.140
 of this program but more explicit and 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.630
 I also felt a breeze and felt 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.030
 as if it happened to me and the devil 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.400
 he told the camera the miserable lives are 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.000
 pay with hell and the final plate 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.430
 it said way to die 666 and the title 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.100
 it said like that you will die and you could see the front of 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.830
 my house at that time I was seized by a sun 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.860
 and also the next day was June 5, 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.960
 2006 and my family and getting up half that 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.750
 I was having fever and shock and I 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.180
 They took me to my bed then at 12 o'clock 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.090
 night the devil appears to me and this one 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.280
 says I warned you luckily I did not die anymore 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.410
 that I caught a cardiac arrest I counted 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.540
 this story in the hospital but I 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.470
 they tried to crazy and at this moment I'm 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.480
 in a psychiatrist 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.730
 that's why he used the loquendo to 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.770
 tell them this story if it were not 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.080
 in this place I would tell my son not to 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.790
 see this program ever since he is a fan 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.950
 of this program but I can not do it 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.140
 now I hope you liked this 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.049
 crepe and pasta accept criticism 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.299
