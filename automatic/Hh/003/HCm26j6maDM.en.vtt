she's imagining going back in time or do

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.759 
she's imagining going back in time or do
you<00:00:40.449> think<00:00:40.600> she<00:00:40.720> actually<00:00:40.839> does<00:00:41.260> go<00:00:41.290> back<00:00:41.589> in

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
you think she actually does go back in

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:48.030 
you think she actually does go back in
time<00:00:44.220> ok<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.750> you<00:00:46.809> think<00:00:47.170> she's<00:00:47.350> imagining<00:00:47.890> it

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
time ok so you think she's imagining it

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.549 
time ok so you think she's imagining it
but<00:00:48.190> you<00:00:48.309> think<00:00:48.549> it's<00:00:48.670> actually<00:00:48.879> happening<00:00:49.559> ok

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
but you think it's actually happening ok

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:51.780 
but you think it's actually happening ok
why<00:00:50.949> do<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:51.129> think<00:00:51.280> it's<00:00:51.460> just<00:00:51.670> her

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
why do you think it's just her

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:09.510 
why do you think it's just her
imagination<00:00:51.909> carbon<00:01:06.420> ok<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:09.130> maybe<00:01:09.280> we'll

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
imagination carbon ok so maybe we'll

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.890 
imagination carbon ok so maybe we'll
have<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.760> see<00:01:09.909> at<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.090> end<00:01:10.119> if<00:01:10.390> she<00:01:10.510> wakes<00:01:10.659> up

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
have to see at the end if she wakes up

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.810 
have to see at the end if she wakes up
uh-huh<00:01:11.290> now<00:01:12.220> I<00:01:12.250> think<00:01:12.640> that<00:01:12.850> she's<00:01:13.150> not

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
uh-huh now I think that she's not

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.240 
uh-huh now I think that she's not
imagining<00:01:15.820> because<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.650> Nazis<00:01:17.650> mala<00:01:17.980> are

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
imagining because the Nazis mala are

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.550 
imagining because the Nazis mala are
dead<00:01:18.430> or<00:01:19.060> they're<00:01:19.390> not<00:01:19.510> dead<00:01:19.720> like<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:20.050> it's

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
dead or they're not dead like that it's

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.700 
dead or they're not dead like that it's
over<00:01:20.710> ok<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.610> they<00:01:21.730> just<00:01:21.880> won't<00:01:24.360> maybe

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
over ok and they just won't maybe

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.320 
over ok and they just won't maybe
they're<00:01:26.710> trying<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.280> show<00:01:29.010> thank<00:01:30.010> our

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
they're trying to show thank our

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.140 
they're trying to show thank our
religions<00:01:31.330> like<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.840> whatever

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
religions like that whatever

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.880 
religions like that whatever
I<00:01:34.690> think<00:01:35.230> he<00:01:35.380> wants<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:36.670> know<00:01:37.360> why<00:01:38.140> little<00:01:38.680> bit

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
I think he wants to know why little bit

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.180 
I think he wants to know why little bit
like<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.960> she<00:01:40.990> can<00:01:41.260> actually<00:01:41.380> remember<00:01:41.710> not

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
like so she can actually remember not

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.960 
like so she can actually remember not
like<00:01:43.320> yeah<00:01:44.320> I'd<00:01:44.470> be<00:01:44.620> like<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:45.040> don't<00:01:45.190> want<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.640> do

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
like yeah I'd be like I don't want to do

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.540 
like yeah I'd be like I don't want to do
it<00:01:46.180> like<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.810> just<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.530> show<00:01:47.860> her<00:01:48.010> how<00:01:48.280> like

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
you kind of saying that like maybe it's

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.420 
you kind of saying that like maybe it's
like<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.840> power<00:01:56.170> from<00:01:56.530> her<00:01:56.650> religion<00:01:57.130> that<00:01:57.250> took

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
her a lesson and then I heard Carmen say

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.080 
her a lesson and then I heard Carmen say
I<00:02:02.530> think<00:02:02.800> maybe<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.460> think<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.760> maybe<00:02:03.850> it's

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
I think maybe you think it maybe it's

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.710 
I think maybe you think it maybe it's
just<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.390> dream<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.260> feels<00:02:05.500> very<00:02:05.710> real<00:02:06.220> and

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
just a dream so it feels very real and

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.070 
just a dream so it feels very real and
then<00:02:08.040> Anna<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:10.119> think<00:02:10.390> maybe<00:02:10.540> that<00:02:10.720> she's

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
then Anna you think maybe that she's

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.980 
then Anna you think maybe that she's
imagining<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.830> too<00:02:12.040> okay<00:02:12.910> do<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.570> think<00:02:13.780> it's

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
imagining it too okay do you think it's

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.050 
imagining it too okay do you think it's
okay<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.380> think<00:02:14.830> either<00:02:15.040> way<00:02:15.370> about<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.670> yeah

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
okay to think either way about it yeah

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.180 
okay to think either way about it yeah
because<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:17.200> does<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.530> story<00:02:17.770> still<00:02:18.040> make

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
because this does the story still make

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.430 
because this does the story still make
sense<00:02:18.430> if<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.700> believe<00:02:19.000> either<00:02:19.150> way<00:02:19.480> okay<00:02:20.110> I

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
sense if you believe either way okay I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.650 
sense if you believe either way okay I
think<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:21.040> main<00:02:21.250> point<00:02:21.520> is<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.390> just

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
think the main point is is that it just

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.190 
think the main point is is that it just
seems<00:02:22.900> very<00:02:23.230> real<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.970> she's<00:02:25.870> able

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
seems very real and so that she's able

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.050 
seems very real and so that she's able
to<00:02:26.500> experience<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.430> make<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.640> seem<00:02:28.030> real

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
to experience it and make it seem real

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.500 
to experience it and make it seem real
whether<00:02:28.930> Israel<00:02:29.260> or<00:02:29.680> not<00:02:30.090> okay<00:02:31.090> everybody
