00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
in the middle of a series of videos in

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.950 
in the middle of a series of videos in
the<00:00:07.560> language<00:00:08.040> are<00:00:08.400> where<00:00:09.269> we're<00:00:09.420> exploring

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
the language are where we're exploring

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.020 
the language are where we're exploring
the<00:00:10.200> basic<00:00:10.620> wat<00:00:10.830> commands<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.490> today<00:00:11.759> what

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the basic wat commands and today what

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.220 
the basic wat commands and today what
we're<00:00:12.150> going<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.330> do<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.660> spend<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.990> little<00:00:13.110> bit

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
we're going to do is spend a little bit

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.799 
we're going to do is spend a little bit
of<00:00:13.349> time<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:14.089> scratching<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.179> surface<00:00:15.389> of

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
of time on scratching the surface of

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.560 
of time on scratching the surface of
color<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:17.250> our<00:00:17.460> plots<00:00:17.789> there's<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> lot<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.270> ways

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
color in our plots there's a lot of ways

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.359 
color in our plots there's a lot of ways
to<00:00:19.050> accomplish<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.500> lot<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.890> pretty<00:00:20.039> cool

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
to accomplish a lot of pretty cool

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.160 
to accomplish a lot of pretty cool
things<00:00:20.730> but<00:00:20.970> we're<00:00:21.539> going<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.779> start<00:00:21.990> with<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
things but we're going to start with a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.470 
things but we're going to start with a
very<00:00:22.439> basic<00:00:22.800> building<00:00:23.490> blocks<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.000> color<00:00:24.240> so

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
very basic building blocks of color so

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:38.049 
very basic building blocks of color so
let's<00:00:25.289> take<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.529> look

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.250 

okay<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.120> we're<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> start<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:40.110> we

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
okay so we're going to start like we

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.540 
okay so we're going to start like we
have<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> last<00:00:40.739> couple<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.100> videos<00:00:41.160> we've

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
have in the last couple of videos we've

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.850 
have in the last couple of videos we've
just<00:00:41.850> some<00:00:42.120> nonsense<00:00:42.629> data<00:00:43.350> doesn't<00:00:43.620> mean

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
just some nonsense data doesn't mean

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.979 
just some nonsense data doesn't mean
anything<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:44.579> X<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.239> all<00:00:45.720> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
anything but we have X here all the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.080 
anything but we have X here all the
values<00:00:46.290> between<00:00:46.470> 100<00:00:47.070> why<00:00:47.250> use<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.579> logarithm

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
values between 100 why use the logarithm

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.299 
values between 100 why use the logarithm
of<00:00:48.300> X<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.199> it<00:00:49.379> would<00:00:49.500> take<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> look<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.070> what

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
of X and it would take a look at what

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.009 
of X and it would take a look at what
that<00:00:50.340> plot<00:00:50.760> looks<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.570> see<00:00:51.809> here

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
that plot looks like you can see here

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.530 
that plot looks like you can see here
nothing<00:00:52.320> too<00:00:52.469> shocking<00:00:52.800> we've<00:00:53.579> got<00:00:53.909> hollow

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
nothing too shocking we've got hollow

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.960 
nothing too shocking we've got hollow
black<00:00:54.900> circles<00:00:55.470> along<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.769> white<00:00:56.040> plane<00:00:56.400> we<00:00:56.730> can

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
black circles along a white plane we can

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.060 
black circles along a white plane we can
spice<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> change<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.350> by<00:00:58.800> simply

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
spice it up and change it by simply

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.590 
spice it up and change it by simply
setting<00:00:59.339> a<00:00:59.489> color<00:00:59.730> parameter<00:00:59.909> and<00:01:00.269> we<00:01:00.360> do<00:01:00.479> it

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
setting a color parameter and we do it

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.579 
setting a color parameter and we do it
like<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.930> within<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> black<00:01:01.559> community

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
like this within the black community

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.680 
like this within the black community
color<00:01:02.280> equals<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.850> you're<00:01:03.269> always<00:01:03.479> going<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
color equals and you're always going to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.410 
color equals and you're always going to
pass<00:01:03.839> its<00:01:04.080> strings<00:01:04.470> now<00:01:04.680> our<00:01:04.890> has<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.190> big<00:01:05.610> list

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
pass its strings now our has a big list

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.790 
pass its strings now our has a big list
of<00:01:06.720> colors<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.170> we'll<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.440> some<00:01:07.590> exploration

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
of colors and we'll do some exploration

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.350 
of colors and we'll do some exploration
of<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.399> future<00:01:08.520> videos<00:01:08.759> but<00:01:09.090> let's<00:01:09.240> just

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
of that in future videos but let's just

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.460 
of that in future videos but let's just
start<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.540> something<00:01:09.780> basic<00:01:09.929> here<00:01:10.289> let's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
start with something basic here let's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.990 
start with something basic here let's
make<00:01:10.679> it<00:01:10.710> red<00:01:11.039> and<00:01:11.360> if<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:13.009> swap<00:01:14.009> back<00:01:14.280> over<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
make it red and if we swap back over to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.510 
make it red and if we swap back over to
our<00:01:15.030> null<00:01:15.539> device<00:01:15.780> you'll<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.310> not<00:01:17.310> too

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
our null device you'll see not too

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.080 
our null device you'll see not too
complicated<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:19.460> x<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.880> y

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
complicated there you have it x and y

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.029 
complicated there you have it x and y
and<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.929> points<00:01:22.140> are<00:01:22.440> red<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:22.890> that's

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
and all of the points are red now that's

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.590 
and all of the points are red now that's
not<00:01:23.190> too<00:01:23.399> useful<00:01:23.580> too<00:01:23.910> excited<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.360> don't<00:01:24.509> have

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
not too useful too excited we don't have

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.910 
not too useful too excited we don't have
a<00:01:24.660> lot<00:01:24.690> of<00:01:24.840> reason<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> change<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.740> let

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
a lot of reason to change that let

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.800 
a lot of reason to change that let
outside<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.399> aesthetic<00:01:27.179> purposes<00:01:27.539> we<00:01:27.690> may

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
outside of aesthetic purposes we may

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.810 
outside of aesthetic purposes we may
have<00:01:27.929> but<00:01:28.080> let's<00:01:28.289> add<00:01:28.470> some<00:01:28.530> more<00:01:29.190> information

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
have but let's add some more information

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.630 
have but let's add some more information
there's<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> we'll<00:01:32.220> make<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.399> third

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
there's one so we'll make a third

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.279 
there's one so we'll make a third
variable<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.390> illustrate<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.050> point

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
variable here to illustrate the point

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:40.609 
variable here to illustrate the point
we'll<00:01:34.440> say<00:01:34.679> z<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.840> equal<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.110> x<00:01:37.440> /<00:01:37.979> 25<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.560> I

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
we'll say z is equal to x / 25 and if I

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.800 
we'll say z is equal to x / 25 and if I
want<00:01:40.800> to<00:01:40.830> add<00:01:41.009> information<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.390> plot<00:01:42.600> that's

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
want to add information to a plot that's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.260 
want to add information to a plot that's
already<00:01:43.290> active<00:01:43.890> put<00:01:44.640> something<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> null

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
already active put something in the null

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.370 
already active put something in the null
device<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.720> are<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.869> having<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> legend

information<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.220> our<00:01:50.399> current<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.570> did

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
information to our current one so did

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.580 
information to our current one so did
one<00:01:51.990> point<00:01:52.439> Z<00:01:52.890> here<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.479> if<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.659> handle<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.439> can

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
one point Z here and if we handle we can

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.429 
one point Z here and if we handle we can
see<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:57.270> line<00:01:57.600> here's<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.110> simple

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
see you have the line here's a simple

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.620 
see you have the line here's a simple
linear<00:01:59.159> result<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.240> X<00:02:00.540> /<00:02:00.899> 25<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.570> now<00:02:03.570> we

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
linear result of X / 25 and now we

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.030 
linear result of X / 25 and now we
understand<00:02:04.170> why<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.439> might<00:02:04.590> want<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.979> use

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
understand why you might want to use

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.810 
understand why you might want to use
color<00:02:05.340> we're<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.640> want<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
color we're going to want to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.139 
color we're going to want to
differentiate<00:02:06.240> between<00:02:06.630> X<00:02:07.289> and<00:02:08.149> where

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
differentiate between X and where

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.780 
differentiate between X and where
there's<00:02:09.269> I<00:02:09.420> y<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.780> z<00:02:10.250> here<00:02:11.250> between<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:11.760> two

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
there's I y and z here between the two

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.140 
there's I y and z here between the two
different<00:02:12.980> sets<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.220> because<00:02:14.519> especially

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
different sets here because especially

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.600 
different sets here because especially
down<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.690> lower<00:02:16.650> left<00:02:17.040> corner<00:02:17.340> it's

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
down in this lower left corner it's

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.740 
down in this lower left corner it's
tough<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.910> tell<00:02:18.090> which<00:02:18.299> thing<00:02:18.570> we're<00:02:18.720> looking

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
tough to tell which thing we're looking

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.099 
tough to tell which thing we're looking
at<00:02:19.079> so<00:02:19.290> what<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.590> would<00:02:19.739> do<00:02:20.239> is<00:02:21.239> say<00:02:21.840> when<00:02:22.019> we

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
at so what we would do is say when we

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.539 
at so what we would do is say when we
add<00:02:22.230> point<00:02:22.560> Z<00:02:22.799> we<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:23.070> set<00:02:23.220> our<00:02:23.250> color

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
add point Z we can set our color

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.550 
add point Z we can set our color
parameter<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.959> we'll<00:02:25.109> just<00:02:25.260> make<00:02:25.380> these

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
parameter and we'll just make these

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.470 
parameter and we'll just make these
green<00:02:25.859> at<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.100> pen<00:02:26.430> like<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.030> said<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.420> got

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
green at the pen like I said you got

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.880 
green at the pen like I said you got
many<00:02:27.780> colors<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.170> choose<00:02:28.320> from<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.709> we'll

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
many colors to choose from the we'll

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.560 
many colors to choose from the we'll
just<00:02:28.920> use<00:02:29.220> easily<00:02:29.700> recognizable<00:02:30.269> ones<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.510> we

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
just use easily recognizable ones and we

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.660 
just use easily recognizable ones and we
go<00:02:30.750> back<00:02:30.930> over<00:02:31.230> our<00:02:31.320> plot<00:02:31.530> now<00:02:32.040> we<00:02:32.100> can<00:02:32.340> easily

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
go back over our plot now we can easily

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.810 
go back over our plot now we can easily
tell<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.870> lower<00:02:34.320> one<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.650> black<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.579> it

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
tell that that lower one is black and it

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.180 
tell that that lower one is black and it
belongs<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.140> x<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.410> y<00:02:37.500> values<00:02:37.530> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
belongs to just the x and y values and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.740 
belongs to just the x and y values and
the<00:02:38.730> Z<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.060> X<00:02:39.120> values<00:02:40.459> are<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:42.150> green<00:02:42.450> there<00:02:42.630> so

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the Z and X values are in green there so

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.569 
the Z and X values are in green there so
that<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.019> very<00:02:43.380> basic<00:02:43.620> looking<00:02:44.130> color<00:02:44.340> and

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
that is a very basic looking color and

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.370 
that is a very basic looking color and
how<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.180> would<00:02:45.420> employ<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.810> differentiate

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
how you would employ the differentiate

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.689 
how you would employ the differentiate
things<00:02:46.620> now<00:02:46.739> that's<00:02:46.919> one<00:02:47.130> way<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.340> can<00:02:47.549> do<00:02:47.669> it

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:47.699 
things now that's one way you can do it

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.849 
things now that's one way you can do it
and<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.510> very<00:02:48.600> nice<00:02:48.900> because<00:02:49.079> we<00:02:49.320> have<00:02:49.470> three

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
and it's very nice because we have three

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:50.840 
and it's very nice because we have three
vector

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
vector

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.190 
vector
representing<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:51.600> we<00:02:51.690> don't<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.050> eat<00:02:52.170> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
representing but we don't have to eat a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.900 
representing but we don't have to eat a
three-dimensional<00:02:52.800> plot<00:02:53.010> basically<00:02:53.820> we

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
three-dimensional plot basically we

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.040 
three-dimensional plot basically we
could<00:02:54.030> easily<00:02:54.180> print<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.690> show<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.870> people

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
could easily print and show to people

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.240 
could easily print and show to people
and<00:02:55.260> have<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.470> be<00:02:55.560> quite<00:02:55.800> communicative

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
and have it be quite communicative

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.220 
and have it be quite communicative
services<00:02:56.730> why<00:02:56.940> colors<00:02:57.360> importantly<00:02:57.870> map

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
services why colors importantly map

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.890 
services why colors importantly map
things<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.190> let's<00:02:59.430> take<00:02:59.610> one<00:03:00.180> further<00:03:00.630> look

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
things so let's take one further look

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.870 
things so let's take one further look
and<00:03:01.080> very<00:03:01.230> basic<00:03:01.680> use<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.860> color<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.460> that's

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
and very basic use of color and that's

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.250 
and very basic use of color and that's
to<00:03:03.060> color<00:03:03.240> something<00:03:03.540> buy<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.660> property<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.230> has

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
to color something buy a property it has

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.470 
to color something buy a property it has
and<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:04.800> do<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.670> are<00:03:05.700> going<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:06.000> load<00:03:06.270> up

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
and to do that we are going to load up

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.420 
and to do that we are going to load up
what<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.780> r<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:06.960> built-in<00:03:07.440> data<00:03:07.620> sets<00:03:07.950> now<00:03:08.130> this

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
what it r is built-in data sets now this

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.740 
what it r is built-in data sets now this
is<00:03:08.580> something<00:03:08.790> you'll<00:03:08.970> see<00:03:09.120> probably<00:03:09.540> if<00:03:09.630> you

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
is something you'll see probably if you

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
instructional things that are out there

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.290 
instructional things that are out there
that<00:03:15.870> are<00:03:16.380> has<00:03:16.770> built-in<00:03:17.340> data<00:03:17.790> sets<00:03:18.150> a

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
that are has built-in data sets a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.940 
that are has built-in data sets a
variety<00:03:18.960> of<00:03:19.110> sorts<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.530> we're<00:03:19.710> going<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.920> use

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
variety of sorts so we're going to use

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.090 
variety of sorts so we're going to use
one<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.370> those<00:03:20.490> datasets<00:03:21.050> cold<00:03:22.050> iris<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:22.980> it's

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
one of those datasets cold iris and it's

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.270 
one of those datasets cold iris and it's
about<00:03:23.190> flowers<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:25.230> we<00:03:25.350> use<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.830> command<00:03:26.040> data

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
about flowers so we use the command data

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.980 
about flowers so we use the command data
iris<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.060> do<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.360> if<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.540> want<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.750> look<00:03:27.810> at

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
iris to do that if you want to look at

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.590 
iris to do that if you want to look at
it<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.740> certainly<00:03:29.070> can<00:03:29.340> too<00:03:30.210> big<00:03:30.360> for<00:03:30.540> the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
it you certainly can too big for the

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.290 
it you certainly can too big for the
screen<00:03:31.160> but<00:03:32.160> if<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.370> look<00:03:32.520> at<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:32.940> ahead<00:03:33.120> of

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
screen but if you look at just ahead of

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.050 
screen but if you look at just ahead of
it<00:03:33.510> which<00:03:33.630> we<00:03:33.750> taught<00:03:33.960> you<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.260> repeatedly<00:03:35.060> you

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
it which we taught you to repeatedly you

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.900 
it which we taught you to repeatedly you
can<00:03:36.240> see<00:03:36.390> we<00:03:36.510> have<00:03:36.690> five<00:03:37.080> different<00:03:38.010> qualities

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
can see we have five different qualities

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.600 
can see we have five different qualities
of<00:03:38.940> iris<00:03:39.540> flowers<00:03:39.960> and<00:03:40.310> we're<00:03:41.310> going<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.460> use

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
of iris flowers and we're going to use

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.070 
of iris flowers and we're going to use
color<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:42.030> differentiate<00:03:42.450> between<00:03:42.570> them<00:03:42.930> and

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
color to differentiate between them and

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.340 
color to differentiate between them and
I'll<00:03:43.260> show<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.500> how<00:03:44.660> so<00:03:45.660> I'm<00:03:45.810> going<00:03:46.020> to<00:03:46.050> plot

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
I'll show you how so I'm going to plot

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.930 
I'll show you how so I'm going to plot
some<00:03:46.740> vectors<00:03:47.160> out<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:47.490> data<00:03:47.700> frames

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
some vectors out of this data frames

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.760 
some vectors out of this data frames
from<00:03:48.030> columns<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.630> we'll<00:03:49.080> do<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:49.500> quite

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
from columns and we'll do this quite

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.160 
from columns and we'll do this quite
simply<00:03:50.040> by<00:03:50.160> you<00:03:50.220> shooting<00:03:50.520> from<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.730> lot<00:03:51.170> iris

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
simply by you shooting from a lot iris

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.500 
simply by you shooting from a lot iris
and<00:03:52.860> we'll<00:03:53.070> subset<00:03:53.550> iris<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.360> will<00:03:54.870> save<00:03:55.080> petal

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
and we'll subset iris to will save petal

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.820 
and we'll subset iris to will save petal
length<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.170> don't<00:03:58.320> know<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.470> darn<00:03:58.740> thing

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
length and I don't know a darn thing

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.500 
length and I don't know a darn thing
about<00:03:59.280> irises<00:03:59.790> but<00:03:59.970> petal<00:04:00.210> length<00:04:00.300> makes

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
about irises but petal length makes

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.940 
about irises but petal length makes
sense<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.840> me<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.080> it's<00:04:01.200> pedal<00:04:01.380> with<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:01.800> those

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
sense to me so it's pedal with so those

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.130 
sense to me so it's pedal with so those
are<00:04:02.100> easy<00:04:02.250> enough<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.700> understand<00:04:03.090> let's<00:04:03.930> see

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
are easy enough to understand let's see

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.320 
are easy enough to understand let's see
if<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:05.160> show<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:05.760> looks<00:04:05.970> like<00:04:06.120> anything

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
if you show it looks like anything

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.190 
if you show it looks like anything
rather<00:04:06.630> than<00:04:06.750> we<00:04:06.930> plot<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.320> i<00:04:08.960> repel<00:04:09.960> length

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
rather than we plot it i repel length

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.580 
rather than we plot it i repel length
and<00:04:10.380> iris<00:04:10.590> petal<00:04:10.890> width<00:04:11.960> and<00:04:12.960> if<00:04:13.290> we<00:04:13.380> issue

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
and iris petal width and if we issue

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.590 
and iris petal width and if we issue
this<00:04:13.680> command<00:04:13.740> will<00:04:14.100> see<00:04:14.310> we<00:04:14.550> get<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:15.330> looks

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
this command will see we get that looks

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.090 
this command will see we get that looks
like<00:04:15.750> in<00:04:15.930> general<00:04:16.109> as<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.739> pedal<00:04:16.980> link

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
like in general as the pedal link

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.530 
like in general as the pedal link
increases<00:04:17.580> so<00:04:17.730> does<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.880> pellet<00:04:18.299> that's

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
increases so does the pellet that's

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.320 
increases so does the pellet that's
informative<00:04:18.960> but<00:04:19.739> these<00:04:20.100> are<00:04:20.340> irish's<00:04:21.210> of

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
informative but these are irish's of

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.030 
informative but these are irish's of
different<00:04:21.600> species<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.140> maybe<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.560> species

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
different species and maybe the species

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.550 
different species and maybe the species
I<00:04:23.340> will<00:04:24.000> have<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.450> know<00:04:24.510> different<00:04:24.600> petal

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
I will have you know different petal

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.920 
I will have you know different petal
links<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.890> pedal<00:04:26.070> wits<00:04:26.550> in<00:04:26.910> gentleman<00:04:27.420> than

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
links and pedal wits in gentleman than

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
links and pedal wits in gentleman than
each<00:04:28.050> other<00:04:28.320> maybe<00:04:28.710> they'll<00:04:28.890> be

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
each other maybe they'll be

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.800 
each other maybe they'll be
differentiated<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.670> way<00:04:29.790> and<00:04:29.970> so<00:04:30.510> we<00:04:30.660> can

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
differentiated that way and so we can

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.540 
differentiated that way and so we can
issue<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.200> command<00:04:31.500> like<00:04:31.710> this<00:04:31.890> was<00:04:32.070> in<00:04:32.190> colored

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
issue a command like this was in colored

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.610 
issue a command like this was in colored
and<00:04:32.760> instead<00:04:33.270> of<00:04:33.390> setting<00:04:34.140> it<00:04:34.200> equal<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.590> a

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
and instead of setting it equal to a

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.950 
and instead of setting it equal to a
string<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:35.280> represents<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.480> color<00:04:36.660> value

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
string that represents a color value

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.820 
string that represents a color value
what<00:04:37.050> we're<00:04:37.140> going<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.320> do<00:04:37.380> is<00:04:37.530> just<00:04:37.650> set<00:04:37.800> it

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
what we're going to do is just set it

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.180 
what we're going to do is just set it
equal<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.190> some<00:04:38.630> factor<00:04:39.630> property<00:04:40.170> of<00:04:40.530> this

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
equal to some factor property of this

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.890 
equal to some factor property of this
data<00:04:41.460> set<00:04:41.700> so<00:04:41.760> you<00:04:42.030> can<00:04:42.360> automatically

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
data set so you can automatically

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.990 
data set so you can automatically
determine<00:04:43.500> how<00:04:43.560> to<00:04:43.620> color<00:04:43.800> x<00:04:44.010> factor<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.610> the

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
determine how to color x factor and the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.070 
determine how to color x factor and the
fact<00:04:45.210> we're<00:04:45.390> going<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.570> use<00:04:45.690> your<00:04:45.810> species

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
fact we're going to use your species

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.030 
fact we're going to use your species
like<00:04:46.440> i<00:04:46.590> said<00:04:46.800> virus<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:49.050> species<00:04:49.560> quality

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
like i said virus the species quality

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.080 
like i said virus the species quality
and<00:04:50.790> when<00:04:51.000> we<00:04:51.090> issue<00:04:51.210> this<00:04:51.420> command<00:04:51.480> and<00:04:52.110> hot

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
and when we issue this command and hot

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.970

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
examination of how you can use color to

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.050 
examination of how you can use color to
differentiate<00:05:13.540> points<00:05:14.290> on<00:05:14.470> plots<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:15.060> we're

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
differentiate points on plots and we're

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.030 
differentiate points on plots and we're
going<00:05:16.180> to<00:05:16.210> spend<00:05:16.449> more<00:05:16.990> time<00:05:17.290> in<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.860> future

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
going to spend more time in the future

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.920 
going to spend more time in the future
on<00:05:18.460> color<00:05:19.000> because<00:05:19.330> there<00:05:19.479> are<00:05:19.540> a<00:05:19.570> lot<00:05:19.660> of<00:05:19.690> very

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
on color because there are a lot of very

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.840 
on color because there are a lot of very
things<00:05:20.290> you<00:05:20.410> can<00:05:20.560> do<00:05:20.650> with<00:05:20.800> radiance<00:05:21.310> there's

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
things you can do with radiance there's

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.790 
things you can do with radiance there's
a<00:05:21.940> lot<00:05:22.120> of<00:05:22.150> very<00:05:22.510> interesting<00:05:22.840> way<00:05:23.500> you<00:05:23.560> can

a lot of very interesting way you can

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.100 
a lot of very interesting way you can
get<00:05:23.860> a<00:05:23.919> lot<00:05:24.100> of<00:05:24.130> information<00:05:24.790> into<00:05:25.660> a<00:05:25.690> simple

get a lot of information into a simple
two-dimensional<00:05:26.290> space<00:05:26.740> but<00:05:27.310> that's<00:05:27.490> a<00:05:27.610> taste

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
two-dimensional space but that's a taste

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.030 
two-dimensional space but that's a taste
