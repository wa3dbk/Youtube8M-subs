00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
actually manifest through music and I

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.350 
actually manifest through music and I
think<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.340> language<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.030> this

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
think that is the language it is this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.150 
think that is the language it is this
language<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> heart<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.559> mind<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.920> soul

and<00:00:39.170> what<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.320> beautiful<00:00:41.160> about<00:00:41.399> revisiting

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
and what is beautiful about revisiting

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.279 
and what is beautiful about revisiting
compositions<00:00:43.620> by<00:00:44.520> composers<00:00:45.149> who<00:00:45.450> were<00:00:45.719> here

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
compositions by composers who were here

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.560 
compositions by composers who were here
in<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.680> 30s<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.579> know<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.450> were

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
in the 30s and you know they were

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.180 
in the 30s and you know they were
writing<00:00:49.020> these<00:00:49.170> great<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.710> many<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.100> them

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
writing these great and many of them

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.910 
writing these great and many of them
were<00:00:50.250> written<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.640> late<00:00:50.820> 30s<00:00:51.530> at<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> peak

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
were written in the late 30s at the peak

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.430 
were written in the late 30s at the peak
probably<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.579> their<00:00:54.140> positioning<00:00:55.140> their

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
probably of their positioning their

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.459 
probably of their positioning their
compositional<00:00:56.250> prowess<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
compositional prowess is that the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.560 
compositional prowess is that the
emotions<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.100> they<00:00:59.370> are<00:00:59.430> addressing<00:00:59.820> are

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
emotions that they are addressing are

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.939 
emotions that they are addressing are
still<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> same<00:01:01.109> emotions<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.739> we

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
still the same emotions that we

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.890 
still the same emotions that we

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and I loved that I loved that I could it

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.469 
and I loved that I loved that I could it
felt<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.070> only<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.909> you're<00:01:15.210> able<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
felt like not only was you're able to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.820 
felt like not only was you're able to
commune<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> song<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.680> you're

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
commune with the song but you're

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.399 
commune with the song but you're
thinking<00:01:17.040> about<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:18.210> people<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.110> were<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
thinking about the people that were the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.109 
thinking about the people that were the
source<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.920> song<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> sentiment

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
source of the song and the sentiment

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940 
source of the song and the sentiment
that<00:01:21.210> they're<00:01:21.450> trying<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> express<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> then

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that they're trying to express and then

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.340 
that they're trying to express and then
you're<00:01:23.100> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> breathing<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.090> fresh<00:01:24.689> life<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
you're kind of breathing a fresh life a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.440 
you're kind of breathing a fresh life a
fresh<00:01:25.979> interpretation<00:01:26.159> into<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.210> was

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
fresh interpretation into it that was

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.950 
fresh interpretation into it that was
that<00:01:28.020> was<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.259> real<00:01:29.240> intriguing<00:01:30.240> thing<00:01:30.689> for

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that was the real intriguing thing for

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.929 
that was the real intriguing thing for
me<00:01:31.079> first<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.159> came<00:01:32.220> into<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.700> songs

me first of all I came into the songs
almost<00:01:33.119> naively<00:01:33.750> because<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.799> my<00:01:34.920> genre

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
almost naively because it's not my genre

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.039 
almost naively because it's not my genre
and<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.670> knew<00:01:36.090> some<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> songs<00:01:36.689> obviously
