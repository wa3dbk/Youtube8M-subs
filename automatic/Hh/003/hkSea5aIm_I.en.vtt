like I said it's just it has to be done

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.940 
like I said it's just it has to be done
someone<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:39.090> know<00:02:39.180> if<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.989> don't<00:02:40.230> if<00:02:40.890> you

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
someone you know if you don't if you

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.339 
someone you know if you don't if you
don't<00:02:41.130> talk<00:02:41.489> about<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.819> then<00:02:42.270> your<00:02:43.020> neighbors

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
don't talk about it then your neighbors

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.140 
don't talk about it then your neighbors
are<00:02:43.470> not<00:02:43.620> ignorant<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.520> it's<00:02:45.030> not

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
are not ignorant to it and it's not

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.699 
are not ignorant to it and it's not
their<00:02:45.330> fault<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.810> they<00:02:46.110> just<00:02:46.260> don't<00:02:46.440> know

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
their fault is that they just don't know

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.670 
their fault is that they just don't know
so<00:02:47.370> if<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:48.300> if<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.660> can<00:02:48.870> make<00:02:49.050> someone<00:02:49.440> else
