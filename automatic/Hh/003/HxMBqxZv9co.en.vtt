resource to exploit the symbiosis for
each<00:00:52.800> resource<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.550> an<00:00:53.730> additional<00:00:54.300> bonus

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
each resource is an additional bonus

when certain conditions are met for

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.970 
when certain conditions are met for
example<00:00:57.239> chickens<00:00:57.809> will<00:00:57.989> provide<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.620> food

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
example chickens will provide more food

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.279 
example chickens will provide more food
when<00:00:59.250> placed<00:00:59.579> adjacent<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.449> blueberries<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
when placed adjacent to blueberries and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.380 
when placed adjacent to blueberries and
this<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.609> thing<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.820> need<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.149> do

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
this is the kind of thing you need to do

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.179 
this is the kind of thing you need to do
because<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.049> space<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> villages<00:01:04.979> is

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
because the space in the villages is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.850 
because the space in the villages is
very<00:01:05.580> limited<00:01:06.229> optimizing<00:01:07.229> usage<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
very limited optimizing usage of the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.670 
very limited optimizing usage of the
land<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.340> how<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.729> progress<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> game<00:01:09.680> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
land is how you progress in the game the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.410 
land is how you progress in the game the
villages<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.400> each<00:01:11.640> work<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.119> their<00:01:12.299> own

villages will each work on their own

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.390 
villages will each work on their own
project<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.470> depends<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> land

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400

a time limit on them they may also have

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.330 
a time limit on them they may also have
some<00:01:21.420> additional<00:01:21.659> requirements<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.799> having

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
some additional requirements like having

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.760 
some additional requirements like having

a certain amount of plant or animals but

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.130 
a certain amount of plant or animals but
sometimes<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.939> need<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> kill<00:01:27.540> someone<00:01:27.810> I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
sometimes you need to kill someone I

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.550 
sometimes you need to kill someone I
like<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.119> this<00:01:30.119> unlocks<00:01:30.540> new<00:01:30.840> aspects<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
like that this unlocks new aspects and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
like that this unlocks new aspects and
levels<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.130> your<00:01:32.280> abilities<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.210> can

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
levels up your abilities so you can

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.170 
levels up your abilities so you can
create<00:01:33.780> more<00:01:34.079> potent<00:01:34.590> resources<00:01:35.310> that's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
create more potent resources that's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.420 
create more potent resources that's
really<00:01:36.659> all<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.310> that's

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
really all there is to it but that's

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.149 
really all there is to it but that's
just<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.909> part<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.570> control<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.650> other<00:01:40.799> part

their<00:01:52.170> resources<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.700> they<00:01:53.850> really<00:01:54.149> want

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
their resources and if they really want

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.450

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
it to be a bunch of jerks they can

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.179 
it to be a bunch of jerks they can
attack<00:01:56.759> your<00:01:57.000> Giants<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.600> well<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.950> have

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
attack your Giants as well so you have

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.120 
attack your Giants as well so you have
to<00:01:59.460> teach<00:01:59.670> them<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.030> lesson<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:01.649> goal<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
to teach them a lesson the goal of the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490 
to teach them a lesson the goal of the
game<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.549> achieve<00:02:02.850> specific<00:02:03.500> developments

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
game is to achieve specific developments

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.530 
game is to achieve specific developments
things<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.250> obtaining<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.030> certain<00:02:06.360> amount

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
things like obtaining a certain amount

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.809 
things like obtaining a certain amount
of<00:02:06.719> prosperity<00:02:07.259> using<00:02:07.649> only<00:02:08.310> specific

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
of prosperity using only specific

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.630 
of prosperity using only specific
resources<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.020> village<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.590> really<00:02:11.340> weird

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
resources in a village and really weird

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.960 
resources in a village and really weird
stuff<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:12.000> that

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
stuff like that

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.450 
stuff like that
so<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.510> sense<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.410> game<00:02:14.620> revolves<00:02:15.130> around

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460

so in a sense the game revolves around
obtaining<00:02:16.390> achievements<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.920> games<00:02:18.130> are<00:02:18.310> set

different types of planets but I've seen
a<00:02:31.150> couple<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.660> things<00:02:31.900> I'm<00:02:32.170> not<00:02:32.200> liking<00:02:33.010> about

is<00:03:04.150> something<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:04.600> feel<00:03:04.900> should<00:03:05.230> be<00:03:05.290> explained

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
is something I feel should be explained

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.190 
is something I feel should be explained

to the player showing the prerequisites

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.290 
to the player showing the prerequisites

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
would go a long way to avoiding this

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.740 
would go a long way to avoiding this

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
this game it's more of a mild interest

this game it's more of a mild interest
the<00:03:40.600> developer<00:03:41.200> has<00:03:41.440> mentioned<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:42.160> mac<00:03:42.400> in<00:03:42.610> the
