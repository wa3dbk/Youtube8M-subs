00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.240
 They are easy to manufacture and 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.890
 still very elegant if you are her 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.779
 properly present here in germany 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.689

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.310
 Filling known quite honestly 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.880
 such an ugly name for that 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.559
 a fine dining as with most 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.600
 I think my favorite dish too 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.399
 Nothing beats the original here 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.829
 So make authentic today 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.950
 French eclair with a cream 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.770
 Patissier for the show part need more 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.710
 100 grams of butter 240 grams of flour six 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.960
 Half a teaspoon of salt and 300 eggs 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.020
 milliliters of water will make the brim dc 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.590
 built with 240 grams of sugar 120 grams 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.600

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 milliliters of milk and two and a half 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.949
 tablespoons of cocoa powder which are optional 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.360
 for the chocolate cream for one 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.250
 you can get richer and tastier 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.960
 also take melted chocolate and 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.130
 Finally, 100 grams of chocolate 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:20.220
 Covers for the couverture of this 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.700
 recipe gives about 22 to 25 explains each 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.170
 How big you shape your shell 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.820
 Let's start with the dough and heat it up 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.250
 water with the butter on high heat 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.150
 until the water begins to boil 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.470
 Switched the cooker to medium heat 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.130
 and cook it for another 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.140
 then you make her whole 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.700
 fill in the sieved flour and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.409
 Stir until the dough stops at the pot 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.409
 stick what does not walk there long 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.909
 take the pot from the heat 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.159
 and after every two eggs and for that 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.289
 very neat with a hand mixer or 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.729
 a wooden spoon by driving on this 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.100
 continue until he has all six eggs 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.899
 have processed everything 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.140
 to mix evenly 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.310
 a lot of time with the tube 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.750
 take your garnier syringe and 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.399
 Combine these with a large grommet 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.990
 to shape the shoe tick 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.610
 if your syringe without big 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.610
 you could be delivered too 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.870
 simply without a phone 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.550
 if you do not inject gallate at hand 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.100
 you can just have one for this 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.600
 solid run this piece on a 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.340
 glass and filled with the part 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.970
 then one corner cuts and 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.739
 finished your spurting turns the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.110
 open side of the freezer to and 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.790
 Outflow to stabilize price the bag 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.130
 Slow down and come to an end 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.799
 Continue until the dough is even 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.310
 Exit draws straight lines and bagdad 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.099
 at 180 degrees Celsius for 25 to 30 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.630
 minutes does not think the dough 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.670
 immediately take out of the oven with the 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.260
 dough is ready baked otherwise it will 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.000
 He let go the oven door 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.950
 instead, a gap opens so that 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.950
 feel pastry slowly and evenly 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.930
 we can beat for the creme patissia 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.880
 the somewhat fluid then we add the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.799
 Add sugar with this short in the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.100
 but not into it 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.870
 completely dissolve in it must exist 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.090
 the sieved flour stirs this 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.489
 you add me to it and everything comes 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.870
 under all that all my 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.870
 this year's favorite word is 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.220
 put the whole thing on the stove and 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.180
 heated under constant stirring 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.000
 medium low heat 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.480
 that's the level 1 5 with me on one 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.380
 scale from one to three 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.000
 resists the temptation is fast 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.100
 to cook on high heat because the 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.350
 Cream burning very easily is easy 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.850
 until the cream festival has it 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.590
 with me from the moment I called the 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.660
 got up to the moment as 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.890
 I took the pot from heat 20 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.890
 taken up to 25 minutes 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.180
 add the vanilla sugar to the cream 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.130
 splits the bodies two halves and adds 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:56.410
 Hofer bought half of it for 42 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:58.200
 I wanted to make cream education next to yours 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.910
 dough and do not cut it on either 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.950
 n24 again day has risen and he 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.590
 both it is super easy with the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.150
 cream to fill 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.520
 missing another guided with the 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.350
 cream cuts off a corner and fills it 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.720
 the push with the crÃ¨me patissia 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:18.609
 we clarify already wonderfully let 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.440
 finally, move on to the overture 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.450
 For this you heat the chocolates 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.370
 couverture in a water bath not the 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.990
 chocolate for it in a bowl and 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.090
 These turn into a larger pot 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.650
 for this with water until the 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.630
 water level half the height of the 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.240
 bowl has reached a very elegant 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.190
 set i know puts the stove on high 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.110
 Heat and chill the chocolate until you get it 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.850
 is completely melted oh yes me 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.340
 feel the couverture to the flat side 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:49.050
 explains that it looks like that and 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.050
 for that I turn them all over before 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.630
 points explained in the chocolate and 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:59.050
 Leave a while on the tin 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:01.210
 cool down I hope you tried 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.620
 this pastry will soon be sorted out like that 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.450
 delicious that here several of them 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.580
 on a hood and handy to 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.900
 they are also in a nice take away 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.389
 Packaging will also be the perfect 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.490
 gift for the white day in the infobox 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.110

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.400
 can make gifts boxes yourself 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.080
 I was immediately excited about it 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.370
 They have found themselves for many 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.300
 opportunities are suitable and easy 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.669
 can be individually designed 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.200
 Thank you for watching, I hope you 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.639
 Take a second of my video time 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.800

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.110
