00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
comparison so without further ado let's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910 
comparison so without further ado let's
introduce<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.360> parts<00:01:06.750> let's<00:01:07.439> start<00:01:07.710> off<00:01:07.830> with

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
introduce the parts let's start off with

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.030 
introduce the parts let's start off with
the<00:01:08.070> tower<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> fractal<00:01:10.140> excel<00:01:10.619> r2

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the tower this is the fractal excel r2

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.679 
the tower this is the fractal excel r2
and<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.369> basically<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.880> larger<00:01:12.270> version<00:01:12.570> of

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
and it's basically a larger version of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.410 
and it's basically a larger version of
the<00:01:12.840> define<00:01:13.170> r4<00:01:13.710> which<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> tower<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.030> used

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the define r4 which is the tower I used

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.469 
the define r4 which is the tower I used
for<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:15.840> custom<00:01:16.320> PC<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.490> goes<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:17.939> 100<00:01:18.270> bucks

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
for my custom PC this goes for 100 bucks

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.179 
for my custom PC this goes for 100 bucks
and<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.840> chose<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.259> case<00:01:19.470> because<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:19.979> want

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
and we chose this case because we want

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.249 
and we chose this case because we want
to<00:01:20.280> go<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> silent<00:01:21.060> build<00:01:21.270> after<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
to go with a silent build after all the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.200 
to go with a silent build after all the
Mac<00:01:22.439> Pro<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:23.189> quiet<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.790> want<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
Mac Pro is really quiet and we want to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.080 
Mac Pro is really quiet and we want to
match<00:01:24.390> every<00:01:24.720> aspect<00:01:25.170> as<00:01:25.350> close<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.890> possible

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
match every aspect as close as possible

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.310 
match every aspect as close as possible
we<00:01:27.090> could<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.390> bought<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> smaller<00:01:27.840> Tower<00:01:28.110> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
we could have bought a smaller Tower to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.020 
we could have bought a smaller Tower to
be<00:01:28.439> comparable<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> Mac<00:01:29.340> Pro<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.909> we

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
be comparable to the Mac Pro but we

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.819 
be comparable to the Mac Pro but we
opted<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.630> bigger<00:01:30.869> tower<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.470> future

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
