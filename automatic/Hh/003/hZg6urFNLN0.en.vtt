00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
like the overall build quality of this

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.380 
like the overall build quality of this
tablet<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.289> better<00:00:31.619> than<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.009> 500<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.210> just

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
tablet but better than the a 500 it just

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.270 
tablet but better than the a 500 it just
feels<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> little<00:00:33.840> bit<00:00:34.020> more<00:00:34.079> solid<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
feels a little bit more solid there the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.560 
feels a little bit more solid there the
nice<00:00:35.399> thing<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.940> about<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.360> it's

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
nice thing we like about is that it's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.910 
nice thing we like about is that it's
not<00:00:36.750> as<00:00:36.870> wide<00:00:37.110> compared<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.620> some<00:00:37.770> other

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
not as wide compared to some other

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.530 
not as wide compared to some other
similar<00:00:38.219> sized<00:00:38.550> tablet<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.239> easier<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
similar sized tablet so it's easier to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.180 
similar sized tablet so it's easier to
hold<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> hand<00:00:40.079> overall<00:00:40.920> there's<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
hold in the hand overall there's a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.350 
hold in the hand overall there's a
little<00:00:41.340> bit<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> weight<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.210> most

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
little bit of weight to it but the most

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.060 
little bit of weight to it but the most
part<00:00:42.660> we're<00:00:42.870> happy<00:00:43.110> with<00:00:43.200> overall<00:00:43.680> design

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
part we're happy with overall design

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.850 
part we're happy with overall design
presenting<00:00:44.940> us<00:00:45.059> with<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.329> 7<00:00:45.780> inch<00:00:45.930> LCD<00:00:46.140> display

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
presenting us with a 7 inch LCD display

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.580 
presenting us with a 7 inch LCD display
it<00:00:47.100> features<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> resolution<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.300> 1024<00:00:48.960> by<00:00:49.170> 600

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it features a resolution of 1024 by 600

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.439 
it features a resolution of 1024 by 600
pixels<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> same<00:00:50.910> thing<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.210> see<00:00:51.360> in

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
pixels so it's the same thing we see in

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.869 
pixels so it's the same thing we see in
other<00:00:51.690> 7-inch<00:00:52.500> tablets<00:00:52.980> out<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
other 7-inch tablets out there so it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.520 
other 7-inch tablets out there so it
does<00:00:54.000> produce<00:00:54.149> some<00:00:54.420> fine<00:00:54.660> details<00:00:54.899> very

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
does produce some fine details very

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.920 
does produce some fine details very
clear<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.340> also<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> colors<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
clear we also like the colors to from a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.569 
clear we also like the colors to from a
straight<00:00:58.109> angle<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.620> now<00:00:58.800> i<00:00:59.100> produce<00:00:59.370> some

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
straight angle like now i produce some

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.490 
straight angle like now i produce some
deep<00:00:59.789> tones<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.270> we'd<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.539> saturated<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
deep tones that we'd like saturated in a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.349 
deep tones that we'd like saturated in a
way<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.129> unfortunately<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.789> its<00:01:02.940> poor

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
way but unfortunately with its poor

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.179 
way but unfortunately with its poor
brightness<00:01:03.870> output<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.500> also<00:01:04.619> viewing

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
brightness output and also viewing

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.980 
brightness output and also viewing
angles<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.850> makes<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> very<00:01:06.270> hard<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> view<00:01:06.900> an

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
angles it makes it very hard to view an

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.539 
angles it makes it very hard to view an
outdoor<00:01:07.260> conditions<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.369> could<00:01:08.460> be

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
outdoor conditions and it could be

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.980 
outdoor conditions and it could be
something<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> overall<00:01:09.210> size<00:01:09.510> but

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
something with just the overall size but

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.719 
something with just the overall size but
we<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.170> find<00:01:10.470> find<00:01:10.830> ourselves<00:01:10.979> constantly

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we just find find ourselves constantly

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.789 
we just find find ourselves constantly
pressing<00:01:11.939> something<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.540> register<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.200> about
