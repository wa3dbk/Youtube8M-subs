00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
can kind of compare it to with the new

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.370 
can kind of compare it to with the new
de<00:01:03.809> season<00:01:04.580> but<00:01:05.630> actually<00:01:06.630> i<00:01:06.659> think<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.080> map

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
de season but actually i think this map

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.800 
de season but actually i think this map
looks<00:01:07.860> bit<00:01:08.729> more<00:01:09.000> awesome<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.520> tests

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
looks bit more awesome of all the tests

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.480 
looks bit more awesome of all the tests
very<00:01:13.810> very<00:01:14.020> good<00:01:14.170> visibility<00:01:14.650> in<00:01:15.159> all<00:01:15.340> the

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
very very good visibility in all the

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.469 
very very good visibility in all the
important<00:01:15.880> areas<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.250> B<00:01:18.400> spot<00:01:18.670> looks

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
important areas so the B spot looks

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.109 
important areas so the B spot looks
pretty<00:01:20.140> much<00:01:20.200> like<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.830> old<00:01:20.979> spot<00:01:21.250> with<00:01:21.790> this

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
pretty much like the old spot with this

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.080 
pretty much like the old spot with this
nude<00:01:22.360> with<00:01:23.050> these<00:01:23.200> new<00:01:23.350> changes<00:01:23.590> from<00:01:24.250> add<00:01:25.060> a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
nude with these new changes from add a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.899 
nude with these new changes from add a
big<00:01:25.300> ramp<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:26.140> little<00:01:26.409> ramp<00:01:26.590> right<00:01:26.800> here

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
big ramp and a little ramp right here

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.820 
big ramp and a little ramp right here
why<00:01:27.909> you<00:01:27.970> can't<00:01:28.330> really<00:01:28.570> can<00:01:28.930> come<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.740> the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
why you can't really can come to the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.700 
why you can't really can come to the
camp<00:01:30.009> anymore<00:01:30.250> right<00:01:30.759> here<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:32.259> that's<00:01:32.500> also

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
camp anymore right here so that's also

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.850 
camp anymore right here so that's also
pretty<00:01:33.070> good<00:01:33.280> change<00:01:34.229> makes<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.380> piece<00:01:35.560> pots

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
pretty good change makes the piece pots

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.100 
pretty good change makes the piece pots
more<00:01:36.190> accessible<00:01:36.729> for<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.940> terrorists<00:01:37.479> and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
more accessible for the terrorists and

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.590 
more accessible for the terrorists and
yet<00:01:39.070> this<00:01:39.220> right<00:01:39.580> here's<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.909> little<00:01:40.240> switch

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
yet this right here's the little switch

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.010 
yet this right here's the little switch
but<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.770> we'll<00:01:41.890> get<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:42.369> later<00:01:43.020> it's

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
but and we'll get to that later it's

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.870 
but and we'll get to that later it's
just<00:01:44.290> check<00:01:44.560> out<00:01:44.710> in<00:01:45.039> front<00:01:45.250> of<00:01:45.399> be<00:01:45.610> whether

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
just check out in front of be whether

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.560 
just check out in front of be whether
terrorists<00:01:46.570> will<00:01:46.690> go<00:01:47.789> so<00:01:48.789> this<00:01:49.060> one<00:01:49.240> in<00:01:49.360> pretty

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
terrorists will go so this one in pretty

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.590 
terrorists will go so this one in pretty
much<00:01:49.750> looks<00:01:50.080> like<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:51.610> previous<00:01:51.910> iterations

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
much looks like in previous iterations

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.130 
much looks like in previous iterations
of<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.050> train<00:01:53.440> but<00:01:54.430> it's<00:01:54.670> not<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.330> boiler<00:01:55.930> room

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
anymore with what our boxes and let us

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
the previous iteration of etrade also

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.969 
the previous iteration of etrade also

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
right here where the previous iterations

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.580 
right here where the previous iterations
of<00:04:05.180> train<00:04:05.480> there<00:04:05.660> was<00:04:05.750> little<00:04:05.990> corridor<00:04:06.350> right

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
of train there was little corridor right

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.090 
of train there was little corridor right

tall<00:04:23.210> thin<00:04:23.510> or<00:04:23.990> you<00:04:24.080> can<00:04:24.260> maybe<00:04:24.500> boost<00:04:24.940> with

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
tall thin or you can maybe boost with

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.060 
tall thin or you can maybe boost with
two<00:04:26.180> people<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.810> look<00:04:26.930> over<00:04:27.530> here<00:04:27.560> which<00:04:27.920> is

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
two people to look over here which is

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.270 
two people to look over here which is
kind<00:04:28.850> of<00:04:28.970> cool<00:04:29.030> idea<00:04:29.560> we<00:04:30.560> also<00:04:30.710> have<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:30.980> see

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
kind of cool idea we also have to see

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.540 
kind of cool idea we also have to see
how<00:04:31.340> it<00:04:31.370> performs<00:04:31.850> in<00:04:32.060> matchmaking<00:04:33.340> so<00:04:34.340> this

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
how it performs in matchmaking so this

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.480 
how it performs in matchmaking so this
one<00:04:34.730> here<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.840> general<00:04:36.620> layout<00:04:36.770> is<00:04:37.190> do<00:04:37.370> the

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
one here the general layout is do the

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.520 
one here the general layout is do the
same<00:04:37.730> on<00:04:39.640> yeah<00:04:40.640> I<00:04:40.880> just<00:04:41.210> show<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:41.390> this<00:04:42.320> is<00:04:42.440> the

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
same on yeah I just show you this is the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.670 
same on yeah I just show you this is the
best<00:04:42.770> friday<00:04:43.070> before<00:04:43.250> we<00:04:43.460> go<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:43.790> a<00:04:43.820> spot<00:04:44.680> so

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
best friday before we go to a spot so

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.670 
best friday before we go to a spot so
that<00:04:46.010> looks<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.669> same<00:04:46.880> but<00:04:47.120> we<00:04:47.600> have<00:04:47.750> no<00:04:47.990> yeah

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
that looks the same but we have no yeah

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.780 
that looks the same but we have no yeah
a<00:04:48.890> train<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.820> corridor<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:51.040> yeah<00:04:52.040> corridor

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
a train and a corridor and yeah corridor

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.810 
a train and a corridor and yeah corridor
and<00:04:53.510> on<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.290> old<00:04:54.560> strain<00:04:55.100> we<00:04:55.370> had<00:04:55.520> another

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
and on the old strain we had another

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.570 
and on the old strain we had another
corridor<00:04:56.180> right<00:04:56.419> here<00:04:56.600> which<00:04:56.870> is<00:04:57.020> not<00:04:57.320> done

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
corridor right here which is not done

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.430 
corridor right here which is not done
but<00:04:58.580> I<00:04:58.820> think<00:04:59.120> this<00:04:59.210> one<00:04:59.419> was<00:04:59.570> unnecessary

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
but I think this one was unnecessary

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.750 
but I think this one was unnecessary
anyways<00:05:01.090> so<00:05:02.090> yeah<00:05:02.360> also<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.050> change<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.620> guess

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
anyways so yeah also to change I guess

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.670 
anyways so yeah also to change I guess
and<00:05:04.760> when<00:05:05.270> we<00:05:05.360> go<00:05:05.510> on<00:05:05.570> go<00:05:05.960> down<00:05:06.169> here<00:05:06.350> we<00:05:06.560> are

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
and when we go on go down here we are

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.960 
and when we go on go down here we are
back<00:05:06.800> to<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.130> cities<00:05:07.520> form<00:05:09.160> so<00:05:10.160> yeah<00:05:10.370> now

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
back to the cities form so yeah now

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.820 
back to the cities form so yeah now
let's<00:05:11.090> get<00:05:11.270> to<00:05:11.450> the<00:05:11.540> a<00:05:11.570> spot

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
let's get to the a spot

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.560 
let's get to the a spot
and<00:05:15.570> here<00:05:16.570> really<00:05:17.230> we<00:05:17.530> have<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:18.210> most<00:05:19.210> severe

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
and here really we have the most severe

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.820 
and here really we have the most severe
changes<00:05:19.840> I'd<00:05:20.320> say<00:05:20.590> when<00:05:21.400> we<00:05:21.760> still<00:05:21.970> have<00:05:22.180> this

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
changes I'd say when we still have this

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.410 
changes I'd say when we still have this
look<00:05:23.830> out<00:05:24.040> right<00:05:24.280> here<00:05:25.170> which<00:05:26.370> gal<00:05:27.370> which<00:05:28.180> was

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
look out right here which gal which was

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.220 
look out right here which gal which was
in<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.780> cs<00:05:29.500> one<00:05:29.800> dot<00:05:30.010> six<00:05:30.870> iteration<00:05:31.870> of<00:05:31.930> train

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
in the cs one dot six iteration of train

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.980 
in the cs one dot six iteration of train
and<00:05:32.440> also<00:05:33.060> indices<00:05:34.060> in<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.390> old<00:05:34.540> cisco

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
and also indices in the old cisco

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.960 
and also indices in the old cisco
iteration<00:05:35.560> but<00:05:35.950> not<00:05:36.130> macias<00:05:36.520> has<00:05:36.700> such<00:05:36.850> a

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
iteration but not macias has such a

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.680 
iteration but not macias has such a
declaration<00:05:37.800> but<00:05:38.800> yeah<00:05:38.920> this<00:05:38.980> one<00:05:39.280> is

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
declaration but yeah this one is

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.950 
declaration but yeah this one is
possible<00:05:40.690> look<00:05:41.620> out<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:42.240> it's<00:05:43.240> pretty<00:05:43.420> open

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
possible look out and it's pretty open

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.620 
possible look out and it's pretty open
so<00:05:44.200> i<00:05:44.500> think<00:05:44.920> from<00:05:45.100> down<00:05:45.370> there<00:05:45.600> nature<00:05:46.600> is

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
so i think from down there nature is

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.570 
so i think from down there nature is
common<00:05:47.080> to<00:05:47.170> swatch<00:05:47.410> should<00:05:48.160> have<00:05:48.310> a<00:05:48.340> clear

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
common to swatch should have a clear

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.260 
common to swatch should have a clear
overview<00:05:49.830> so<00:05:50.830> now<00:05:51.070> probably<00:05:51.880> the<00:05:52.060> biggest

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
overview so now probably the biggest

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.360 
overview so now probably the biggest
change<00:05:52.600> is<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:52.990> snapped<00:05:53.410> all<00:05:53.650> right<00:05:53.890> here<00:05:54.160> is

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
change is the snapped all right here is

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.000 
change is the snapped all right here is
gone<00:05:54.760> so<00:05:55.600> this<00:05:55.630> one<00:05:55.990> was<00:05:56.140> in<00:05:56.350> every<00:05:56.860> year

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
gone so this one was in every year

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.850 
gone so this one was in every year
previous<00:05:57.640> d-train<00:05:58.420> iteration<00:05:59.020> but<00:05:59.200> it's<00:05:59.710> not

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
previous d-train iteration but it's not

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.960 
previous d-train iteration but it's not
anymore<00:06:01.140> but<00:06:02.140> yeah<00:06:02.830> okay<00:06:03.160> we<00:06:03.310> have<00:06:03.430> to<00:06:03.610> see<00:06:03.850> how

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
anymore but yeah okay we have to see how

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.960 
anymore but yeah okay we have to see how
this<00:06:04.120> performs<00:06:04.630> in<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:04.870> the<00:06:05.620> matches<00:06:05.980> the

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
this performs in the the matches the

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.880 
this performs in the the matches the
whole<00:06:07.150> pretty<00:06:07.780> much<00:06:07.870> the<00:06:08.020> whole<00:06:08.050> a<00:06:08.380> spot<00:06:08.740> is

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
whole pretty much the whole a spot is

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.150 
whole pretty much the whole a spot is
different<00:06:09.870> now<00:06:10.870> with<00:06:11.050> this<00:06:11.260> on<00:06:11.680> the<00:06:11.860> train

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
different now with this on the train

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.100 
different now with this on the train
right<00:06:12.370> here<00:06:12.690> and<00:06:13.690> we<00:06:14.200> still<00:06:14.440> have<00:06:14.590> the<00:06:14.770> electro

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
right here and we still have the electro

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.770 
right here and we still have the electro
box<00:06:17.110> or<00:06:17.410> whatever<00:06:17.730> so<00:06:18.730> yeah<00:06:18.940> that's<00:06:19.420> the<00:06:19.660> new

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
box or whatever so yeah that's the new

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.650 
box or whatever so yeah that's the new
age<00:06:19.990> spots

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.810 

yeah<00:06:23.320> probably<00:06:23.770> the<00:06:24.040> most<00:06:24.190> different<00:06:24.640> from

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
yeah probably the most different from

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.160 
yeah probably the most different from
the<00:06:24.940> whole<00:06:25.030> map<00:06:26.850> but<00:06:27.850> all<00:06:28.090> like<00:06:28.690> i<00:06:28.720> said<00:06:29.020> my
