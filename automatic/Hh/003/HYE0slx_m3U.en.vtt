00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
length one you may find that it's a lot

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.229 
length one you may find that it's a lot
quicker<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.049> easier<00:02:13.140> if<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.579> loosen<00:02:15.209> this

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
and take the can off the filter so then

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.500 
and take the can off the filter so then
you'll<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.500> range<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.190> motion<00:02:20.700> with

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
you'll have this range of motion with

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.930 
you'll have this range of motion with
your<00:02:21.540> wrench<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.230> do<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.560> fitting<00:02:22.950> it's

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.380 

okay<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.270> two<00:02:51.420> mounting<00:02:51.900> bolts<00:02:52.940> loosen<00:02:53.940> now

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
okay the two mounting bolts loosen now

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.330 
okay the two mounting bolts loosen now
again<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.840> may<00:02:55.080> find<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.800> don't<00:02:55.980> have<00:02:56.100> an<00:02:56.220> air

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
again you may find you don't have an air

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.980 
again you may find you don't have an air
ratchet<00:02:56.550> or<00:02:56.819> whatnot<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.300> may<00:02:57.480> find<00:02:57.780> that

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
ratchet or whatnot you may find that

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.110 
ratchet or whatnot you may find that
it's<00:02:58.140> easier<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.980> take<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.400> cam<00:02:59.670> out<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.030> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
it's easier to take that cam out of the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.550 
it's easier to take that cam out of the
way<00:03:00.240> so<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.569> can<00:03:00.690> get<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.110> nuts<00:03:01.319> on<00:03:01.470> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
way so you can get the nuts on the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.340 
way so you can get the nuts on the
bottom<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:01.980> now<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.819> do<00:03:03.420> have<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:04.050> lot<00:03:04.319> of

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
bottom of this now you do have a lot of

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.760 
bottom of this now you do have a lot of
times<00:03:04.680> wire<00:03:05.640> harness<00:03:07.490> stays<00:03:09.410> down<00:03:10.410> underneath

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
times wire harness stays down underneath

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.260 
times wire harness stays down underneath
they're<00:03:11.040> mounted<00:03:11.370> underneath<00:03:11.610> these<00:03:11.850> bolts

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
they're mounted underneath these bolts

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.309 
they're mounted underneath these bolts
so<00:03:13.640> pull<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:14.790> right<00:03:15.030> up<00:03:15.180> on<00:03:15.330> out<00:03:18.200> I'm<00:03:19.200> going

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
so pull this right up on out I'm going

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.080 
so pull this right up on out I'm going
to<00:03:19.410> lay<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.620> there<00:03:20.180> we<00:03:21.180> want<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.630> bolt<00:03:21.959> and

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
to lay that there we want that bolt and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:32.979 
to lay that there we want that bolt and
