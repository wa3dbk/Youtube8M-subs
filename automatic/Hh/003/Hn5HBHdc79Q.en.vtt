00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.450
 and capital channel continues to cover between 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.639
 scholarship end festival in the new city 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.789
 york and this time with a movie 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:16.660
 starring juliette binoche of the 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.310
 director malgorzata his search and that we 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.990
 tells the life of a journalist who 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.650
 is investigating the case of women 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.650
 prepaid 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.119
 but let the same giulietta us 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.119
 count a little more 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.090
 I believe that the whole issue is important and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.480
 sex is a very important issue in the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.699
 land in our lives you do not believe it by 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.790
 Of course I do think that the movie is 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.220
 a bit graphic and saw it not seen 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.410
 you are thinking in anticipation of the end 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.480
 you have to see the topic of the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.900
 movie is very important because 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.060
 we touch the issue of prostitution 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.100
 It is a different look about 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.130
 students that you can locate in 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.900
 internet and they see things from another 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.900
 world is another world 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.609
 there is also the theme of this woman who sees 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.340
 how your life transforms when you enter 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.890
 Contact with these girls and despite 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.399
 that has everything car or television its 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.289
 husband realizes that things do not 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.579
 they work well because at the end of the day 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.579
 It feels like I would like 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.930
 love is a long journey and many 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.730
 Sometimes it is not easy to keep the passion in 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.730
 our lives to the end 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.990
 all right 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.810
 and watch your reaction when you 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.659
 we ask if like the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.990
 protagonist had fantasized about something 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.990
 wild 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.340
 even if we go back to the movie what was 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.340
 the process to build the character 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.470
 I saw many documentaries I learned a lot 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.350
 of the subject because you can not imagine 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.810
 how uncomfortable this was for me is very 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.580
 complex the subject and the film is about 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.130
 about that complexity 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.910
 friends juliette binoche went through the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.910
 capital channel 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.430
 it's something very good
