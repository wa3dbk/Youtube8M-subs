 I come with the June book so 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.799
 let us begin 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.419
 the first book this month I 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.590
 they gave for my birthday and it's called 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.329
 salt coriander and warner this book 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.660
 present tells the story of a girl 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.099
 who was born in 1643 and how good is 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.769
 london and I thought the world was 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.100
 pretty until his father is locked up 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.900
 something like in a coffin or in a box 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.120
 for a long time so this is the 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.010
 story of this girl I want to read it very 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.870
 soon the next book this month is 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.729
 the great minds eyes and brian's 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.170
 Johnson apparently this is like a 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.539
 typical high school book 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.710
 secondary in which intrigues there is a 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.660
 boy who is wanting to be the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.750
 president of the class school and 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.429
 well it seems to be very funny and the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.320
 cover is curious so I want to read it 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.149
 very soon the next book is waters 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.980

 gave away for the anniversary on my channel 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.399
 apparently this book tells the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.740
 story of a girl and a boy who 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.690
 surprise they are traveling in the titanic and 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.820
 In addition to everything bad that happens to you 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.880
 titanic and some curse that the two 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.760
 they must break so good one this 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.520
 book caught my attention 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.160
 to me on the back cover and two because it's 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.170
 from claudia gray so I'll read it very very 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.470
 soon the next book is my heart 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.150
 in the gray days of yasmin save this 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.310
 book tells the story of a girl 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.230
 who lives in a town that does not accept the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.150
 different people in the has always been 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.010
 very lonely sense and others until it arrives 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.690
 a boy who makes him change the 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.430
 perspective of everything and good 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.650
 apparently this book is pretty 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.090
 sad but good you have to see how 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.980
 eventually the next thing is this is not 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.050
 a diary of andrei course and this is 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.090
 another book of activities you - so 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.640
 I showed in the unboxing and it's good 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.470
 basically to fill it- yourself 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.150
 next book would expect the sun of jan 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.830
 they came are this book is called in 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.630
 other countries would give you the world if not 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.110
 I'm wrong and tells the story of two 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.850
 twins if I remember correctly that in 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.710
 principle are inseparable but 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.570
 eventually they fight and we're going to 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.790
 find out why they fight and why they 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.740
 they stop talking for years and years and the 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.380
 book is counting the results 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.110
 prospects the following books are 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.030
 of a thousand game and maicon read this I think 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.550
 which is a science fiction series more 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.770
 or less and well the first book is called 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.610
 inter world and the second the dream of 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.990
 silver 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.490
 apparently the first book starts 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.410
 telling the story of a boy who 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.150
 lose going to the corner of your house 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.610
 and effectively that happens a day 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.170
 but inside your house and it ends in a 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.030
 intergalactic world 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.270
 of science fiction and things that are going to 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.310
 lead to having many 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.170
 the next book is play dough for 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.970
 little great artists this has already 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.590

 they want to see it and I'm going to leave it here 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.100
 and the last book is the blood of 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.810
 olympus of the peak by hernan this is the 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.150
 Last book of the saga of heroes 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.220
