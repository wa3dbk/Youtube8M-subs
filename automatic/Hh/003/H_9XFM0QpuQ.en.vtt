00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.109
 in our society there are prejudices 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.730
 talk about ballet in men without 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.919
 However, this art represents a 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.439
 unisex nativity that requires many 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.630
 strength and agility skills and the 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.489
 ballet men possess all those 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.829
 characteristics and play a role 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.989
 important in this type of dance though 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.510
 in some cases they should start the same 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.089
 in more adult ages I think that in 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.210
 our western society as a 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.519
 new is so open to training 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.000
 of men in ballet and not 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:53.030
 have that support is more the dancer 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.769
 adult who seeks in its own interest 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.570
 training and yet action is not 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:02.710
 goes to russia and these eastern countries and 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.630
 of europe the training of the male is 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.030
 simultaneous and even and equally 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.220
 demanding that the women's man 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.979
 it is a fundamental basis in the ballet he 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.650
 makes the woman look like the load 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.540
 is his complement the ballet man 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.400
 has a lot of physical dexterity endurance 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.630
 and realizations that for many 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.049
 athletes would be 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.530
 applied or even impossible is who 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.470
 gives the turns jumps large turns 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.799
 big jumps with twists that are things 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.479
 much more physically demanding in the 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.850
 ballet is not simply loading the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.720
 girl which here a lump because no 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.759
 they manage to lift it above the head in 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.170
 difficult poses coming from a jump 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.520
 they have to catch it they have to 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.079
 put the tent on the back 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.280
 because with one hand there is a variety of 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:55.250
 charged that can be done and that are 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.500
 very demanding and require plenty 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.020
 practice in addition to a ballet dance 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.479
 It is considered a physical exercise by 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.869
 all the bodily benefits that it offers 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.920
 the ballet or aerobic exercise works 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.709
 muscular endurance without bulking the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.840
 because likewise he simultaneously works 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.849
 Stretching the muscle does not grow 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.829
 this form but it is elongated and the 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.170
 The dancer's line is long 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.569
 discipline perseverance and perseverance 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.250
 courage of men in ballet is 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.160
 very good and not only do one 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.790
 woman 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.260
 it's also men who do 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.190
 resistance to a lot of muscle mass 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.190
 that is more strength than before 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.170
 970 1 we are all gay 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.330
 ie not all men are gay I 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.250
 I'm straight married is not got a girl 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.960
 It has to be scary if we play sports 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.090
 many in fact we have a body 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.620
 physically very well trained and at a level 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.710
 international I think that wing man is 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.200
 he respects a lot there is a lot of respect for him 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.300
 there is a lot of acceptance and there are less taboos 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.190
 people are more aware that today 's 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.010
 a man is also a career is a 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.500
 witness of life that he catches and respects him 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.500
 a way to live worse is the truth
