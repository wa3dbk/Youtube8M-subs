kind of a guide now I'm going to go up
and<00:00:21.960> curve<00:00:22.320> around<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.250> then<00:00:24.029> come<00:00:24.060> down

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.170 
and curve around and then come down
almost<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:25.980> I'm<00:00:26.220> making<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.670> heart<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.150> I

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
almost like I'm making a heart but I

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.370 
almost like I'm making a heart but I
stopped<00:00:27.840> short

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
stopped short

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.220 
stopped short
I<00:00:28.470> don't<00:00:28.710> do<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> pointy<00:00:29.400> part<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.789> heart

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
I don't do the pointy part of the heart

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.770 
I don't do the pointy part of the heart
then<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> go<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.369> other<00:00:32.399> way<00:00:34.280> same<00:00:35.280> thing

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
then I go the other way same thing

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.369 
then I go the other way same thing
except<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:36.809> opposite<00:00:37.469> way<00:00:38.629> now<00:00:39.629> we're<00:00:40.140> going

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
except for opposite way now we're going

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.660 
except for opposite way now we're going
to<00:00:40.469> make<00:00:40.739> some<00:00:41.010> little<00:00:41.309> ears<00:00:41.610> at<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> top<00:00:43.670> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to make some little ears at the top and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.119 
to make some little ears at the top and
then<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.690> area<00:00:46.020> right<00:00:46.379> here<00:00:46.440> we're<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
then this area right here we're going to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.069 
then this area right here we're going to
close<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.539> make<00:00:48.750> any<00:00:48.960> design

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
close up and you can make any design

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.100 
close up and you can make any design
that<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:50.539> you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.719> get<00:00:51.899> really

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
that you like you can get really

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.840 
that you like you can get really
creative<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.090> area<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:55.550> just<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
creative with that area I just like to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.650 
creative with that area I just like to
usually<00:00:57.149> put<00:00:57.539> lines<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.079> dots<00:00:58.460> now<00:00:59.460> this<00:01:00.270> area

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
usually put lines and dots now this area

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.680 
usually put lines and dots now this area
we're<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> make<00:01:01.649> large<00:01:02.370> circles<00:01:03.359> for

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
we're going to make large circles for

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.290 
we're going to make large circles for
eyes

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.410 

and<00:01:08.390> then<00:01:09.080> inside<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.830> circle<00:01:10.310> small<00:01:10.700> dots

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.530 

so<00:01:14.420> those<00:01:14.630> words<00:01:14.870> lies<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.320> that's<00:01:15.470> his<00:01:15.650> nose

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
so those words lies and that's his nose

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.480 
so those words lies and that's his nose
now<00:01:17.540> for<00:01:17.840> his<00:01:18.020> wings<00:01:18.350> we're<00:01:18.980> just<00:01:19.190> going<00:01:19.400> to

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
now for his wings we're just going to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.900 
now for his wings we're just going to
come<00:01:19.700> out<00:01:19.850> from<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.120> side<00:01:21.310> just<00:01:22.310> like<00:01:22.580> this

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
come out from the side just like this

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.710 
come out from the side just like this
with<00:01:23.720> curved<00:01:24.290> lines<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:25.310> then<00:01:26.210> we<00:01:26.480> are<00:01:26.540> going

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
with curved lines and then we are going

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.630 
with curved lines and then we are going
to<00:01:26.870> make<00:01:27.020> another<00:01:27.380> curved<00:01:27.710> line<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:30.520> then<00:01:31.520> if

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
to make another curved line and then if

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.220 
to make another curved line and then if
you'd<00:01:31.760> like<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.120> put<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.300> little<00:01:32.450> design<00:01:32.840> on<00:01:32.900> the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230

you'd like to put a little design on the
inside<00:01:33.260> of<00:01:33.770> those<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.250> would<00:01:34.400> always<00:01:34.610> look

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570
