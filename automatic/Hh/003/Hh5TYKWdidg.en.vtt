00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.470 

what's<00:00:01.199> up<00:00:01.410> guys<00:00:01.650> son<00:00:02.280> of<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.490> bee<00:00:02.669> here<00:00:02.970> today

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
what's up guys son of a bee here today

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.440 
what's up guys son of a bee here today
here<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.230> show<00:00:04.410> you<00:00:04.470> how<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.890> use<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.759> hydrogen

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
here to show you how to use the hydrogen

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.879 
here to show you how to use the hydrogen
generator<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.770> electronic<00:00:08.630> separator

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
generator and the electronic separator

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.240 
generator and the electronic separator
now<00:00:10.889> basically<00:00:12.410> this<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.559> how<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.830> make<00:00:14.009> a

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
now basically this is how you make a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.490 
now basically this is how you make a
power<00:00:14.940> system<00:00:16.490> that<00:00:17.490> once<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.970> gets<00:00:18.150> going

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
power system that once it gets going

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.689 
power system that once it gets going
keeps<00:00:19.500> itself<00:00:19.890> charged<00:00:20.400> or<00:00:20.609> running<00:00:21.500> so<00:00:22.699> just

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
keeps itself charged or running so just

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.529 
keeps itself charged or running so just
start<00:00:24.320> you<00:00:25.320> need<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.650> water<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:27.359> can

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
start you need some water now you can

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.220 
start you need some water now you can
use<00:00:27.660> any<00:00:27.900> pump<00:00:28.550> that<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.760> need<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.689> being

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
use any pump that you need but being

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.850 
use any pump that you need but being
that<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.859> have<00:00:31.980> access<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:33.030> aqueous

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
that we have access to the aqueous

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.250 
that we have access to the aqueous
accumulator<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:35.370> thermal<00:00:35.730> expansion<00:00:36.260> I'm

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
accumulator from thermal expansion I'm

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.100 
accumulator from thermal expansion I'm
going<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.559> using<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.629> you<00:00:39.629> pump<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.020> out

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
going to be using that you pump it out

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.720 
going to be using that you pump it out
with<00:00:40.350> some<00:00:40.500> fluid<00:00:40.829> ducts<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.460> pump

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
with some fluid ducts here and you pump

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.510 
with some fluid ducts here and you pump
it<00:00:44.879> into<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.329> separator<00:00:45.750> now<00:00:46.289> what<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.460> does

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it into the separator now what this does

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.709 
it into the separator now what this does
essentially<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.690> break<00:00:49.140> water<00:00:49.440> down<00:00:49.770> from

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
essentially is break water down from

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.600 
essentially is break water down from
being<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.840> liquid<00:00:52.579> into<00:00:54.110> oxygen<00:00:55.110> hydrogen<00:00:55.550> now

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
being a liquid into oxygen hydrogen now

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.029 
being a liquid into oxygen hydrogen now
the<00:00:57.120> hydrogen's<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> left<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.530> oxygens

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the hydrogen's on the left the oxygens

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.779 
the hydrogen's on the left the oxygens
on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.250> right<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.469> other<00:01:01.559> words<00:01:01.829> hydrogen

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
on the right so in other words hydrogen

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.710 
on the right so in other words hydrogen
is<00:01:02.850> blue<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.899> oxygen<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.470> red<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> once<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
is blue the oxygen is red so once you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.100 
is blue the oxygen is red so once you
get<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.979> pump<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.900> both<00:01:09.900> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
get there you can just pump out both of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.240 
get there you can just pump out both of
these<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:12.710> end<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:15.080> draining<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.380> oxygen<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
these and end up draining the oxygen and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.950 
these and end up draining the oxygen and
hydrogen<00:01:19.250> now<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.759> also<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.240> dump<00:01:21.750> them

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
hydrogen now you can also just dump them

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.140 
hydrogen now you can also just dump them
out<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.500> don't<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.159> use<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.580> them<00:01:23.790> but

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
out if you don't have a use for them but

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.090 
out if you don't have a use for them but
I'm<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> show<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.140> use<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> oxygen

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I'm going to show you use for the oxygen

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.399 
I'm going to show you use for the oxygen
later<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.790> we're<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.180> put<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.259> over

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
later so we're going to put that over

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.090 
later so we're going to put that over
there<00:01:29.030> from<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:31.020> pump<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.560> hydrogen

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
there from there you pump the hydrogen

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.749 
there from there you pump the hydrogen
into<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.119> hydrogen<00:01:33.720> generator<00:01:34.579> what<00:01:35.579> this

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
into the hydrogen generator what this

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.260 
into the hydrogen generator what this
does<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.240> inputs<00:01:36.960> hydrogen<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.820> from<00:01:38.820> any<00:01:39.090> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
does is inputs hydrogen in from any of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.030 
does is inputs hydrogen in from any of
the<00:01:39.360> three<00:01:39.630> sides<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:41.130> outputs<00:01:41.670> power

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
the three sides and just outputs power

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.639 
the three sides and just outputs power
very<00:01:44.040> simple<00:01:45.079> now<00:01:46.079> we're<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> connect

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
very simple now we're going to connect

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.770 
very simple now we're going to connect
some<00:01:46.799> Universal<00:01:47.280> cables<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.820> here

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.850 

and<00:01:52.360> here<00:01:53.360> we<00:01:53.480> go

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
and here we go

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
and here we go
this<00:01:54.860> is<00:01:55.010> it<00:01:55.330> it's<00:01:56.330> not<00:01:56.480> a<00:01:56.510> complex<00:01:57.140> build<00:01:57.500> I<00:01:57.880> do

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
this is it it's not a complex build I do

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.630 
this is it it's not a complex build I do
believe<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.450> cost<00:01:59.690> is<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.430> little<00:02:01.430> high<00:02:01.610> but

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
believe the cost is a little high but

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.370 
believe the cost is a little high but
still<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> good<00:02:02.630> starting<00:02:04.540> system<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:06.229> get

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
still a good starting system to get

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.980 
still a good starting system to get
everything<00:02:06.620> out<00:02:06.950> of<00:02:08.860> we<00:02:09.860> can<00:02:10.280> drop<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:13.990> energy

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
everything out of we can drop a energy

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.510 
everything out of we can drop a energy
cube<00:02:15.350> into<00:02:15.709> here<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:17.209> see<00:02:17.390> how<00:02:17.510> well<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.870> runs

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
cube into here to see how well it runs

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.000 
cube into here to see how well it runs
but<00:02:19.520> at<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.630> moment<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.290> see<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.590> isn't

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
but at the moment you see it isn't

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.670 
but at the moment you see it isn't
producing<00:02:22.459> any<00:02:22.640> power<00:02:23.110> that's<00:02:24.110> because<00:02:24.470> this

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
producing any power that's because this

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.810 
producing any power that's because this
system<00:02:25.330> needs<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.450> little<00:02:26.570> kick<00:02:26.780> start<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.820> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
system needs a little kick start it the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.060 
system needs a little kick start it the
separator<00:02:29.270> needs<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.750> get<00:02:29.900> power<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.709> separate

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
separator needs to get power to separate

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.360 
separator needs to get power to separate
the<00:02:31.220> water<00:02:31.930> before<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.170> can<00:02:33.350> give<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.650> hydrogen

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
the water before it can give it hydrogen

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.140 
the water before it can give it hydrogen
into<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.730> generator<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.620> can<00:02:36.739> have<00:02:36.890> power

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
into the generator so it can have power

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.210 
into the generator so it can have power
so<00:02:38.150> just<00:02:38.360> drop<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:39.020> battery<00:02:39.590> or<00:02:39.860> hook<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.160> up

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
so just drop in a battery or hook it up

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.760 
so just drop in a battery or hook it up
to<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> battery<00:02:40.670> power<00:02:41.330> source<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.970> away<00:02:43.970> we<00:02:44.180> go

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
to a battery power source and away we go
