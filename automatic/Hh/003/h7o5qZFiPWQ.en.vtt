00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.680
 It takes a long time to get here 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.630
 in particular pio real has one 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.729
 Hidden ability thanks to the still 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.180
 fight better is ok download 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.180
 the third culprit 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.320
 A bank is saved when it is saved 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.420
 because not switch off 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.640
 and here already have 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.229
 the gift before you probably received it from 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.320
 the supplier are in a pokémon 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:34.460
 center ab ok thank you very much nice and so 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.159
 You can do this with this woman 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.340
 pokémon get this rp royal and me 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.399
 I've already recorded it in my team 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.500
 it is here at level 50 and esther 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.320
 the attacks leaves storm restraint 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.490
 spend and giga even from the essence ago 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.470
 it is naive 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.119
 So it's on the so on 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.220
 initiative good and bad on the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.929
 special defense if that is good knows 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.360
 I do not really think so now 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.190
 but already such a pokémon is like 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.509
 very important to be fast I know 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.780
 but not why the special 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.369
 defense is reduced 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.310
 but ok let me put that aside and 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.260
 let's look at this yes puck only 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.830
 still know closer to what it has in the sun 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.680
 horny that view of mutpol leaves 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.390
 Storm is good restraint harnisch 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.850
 really do not tell me anything 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.530
 user presses his target out higher 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.660
 The chapter style is so powerful 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.079
 Day also kay sounds bizarre 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.700
 because they are limited to five means 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.380
 so that the trucker flash nitz 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.989
 injected or good I do not know 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.739
 I have so far never seen anything like 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.200
 honestly belongs 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.880
 and last but not least nauseous worry about 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.359
 the opponent as know kp are abstract yes 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.160
 actually quite cool pokémon has it 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.930
 the ability reversal status 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.100
 change will be reversed I want 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.630
 let's say if this pokémon to 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.100
 example would be parried 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.260
 who then simply on the opposite 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.750
 But I wonder how that is 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.250
 on affects so affects the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.930
 Example of such a condition in the two 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.810
 pokémon would be made for 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.209
 for something like I do not know whether 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.120
 Sleep is actually a status as well 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.670
 state say now that set there 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.709
 slumbers in and that then affects 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.680
 also very much and also one 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.170
 Another pokémon weather at the end again 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.360
 sent back to both or just up 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.950
 Rank three 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.630
 that's a very good question i know 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.730
 not otherwise that was already for 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.620
 this little specials could that 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.950
 pokémon in action again but show 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.200
 I think so, you guys have her 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.820
 nothing is going to happen anyway 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.320
 show it looks quite cool 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.840
 I ask myself always straight 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.670
 just this pokémon I get 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.600
 my there are so many pokémon why has 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.280
 you look necessarily reflect it 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.420
 decided very good question 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.470
 well hopefully more will be added 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.380
 pokémon provided or 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.150
 just for download then me 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.950
 think the cool customs station actually 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.890
 very cool you get quite good professionals 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.709
 who also have something on them and who 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.260
 sometimes even then have good values 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.970
 with whom she has been and then I am 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.820
 also cool as you have to the pokémon 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.530
 I myself get tears 1 and have it 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.250
 seen 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.080
 and even use storm leaves 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.570
 and we want the skp now 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.000
 destroy or kill it said 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.690
 because this day can definitely be 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.690
 not survive 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.810
 yes, looks pretty cool from the 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.950
 Bed is mag is definitely 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.480
 and yes if they too have now 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.950
 that could also be supported by you 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.930
 just have to do what I did 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.060
 So had what I had shown 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.170
 and then you can have this pokémon 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.910
 also download 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.620
 yes, if you liked this video 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.970
 People can see me and this video 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.380
 with a thumb upwards support 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.670
 I would be very happy 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.990
