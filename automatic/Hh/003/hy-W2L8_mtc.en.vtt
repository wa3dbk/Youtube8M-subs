00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
but cooking them on low get rekd black

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.270 
but cooking them on low get rekd black
around<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> edges<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.240> has<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.159> chance<00:01:20.159> of

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
around the edges it has a chance of

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.450 
around the edges it has a chance of
burning<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.939> don't<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.390> cooking<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.170> low

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
burning and I don't think cooking on low

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.390 
burning and I don't think cooking on low
that<00:01:23.460> crock-pot<00:01:23.790> should<00:01:24.240> burn<00:01:24.540> things<00:01:25.400> I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that crock-pot should burn things I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.760 
that crock-pot should burn things I
actually<00:01:27.119> had<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.659> before<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.680> I

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
actually had one before this and I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.550 
actually had one before this and I
thought<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.430> defective<00:01:30.000> because<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.630> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
thought it was defective because it and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.200 
thought it was defective because it and
I<00:01:31.710> actually<00:01:32.070> returned<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.880> store

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
I actually returned it to the store

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.350 
I actually returned it to the store
thinking<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.079> low<00:01:34.259> doesn't<00:01:34.530> work<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
thinking the low doesn't work on this

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.880 
thinking the low doesn't work on this
but<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.570> got<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.680> doesn't

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
but then I got this one and it doesn't

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.380 
but then I got this one and it doesn't
think<00:01:37.979> that's<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.310> pink<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.700> I'm<00:01:38.759> thinking<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
think that's a pink so I'm thinking that

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.469 
think that's a pink so I'm thinking that
maybe<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.530> way<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.770> designed<00:01:40.920> I

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
maybe it's just the way it's designed I

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.749 
maybe it's just the way it's designed I
have<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.659> stopped<00:01:43.020> using<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.610> only

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
have just stopped using it if I'm only

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.999 
have just stopped using it if I'm only
cooking<00:01:45.090> take<00:01:45.990> four<00:01:46.259> chicken<00:01:46.560> breasts<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:46.920> a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
cooking take four chicken breasts at a

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.880 
cooking take four chicken breasts at a
time<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> small<00:01:48.600> cut<00:01:49.170> pot<00:01:49.409> as<00:01:49.740> I've

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
time and I have a small cut pot as I've

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.149 
time and I have a small cut pot as I've
been<00:01:50.009> using<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.840> for<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> would<00:01:53.040> not

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
been using and for that so I would not

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.280 
been using and for that so I would not
try<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.520> cook<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.850> small<00:01:54.149> amount<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.079> this

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
try to cook a small amount in this this

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.280 
try to cook a small amount in this this
is<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> large<00:01:55.770> pot<00:01:56.070> pot<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.420> cook

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
is a large pot pot and to to cook

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.990 
is a large pot pot and to to cook
without<00:01:58.680> burning<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.280> think<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.610> need<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.820> be

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
without burning I think you need to be

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.539 
without burning I think you need to be
