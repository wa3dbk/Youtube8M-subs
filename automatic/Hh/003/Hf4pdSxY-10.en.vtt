mic cord and i plug it in it I really
it's<00:02:02.189> hard<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:02.490> me<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:03.000> hand<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
it's hard for me to get my hand in a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.139 
it's hard for me to get my hand in a
place<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.310> me<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.670> hold<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.439> use<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.879> if

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
place for me to hold it and use it so if

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.800 
place for me to hold it and use it so if
that's<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.750> little<00:02:09.929> weird<00:02:11.360> that's

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
that's a little weird that's

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.470 
that's a little weird that's
argh<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.430> weird<00:02:14.670> now<00:02:14.819> actually<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.390> is

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
argh and it's weird now actually it is

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.850 
argh and it's weird now actually it is
charging<00:02:16.050> because<00:02:16.170> before<00:02:16.500> i<00:02:16.560> found<00:02:16.800> that

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
charging because before i found that

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.410 
charging because before i found that
plugin<00:02:17.400> at<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.640> computer<00:02:18.000> wasn't<00:02:18.180> really

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
plugin at the computer wasn't really

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.030 
plugin at the computer wasn't really
charging<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.110> i<00:02:19.140> don't<00:02:19.470> know<00:02:19.530> what<00:02:19.650> was<00:02:19.800> going

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
charging so i don't know what was going

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.729 
charging so i don't know what was going
on<00:02:20.130> with<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:22.069> that's<00:02:23.069> different

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
on with that so that's different

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.870 
on with that so that's different
otherwise<00:02:25.739> it's<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.040> solid<00:02:26.250> build<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:26.849> this

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
otherwise it's a solid build like this

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.089 
otherwise it's a solid build like this
is<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> really<00:02:27.540> good<00:02:27.900> device<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.870> back

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
is a really good device I like the back

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.000 
is a really good device I like the back
really<00:02:32.099> neat<00:02:32.370> little<00:02:32.489> covering<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:34.440> it

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
really neat little covering it it

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.589 
really neat little covering it it
handles<00:02:35.459> all<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.580> battery<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.209> will<00:02:36.450> ask

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
handles all the battery on it will ask

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.470 
handles all the battery on it will ask
quite<00:02:36.900> well<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.080> took<00:02:37.230> my<00:02:37.530> nexus<00:02:37.860> 4<00:02:38.130> out<00:02:38.450> for<00:02:39.450> a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
quite well I took my nexus 4 out for a

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.699 
quite well I took my nexus 4 out for a
little<00:02:39.599> bit<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.840> playing<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.200> some<00:02:40.349> ingress

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
little bit of playing and some ingress

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.290 
little bit of playing and some ingress
which<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.069> tends<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.610> bit<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.120> heavier

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
which is tends to be a bit of a heavier

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.330 
which is tends to be a bit of a heavier
battery<00:02:42.870> draw<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.260> i<00:02:43.290> play<00:02:43.560> with<00:02:43.739> my<00:02:43.830> nexus<00:02:44.130> 4

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
battery draw so i play with my nexus 4

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.830 
battery draw so i play with my nexus 4
while<00:02:44.519> i<00:02:44.550> played<00:02:44.819> with<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.360> same<00:02:45.569> time

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
while i played with this the same time

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.920 
while i played with this the same time
pretty<00:02:46.799> much<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.130> same<00:02:47.340> usage<00:02:47.819> when<00:02:48.660> i<00:02:48.720> got

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
pretty much the same usage when i got

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.650 
pretty much the same usage when i got
back<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.350> house<00:02:50.120> this<00:02:51.120> had<00:02:51.360> only<00:02:51.480> gone

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
back to the house this had only gone

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.210 
back to the house this had only gone
down<00:02:51.870> forty<00:02:52.290> three<00:02:52.440> percent<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.950> battery

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
down forty three percent of battery

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.039 
down forty three percent of battery
usage<00:02:53.519> whereas<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.299> nexus<00:02:54.630> went<00:02:54.810> down<00:02:54.930> about

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
usage whereas the nexus went down about

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.170 
usage whereas the nexus went down about
fifty<00:02:55.440> four<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:56.190> little<00:02:56.730> better<00:02:57.000> on<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
fifty four so a little better on the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.759 
fifty four so a little better on the
battery<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.690> can't<00:02:57.959> remember<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.319> size<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
battery I can't remember the size of the

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.100 
battery I can't remember the size of the
battery<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.160> one<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.430> but<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.930> don't<00:03:00.930> last

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
battery this one is but it is don't last

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.690 
battery this one is but it is don't last
a<00:03:01.290> little<00:03:01.380> bit<00:03:01.500> more<00:03:01.709> than<00:03:01.769> say<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.190> Nexus

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
a little bit more than say the Nexus

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.870 
a little bit more than say the Nexus
what<00:03:02.849> people<00:03:03.150> are<00:03:03.299> saying<00:03:03.860> now<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:05.459> terms<00:03:05.640> of

what people are saying now in terms of

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.630 
what people are saying now in terms of
specs<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.560> dual<00:03:07.709> core<00:03:08.040> what<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.549> it

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
specs on it it's a dual core what is it

1.5<00:03:08.819> year<00:03:09.569> it's<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:09.989> had<00:03:10.110> one<00:03:10.319> gig<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.160> ram<00:03:11.900> only

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
1.5 year it's I had one gig of ram only

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.800 
1.5 year it's I had one gig of ram only
16<00:03:13.290> gigs<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.590> space<00:03:13.709> it's<00:03:14.430> was<00:03:14.640> not<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.299> heavy

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
16 gigs of space it's was not a heavy

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.080 
16 gigs of space it's was not a heavy
powerhouse<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.470> if<00:03:16.799> we<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:19.519> benchmark<00:03:20.519> it

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
powerhouse and if we do a benchmark it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.180 
powerhouse and if we do a benchmark it
actually<00:03:21.570> laid<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.930> pretty<00:03:22.140> low<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:23.100> know

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
actually laid it pretty low but you know

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.020 
actually laid it pretty low but you know
what<00:03:23.340> benchmarks<00:03:24.150> are<00:03:24.299> great<00:03:24.810> for<00:03:26.030> nothing

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
what benchmarks are great for nothing

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.729 
what benchmarks are great for nothing
really<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.959> best<00:03:28.140> thing<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.380> do<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.560> play

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
really the best thing to do is play

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:29.960 
really the best thing to do is play
around<00:03:28.859> with<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.069> I<00:03:29.190> really<00:03:29.430> haven't<00:03:29.609> had<00:03:29.760> any

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
around with it I really haven't had any

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.770 
around with it I really haven't had any
issue<00:03:30.239> with<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.660> lagging<00:03:31.079> on<00:03:31.350> me<00:03:32.690> compared<00:03:33.690> to

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
issue with it lagging on me compared to

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.599 
issue with it lagging on me compared to
other<00:03:33.900> devices<00:03:34.260> I've<00:03:34.739> had<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.069> is<00:03:35.250> actually

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609
