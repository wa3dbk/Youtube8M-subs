usually how you do that is by base

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.289 
usually how you do that is by base
aligning<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.280> before<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> snap<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.180> in

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
aligning and before the snap if it's in

aligning and before the snap if it's in
a<00:01:36.390> run<00:01:36.570> formation<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.890> hold<00:01:38.100> down<00:01:38.460> on

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
a run formation I like to hold down on

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.280 
a run formation I like to hold down on
the<00:01:38.790> Left<00:01:38.880> stick<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.630> little<00:01:39.869> bit<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.140> that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the Left stick just a little bit so that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.390 
the Left stick just a little bit so that
at<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> start<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> snap<00:01:41.040> my<00:01:41.250> guy

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
at the start of the snap my guy

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.609 
at the start of the snap my guy
automatically<00:01:42.119> shoots<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.689> gap<00:01:42.869> between<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
automatically shoots the gap between the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.130 
automatically shoots the gap between the
D<00:01:43.829> tackles<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:45.630> side<00:01:45.899> you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
D tackles there on the right side you

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.190 
D tackles there on the right side you
can<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:47.820> get<00:01:48.000> your<00:01:48.030> three-four<00:01:48.600> odd<00:01:48.810> look

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
can see you get your three-four odd look

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.310 
can see you get your three-four odd look
they're<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.680> very<00:01:50.070> balanced<00:01:51.170> formation<00:01:52.170> but

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
they're a very balanced formation but

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.389 
they're a very balanced formation but
you're<00:01:52.409> gonna<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.680> playing<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.950> cover<00:01:53.130> three

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
you're gonna be playing a cover three

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.639 
you're gonna be playing a cover three
behind<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.869> also<00:01:55.049> allows<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> play<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
behind it this also allows you to play a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.319 
behind it this also allows you to play a
cover<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.159> width<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.430> switch<00:01:56.880> up<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> cover

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
cover for width and switch up to a cover

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.420 
cover for width and switch up to a cover
for<00:01:57.450> without<00:01:57.659> anyone<00:01:57.899> noticing<00:01:58.189> so<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.250> can

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
for without anyone noticing so you can

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.980 
for without anyone noticing so you can
see<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.670> if<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.270> shoot<00:02:00.750> that

gap between the two D tackles there
between<00:02:04.229> those<00:02:04.560> guards<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.979> opens<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.549> for<00:02:05.790> you

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939

on run plays most of the time what
happens<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:09.060> if<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.330> shoot<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.720> gap

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
happens is if you shoot that gap

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.780 
happens is if you shoot that gap
correctly<00:02:10.410> which<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.739> got<00:02:10.979> closed<00:02:11.370> down<00:02:11.580> on

correctly which this got closed down on
me<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.239> can<00:02:12.420> destroy<00:02:12.780> run<00:02:12.989> plays<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.440> can

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
me you can destroy run plays you can

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.910 
me you can destroy run plays you can
also

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
also

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.000 
also

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
see right here the run gets destroyed to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.420 
see right here the run gets destroyed to
the<00:02:21.900> outside<00:02:22.230> because<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.620> shed<00:02:23.099> my<00:02:23.220> block

spinning<00:02:38.280> him<00:02:38.459> around<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:39.209> see<00:02:39.360> how<00:02:39.480> he<00:02:39.540> just

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
spinning him around you see how he just

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.479 
spinning him around you see how he just
does<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.530> just<00:02:40.860> like<00:02:41.010> oh<00:02:41.190> you're

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
does that and is just like oh you're

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.309 
does that and is just like oh you're
your<00:02:42.150> outer<00:02:42.269> leveraging<00:02:42.780> me<00:02:42.870> let<00:02:43.080> me<00:02:43.140> just

your outer leveraging me let me just

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.110 
your outer leveraging me let me just
spin<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.069> Frank<00:02:44.310> Gore<00:02:44.489> can<00:02:44.700> now<00:02:44.819> get

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
spin you so that Frank Gore can now get

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.300 
spin you so that Frank Gore can now get

I take out the polling guard now you're

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.620 
I take out the polling guard now you're
