we were looking at I believe the launch

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.940 
we were looking at I believe the launch
price<00:02:56.710> was<00:02:56.980> around<00:02:57.100> eighty<00:02:57.610> dollars<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.950> of

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
much I like it but build quality here is

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.730 
much I like it but build quality here is
solid<00:03:39.670> design<00:03:40.180> seems<00:03:40.630> nice<00:03:40.870> it's<00:03:41.200> modern<00:03:41.590> and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740

I've<00:03:42.310> seen<00:03:42.520> a<00:03:42.550> lot<00:03:42.640> of<00:03:42.820> docks<00:03:43.120> as<00:03:43.750> many<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.380> you

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
I've seen a lot of docks as many of you

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.250 
I've seen a lot of docks as many of you
may<00:03:44.770> imagine<00:03:45.250> or<00:03:45.760> can't<00:03:45.940> imagine<00:03:46.360> in<00:03:47.020> the

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
course of reviewing products like this

reviewed<00:03:52.720> for<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.080> galaxy<00:03:53.560> note<00:03:53.740> 2<00:03:54.340> which<00:03:55.030> is

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
reviewed for the galaxy note 2 which is

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.580 
reviewed for the galaxy note 2 which is
very<00:03:55.450> similar<00:03:55.630> in<00:03:55.870> terms<00:03:56.020> of<00:03:56.200> functionality

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
very similar in terms of functionality

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.770 
very similar in terms of functionality
to<00:03:57.070> this<00:03:57.310> because<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:57.790> gives<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.210> three<00:03:58.510> USB

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
to this because it gives you three USB

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.040 
to this because it gives you three USB
ports<00:03:58.930> HDMI<00:03:59.440> out<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.340> a<00:04:00.460> line<00:04:00.700> out<00:04:00.940> as<00:04:01.750> well<00:04:01.960> as

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
ports HDMI out and a line out as well as

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.190 
ports HDMI out and a line out as well as
of<00:04:02.110> course<00:04:02.170> charging<00:04:02.800> capability<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:04.020> this<00:04:05.020> is

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
of course charging capability so this is

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.930 
of course charging capability so this is
definitely<00:04:05.410> one<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.160> nicer<00:04:06.190> docks<00:04:06.730> that

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
definitely one of the nicer docks that

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.560 
definitely one of the nicer docks that

I know toshiba did come out with a
budget<00:04:21.760> tablet<00:04:22.270> not<00:04:22.450> you

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
budget tablet not you

go<00:04:23.000> away<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.420> didn't<00:04:23.990> really<00:04:24.170> appeal<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.470> me

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
go away I didn't really appeal to me

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.780 
go away I didn't really appeal to me
because<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.100> know<00:04:25.220> that's<00:04:25.460> not<00:04:25.580> what<00:04:25.760> I

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
because you know that's not what I

an actual value and really represents a

things going on there but they could

could have gone with something that was

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
sure why they did it probably cost but

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.750 
sure why they did it probably cost but
not<00:05:12.290> too<00:05:12.470> relevant<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:13.010> then<00:05:13.340> here<00:05:13.490> we<00:05:13.520> have

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
not too relevant and then here we have

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.460 
not too relevant and then here we have
of<00:05:13.910> course<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.300> other<00:05:14.450> half<00:05:14.750> of<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.080> charging

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
of course the other half of the charging

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.160 
of course the other half of the charging
components<00:05:16.040> so<00:05:16.190> not<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.210> most<00:05:17.480> mobile<00:05:17.810> device

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
components so not the most mobile device

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.570 
components so not the most mobile device
but<00:05:18.470> when<00:05:18.590> you<00:05:18.680> think<00:05:18.830> about<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.220> fact<00:05:19.400> that

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
but when you think about the fact that

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.490 
but when you think about the fact that
this<00:05:19.760> will<00:05:19.970> give<00:05:20.120> you<00:05:20.240> all<00:05:20.480> the<00:05:20.720> capability<00:05:21.320> of

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
this will give you all the capability of

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.700 
this will give you all the capability of
something<00:05:22.190> like<00:05:22.400> a<00:05:22.700> transformer<00:05:23.470> because<00:05:24.470> now

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
something like a transformer because now

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.080 
something like a transformer because now
all<00:05:24.740> you<00:05:25.130> need<00:05:25.160> to<00:05:25.370> have<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:25.670> a<00:05:25.700> Bluetooth

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
all you need to have is a Bluetooth

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.360 
all you need to have is a Bluetooth
keyboard<00:05:26.540> a<00:05:26.690> mouse<00:05:26.920> because<00:05:27.920> really<00:05:28.130> you

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
keyboard a mouse because really you

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.730 
keyboard a mouse because really you
could<00:05:28.640> just<00:05:28.790> use<00:05:29.030> your<00:05:29.300> tablet<00:05:29.510> up<00:05:30.410> right<00:05:30.710> in
