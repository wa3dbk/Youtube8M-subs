tutorial<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.000> grabbed<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.110> rocky<00:00:22.650> texture<00:00:23.220> from

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
tutorial I grabbed a rocky texture from

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.359 
tutorial I grabbed a rocky texture from
cg<00:00:24.360> texture<00:00:24.750> skaam<00:00:25.200> I<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:26.099> brought<00:00:26.189> that

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
cg texture skaam I just brought that

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.600 
cg texture skaam I just brought that
into<00:00:26.520> Photoshop<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.740> adjust<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.890> some<00:00:29.279> curves

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
into Photoshop and adjust to some curves

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.030 
into Photoshop and adjust to some curves
and<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.090> dell<00:00:30.270> is<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> PNG<00:00:30.750> file<00:00:31.080> now<00:00:31.680> I<00:00:31.710> just

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and it's a dell is a PNG file now I just

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.080 
and it's a dell is a PNG file now I just
import<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.850> into<00:00:32.970> 3d<00:00:33.840> coat<00:00:34.520> in<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.670> case<00:00:35.879> I

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
import it into 3d coat in this case I

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.510 
import it into 3d coat in this case I
had<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> invert<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.720> mask<00:00:36.900> because<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:38.250> white

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
had to invert the mask because the white

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.520 
had to invert the mask because the white
and<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> texture<00:00:39.210> carves<00:00:39.660> into<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.140> object

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and the texture carves into the object

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.500 
and the texture carves into the object
or<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.800> black<00:00:40.980> doesn't<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:41.940> anything<00:00:42.269> at<00:00:42.390> all

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
or as black doesn't do anything at all

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.240 
or as black doesn't do anything at all
so<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.199> could<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.530> brought<00:00:43.650> that<00:00:43.710> back<00:00:44.040> into

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
so I could have brought that back into

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.220 
so I could have brought that back into
the<00:00:44.309> photoshop<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.940> inverted<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> alright

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the photoshop and inverted it alright

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
the photoshop and inverted it alright
you<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.379> click<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> invert<00:00:47.190> mask<00:00:47.400> and<00:00:47.670> 3d

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
you just click on the invert mask and 3d

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.709 
you just click on the invert mask and 3d
coat<00:00:48.390> I'm<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.440> sculpting<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.329> cracks<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
coat I'm just sculpting in cracks to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.750 
coat I'm just sculpting in cracks to
places<00:00:52.380> that<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:52.980> cracks<00:00:53.219> would<00:00:53.430> appear

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
places that I think cracks would appear

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.910 
places that I think cracks would appear
naturally<00:00:54.329> he's<00:00:54.930> using<00:00:55.320> other<00:00:55.469> parts<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
naturally he's using other parts of the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.030 
naturally he's using other parts of the
texture<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.520> add<00:00:57.120> more<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.809> concrete<00:00:58.649> feel

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
texture to add more of a concrete feel

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.760 
texture to add more of a concrete feel
to<00:00:59.370> everything<00:00:59.730> so<00:00:59.760> it's<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.270> smooth

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
to everything so it's not so smooth

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.520 
to everything so it's not so smooth
especially<00:01:01.770> along<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.950> edges<00:01:02.190> too<00:01:03.410> so<00:01:04.410> I'm

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
especially along the edges too so I'm

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.520 
especially along the edges too so I'm
just<00:01:04.739> filling<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.489> areas<00:01:05.910> and<00:01:06.380> throwing<00:01:07.380> in

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
just filling in areas and throwing in

00:01:07.530 --> 00:03:07.209 
just filling in areas and throwing in
some<00:01:07.770> deeper<00:01:08.280> gouges

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.219 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.209 

now<00:03:08.219> sometimes<00:03:08.640> when<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.659> sculpt<00:03:10.409> using<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.920> mask

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219 
now sometimes when I sculpt using a mask

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.539 
now sometimes when I sculpt using a mask
like<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:12.390> see<00:03:12.420> sharp<00:03:13.319> points<00:03:14.129> appear

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
like this you see sharp points appear

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.539 
like this you see sharp points appear
low<00:03:15.420> spikes<00:03:15.870> I'll<00:03:16.590> go<00:03:16.829> back<00:03:17.010> through<00:03:17.370> those

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
low spikes I'll go back through those

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.809 
low spikes I'll go back through those
and<00:03:18.319> smooth<00:03:19.319> them<00:03:19.439> out<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.219> then<00:03:20.519> after<00:03:20.790> that

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
and smooth them out and then after that

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:48.660 
and smooth them out and then after that
apply<00:03:21.620> texture<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:22.680> top<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.980> that

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.809 

i<00:03:48.760> also<00:03:49.420> created<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:50.080> another<00:03:50.500> texture<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.790> a

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
i also created a another texture and a

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.030 
i also created a another texture and a
lot<00:03:52.030> more<00:03:52.180> contrast<00:03:52.870> in<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.410> other<00:03:53.530> one<00:03:53.709> we're

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
lot more contrast in the other one we're

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.520 
lot more contrast in the other one we're
using<00:03:54.220> this<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.790> create<00:03:55.540> sharper<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:56.260> dents

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
using this to create sharper and dents

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:17.420 
using this to create sharper and dents
in<00:03:56.830> gouges

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.400 

also<00:04:18.430> there<00:04:18.609> are<00:04:18.639> areas<00:04:18.940> where<00:04:19.570> if<00:04:20.290> I'm

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
also there are areas where if I'm

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.650 
also there are areas where if I'm
painting<00:04:20.650> along<00:04:20.979> an<00:04:21.130> edge<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.940> adjoining

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
painting along an edge the adjoining

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.840 
painting along an edge the adjoining
edge<00:04:22.900> will<00:04:23.560> have<00:04:23.710> streaks<00:04:24.160> from<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.490> texture

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
edge will have streaks from the texture

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.659 
edge will have streaks from the texture
so<00:04:25.419> I'll<00:04:25.540> just<00:04:25.810> paint<00:04:26.620> texture<00:04:27.070> over<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.430> to

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
so I'll just paint texture over that to

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.730 
so I'll just paint texture over that to
cover<00:04:27.880> it<00:04:28.060> up<00:04:28.210> or<00:04:28.479> smooth<00:04:28.990> it<00:04:29.139> out<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:29.560> then

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
cover it up or smooth it out and then

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.129 
cover it up or smooth it out and then
paint<00:04:29.979> over<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.280> again<00:04:30.430> now<00:04:31.360> here<00:04:31.630> I'm<00:04:31.810> adding

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
paint over it again now here I'm adding

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.960 
paint over it again now here I'm adding
a<00:04:32.290> little<00:04:32.500> more<00:04:32.620> detail<00:04:33.010> into<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.430> areas<00:04:33.940> that

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
a little more detail into the areas that

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.190 
a little more detail into the areas that
i<00:04:34.180> smoothed<00:04:34.540> out<00:04:39.389> that's<00:04:40.389> pretty<00:04:40.900> much<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.050> for

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
i smoothed out that's pretty much it for

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:52.559 
i smoothed out that's pretty much it for
part<00:04:41.889> 2

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.629 

you
