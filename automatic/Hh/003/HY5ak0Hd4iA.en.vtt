that is not about cooking it's about

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.870 
that is not about cooking it's about

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
and I didn't particularly like it I

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.019 
and I didn't particularly like it I
didn't<00:00:19.859> like<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> way<00:00:20.189> they<00:00:20.340> were<00:00:20.369> editing<00:00:20.850> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
didn't like the way they were editing it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.870

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
horrible you know I've had so many

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.440 
horrible you know I've had so many
letters<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.320> support<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:35.010> saying<00:00:35.399> what<00:00:36.329> you

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450

said<00:00:36.480> was<00:00:36.899> not<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.410> harmful<00:00:37.649> people<00:00:38.070> it's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
said was not really harmful people it's

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
said was not really harmful people it's
just<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.399> little<00:00:38.640> bit<00:00:38.760> too<00:00:38.879> sensitive<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.600> think

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
just a little bit too sensitive I think

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.990 
just a little bit too sensitive I think
one<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.320> his<00:00:40.469> big<00:00:40.710> concerns<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.610> your

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
one of his big concerns was your

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.720 
one of his big concerns was your
phrasing<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.930> gay<00:00:43.170> good<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.219> I've<00:00:44.460> thought

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
phrasing of gay good as you I've thought

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.340 
phrasing of gay good as you I've thought
about<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.149> an<00:00:45.510> awful<00:00:45.660> lot<00:00:45.930> especially

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
about it an awful lot especially

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.510 
about it an awful lot especially
thinking<00:00:46.590> about<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.890> interview<00:00:47.250> today<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
thinking about this interview today and

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.819 
thinking about this interview today and
I<00:00:47.789> still<00:00:48.090> can't<00:00:48.360> understand<00:00:48.930> how<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.649> could

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
I still can't understand how it could

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.590 
I still can't understand how it could
possibly<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.489> been<00:00:50.789> offensive<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.360> anybody

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
possibly have been offensive to anybody

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.170 
possibly have been offensive to anybody
including<00:00:51.899> him<00:00:52.350> yeah<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.760> like

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
including him yeah I think it's like

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.119 
including him yeah I think it's like
what<00:00:54.390> did<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.660> know<00:00:54.809> who<00:00:55.199> left<00:00:55.559> at<00:00:55.800> there<00:00:56.010> it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
just a bit intense and I found that

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.630 
just a bit intense and I found that
those<00:03:21.410> young<00:03:21.680> girls<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:22.070> couldn't<00:03:22.370> connect

with him at all and I thought the Brian

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.280 
with him at all and I thought the Brian
had<00:03:24.350> an<00:03:24.500> agenda<00:03:24.830> as<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.760> reality<00:03:26.330> TV<00:03:26.510> star<00:03:26.720> very

quickly I started to look down my nose
at<00:03:29.240> them<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.540> thought<00:03:30.020> there<00:03:30.200> were<00:03:30.290> less<00:03:30.470> of

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620
