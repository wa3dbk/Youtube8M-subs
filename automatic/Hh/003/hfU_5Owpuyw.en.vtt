Giorgio Petrosyan

00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:08.665
---Are you damaged?

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:15.730
My hand hurts, but that's all.

00:00:34.383 --> 00:00:38.561
---How happy are you about the win?

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:59.780
I finally became number one. I'm very happy.

00:01:15.427 --> 00:01:22.032
---You were chosen for Masato's final match.

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:43.631
He's very strong, but he's not number one. I am.

00:01:56.692 --> 00:02:01.623
---So you will prove that on New Year's eve?

00:02:07.942 --> 00:02:15.667
I don't like just talking about something. It's all about action.

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:25.265
I'll show you who is number one on New Year's eve.

00:02:54.155 --> 00:03:05.424
---Masato asked you if you were free on New Year's. How did you answer?

00:03:12.314 --> 00:03:19.789
I told him that I was free and that I'd see him then.

00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:41.238
---Your impression of Masato?

00:03:46.577 --> 00:03:52.147
I've been watching him for a long time.

00:03:52.147 --> 00:04:05.732
I like his style, but his time is over.

00:04:25.609 --> 00:04:57.158
Finally, I'd like to thank everyone. My master and manager, too.
