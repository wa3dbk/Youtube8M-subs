okay<00:00:36.890> here<00:00:37.160> we<00:00:37.250> are<00:00:37.280> I<00:00:37.640> thought<00:00:38.000> today<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:38.329> would

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
okay here we are I thought today I would

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.869 
okay here we are I thought today I would
talk<00:00:38.750> a<00:00:38.780> little<00:00:39.170> bit<00:00:39.559> about<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:40.399> importance

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
talk a little bit about the importance

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.630 
talk a little bit about the importance
of<00:00:41.030> understanding<00:00:41.440> lighting<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:42.649> the

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
of understanding lighting and the

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.630 
of understanding lighting and the
Lighting's<00:00:44.030> ability<00:00:44.659> to<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.440> face<00:00:45.649> one<00:00:46.519> of

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
Lighting's ability to the face one of

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.979 
Lighting's ability to the face one of
the<00:00:46.699> things<00:00:46.969> that<00:00:47.120> photographers<00:00:47.719> have<00:00:47.870> the

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
the things that photographers have the

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.319 
the things that photographers have the
biggest<00:00:48.170> problem<00:00:48.769> with<00:00:48.979> is<00:00:49.329> understanding

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
biggest problem with is understanding

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.939 
biggest problem with is understanding
where<00:00:50.600> they<00:00:50.780> should<00:00:51.019> start<00:00:51.379> when<00:00:51.680> shooting

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
where they should start when shooting

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.789 
where they should start when shooting
it's<00:00:52.850> very<00:00:53.119> very<00:00:53.449> simple<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.960> get<00:00:54.109> confused<00:00:54.320> on

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
it's very very simple to get confused on

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.700 
it's very very simple to get confused on
that<00:00:54.859> but<00:00:55.579> every<00:00:56.000> photograph<00:00:56.420> begins<00:00:57.379> and

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
that but every photograph begins and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.000 
that but every photograph begins and
ends<00:00:58.129> with<00:00:58.519> light<00:00:59.420> we<00:01:00.320> have<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.739> take<00:01:00.979> that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
ends with light we have to take that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.819 
ends with light we have to take that
into<00:01:01.219> consideration<00:01:01.809> so<00:01:02.809> what<00:01:03.049> that<00:01:03.079> means<00:01:03.559> is

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
into consideration so what that means is

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.850 
into consideration so what that means is
you<00:01:04.009> need<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.280> find<00:01:04.580> out<00:01:04.759> two<00:01:05.119> key<00:01:05.449> elements

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
you need to find out two key elements

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.090 
you need to find out two key elements
those<00:01:06.860> key<00:01:07.190> elements<00:01:07.759> are<00:01:08.380> number<00:01:09.380> one<00:01:09.619> the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
those key elements are number one the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.760 
those key elements are number one the
direction<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:10.909> light<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:12.140> need<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:12.590> know

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
direction of light you need to know

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.090 
direction of light you need to know
exactly<00:01:13.009> where<00:01:13.789> the<00:01:14.000> light<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.450> coming<00:01:14.899> from

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
exactly where the light is coming from

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.520 
exactly where the light is coming from
without<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.369> you're<00:01:17.030> in<00:01:17.149> trouble<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.690> the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
without it you're in trouble and the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.130 
without it you're in trouble and the
second<00:01:18.950> part<00:01:19.159> is<00:01:19.600> understanding<00:01:20.600> what<00:01:20.630> type

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
second part is understanding what type

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.919 
second part is understanding what type
of<00:01:21.170> light<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:21.799> is<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:22.729> in<00:01:22.880> other<00:01:23.060> words<00:01:23.390> if

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
of light that is so in other words if

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.320 
of light that is so in other words if
you<00:01:24.200> walk<00:01:24.470> into<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.890> situation<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:25.670> need<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:26.060> be

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
you walk into a situation you need to be

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.109 
you walk into a situation you need to be
able<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.750> identify<00:01:26.899> whether<00:01:27.890> it's<00:01:28.220> daylight

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
able to identify whether it's daylight

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.469 
able to identify whether it's daylight
blue<00:01:29.659> light<00:01:29.979> tungsten<00:01:30.979> orange<00:01:31.490> light<00:01:31.670> green

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
blue light tungsten orange light green

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.899 
blue light tungsten orange light green
fluorescent<00:01:33.440> light<00:01:33.560> or<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:33.979> combination<00:01:34.490> of

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
fluorescent light or a combination of

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.419 
fluorescent light or a combination of
all<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.119> them<00:01:35.390> that<00:01:36.110> will<00:01:36.409> save<00:01:36.649> for<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:36.979> second

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
all of them that will save for a second

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.719 
all of them that will save for a second
video<00:01:37.670> but<00:01:38.299> right<00:01:38.600> now<00:01:39.020> we<00:01:39.890> need<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.399> decide

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
video but right now we need to decide

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.270 
video but right now we need to decide
where<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.630> light<00:01:41.840> coming<00:01:42.380> from<00:01:42.409> now<00:01:43.130> in

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
where is the light coming from now in

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.969 
where is the light coming from now in
most<00:01:43.430> situations<00:01:43.759> light<00:01:44.539> always<00:01:44.960> comes<00:01:45.710> from

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
most situations light always comes from

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.590 
most situations light always comes from
up<00:01:46.130> above<00:01:46.280> as<00:01:46.759> we<00:01:47.000> know<00:01:47.149> whether<00:01:47.420> you're

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
up above as we know whether you're

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.270 
up above as we know whether you're
indoors<00:01:48.020> outdoors<00:01:48.560> or<00:01:48.649> whatever<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:49.070> may<00:01:49.250> be

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
indoors outdoors or whatever it may be

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.910 
indoors outdoors or whatever it may be
but<00:01:49.520> right<00:01:49.759> now<00:01:50.270> we're<00:01:50.869> in<00:01:50.899> my<00:01:51.200> studio<00:01:51.649> with<00:01:51.890> a

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
but right now we're in my studio with a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.219 
but right now we're in my studio with a
storefront<00:01:52.340> window<00:01:53.030> as<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.780> can<00:01:53.929> tell<00:01:53.990> from

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
storefront window as you can tell from

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.609 
storefront window as you can tell from
home<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.979> light<00:01:55.219> is<00:01:55.429> hitting<00:01:56.289> extremely<00:01:57.289> hard

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
home the light is hitting extremely hard

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.700 
home the light is hitting extremely hard
from<00:01:58.280> your<00:01:58.520> right<00:01:58.789> side<00:01:59.090> it's<00:01:59.479> coming<00:01:59.869> into<00:02:00.439> my

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
from your right side it's coming into my

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.489 
from your right side it's coming into my
face<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.670> once<00:02:01.939> we're<00:02:02.119> able<00:02:02.359> to<00:02:02.600> identify<00:02:02.750> that

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:03.499 
face so once we're able to identify that

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:05.590 
face so once we're able to identify that
that's<00:02:04.130> going<00:02:04.429> to<00:02:04.490> make<00:02:04.700> things<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:05.210> lot<00:02:05.359> easier

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
that's going to make things a lot easier

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.020 
that's going to make things a lot easier
and<00:02:06.289> better<00:02:06.320> for<00:02:06.770> us<00:02:07.070> to<00:02:07.100> start<00:02:07.490> shooting<00:02:07.729> our

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
and better for us to start shooting our

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.060 
and better for us to start shooting our
image<00:02:08.329> not<00:02:08.899> only<00:02:09.109> will<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.530> affect<00:02:09.890> our

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
image not only will it affect our

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.400 
image not only will it affect our
clarity<00:02:10.609> it'll<00:02:11.120> affect<00:02:11.540> our<00:02:11.720> perception<00:02:12.320> of

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
clarity it'll affect our perception of

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.440 
clarity it'll affect our perception of
the<00:02:12.560> way<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.709> image<00:02:13.220> looks<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:14.180> I'm<00:02:14.239> going<00:02:14.390> to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.710 
make people look their best so what
we're<00:04:25.260> doing<00:04:25.289> is<00:04:25.740> again<00:04:26.340> turning<00:04:26.760> a<00:04:26.970> face<00:04:27.210> into

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
we're doing is again turning a face into

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.839 
we're doing is again turning a face into
the<00:04:27.750> light<00:04:28.199> so<00:04:28.470> that<00:04:28.860> means<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.669> we're

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
the light so that means that we're

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.900 
the light so that means that we're
lighting<00:04:30.120> into<00:04:30.449> the<00:04:31.020> face<00:04:31.520> through<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.580> body

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
lighting into the face through the body

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.270 
lighting into the face through the body
it's<00:04:33.539> going<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.840> give<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.199> most<00:04:34.500> dimension

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
it's going to give the most dimension

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.219 
it's going to give the most dimension
that<00:04:35.370> we<00:04:35.430> possibly<00:04:35.760> can<00:04:36.389> of<00:04:36.599> the<00:04:36.720> body<00:04:36.960> and

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
that we possibly can of the body and

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.710 
that we possibly can of the body and
face<00:04:37.530> now<00:04:38.220> if<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:38.580> look<00:04:38.789> this<00:04:39.150> is<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.449> broad

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
face now if you look this is the broad

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.100 
face now if you look this is the broad
side<00:04:40.050> by<00:04:40.770> turning<00:04:41.130> away<00:04:41.340> this<00:04:42.210> is<00:04:42.479> now<00:04:42.660> called

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
side by turning away this is now called

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.379 
side by turning away this is now called
the<00:04:43.260> short<00:04:43.740> side<00:04:44.039> of<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.430> light<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.910> shadowed

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
the short side of the light the shadowed

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.589 
the short side of the light the shadowed
side<00:04:45.720> is<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.560> short<00:04:46.889> side<00:04:47.280> of<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.639> light<00:04:47.820> now

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
side is the short side of the light now

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.450 
side is the short side of the light now
by<00:04:48.780> bringing<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.289> short<00:04:49.620> side<00:04:49.949> of<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.250> light

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
by bringing the short side of the light

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.810 
by bringing the short side of the light
closer<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.990> it's<00:04:52.229> making<00:04:52.800> her<00:04:53.190> appear

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
closer to you it's making her appear

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.930 
closer to you it's making her appear
thinner<00:04:54.750> because<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:55.710> heavier<00:04:56.070> left<00:04:56.370> side<00:04:56.640> is

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
thinner because the heavier left side is

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.830 
thinner because the heavier left side is
further<00:04:57.450> away<00:04:57.840> from<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.380> lens<00:04:58.770> so<00:04:59.550> understand

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
further away from the lens so understand

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.050 
further away from the lens so understand
key<00:05:01.169> element<00:05:01.680> is<00:05:01.860> making<00:05:02.460> sure<00:05:02.699> that<00:05:02.940> the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
key element is making sure that the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.540 
key element is making sure that the
broad<00:05:03.419> light<00:05:03.840> is<00:05:04.080> further<00:05:04.800> from<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.220> lens

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
broad light is further from the lens

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.670 
broad light is further from the lens
broadly<00:05:06.210> lit<00:05:06.449> side<00:05:06.720> further<00:05:07.139> from<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.410> lens

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
broadly lit side further from the lens

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.090 
broadly lit side further from the lens
short<00:05:08.430> left<00:05:08.669> side<00:05:08.940> closer<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:10.139> you<00:05:10.650> look<00:05:10.860> at<00:05:10.979> me

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
short left side closer to you look at me

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.300 
short left side closer to you look at me
full<00:05:11.340> face<00:05:11.639> but<00:05:12.449> when<00:05:12.600> I<00:05:12.630> turn<00:05:12.960> away<00:05:13.310> thinner

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
full face but when I turn away thinner

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.260 
full face but when I turn away thinner
so<00:05:15.090> now<00:05:15.360> understand<00:05:16.229> direction<00:05:17.220> of<00:05:17.340> light<00:05:17.370> key

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
so now understand direction of light key

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.990 
so now understand direction of light key
element<00:05:18.750> very<00:05:19.199> very<00:05:19.470> simple<00:05:19.770> light<00:05:20.520> into<00:05:20.970> the
