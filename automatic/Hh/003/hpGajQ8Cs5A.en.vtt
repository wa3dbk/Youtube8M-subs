00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
it by getting the cortical the truth e28

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.300 
it by getting the cortical the truth e28
to<00:02:33.390> spin<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.870> then<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.710> actually<00:02:34.860> glide

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
