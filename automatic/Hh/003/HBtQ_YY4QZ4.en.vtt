want<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.450> food<00:01:15.630> truck<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.049> opposed<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
want a food truck as opposed to a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
want a food truck as opposed to a
restaurant<00:01:16.830> overhead<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.970> mean<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.689> pay

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
restaurant overhead I mean you don't pay

a<00:01:18.840> rent<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.890> lot<00:01:20.040> less<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.460> need<00:01:20.549> less

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
overall I think you can probably put

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
overall I think you can probably put
like<00:01:25.170> fifty<00:01:25.409> percent<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> bottom<00:01:26.189> line<00:01:26.369> as

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
opposed to like 12 if you're doing good

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.170 
opposed to like 12 if you're doing good
in<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.619> restaurant<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.490> economics<00:01:30.030> are
