thumbnails<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.159> this<00:01:19.430> is<00:01:19.960> really<00:01:20.960> no

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
thumbnails and this is really no

different you're just creating miniature

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.679 
different you're just creating miniature
thumbnails<00:01:24.439> of<00:01:24.829> color<00:01:25.490> variants<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.420> just

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
thumbnails of color variants and just

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.230 
thumbnails of color variants and just
trying<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.109> understand<00:01:27.680> what<00:01:28.640> are<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.850> kinds

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
trying to understand what are the kinds

of<00:01:29.329> colors<00:01:29.689> that<00:01:29.840> are<00:01:29.960> going<00:01:30.079> to<00:01:30.140> work<00:01:30.380> with

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
of colors that are going to work with

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.639 
of colors that are going to work with
this<00:01:30.740> what<00:01:31.070> are<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.250> ones<00:01:31.399> that<00:01:31.609> are<00:01:31.700> not<00:01:31.909> and

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
this what are the ones that are not and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
I you know when I started doing this

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.990 
I you know when I started doing this
stuff<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:35.630> really<00:01:35.960> don't<00:01:36.229> know<00:01:36.670> what<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.700> look

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000

stuff I really don't know what to look
for<00:01:38.240> sometimes<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.200> I'll<00:01:39.380> start<00:01:39.679> off<00:01:39.799> with

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
for sometimes so I'll start off with

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.969 
for sometimes so I'll start off with
some<00:01:40.420> warm<00:01:41.420> colors<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.200> I'll<00:01:42.320> start<00:01:42.590> off<00:01:42.740> then

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
some warm colors and I'll start off then

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.310 
some warm colors and I'll start off then
I'll<00:01:43.130> try<00:01:43.460> some<00:01:43.729> cool<00:01:43.969> colors<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:45.049> sort

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
I'll try some cool colors and that sort

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.270 
I'll try some cool colors and that sort
of<00:01:45.380> thing<00:01:45.530> that's<00:01:45.679> kind<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.009> what<00:01:46.159> you're

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280

of thing that's kind of what you're
seeing<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.640> background<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:47.420> then<00:01:47.990> try<00:01:48.439> to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
seeing in the background and then try to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.200 
seeing in the background and then try to
experiment<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.520> see<00:01:49.579> how<00:01:49.909> you're<00:01:50.060> going<00:01:50.149> to

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
experiment and see how you're going to

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.389 
experiment and see how you're going to
make<00:01:50.390> all<00:01:50.659> this<00:01:50.960> stuff<00:01:51.289> work<00:01:51.679> are<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.280> gonna

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
make all this stuff work are you gonna

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.999 
make all this stuff work are you gonna
make<00:01:52.729> something<00:01:53.299> with<00:01:53.649> different<00:01:54.649> colored

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
make something with different colored

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.179 
make something with different colored
backgrounds<00:01:56.200> have<00:01:57.200> some<00:01:57.499> sort<00:01:57.679> of<00:01:57.740> harmony

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
backgrounds have some sort of harmony

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.999 
backgrounds have some sort of harmony
color<00:01:58.490> harmony<00:01:59.229> so<00:02:00.229> as<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.499> go<00:02:00.679> through<00:02:00.710> the

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
color harmony so as I go through the

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.109 
color harmony so as I go through the
darks<00:02:01.429> I'm<00:02:02.119> lightly<00:02:02.840> coloring<00:02:03.829> in<00:02:04.070> all<00:02:04.640> with

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
darks I'm lightly coloring in all with

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.880 
darks I'm lightly coloring in all with
just<00:02:05.390> grays<00:02:06.140> here<00:02:06.679> and<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:08.210> am<00:02:08.569> really<00:02:09.560> using

is my light gonna be so I'm gonna see

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.979 
is my light gonna be so I'm gonna see
that<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.489> shadow<00:02:49.790> side<00:02:50.180> which<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.660> what<00:02:50.810> you

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
that the shadow side which is what you

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.720 
that the shadow side which is what you
see<00:02:51.200> here<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.099> lights<00:02:52.340> going<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.610> be

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
see here is the lights going to be

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.400 
see here is the lights going to be
coming<00:02:53.150> from<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:54.069> right<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.959> right-hand

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
coming from the right the right-hand

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.590 
coming from the right the right-hand
side<00:02:57.709> so<00:02:58.100> all<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.940> area<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.299> you<00:02:59.390> see<00:02:59.420> a

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
side so all that area that you see a

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.250 
side so all that area that you see a
little<00:02:59.870> bit<00:02:59.959> of<00:03:00.080> shadow<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:02.630> showing<00:03:03.049> where

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
little bit of shadow is showing where

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.309 
little bit of shadow is showing where
the<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:05.420> know<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.630> light<00:03:05.810> source<00:03:06.080> is<00:03:06.140> coming

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
the you know the light source is coming

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.180 
the you know the light source is coming
from<00:03:06.709> which<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.370> why<00:03:07.549> I'm<00:03:07.670> going<00:03:07.849> to<00:03:07.910> start<00:03:08.209> to

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
from which is why I'm going to start to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.759 
from which is why I'm going to start to
just<00:03:10.190> add<00:03:10.370> some<00:03:10.900> highlighted<00:03:11.900> orange<00:03:12.170> hues

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.640 
just add some highlighted orange hues
and<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.489> start<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.940> lighten<00:03:14.330> up<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:15.530> other

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
and and start to lighten up the other

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
and and start to lighten up the other
half<00:03:15.739> of<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.450> GTL<00:03:17.450> here<00:03:21.280> once<00:03:22.280> again<00:03:22.370> I'm

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
half of the GTL here once again I'm

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.839 
half of the GTL here once again I'm
going<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:22.880> just<00:03:23.200> darken<00:03:24.200> up<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:25.370> bottom

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
going to just darken up the the bottom

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.130 
going to just darken up the the bottom
of<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.150> GTO<00:03:26.650> indicate<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.769> shadowed<00:03:28.160> areas

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
of the GTO indicate the shadowed areas

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.550 
of the GTO indicate the shadowed areas
just<00:03:30.140> where<00:03:30.290> we<00:03:30.410> have<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.620> grill<00:03:30.950> area<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:32.560> once

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
just where we have a grill area and once

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.400 
just where we have a grill area and once
again<00:03:33.769> I'm<00:03:34.070> just<00:03:34.100> kind<00:03:34.370> of<00:03:35.260> searching<00:03:36.260> and

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
again I'm just kind of searching and

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.590 
again I'm just kind of searching and
looking<00:03:36.799> for<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.280> right<00:03:37.310> kinds<00:03:37.880> of<00:03:37.970> colors<00:03:38.359> to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
looking for the right kinds of colors to

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.670 
looking for the right kinds of colors to
use<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:44.000> know<00:03:44.540> another<00:03:44.750> reason<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:45.350> do<00:03:45.500> this

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
use you know another reason to do this

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.220 
use you know another reason to do this
to<00:03:46.430> try<00:03:46.579> this<00:03:46.700> technique<00:03:47.209> is<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.720> remove<00:03:48.049> the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
to try this technique is to remove the

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.380 
to try this technique is to remove the
intimidation<00:03:48.920> factor<00:03:49.100> because<00:03:49.760> here<00:03:50.030> we<00:03:50.150> got

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
intimidation factor because here we got

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.240 
intimidation factor because here we got
now<00:03:50.630> four<00:03:50.959> different<00:03:51.440> thumbnails<00:03:51.739> that

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
now four different thumbnails that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.479 
now four different thumbnails that
you're<00:03:52.940> just<00:03:53.180> sort<00:03:53.420> of<00:03:53.510> experimenting<00:03:54.230> with

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
you're just sort of experimenting with

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.360 
you're just sort of experimenting with
not<00:03:55.489> meant<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:55.970> be<00:03:56.120> anything<00:03:56.870> finished<00:03:57.530> it's

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
not meant to be anything finished it's

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.039 
not meant to be anything finished it's
just<00:03:58.730> there<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.150> assist<00:03:59.540> you<00:03:59.780> in<00:03:59.810> your

just there to assist you in your
exploration<00:04:00.739> that's<00:04:01.100> it<00:04:02.049> now<00:04:03.049> even<00:04:03.319> as<00:04:03.470> I'm

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
exploration that's it now even as I'm

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.979 
exploration that's it now even as I'm
exploring<00:04:04.280> different<00:04:04.459> colors<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.209> using<00:04:05.660> all

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
exploring different colors and using all

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.340 
exploring different colors and using all

these different hues and trying to find
a<00:04:09.440> way<00:04:09.560> for<00:04:09.769> it<00:04:09.859> to<00:04:09.920> work<00:04:10.160> I<00:04:10.459> still<00:04:11.239> have<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.600> be

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
a way for it to work I still have to be

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.860 
a way for it to work I still have to be
mindful<00:04:12.290> of<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:13.340> basics<00:04:13.850> of<00:04:14.060> really

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.879 
you're looking at this as a pure
exploration<00:04:34.960> phase<00:04:35.960> used

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
exploration phase used

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.050 
exploration phase used
do<00:04:37.840> keep<00:04:38.840> in<00:04:39.020> mind<00:04:39.259> that<00:04:39.590> they're<00:04:40.580> based<00:04:40.819> on

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
do keep in mind that they're based on

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.890 
do keep in mind that they're based on
core<00:04:41.449> principles<00:04:43.360> now<00:04:44.360> we're<00:04:44.539> going<00:04:44.629> to<00:04:44.689> go

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
core principles now we're going to go

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.739 
core principles now we're going to go
into<00:04:45.349> adding<00:04:46.279> some<00:04:46.550> reflected<00:04:47.120> areas<00:04:47.479> of<00:04:47.659> the

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:47.749 
into adding some reflected areas of the

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:51.339 
into adding some reflected areas of the
dark<00:04:47.960> we're<00:04:48.169> going<00:04:48.289> to<00:04:48.349> zoom<00:04:48.590> in<00:04:48.770> here<00:04:50.289> it's<00:04:51.289> a

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
dark we're going to zoom in here it's a

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.200 
dark we're going to zoom in here it's a
little<00:04:51.560> bit<00:04:51.680> of<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.830> jump<00:04:52.099> what<00:04:52.789> you<00:04:52.909> can<00:04:52.999> see

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
little bit of a jump what you can see

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.309 
little bit of a jump what you can see
from<00:04:53.389> the<00:04:53.539> video<00:04:54.050> transition<00:04:55.060> but

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
from the video transition but

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.510 
from the video transition but
essentially<00:04:57.319> what<00:04:57.469> I've<00:04:57.590> done<00:04:57.770> is<00:04:57.979> started<00:04:58.340> to

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
essentially what I've done is started to

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.339 
essentially what I've done is started to
pop<00:04:58.819> out<00:04:59.029> some<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.419> these<00:04:59.509> colors<00:04:59.960> I'm<00:05:00.110> just

pop out some of these colors I'm just
starting<00:05:00.590> to<00:05:00.620> pop<00:05:00.889> out<00:05:01.539> that<00:05:02.539> other<00:05:02.719> half<00:05:03.050> by

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
starting to pop out that other half by

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.040 
starting to pop out that other half by
increasing<00:05:04.159> the<00:05:04.249> intensity<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.300> yellow

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
increasing the intensity of the yellow

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.260 
increasing the intensity of the yellow
and<00:05:06.259> I'm<00:05:07.099> just<00:05:07.219> going<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:07.430> start<00:05:07.699> adding<00:05:08.150> in

colors from the base color and you know
the<00:06:22.789> harder<00:06:23.089> you<00:06:23.210> press<00:06:23.419> the<00:06:23.539> more<00:06:23.719> pressure

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
the harder you press the more pressure

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.749 
the harder you press the more pressure
you<00:06:24.319> put<00:06:24.349> as<00:06:24.770> you<00:06:24.889> have<00:06:25.129> the<00:06:25.250> colored<00:06:25.580> Dodge

you put as you have the colored Dodge
tool<00:06:26.149> selected<00:06:26.949> the<00:06:27.949> more<00:06:28.219> intense<00:06:29.169> the<00:06:30.169> hues

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
tool selected the more intense the hues

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:37.060 
tool selected the more intense the hues
become

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.700 

so<00:06:38.070> here<00:06:38.280> I'm<00:06:38.370> just<00:06:38.900> playing<00:06:39.900> around<00:06:40.170> with<00:06:40.440> the

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
so here I'm just playing around with the

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.870 
so here I'm just playing around with the
with<00:06:41.490> the<00:06:41.610> light<00:06:42.800> adding<00:06:43.800> some<00:06:43.980> intensity<00:06:44.550> to

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
with the light adding some intensity to

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.240 
with the light adding some intensity to
the<00:06:45.060> image<00:06:47.990> so<00:06:48.990> wrapping<00:06:49.410> up<00:06:49.530> here<00:06:49.800> this<00:06:50.040> is

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
the image so wrapping up here this is

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.730 
the image so wrapping up here this is
really<00:06:51.090> the<00:06:51.270> general<00:06:51.660> idea<00:06:51.930> behind<00:06:52.170> color

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
really the general idea behind color

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.180 
really the general idea behind color
compositions<00:06:53.580> is<00:06:53.880> to<00:06:54.710> kind<00:06:55.710> of<00:06:55.770> find<00:06:56.070> that

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
compositions is to kind of find that

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.400 
compositions is to kind of find that
balance<00:06:56.790> between<00:06:57.330> all<00:06:57.600> the<00:06:57.870> different<00:06:57.900> hues

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
balance between all the different hues

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.890 
balance between all the different hues
and<00:06:58.530> colors<00:06:58.950> that<00:06:59.130> you<00:06:59.250> see<00:06:59.600> so<00:07:00.600> I<00:07:00.630> hope<00:07:00.780> you

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
and colors that you see so I hope you
