00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
from your pile fire pits are typically

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.020 
from your pile fire pits are typically
round<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.799> oftentimes<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.000> dig<00:01:39.270> a

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
round and oftentimes you can dig a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.389 
round and oftentimes you can dig a
little<00:01:42.030> rut<00:01:42.560> into<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> side<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.920> one<00:01:44.070> which

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
little rut into the side of one which

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.910 
little rut into the side of one which
will<00:01:44.520> help<00:01:44.610> increase<00:01:44.820> airflow<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
will help increase airflow in the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.859 
will help increase airflow in the
beginning<00:01:47.310> stages<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.789> your<00:01:47.970> fire<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.539> keep

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
beginning stages of your fire and keep

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.779 
beginning stages of your fire and keep
your<00:01:48.960> coals<00:01:49.320> running<00:01:49.740> hotter<00:01:49.979> once<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.610> fire

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
your coals running hotter once your fire

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:59.419 
your coals running hotter once your fire
is<00:01:50.820> actually<00:01:51.330> going<00:01:57.200> if<00:01:58.200> you're<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.100> an<00:01:59.220> area

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
is actually going if you're in an area

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.169 
is actually going if you're in an area
that<00:02:00.440> has<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.470> premade<00:02:02.009> fire<00:02:02.369> ring<00:02:02.729> that's

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
that has a premade fire ring that's

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.789 
that has a premade fire ring that's
always<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> best<00:02:03.780> choice<00:02:03.929> to<00:02:04.289> use<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.679> it's

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
always the best choice to use and it's

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.520 
always the best choice to use and it's
already<00:02:05.130> been<00:02:05.280> impacted<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.530> therefore

already been impacted and therefore

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.270 
already been impacted and therefore
you'll<00:02:07.709> be<00:02:07.830> able<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.220> minimize<00:02:08.519> your<00:02:08.910> impact

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
you'll be able to minimize your impact
