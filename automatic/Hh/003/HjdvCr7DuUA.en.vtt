00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
 hello hall is welcome in this 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.899
 roulette the recipe of the day and 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.160
 aubergines au gratin for 4 people 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.130
 we need it aubergines 1 pepper 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.890
 red 125 g mozzarella 3 tomatoes 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.119
 keep with the judge a spoon 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.220
 honey soup some leaves of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.000
 basil 30 g grated gruyere oil 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.060
 olive salt and pepper forgets not 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.529
 to put the oven to preheated 180 Â° on 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.019
 will start with miss them 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.880
 eggplant yes I know I already have trouble 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.649
 to double with 2 aubergines so I'll 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.450
 say with 3 e tron it would be a 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.410
 disaster 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.149
 but hey it's okay since we're going 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.190
 the kitchens and not the juggles already 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.870
 remove the ends I have the cut in 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.079
 two in the sense of the length as 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.079
 it 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.970
 eggplant empty feeling we are 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.250
 to make room for me 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.870
 I use a Parisian spoon with 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.990
 once we're done it's hard to 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.990
 to do without 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.730
 and now we're going to have the 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.920
 eggplant and emptied into dishes that 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.270
 I have to put a little trick of 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.870
 books anyway and then I put them 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.340
 in well keep the pulpit of 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.430
 the game eggplant cut it into small 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.430
 parts 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.530
 I will start with cooking but 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.500
 eggplants the weight we will come the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.490
 join nice and a few moments I 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.210
 cut out the point so have there me in 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.070
 what I do is I take off 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.570
 the hat and then I pass along 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.140
 like that to remove the seeds that 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.939
 are in the center 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.979
 then we will cut into pieces 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.560
 each for his technique to cut 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.509
 peppers me I admit that I like 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.039
 cut the hat first and always 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.420
 cuts and flesh side because I 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.789
 find when one cuts out skin side and ben 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.319
 allal there but slip on the pepper that me 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.149
 dislike a lot thought about bissau peppers 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.720
 and then we detail in strips or 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.610
 small pieces 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.110
 the important thing is that it is not cut 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.619
 too big no it takes time to cook 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.619
 In the caserole 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.080
 I now add the tomatoes that 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.549
 I will simply cut into small 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.689
 pieces with their juice i'm going 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.580
 directly with the scissors for 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.179
 cut into pieces and sometimes I 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.819
 even do it directly in the box of 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.180
 basil for flavoring salt and 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.040
 pepper 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.040
 now is that during 15 to 20 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.420
 minutes on mild medium fire the idea is 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.860
 to really get something good 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.530
 fondant well fluffy so it takes 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.569
 really that vegetables and time of 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.890
 become all tender and five minutes 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.650
 before the end of cooking 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.420
 we will add the honey I cut the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.340
 mozzarella in thin slices that's all 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.360
 just the strange thing we will put on the 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.370
 above for it to be based on vegetables 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.930
 milk think I finger-mouthed have 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.670
 garnished the eggplant halves with the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.920
 mix if you ever find that the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.810
 eggplant and do not like it right 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.810
 can do is take off a tiny 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.530
 little skin on the back of the eggplant 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.060
 just to prevent them from being too much 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.150
 bombay so she can stand in 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.750
 place I put it seems to me there and the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.970
 grated cheese 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.840
 I do not know you, but then it's me 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.150
 gives great bread to quote them to the sites 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.510
 so he wants in the comments 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.829
 you scream it scream I'm hungry it's gone 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.829
 for 45 minutes of cooking 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.670
 aubergines au gratin are ready I 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.440
 serve with semolina between us 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.930
 I took the joke that goes in 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.840
 zucchini mini stuffed in the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.120
 squash with herbs of jacqueline because 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.130
