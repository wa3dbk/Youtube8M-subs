 Photoshop video tutorials 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.930
 welcome everyone to the new video tutorials on 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.360
 Communication Alexey Kuzmichev 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.330
 and today we will study with you 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.330
 separate complex objects from the background in 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.000
 In this case, we will separate 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.790
 This model is so difficult to see. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.090
 here is that she develops here 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.370
 so here in all directions hair and therefore 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.850
 in the usual way to highlight this area 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.579
 I wo n't be able to show you how 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.470
 make using the channel oh well 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.050
 let's start first with us 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.780
 you need to copy our model 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.290
 on the new background for this click kontrol 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.470
 and kontrol prices and paste on a new background 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.560
 and press control to customize the size. 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.000
 using the control the combination 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.180
 free transform clamped 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.689
 shift key we begin to reduce the size 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.530
 until the moment we have a model 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.259
 will fit 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:21.149
 on our new background so still a little bit 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:26.009
 decrease by approximately so push 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:29.009
 enter key and now we are with you 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.189
 It is necessary to go to the tabs channels with 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.689
 with the help of which we are already with you and we will 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.060
 highlight our model 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.139
 here as you can see there are four 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.999
 the channel is rgb red green and blue 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:44.459
 we need to choose from here 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:47.270
 these here are 3 red green and blue 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:50.280
 the most contrast channel 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 usually this is the blue channel in this case 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.520
 me also then he i think that with 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.609
 most photos will be a contrast 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.130
 most blue channel choose it 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.950
 right click select item 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.929
 create a duplicate channel here click 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.590
 ok key and turn this channel on for now 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.230
 that the main blue channel can be turned off 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.050
 he does not come in handy go back to 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.230
 a copy so that we can be with you 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.360
 easier let's invert this channel 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.420
 press the combination counter 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.020
 and we get this result 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.580
 as you can see on a black background, hair is much 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.230
 become more noticeable 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.840
 it's very, very good if you have a background 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.510
 fairly contrasting then you can when 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.630
 help item image correction 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.730
 level a little bit to edit 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.970
 contrast dragging this one over here left 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.739
 Slider right but here it is very important 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.319
 don't overdo it if for example you 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.750
 drag this slider 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.660
 you begin to disappear hair details see 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.530
 so why pick such a value 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.299
 to you and the background was the most 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:11.480
 contrast and hair left over 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:14.400
 max integer click ok 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.900
 Next, select the tool dimmer 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.120
 click here exhibiting for it 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.390
 set 100 percent and range with 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.190
 you must be a shadow to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.290
 the impact was only on the darkest 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.920
 areas 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:36.320
 starting to work out the area where we 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.320
 background here in such a way to paint them 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:43.880
 we pass also here 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:48.530
 work out the area where the hair to 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:58.620
 maximally add contrast here here 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:04:04.470
 so also here neatly here it is 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.609
 Now we can take the whole thing 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.000
 larger diameter 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:13.290
 and paint over the remaining areas here 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.200
 so now choose the tool 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.959
 lighter range set backlight 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.250
 exhibiting one hundred percent and starting 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.940
 already work with the brightest 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.940
 areas 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:32.560
 so here we go all we highlight them if 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.300
 somewhere we will not work 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.419
 the area is okay we have them then 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.419
 just with a brush also 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.419
 draw 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:56.830
 working through all the window here and these 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.430
 areas can already be modified using 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.139
 tassels 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:06.099
 choose a brush in white make sure 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:09.219
 that you have it tough and just 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:15.639
 paint over the remaining areas like this 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:17.560
 here is the way everything is fine now for us 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.280
 you need from this area 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.919
 get selection for this click 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.520
 holding down the control key in our 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.560
 channel off channel rgb 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.080
 this channel we worked with 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.449
 turn off and go back to 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.710
 tab layers 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:39.729
 add a mask to our top layer 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:42.279
 click here and as you see our model 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.400
 fits on a new background only 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:47.050
 here and there we have become noticeably ugly 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.120
 streaks of old background 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.310
 but I will show you just one 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.610
 a way that will help you from them 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:58.300
 get rid let's duplicate the layer with 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.279
 model press control jay go 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.699
 on the bottom layer and overlay mode for 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:06.580
 we put it multiply as you can see already 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:10.120
 the veining has become much less now 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.729
 select the mask of the upper layer and go 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.740
 in the item box here choose the item 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:18.870
 properties 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:21.669
 here we click on the edge of the mask button and 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:26.480
 let's start a little shift 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:37.180
 edge left and add 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:41.560
 feathering so follow the result 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:45.700
 so that we have a smooth transition 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.700
 between these two layers 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:57.190
 Well, I think you can now leave u 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:07:00.410
 where have I appeared in the gap 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.600
 on model's face on chest 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.340
 nothing terrible from them can be easy 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.070
 get rid of with ordinary white 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.720
 brushes now I will show how to do it 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:12.020
 click ok here close 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.810
 This window and as I said now 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.150
 we need to get rid of the visible areas 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.670
 the previous stage is not very good them 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:23.540
 so painted over just white brush 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:27.020
 here we do masochki here in principle and 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.660
 everything and so let's look at the result 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.690
 which we succeeded if we for example 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.550
 turn off the bottom layer as you can see here 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:37.250
 a very large amount is lost 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:40.220
 details and of course I want you right away 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.780
 say that here for every photo 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.740
 values â€‹â€‹will be individual to you 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:48.710
 it will be necessary to customize the settings 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:51.410
 masks under exactly your picture under 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.870
 your selection so you have it 

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:57.350
 looked natural and harmonious on 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:08:00.110
 new background Well on this I think all 

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.660
 Thank you all for your attention and see you in 

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.580
