people keep stopping progress because of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.010 
people keep stopping progress because of
some<00:00:59.100> objection<00:00:59.699> but<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.090> genuinely<00:01:00.510> feel<00:01:00.809> in

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
India religion is given more importance

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.600 
India religion is given more importance
than<00:01:02.879> law<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.809> other<00:01:03.930> things<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.680> there's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
different the different laws for

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.620 
different the different laws for
different<00:01:08.010> religions<00:01:08.400> yeah<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.090> that's<00:01:09.330> I

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
different religions yeah so that's I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.240 
different religions yeah so that's I
don't<00:01:09.960> understand<00:01:10.320> how<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.680> think<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.040> one

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
don't understand how we can think is one

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.550 
don't understand how we can think is one
nation<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.540> actually<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.380> different

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
nation if we actually are different

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.010 
nation if we actually are different
nations<00:01:14.159> right<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.210> we're<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.570> secular

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
nations right so we're not secular

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.890 
nations right so we're not secular
because<00:01:16.530> when<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> say<00:01:17.340> secular<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.970> mean<00:01:18.479> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
because when I say secular I mean that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.420 
because when I say secular I mean that
law<00:01:19.140> should<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.409> separate<00:01:19.830> from<00:01:19.979> religion

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
law should be separate from religion

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.420 
law should be separate from religion
right<00:01:20.490> um<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:22.320> what<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.250> while

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
right um and you can be what in a while

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
Muslim and that's great right but there

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
Muslim and that's great right but there
should<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.829> law<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.579> I'm<00:01:29.700> told<00:01:29.909> that'll

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
should be one law but I'm told that'll

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.420 
should be one law but I'm told that'll
