00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.610
 toy 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.610
 let's see what we open 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.550
 uy but what is this 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.070
 it seems that they are rackets 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.570
 and apart from that they have also left us 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.030

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.100
 pieces more to a blue and another orange 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.530
 let's see the brochure to know how 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.690

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.770
 Clear 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.770
 Well here we have it 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.650
 it seems that they are two rackets that are put 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.840
 in your fingers and you can play with a 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.500
 ball the hoops that have come out 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.840
 they form the ball that original and here 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.120
 behind is the complete collection of 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.640
 end of the games there are several rackets 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.490
 different 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.490
 we would first ride the ball 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.819
 to see to see good because here would be 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.299
 our ball already mounted 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.610
 only the rackets would be left to assemble 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.690
 that go like this 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.720
 here we have the blue racket 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.450
 and the same with the orange and now only 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.690
 Snowshoes have to get the 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.690
 fingers 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.630
 and so we could play with the ball 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.870
 Let's see 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.770
 Well, what is missing, you can 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.770
