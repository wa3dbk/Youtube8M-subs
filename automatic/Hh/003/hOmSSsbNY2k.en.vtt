just give it a quick wipe with it and I
found<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.409> sign<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.930> sign<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.470> going

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
found a sign a one sign of it going

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.100 
found a sign a one sign of it going
earlier<00:01:35.369> are<00:01:35.520> having<00:01:35.820> problems<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.630> was

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
earlier are having problems with it was
