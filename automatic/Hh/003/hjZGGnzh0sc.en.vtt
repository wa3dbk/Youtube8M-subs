 at the end of the episode here we can see 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.570
 a repetition when simpson is swept and 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.780
 plays the ball very good swept but 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.210
 according to the referee it was criminal 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.610
 then here we see a change of wigan 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.190
 and william the base to pull hold 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.740
 will discuss with the former striker of 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.179
 norwich directive which is dealt with and the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.569
 fails wigan fails and with that penalties we go 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.239
 we finished the match 1-1 tied on 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.690
 kunstverein jr is saved to the last 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.510
 minutes 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.300
 then here well in the next file 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.800
 I was going to be Matthew Musacchio if I did not 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.530
 I mistake the Argentine who plays in the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.380
 villarreal will sign with us in 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.600
 consist rangers and the next game 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.300
 is against the debut against the queens 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.820
 park rangers is permanent visit adrián 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.520
 makes a magnificent break tears the 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.520
 defense is a great goal the young Brazilian 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.140
 and with his father aged just 18 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.030
 he makes magic in his first goal and so 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.090
 the match ends the match was very 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.690
 boring we occupy more magic in the queens 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.410
 park rangers because we only finished 1-0 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.330
 and there were not many opportunities was a 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.760
 game a lot that was played in the middle 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.770
 but in the second match Bayern 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.070
 at home against blackpool martinez 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.760
 It happens to the full but full not the strip 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.610
 and throw the goal to your goal that you saw the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.160
 English are doing what they are being 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.070
 the scorers of the rangers club 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.230
 we must buy more Latinos after 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.260
