land<00:01:52.689> you<00:01:52.899> take<00:01:53.079> off<00:01:53.229> now<00:01:53.380> what<00:01:53.530> that's<00:01:53.619> going

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
land you take off now what that's going

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.499 
land you take off now what that's going
to<00:01:53.860> do<00:01:54.039> is<00:01:54.489> it's<00:01:54.700> gonna<00:01:54.789> build<00:01:55.119> more<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.420> an

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
to do is it's gonna build more of an

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.139 
to do is it's gonna build more of an
elastic<00:01:55.780> muscle<00:01:56.349> and<00:01:57.159> it's<00:01:57.429> your<00:01:57.610> muscle

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
elastic muscle and it's your muscle

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.789 
elastic muscle and it's your muscle
fibers<00:01:58.179> or<00:01:58.509> your<00:01:58.630> legs<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.110> it's<00:01:59.619> going<00:01:59.739> to

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
fibers or your legs and it's going to

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.520 
fibers or your legs and it's going to
increase<00:02:00.610> your<00:02:01.030> elastic<00:02:01.780> ability<00:02:02.079> meaning

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
more prone to being more elastic meaning

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.640 
more prone to being more elastic meaning
having<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.390> better<00:02:10.539> rubberband<00:02:11.019> effect<00:02:11.319> so

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
having a better rubberband effect so

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.289 
having a better rubberband effect so
quicker<00:02:11.980> snap<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.489> get<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.730> top<00:02:12.910> speed<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.209> lot

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
quicker snap you get the top speed a lot

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.360 
quicker snap you get the top speed a lot
