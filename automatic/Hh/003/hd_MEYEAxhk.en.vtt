00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
the water to cut drag so this is an

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.570 
the water to cut drag so this is an
exaggeration<00:00:45.120> drill<00:00:45.950> it's<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.160> gonna<00:00:47.400> look

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
exaggeration drill it's not gonna look

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.250 
exaggeration drill it's not gonna look
right<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:48.210> not<00:00:48.360> supposed<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.870> look<00:00:48.930> right

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
right it's not supposed to look right

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
right it's not supposed to look right
the<00:00:49.890> goal<00:00:50.130> is<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.310> get<00:00:50.550> their<00:00:50.700> heads<00:00:50.940> too<00:00:51.300> far

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the goal is to get their heads too far

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.510 
the goal is to get their heads too far
down<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.260> lot<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.740> times<00:00:52.920> they'll<00:00:53.130> do<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.400> with

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
down a lot of times they'll do this with

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.980 
down a lot of times they'll do this with
a<00:00:53.550> snorkel<00:00:53.880> we<00:00:54.180> don't<00:00:54.330> have<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> snorkel<00:00:54.960> here

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
a snorkel we don't have a snorkel here

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.510 
a snorkel we don't have a snorkel here
so<00:00:55.320> we'll<00:00:55.440> breathe<00:00:55.680> every<00:00:55.950> fifth<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.310> every

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
so we'll breathe every fifth or every

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.840 
so we'll breathe every fifth or every
seventh<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.740> we<00:00:58.860> just<00:00:59.070> try<00:00:59.400> to<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.760> them

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
seventh and then we just try to get them

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060 
seventh and then we just try to get them
to<00:00:59.880> be<00:01:00.060> as<00:01:00.150> low<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.720> can<00:01:00.870> possibly<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.440> we

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
to be as low as we can possibly be we

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.950 
to be as low as we can possibly be we
know<00:01:02.340> they're<00:01:02.520> gonna<00:01:02.610> come<00:01:02.700> back<00:01:03.090> up<00:01:03.150> when<00:01:03.810> it

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
know they're gonna come back up when it

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.359

seventh go ahead so I'm just trying to
adjust<00:01:43.770> his<00:01:43.889> breathing<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.399> bit

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
adjust his breathing a little bit

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.669 
adjust his breathing a little bit
because<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.969> that<00:01:45.569> changes<00:01:46.079> everything<00:01:46.380> on

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
because that that changes everything on

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.739 
because that that changes everything on
freestyle<00:01:47.219> the<00:01:47.459> breathing<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.630> they

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749 
freestyle the breathing and if they

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:50.389 
freestyle the breathing and if they
breathe<00:01:49.020> too<00:01:49.289> high<00:01:49.499> no<00:01:49.560> matter<00:01:50.009> what<00:01:50.249> they're

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
breathe too high no matter what they're

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.830 
breathe too high no matter what they're
doing<00:01:50.639> between<00:01:50.789> their<00:01:51.240> breaths<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.689> was

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
doing between their breaths that was

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.870 
doing between their breaths that was
better<00:01:52.049> no<00:01:52.889> matter<00:01:53.130> no<00:01:53.310> matter<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:53.729> they're

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
better no matter no matter what they're

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.730 
better no matter no matter what they're
doing<00:01:54.119> between<00:01:54.479> their<00:01:54.689> breaths<00:01:54.959> their<00:01:55.560> breath

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
doing between their breaths their breath

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.109 
doing between their breaths their breath
is<00:01:55.859> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.069> bring<00:01:56.249> their<00:01:56.369> head<00:01:56.549> back<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.939> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
is going to bring their head back up and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.419 
is going to bring their head back up and
affect<00:01:57.630> their<00:01:57.779> whole<00:01:57.899> body<00:01:58.139> positions<00:01:58.679> a<00:01:58.859> lot

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
affect their whole body positions a lot

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.889 
affect their whole body positions a lot
of<00:01:59.609> it<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.789> number<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.240> getting<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.659> initial

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
of it is number one getting the initial

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.510 
of it is number one getting the initial
head<00:02:01.229> position<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.069> trying<00:02:02.399> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
head position and then trying to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.160 
head position and then trying to
maintain<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.999> position<00:02:03.689> when<00:02:03.840> they<00:02:03.959> breathe

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
maintain that position when they breathe

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.779 
maintain that position when they breathe
or<00:02:04.349> as<00:02:04.439> close<00:02:04.619> as<00:02:04.799> possible<00:02:04.859> because

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
or as close as possible because

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:06.769 
or as close as possible because
obviously<00:02:05.969> they're<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.359> going<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.599> be<00:02:06.659> able

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:06.779 
obviously they're not going to be able

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:11.530 
obviously they're not going to be able
to<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:06.990> their<00:02:07.109> head<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.439> low

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.060 

we're<00:02:12.540> looking<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:12.960> his<00:02:13.290> hips<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.710> come<00:02:13.740> up

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
we're looking for his hips to come up

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.400 
we're looking for his hips to come up
and<00:02:14.310> his<00:02:15.270> body<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.810> as<00:02:15.900> neutral<00:02:16.290> as

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
and his body to be as neutral as

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.300 
and his body to be as neutral as
possible<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.130> water<00:02:18.830> some<00:02:19.830> benefits<00:02:20.220> of

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
possible in the water some benefits of

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.830 
possible in the water some benefits of
the<00:02:20.430> journal<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.760> was<00:02:20.880> doing<00:02:21.120> was<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.480> helps<00:02:21.720> me

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
the journal I was doing was it helps me

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.350 
the journal I was doing was it helps me
to<00:02:21.870> keep<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.260> neutral<00:02:22.710> body<00:02:22.830> position<00:02:23.360> it

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
to keep a neutral body position it

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.610 
to keep a neutral body position it
allows<00:02:24.570> me<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.810> go<00:02:24.960> straight<00:02:25.260> through<00:02:25.380> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
allows me to go straight through the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.590 
allows me to go straight through the
water<00:02:25.800> rather<00:02:26.190> than<00:02:26.460> diverting<00:02:27.180> my<00:02:27.240> energy

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
water rather than diverting my energy

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.260 
water rather than diverting my energy
elsewhere<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:29.430> helps<00:02:29.670> me<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.820> keep<00:02:29.970> my<00:02:30.090> head

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
elsewhere it helps me to keep my head

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.610 
elsewhere it helps me to keep my head
down<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.780> allows<00:02:30.930> me<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.200> go<00:02:31.290> as<00:02:31.350> fast<00:02:31.470> as

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
down and allows me to go as fast as

down and allows me to go as fast as
possible
