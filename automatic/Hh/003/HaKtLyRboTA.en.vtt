00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.570 
well the acts obviously is obstructing
will<00:02:37.599> so<00:02:38.599> no<00:02:38.959> point<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.349> our<00:02:39.410> tornado<00:02:39.920> sleeping

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
will so no point to our tornado sleeping

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.820 
will so no point to our tornado sleeping
this<00:02:40.700> then<00:02:41.480> why<00:02:41.660> they<00:02:41.810> call<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:41.989> tornado<00:02:42.440> it

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
this then why they call that tornado it

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.680 
this then why they call that tornado it
tornado<00:02:42.860> is<00:02:43.459> be<00:02:43.610> not<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:44.920> rectangle<00:02:45.920> or<00:02:46.690> you're

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
tornado is be not a rectangle or you're

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.650 
tornado is be not a rectangle or you're
not<00:02:47.750> only<00:02:48.050> two<00:02:48.319> boys<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:48.739> mean<00:02:48.920> it

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
face anyway i'll start with the geometry

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.420 
face anyway i'll start with the geometry
and<00:03:01.540> other<00:03:01.900> time<00:03:02.530> push<00:03:02.800> this<00:03:02.950> robot<00:03:03.280> in<00:03:03.400> the

mean<00:05:06.100> is<00:05:06.280> hola<00:05:06.580> is<00:05:06.940> great<00:05:07.680> but<00:05:08.680> but<00:05:09.310> is<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.330> bit

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
mean is hola is great but but is a bit

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.889 
mean is hola is great but but is a bit
or<00:05:11.320> less<00:05:11.470> effective<00:05:12.130> in<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.400> game

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:13.899 
or less effective in the game

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:16.359 
or less effective in the game
this<00:05:14.899> doesn't<00:05:15.259> actually<00:05:15.439> do<00:05:15.770> much<00:05:15.919> damage<00:05:16.129> if

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:16.369 
this doesn't actually do much damage if

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:26.600 
this doesn't actually do much damage if
ago<00:05:16.610> so<00:05:16.789> judges<00:05:17.119> decision<00:05:19.569> so<00:05:21.519> anyway

someone suggests an idea for a robot

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.490 
someone suggests an idea for a robot
I'll<00:05:35.200> take<00:05:35.530> out<00:05:35.770> I'll<00:05:36.160> take<00:05:37.380> combination<00:05:38.380> of

moon walk I now obviously with the

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.840 
moon walk I now obviously with the
different<00:06:44.440> action<00:06:44.860> that<00:06:45.130> within<00:06:45.340> they<00:06:45.669> look

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:45.850 
different action that within they look

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.650 
different action that within they look
kind<00:06:46.390> of<00:06:46.630> similar<00:06:47.380> the<00:06:47.770> robots<00:06:48.390> they<00:06:49.390> have<00:06:49.510> the

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
kind of similar the robots they have the

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.390 
kind of similar the robots they have the
same<00:06:49.840> chassis<00:06:50.200> because<00:06:50.800> they<00:06:50.919> have<00:06:51.010> to<00:06:51.130> change

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
same chassis because they have to change

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.320 
same chassis because they have to change
it<00:06:51.580> or<00:06:51.669> what<00:06:51.790> interacts<00:06:52.419> I'm

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
it or what interacts I'm

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.100 
it or what interacts I'm
why<00:06:53.930> they're<00:06:54.470> mine<00:06:55.189> robot<00:06:55.909> oh<00:06:56.210> I<00:06:56.780> don't

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
why they're mine robot oh I don't

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.510 
why they're mine robot oh I don't
understand<00:06:57.470> is<00:06:57.620> why<00:06:57.650> do<00:06:57.830> they<00:06:58.009> change<00:06:58.250> the

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
understand is why do they change the

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.249 
understand is why do they change the
weapon<00:06:59.000> for<00:06:59.270> stronger<00:06:59.750> but<00:06:59.870> they<00:07:00.020> don't

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
weapon for stronger but they don't

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.610 
weapon for stronger but they don't
bother<00:07:00.500> don't<00:07:01.069> change<00:07:02.000> the<00:07:02.300> robots<00:07:02.990> when

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
bother don't change the robots when

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.879 
bother don't change the robots when
there<00:07:03.800> are<00:07:03.919> costs<00:07:04.430> especially<00:07:05.090> so<00:07:06.020> right

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:06.889 
there are costs especially so right

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:08.290 
there are costs especially so right
there's<00:07:07.129> another<00:07:07.340> cost<00:07:07.610> reception<00:07:08.060> in<00:07:08.180> this

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
there's another cost reception in this

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.369 
there's another cost reception in this
stage<00:07:08.629> than<00:07:09.379> 0<00:07:09.500> which<00:07:10.389> one<00:07:11.389> ends<00:07:11.750> but<00:07:12.020> i<00:07:12.169> think

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:12.379 
stage than 0 which one ends but i think

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:14.969 
stage than 0 which one ends but i think
it<00:07:12.469> might<00:07:12.620> be<00:07:12.650> of<00:07:12.919> these<00:07:13.069> my<00:07:13.400> favorite<00:07:14.300> arena

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:14.979 
it might be of these my favorite arena

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:17.409 
it might be of these my favorite arena
