00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
I did that it's pretty bad year for the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.529 
I did that it's pretty bad year for the
DPS<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.460> they<00:00:59.550> get<00:00:59.699> for<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.359> pretty

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
DPS so they get for it is it's pretty

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.979 
DPS so they get for it is it's pretty
decent<00:01:01.160> anyways<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.309> rotation<00:01:02.760> I'm<00:01:02.879> doing<00:01:03.239> it's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
decent anyways a rotation I'm doing it's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.950 
decent anyways a rotation I'm doing it's
extremely<00:01:04.619> simple<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.430> try<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.970> follow<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.510

was like going full speed that would be

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.090 
was like going full speed that would be
a<00:01:54.000> perfect<00:01:54.479> time<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.810> refresh<00:01:55.200> haunt<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.890> use

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
a perfect time to refresh haunt you use

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.130 
a perfect time to refresh haunt you use
haunt<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.700> soon<00:01:56.969> as<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.180> gets<00:01:57.270> off<00:01:57.479> CD<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:57.960> as

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
haunt as soon as it gets off CD not as
