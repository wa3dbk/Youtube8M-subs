00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
these transformations then we can as

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.369 
these transformations then we can as
well<00:04:11.519> they've<00:04:12.519> been<00:04:12.639> a<00:04:12.700> responsible<00:04:13.379> player

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
on the world scene and in multilateral

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.080 
on the world scene and in multilateral
fora<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:19.120> so<00:04:19.979> under<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.700> president's

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.430 
leadership I think that they've made
enormous<00:04:24.070> strides<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.789> we<00:04:25.780> will<00:04:25.900> continue<00:04:26.020> to

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
enormous strides and we will continue to

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.950 
enormous strides and we will continue to
look<00:04:27.280> for<00:04:27.760> what<00:04:28.120> opportunities<00:04:28.780> to
