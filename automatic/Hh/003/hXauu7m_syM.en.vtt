00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
things but if he doesn't take the

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.649 
things but if he doesn't take the
hormones<00:05:37.340> that<00:05:37.460> he<00:05:37.610> requires<00:05:38.000> he<00:05:38.479> ends<00:05:38.630> up

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
hormones that he requires he ends up

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.240

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
Frank Mir and Antonio Silva I think

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.209 
Frank Mir and Antonio Silva I think
until<00:06:20.599> we<00:06:20.659> see<00:06:20.930> Antonio<00:06:21.169> Silva<00:06:21.650> walk<00:06:21.830> into<00:06:22.129> the

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
until we see Antonio Silva walk into the

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.360 
until we see Antonio Silva walk into the
cage<00:06:22.430> and<00:06:22.729> if<00:06:23.479> I<00:06:24.169> see<00:06:24.379> the<00:06:24.500> Antonio<00:06:24.710> Silva<00:06:25.250> of<00:06:25.310> a

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
cage and if I see the Antonio Silva of a

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.640 
cage and if I see the Antonio Silva of a
few<00:06:25.550> months<00:06:25.669> ago<00:06:25.879> against<00:06:26.569> Andrei<00:06:26.900> Arlovski<00:06:27.020> I

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
few months ago against Andrei Arlovski I

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.839 
few months ago against Andrei Arlovski I
think<00:06:28.039> it's<00:06:28.159> a<00:06:28.219> very<00:06:28.340> tough<00:06:28.610> fight<00:06:28.819> for

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
think it's a very tough fight for

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.790 
think it's a very tough fight for
Antonio<00:06:29.330> Silver<00:06:29.629> to<00:06:29.690> win<00:06:29.900> that<00:06:30.080> all<00:06:30.289> things

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
Antonio Silver to win that all things

looking<00:06:34.729> at<00:06:34.969> a<00:06:35.029> fight<00:06:35.240> you're<00:06:35.389> hoping<00:06:35.870> that

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
looking at a fight you're hoping that

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.409 
looking at a fight you're hoping that
both<00:06:36.259> guys<00:06:36.529> are<00:06:36.889> going<00:06:37.310> to<00:06:37.370> be<00:06:37.460> as<00:06:37.639> close<00:06:38.060> to

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
both guys are going to be as close to

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:39.860 
both guys are going to be as close to
peak<00:06:38.810> physical<00:06:39.050> condition

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
peak physical condition

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.410 
peak physical condition
as<00:06:39.930> they<00:06:40.380> possibly<00:06:40.620> can<00:06:41.190> be<00:06:41.370> as<00:06:41.550> athletes<00:06:42.150> and

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
as they possibly can be as athletes and

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.960 
as they possibly can be as athletes and
with<00:06:42.780> that<00:06:42.930> said<00:06:43.290> it's<00:06:44.220> easy<00:06:44.550> to<00:06:44.760> see<00:06:44.940> how

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
with that said it's easy to see how

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.430 
with that said it's easy to see how
Bigfoot<00:06:45.450> Silva<00:06:45.720> could<00:06:45.870> win<00:06:46.020> this<00:06:46.170> fight

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
Bigfoot Silva could win this fight

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.380 
Bigfoot Silva could win this fight
because<00:06:46.590> he's<00:06:46.920> got<00:06:47.100> heavy<00:06:47.310> hands<00:06:47.670> in<00:06:47.790> the<00:06:48.180> past

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
because he's got heavy hands in the past

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.420 
because he's got heavy hands in the past
Frank<00:06:48.810> mirrors<00:06:49.080> but<00:06:49.290> more<00:06:49.890> than<00:06:50.010> happy<00:06:50.220> to
