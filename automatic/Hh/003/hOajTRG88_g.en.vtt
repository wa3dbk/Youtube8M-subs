when<00:00:02.320> we<00:00:02.440> were<00:00:02.560> preparing<00:00:02.800> to<00:00:03.190> move<00:00:03.429> up<00:00:03.550> from

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:03.580 
when we were preparing to move up from

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.999 
when we were preparing to move up from
your<00:00:03.909> 80<00:00:04.090> NAB<00:00:04.840> you<00:00:04.930> were<00:00:05.020> all<00:00:05.200> really<00:00:05.859> nervous

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:06.009 
your 80 NAB you were all really nervous

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:07.380 
your 80 NAB you were all really nervous
thinking<00:00:06.670> it<00:00:06.759> was<00:00:06.879> going<00:00:07.029> to<00:00:07.149> be<00:00:07.240> completely

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.390 
thinking it was going to be completely

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.090 
thinking it was going to be completely
different<00:00:07.690> because<00:00:08.020> we've<00:00:08.469> got<00:00:08.650> mud<00:00:08.860> and

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
different because we've got mud and

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.560 
different because we've got mud and
witches<00:00:09.459> the<00:00:09.639> little<00:00:09.880> house<00:00:10.059> where<00:00:10.450> we'll

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
witches the little house where we'll

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.570 
witches the little house where we'll
everyone's<00:00:10.929> together<00:00:11.889> it's<00:00:12.250> like<00:00:12.280> a<00:00:12.400> little

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
everyone's together it's like a little

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.579 
everyone's together it's like a little
community<00:00:12.940> and<00:00:13.360> then<00:00:13.780> we<00:00:13.870> move<00:00:14.049> up<00:00:14.139> to<00:00:14.200> the<00:00:14.349> big

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:14.589 
community and then we move up to the big

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.410 
community and then we move up to the big
building<00:00:14.830> and<00:00:15.280> we<00:00:15.580> think<00:00:15.849> it's<00:00:16.000> going<00:00:16.150> to<00:00:16.299> be<00:00:16.390> a

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
building and we think it's going to be a

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.030 
building and we think it's going to be a
huge<00:00:16.779> leap<00:00:16.990> but<00:00:17.230> when<00:00:17.349> you<00:00:17.439> get<00:00:17.619> there<00:00:17.860> it's

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
huge leap but when you get there it's

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.330 
huge leap but when you get there it's
just<00:00:18.369> natural<00:00:18.730> and<00:00:19.210> you<00:00:19.689> ready<00:00:20.200> to<00:00:20.470> be<00:00:20.590> there

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
just natural and you ready to be there

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.960 
just natural and you ready to be there
I<00:00:26.740> think<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.800> o.9<00:00:28.009> is<00:00:28.130> a<00:00:28.160> really<00:00:28.400> good<00:00:28.550> entry

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
I think the o.9 is a really good entry

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.640 
I think the o.9 is a really good entry
year<00:00:29.180> and<00:00:29.449> time<00:00:29.900> to<00:00:30.050> come<00:00:30.199> into<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:30.470> school

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
year and time to come into the school

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.080 
year and time to come into the school
because<00:00:30.919> obviously<00:00:31.669> you<00:00:31.759> aren't<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.059> only

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
because obviously you aren't the only

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.270 
because obviously you aren't the only
one<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:32.870> I<00:00:33.110> don't<00:00:33.470> think<00:00:33.559> you'll<00:00:33.739> come<00:00:33.829> on<00:00:34.129> your

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
one so I don't think you'll come on your

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.890 
one so I don't think you'll come on your
own<00:00:34.430> at<00:00:34.550> all<00:00:34.730> I<00:00:35.030> think<00:00:35.270> you've<00:00:35.420> got<00:00:35.540> many<00:00:35.750> other

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
own at all I think you've got many other

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.560 
own at all I think you've got many other
people<00:00:36.140> who<00:00:36.260> would<00:00:36.379> be<00:00:36.530> supportive<00:00:37.160> and

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
people who would be supportive and

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.930 
people who would be supportive and
they're<00:00:38.570> in<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.780> same<00:00:38.960> boat<00:00:39.230> so<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:39.949> can<00:00:40.309> all

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
they're in the same boat so you can all

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.670 
they're in the same boat so you can all
go<00:00:41.390> through<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:41.629> together<00:00:41.750> when<00:00:42.260> I<00:00:42.379> when<00:00:42.650> I

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680
