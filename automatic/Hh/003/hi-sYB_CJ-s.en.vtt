00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
that it's pretty solid once you get a PS

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
at it on there to pretty much make the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.740 
at it on there to pretty much make the
game<00:02:20.160> how<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.549> should<00:02:20.849> have<00:02:20.970> been<00:02:21.120> they've

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
game how it should have been they've

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.509 
game how it should have been they've
been<00:02:21.930> able<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.200> get<00:02:22.379> all<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.500> proper<00:02:22.920> licenses

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
been able to get all the proper licenses

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.740 
been able to get all the proper licenses
so<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:25.290> gameplay<00:02:25.769> is<00:02:25.830> pretty<00:02:26.180> pretty<00:02:27.180> solid

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
so the gameplay is pretty pretty solid

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.070 
so the gameplay is pretty pretty solid
it's<00:02:28.580> I'd<00:02:29.580> say<00:02:29.760> it's<00:02:29.879> more<00:02:30.030> realistic<00:02:30.480> from

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
it's I'd say it's more realistic from

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.650 
it's I'd say it's more realistic from
the<00:02:31.200> soccer<00:02:31.470> standpoint<00:02:32.720> than<00:02:33.720> FIFA<00:02:34.319> but<00:02:35.660> FIFA

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
the soccer standpoint than FIFA but FIFA

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.809 
the soccer standpoint than FIFA but FIFA

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
annoying and then a few games that

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.879 
annoying and then a few games that
aren't<00:03:41.499> optimized<00:03:42.099> for<00:03:42.249> controllers<00:03:43.060> at<00:03:43.269> all

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889

I'm<00:03:44.889> still<00:03:45.400> not<00:03:45.519> a<00:03:45.579> fan<00:03:45.669> of<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.629> keyboard<00:03:47.409> and

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
I'm still not a fan of the keyboard and

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.970 
I'm still not a fan of the keyboard and
mouse<00:03:47.709> for<00:03:48.129> movement<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.780> I'm<00:03:50.409> playing<00:03:50.799> with

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
mouse for movement so I'm playing with

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.830 
mouse for movement so I'm playing with
my<00:03:51.299> 360<00:03:52.299> controller<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.730> I'm<00:03:55.389> hoping<00:03:55.780> that

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
my 360 controller and I'm hoping that

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.159 
my 360 controller and I'm hoping that
more<00:03:56.799> games<00:03:57.219> are<00:03:57.639> optimized<00:03:58.120> for<00:03:58.150> controllers

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.539
