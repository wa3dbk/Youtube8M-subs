00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.920
 You know something happens to people and 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.130
 always make everyone happy 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.830
 The computer periphery is very happy. 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.240
 With what happened, I'm actually 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.410
 almost disconnected from planet earth 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.520
 because it is ultimately an obvious mobile computer 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.480
 but so what 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.220
 there who knows how to read more is not good or not 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.289
 I'm here today to show the latest 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.110
 books that entered the site called 14 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.059
 the first was a big surprise that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.620
 I was very happy to see why it is a 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.870
 Difficulty that I have very much 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.540
 big big not only do I think 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.270
 people also if you look for 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.030
 book of poetry of bukowski the bukowski 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.270
 Or both, I know, there it is for me. 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.760
 Bukowski with eddy hard to find 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.590
 they produced not that English getaway is 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.079
 easy but it is also difficult to find in 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.980
 English here in Brazil is a 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.469
 problem 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.199
 the ibm has several releases in the forest 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.729
 are those Portuguese but are the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:13.080
 hot mixed women novels is topical 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.080
 then began to find there but poetry of the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.290
 bukowski is difficult so that's what a 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.560
 day I get a little child with a 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.470
 book in hand resembles poetry and reads 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.240
 what is the safe 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.950
 The seven letters have released this book which is 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.060
 this stolen madness that I do not want to 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.369
 no one but myself to man is in 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.890
 truth is a collection and it is not a book 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.619
 of bukowski published a collection of 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.610
 several of his poems published in several 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.860
 books in here has the basic shopping list 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:56.040
 so it's a great hotel 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.290
 this is the books that have had the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.630
 fathers days extracted for this collection 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.869
 who made this selection was fernando 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.869
 koproski 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:12.790
 if neither his name was evil but Dom Fernando 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.740
 koproski after the man thinks the name 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.710
 so then what is the problem of wrong 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.100
 Everyone who is what I have to say 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.680
 It's just praise. 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.830
 is a very cool selection of poetry in the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.820
 cof chem has a very good production of 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.530
 Fernando made a massive introduction 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:37.000
 cool 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.050
 finally is beautiful or something bought there reading 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.920
 safe box 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:49.150
 that's it she's mine then only june 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:55.750
 I'm in the middle yet but I already loved too much 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:58.959
 so many years ago the type is us 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.270
 Lucio recalled more culture problems in 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:06.130
 culture and I bought some books one 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:09.250
 of them was the young suffering veta aa 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.190
 kind of book that everyone everybody 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.570
 it will read and I need measurement 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.459
 reasonable 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.940
 I have a certain difficulty 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.830
 find books a type of sebum to search 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.840
 today measuring the wretched I do not 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.050
 I found a book circle edition 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.260
 1955 it was a single volume that not 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.700
 So, if I find out, tell me. 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.120
 I accept if I have, I left the house 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.120
 in the market 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:47.320
 I'm one of those people so one day 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:51.180
 I will read freedom liberty 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.380
 a cool tip here in Sao Paulo is 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.920
 of course people will like it because the 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.360
 good white sheet o know white sheet 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.900
 really gets in the way of reading 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.610
 role is for software that the navy is 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.790
 much easier to read to us 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.160
 ana another achievement this month was a 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.560
 month of achievement was the hero of a thousand 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.620
 faces he spoke exhausted is from the culture and 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.230
 Thought is that book is more theoretical 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.290
 for those who do not know the hero of a thousand faces 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:25.490
 is a classic all -time use 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.490
 who lived and he talks about the moment of how 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.690
 there are some we show and these plots 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.070
 are always reused in the stories 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.560
 sought to ask her will clarify 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.410
 better than I am so both confused 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.990
 but it's worth it for people who like 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.360
 theory one likes crazy things that 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:49.430
 He does here and picks up a lot of texts. 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.620
 classic and not very well known and mills 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.790
 how they are reused the type to 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.790
 recycling literature 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.740
 and after reading the ocean on the way 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.880
 no game because so very thirsty 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.590
 from ubiratÃ£ 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.560
 So I started buying new books. 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:16.160

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:19.380

 laminated paper and also the children's 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.660
 Someone does not have several children's books. 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.660
 very cool 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:34.950
 cited the penalty 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.670

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.970
 it is more that they exhausted more crowded 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:40.320
