see here because very dark ah ok so go
ahead<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.869> try<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.080> start<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> car

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.550 

okay<00:00:47.220> so<00:00:47.280> as<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:48.260> doesn't<00:00:49.260> idol

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
okay so as you can see doesn't idol

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
okay so as you can see doesn't idol
right<00:00:49.880> if<00:00:50.880> I<00:00:51.090> give<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.390> enough<00:00:51.600> gas<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.200> the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
right if I give it enough gas that the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.700 
right if I give it enough gas that the
throttle<00:00:53.580> sensor<00:00:54.110> switches<00:00:55.110> out<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.350> idle

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
throttle sensor switches out of idle

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.270 
throttle sensor switches out of idle
mode<00:00:55.920> than<00:00:56.220> it<00:00:56.340> does<00:00:56.489> this

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.580 

you<00:01:03.789> can<00:01:03.910> hear<00:01:04.119> it<00:01:04.269> missing<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:04.989> sputtering

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
you can hear it missing and sputtering

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.859 
you can hear it missing and sputtering
and<00:01:05.860> being<00:01:06.240> overall<00:01:07.240> terrible<00:01:09.360> yeah<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.690> then

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
you know dying so let's get it started

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.010 
you know dying so let's get it started
again

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:36.600 

give<00:01:22.020> us<00:01:22.110> some<00:01:22.259> gas

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:47.370 

just<00:01:37.270> excuse<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.930> fan

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.469 

now<00:01:47.890> what<00:01:48.040> I'm<00:01:48.130> doing<00:01:48.399> now<00:01:48.430> where<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.119> engines

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
now what I'm doing now where the engines

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.480 
now what I'm doing now where the engines
noise<00:01:49.750> is<00:01:49.960> changing<00:01:50.409> as<00:01:50.560> I'm<00:01:50.979> touching<00:01:51.250> the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
noise is changing as I'm touching the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.680 
noise is changing as I'm touching the
harness<00:01:51.909> on<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.600> air<00:01:53.020> flow<00:01:53.229> sensor

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.730 

they're<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:00.890> sounds<00:02:01.220> pretty<00:02:01.370> good<00:02:05.650> now<00:02:06.650> i'm

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
they're that sounds pretty good now i'm

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.620 
they're that sounds pretty good now i'm
not<00:02:06.920> sure<00:02:07.100> why<00:02:07.280> it's<00:02:07.460> doing<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.850> but

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
not sure why it's doing that but

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.780 
not sure why it's doing that but
considering<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.350> just<00:02:09.560> fixed<00:02:09.950> itself<00:02:10.310> just<00:02:10.670> by

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
considering it just fixed itself just by

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.180 
considering it just fixed itself just by
touching<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.270> airflow<00:02:11.630> sensor<00:02:12.020> wire<00:02:12.230> i'm

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
touching the airflow sensor wire i'm

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.860 
touching the airflow sensor wire i'm
going<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:13.850> have<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.030> go<00:02:14.180> ahead<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.510> say<00:02:14.690> it's

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
going to have to go ahead and say it's

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.140 
going to have to go ahead and say it's
something<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.290> do<00:02:15.440> with<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:16.150> unfortunately

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
something to do with that unfortunately

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.670 
something to do with that unfortunately
i<00:02:17.210> don't<00:02:17.360> know<00:02:17.420> whether<00:02:17.570> it's<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.900> bad<00:02:18.230> air<00:02:18.440> flow

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
i don't know whether it's a bad air flow

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.940 
i don't know whether it's a bad air flow
sensor<00:02:18.710> or<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.520> bad<00:02:20.030> harness<00:02:20.600> or<00:02:21.020> what's<00:02:21.740> going

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
sensor or a bad harness or what's going

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.490 
sensor or a bad harness or what's going
on<00:02:22.190> but<00:02:22.510> seems<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.690> be<00:02:23.780> running<00:02:23.930> let's<00:02:24.260> give<00:02:24.410> us

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
on but seems to be running let's give us

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.380 
on but seems to be running let's give us
some<00:02:24.620> gas<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:24.800> see<00:02:25.130> what<00:02:25.250> happens

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.750 

yep<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:33.290> seems<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.860> be<00:02:33.950> running<00:02:34.160> right<00:02:36.760> still

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
yep that seems to be running right still

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.600 
yep that seems to be running right still
a<00:02:37.790> little<00:02:37.970> bit<00:02:38.209> funny<00:02:38.450> but<00:02:38.660> now<00:02:39.650> nearly<00:02:40.099> as<00:02:40.340> bad

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
a little bit funny but now nearly as bad

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.460 
a little bit funny but now nearly as bad
as<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.030> was<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:43.670> not<00:02:44.599> entirely<00:02:44.989> sure<00:02:45.200> what's

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
as it was so not entirely sure what's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.960 
as it was so not entirely sure what's
going<00:02:45.620> on<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:47.630> as<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.840> can<00:02:47.959> see<00:02:48.819> Idol<00:02:49.819> is

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
going on and as you can see Idol is

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.410 
going on and as you can see Idol is
stable<00:02:51.550> which<00:02:52.550> is<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.730> big<00:02:53.000> difference<00:02:53.209> from

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
stable which is a big difference from

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
stable which is a big difference from
what<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.690> was<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.910> maybe<00:02:56.660> one<00:02:56.959> more<00:02:57.110> clue

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
what it was so maybe one more clue

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.770 
what it was so maybe one more clue
towards<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:58.130> finally<00:02:58.760> getting<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.090> stupid

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
towards a finally getting this stupid

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.180 
towards a finally getting this stupid
car<00:02:59.959> running<00:03:00.290> right<00:03:00.470> we'll<00:03:01.220> find<00:03:01.430> out<00:03:03.190> thanks

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
car running right we'll find out thanks

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.670 
car running right we'll find out thanks
for<00:03:04.310> watching<00:03:04.340> I<00:03:04.640> guess<00:03:04.850> I<00:03:05.090> guess<00:03:05.569> I'll<00:03:05.780> go

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
for watching I guess I guess I'll go

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.800 
for watching I guess I guess I'll go
back<00:03:06.800> in<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.220> hope<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.269> stays<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.480> way<00:03:08.720> in

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
back in and hope it stays this way in

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.010 
back in and hope it stays this way in
the<00:03:08.900> morning<00:03:09.140> later
