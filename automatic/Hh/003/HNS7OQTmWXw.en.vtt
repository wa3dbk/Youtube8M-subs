00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.410
 new concept 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:32.360

 want if you do not you want me 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.959
 if you do not want to have cops b 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.459
 you buy the hangar with a 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.040
 character and to get into 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.299
 the airport without seeing the cops you 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.760
 take this character and you come back 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.560
 like that like you and here they are 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.880
 gone the right way so as I you 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:04.599
 I said it's either be here there they 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:10.280
 have come either the base ie here 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:11.220
 be here as we see there down I 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.220
 take 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.600
 because to take off his best it's 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:22.200
 changed but here you are then so you 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.080

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.670
 super jump code be you take a shot 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.050
 I know by heart 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:35.280
 except that there are cars so that 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:42.690
 not walk so like cbbl bbbb lvlt rb 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:49.410

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.760
 the White 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.920
 because she is pretty blue and red 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:05.430
 I like so you ask yourself a 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.780
 any place are here if we can 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.210
 to call it was not necessary that I 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.790
 I eat the pages because otherwise it 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.770
 will hurt 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:21.390
