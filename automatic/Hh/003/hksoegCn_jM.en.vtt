which transfer each one of these is

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:04.280 
which transfer each one of these is
pronounced<00:03:55.040> we<00:03:55.280> clear

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.030 

when<00:04:05.290> we're<00:04:05.440> ready<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.709> serve<00:04:07.830> we<00:04:08.830> take<00:04:09.010> the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
when we're ready to serve we take the

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.650 
when we're ready to serve we take the
sandwich<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.730> like<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:09.970> said<00:04:10.030> I'm<00:04:10.390> going<00:04:10.569> to

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
sandwich and like I said I'm going to

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:20.460 
sandwich and like I said I'm going to
trim<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.160> crust<00:04:12.240> the<00:04:13.240> edges

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.350 

and<00:04:21.470> then<00:04:21.680> we<00:04:21.769> prep<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.250> but<00:04:22.580> this<00:04:22.730> is<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.120> very

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
and then we prep this but this is a very

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.710 
and then we prep this but this is a very
large<00:04:24.580> raising<00:04:25.580> rent<00:04:25.760> on<00:04:25.910> our<00:04:26.030> music<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.540> the

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
large raising rent on our music and the

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.260 
large raising rent on our music and the
reason<00:04:27.020> why<00:04:27.200> is<00:04:27.530> because<00:04:27.950> we<00:04:28.520> actually<00:04:29.030> cut

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
reason why is because we actually cut

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.570 
reason why is because we actually cut
these<00:04:29.480> not<00:04:30.320> new<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:30.530> force<00:04:30.889> but<00:04:31.160> we<00:04:31.250> cutting

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
these not new to force but we cutting

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:49.659 
these not new to force but we cutting
into<00:04:31.910> things<00:04:46.840> also<00:04:47.840> another<00:04:48.200> trick<00:04:48.800> of

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
into things also another trick of

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.320 
into things also another trick of
serving<00:04:51.370> people<00:04:52.370> don't<00:04:52.550> think<00:04:52.669> about<00:04:52.790> this<00:04:53.120> is

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
serving people don't think about this is

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.930 
serving people don't think about this is
you<00:04:53.750> always<00:04:53.960> do<00:04:54.260> odd<00:04:54.470> numbers<00:04:54.919> odd<00:04:55.669> numbers

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
you always do odd numbers odd numbers

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.520 
you always do odd numbers odd numbers
look<00:04:56.270> better<00:04:56.450> on<00:04:56.540> a<00:04:56.660> trade<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.140> even<00:04:57.440> numbers
