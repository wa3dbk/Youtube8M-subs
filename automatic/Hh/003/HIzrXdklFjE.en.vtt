00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.550
 the radio medicine the uicc develops 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.290
 within the framework of Bologna is a degree 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.150
 designed and designed oriented to 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.930
 learning through very methodologies 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.390
 active for the student is designed 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.220
 in six courses the first two courses 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.099
 They are very pre-clinical courses in 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.449
 which the student becomes familiar with and knows 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.579
 the structure and function of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.099
 different organs and systems for 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.690
 they would spend a third course to deepen 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.370
 in the more clinical aspects of 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.280
 disease according to the different 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.140
 specialties and already in sixth course is 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.000
 very oriented to clinical practice and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.399
 also to demonstrate the ability of the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.649
 competence in skills 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.840
 research I think the points 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.210
 strong or differentials of medicine the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 web come on the one hand by the team 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.359
 teacher that we have is a team 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.370
 of course highly 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.440
 qualified but very involved and 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.050
 motivated but the teaching project with 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.110
 a great vocation of service we have 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.880
 with technical and personal means to 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.439
 disposition of our students we are 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.729
 inside a hospital environment as it is 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.720
 the General Hospital of Catalonia what 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.330
 facilitates that our students 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.730
 enter very early in contact with 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.760
 the hospital environment as well 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.530
 we have aesthetic dissection rooms 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.030
 simulation labs that allow 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.080
 that our students before we 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.990
 start doing your practices 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.150
 Clinics with patients do so in 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.740
 a simulated environment but very close to 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.700
 the reality allowing the trial error 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.130
 before they really commit chances 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.230
 a detriment for the patients we have 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.120
 a very personalized training that 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.330
 try to train the student 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.680
 in all areas spheres from the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.680
 knowledge point of view 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.950
 scientists the human cultural aspect 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.680
 allowing to draw from each of the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.180
 students a better potential in their 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.160
 better qualities since we have a 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.720
 very personalized training for groups 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.090
 reduced that the teacher allows 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.100
 know the student and know what their 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.020
 needs and help you and offer you 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.060
 resources you need at any time 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.960
 what are my professional opportunities to 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.760
 finish the race 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.440
 when studying when a student 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.630
 begins a career as medicine what 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.460
 he wants is to be a doctor and develop his 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.800
 profession is of good assistance 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.960
 either in any of specialties or 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.420
 in primary care but also 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.430
 from the degree we try to give them 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.960
 other outputs and also train them in 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.000
 areas such as the 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.800
 investigation for that throughout the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.870
 career and different subjects and 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.370
 subjects in which this area is touched 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.620
 arriving at the sixth course where they have to 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.390
 develop a work EOG 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.520
 master in which they have to prove their 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.390
 research capacity also we 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.060
 we train in communication skills 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.800
 Judgment reasoning skills 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.510
 way they can also exercise their 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.150
 activity as teachers or as 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.260
 professionals in the field of 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.080
 university for example and also 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.210
 we make an important and we develop 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.700
 matters considered in the field of 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.530
 management management so much of what is the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.570
 resources as already to be able to develop 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.520
 your activity in a medical direction or 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.380
 in any other field 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.790
 what I would say to a student that 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.530
 wants to decide by which faculty of 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.030
 study medicine that takes into account 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.980
 those differential aspects that you 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.300
 can offer in particular for example 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.250
 in our medical degree in the 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.100
 web would tell you that differential aspects 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.810
 would be the personalized training a 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.100
 training in small groups that we 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.170
 let us know what the 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.760
 needs and qualities of the student to 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.800
 be able to offer in the resources that 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.960
 need to be trained 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.570
 with scientific quality but also 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.420
 personal or human would tell you that it is very 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.370
 important to keep in mind that 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.990
 example our degree we encourage the 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.420
 contact with the healthcare world 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.260
 hospitable from the first day it is 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.090
 an integral formation and above all 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.740
 maybe the best thing I could advise him 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.390
 to say is that you can contact 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.250
 some wake medicine student 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.970
 that can tell you what the value is 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.970
 added that we have
