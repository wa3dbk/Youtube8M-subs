00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.230 
us a little bit about your experience
working<00:01:04.649> in<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.949> veterinarian<00:01:05.460> clinic<00:01:05.759> yeah

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
working in a veterinarian clinic yeah

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.730 
working in a veterinarian clinic yeah
well<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.509> think<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> most<00:01:07.259> important

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
well I think one of the most important

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.460 
well I think one of the most important
things<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.220> people<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.690> to<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.899> educated

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
things for people is just to be educated

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.650 
things for people is just to be educated
about<00:01:10.679> animals<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.399> think<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.240> much<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
about animals and I think so much of the

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.120 
about animals and I think so much of the
neglect<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.110> world<00:01:13.289> is<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.649> people<00:01:13.890> just

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
neglect in the world is from people just

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.830 
neglect in the world is from people just
not<00:01:14.250> knowing<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.119> understanding

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
not knowing or just not understanding

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.620 
not knowing or just not understanding
what<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.080> needs<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.940> from<00:01:17.940> working<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
what the needs are and from working in a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.540 
what the needs are and from working in a
vet<00:01:18.899> clinic<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.320> found<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.039> it's<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.340> new

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
vet clinic I found you know it's the new

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.790 
vet clinic I found you know it's the new
pet<00:01:20.789> owners<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.420> don't<00:01:21.660> necessarily<00:01:22.560> care

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
pet owners that don't necessarily care

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.650 
pet owners that don't necessarily care
to<00:01:22.979> learn<00:01:23.160> about<00:01:23.369> their<00:01:23.670> new<00:01:23.819> dog<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.420> cat<00:01:24.630> or

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
to learn about their new dog or cat or

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.809 
to learn about their new dog or cat or
whatever<00:01:25.080> species<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.770> animal<00:01:26.069> they<00:01:26.190> have<00:01:26.399> and

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
whatever species of animal they have and

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.100 
whatever species of animal they have and
then<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> animal<00:01:27.569> doesn't<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.899> what<00:01:28.020> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
then the animal doesn't get what it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.630 
then the animal doesn't get what it
needs<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:29.039> that's<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.459> biggest

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
needs so I think that's the biggest

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.100 
needs so I think that's the biggest
thing<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.970> saw<00:01:30.179> is<00:01:30.330> if<00:01:30.450> you're<00:01:30.599> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.989> bring
