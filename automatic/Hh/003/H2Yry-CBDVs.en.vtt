00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.280
 hello how are we going to make a recipe 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.990
 simple is sorry in syrup but 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.260
 special pears are going to take the form of 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.730
 hedgehog but called but did the right and 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.730
 the ingredients are these are going to go 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.310
 i 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.880
 ace 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.060
 let's start preparing the syrup 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.480
 For this we heat a liter of water to 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.340
 medium-high fire we add the sugar and 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.770
 we let the syrup go cooking 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.960
 little by little while we are going to go peeling 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.400
 the pears as you see are peeled I 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.990
 I recommend leaving the surface a lot 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.450
 better x and we use a lace 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.860
 rather in our case we need 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.860
 a lodging we are very nice 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.890
 It seems 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.829
 now artistic that we're going to have with 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.530
 the hedgehogs 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.230
 we need a little bit to dissolve 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.310
 the sugar while we split the pears in 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.900
 two equal parts very well we introduce 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.510
 already in the syrup 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.600
 and make it be 30 minutes 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.460
 approximately until it is 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.680
 the time will logically depend on the 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.810
 Size of the fabrics a little bit more 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.200
 big ones a little bit smaller and 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.090
 you know how to reduce very well we take it out and 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.860
 let's leave the syrup to reduce a 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.230
 little bit more and we want it thicker 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.600
 to later accompany our pears 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.790
 it is now the turn of the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.470
 pine nuts let's toast them a little bit 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.540
 so as to give that impression 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.060
 of the slipped hairs that are no more 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.530
 darker clearings than others besides 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.540
 we are a little bit more richer 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.440
 and let's start making the hedgehogs 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.950
 come on let's simulate the curl tines 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.969
 because with the pinions effectively 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.590
 you see this is very easy that happens good 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.860
 that the hedgehogs know that the barbs 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.079
 they are good when they are a little like that 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.969
 angry they put them on edge in whom 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.410
 approach them and when they are more 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.180
 they have them so a little bit more 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.910
 planets and you can even them up 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.560
 until you caress them 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.640
 injured as you want to me are they 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.940
 coming out as you see 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.470
 angry they are coming out tense already 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.200
 several then to see if we the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.459
 you reassured me you'll say good 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.110
 is that the hedgehogs have many more 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.480
 leaks and you have to put a lot to that 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.069
 come clear we can put 34 thousand 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.590
 million but that this is about that 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.360
 look like a hedgehog to the eye that then in the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.870
 mouth get into that amount of pinions 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.269
 it is not necessary especially since 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.910
 consider the price that the damned go 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.370
 good pine nuts we go now with the nose and 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.230
 since it is a covered cookie ball 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.170
 of chocolate and now we go with the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.670
 eyes and take two eyes of equal size 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.569
 animal 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.560
 that does not look like it's against the fact and 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.110
 there is no problem sticking 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.610
 perfectly when it gets drier 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.650
 that acts as if it were true 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.510
 glue is not having any problem in 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.209
 make it good because there you have it to 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.209
 animals how curious very low 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.560
 let's see if we fix it 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.430
 let's put him company if he changes 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.690
 face 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.220
 Balder did and is already 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.160
 perfect to do it with care that 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.350
 publish that everything is ready and 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.260
 look let's put them to drink let's go 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.530
 talk about seeing a little bit of syrup and 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.550
 has reduced very well that six do not pass 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.050
 of the bugs good that did not happen and I 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.330
 I would say that no name goes by and that's why 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.060
 we are going to put him also to eat 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.730
 these balls of three vanish chocolates 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.440
 a few very well I would say good you 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.890
 we see and eat that after a 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:00.200
 time neither drink nor eat good to do 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:02.720
 and something that feeds us 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.060
 good friends that are very simple the 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.730
 perfect but what do you do with the 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.960
 Spend a fun time 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.650
 Y 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.650
 it's okay
