burn off your hair a comb and
straightener<00:00:47.360> this<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:49.140> Revlon

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.229 
straightener this is just my Revlon
strand<00:00:49.920> or<00:00:50.039> any<00:00:50.160> straighter<00:00:50.489> will<00:00:50.789> do<00:00:50.969> well

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
strand or any straighter will do well

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.840 
strand or any straighter will do well
first<00:00:51.449> I'm<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.809> going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.530> lightly<00:00:52.829> spray<00:00:53.430> my

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
first I'm just going to lightly spray my

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
first I'm just going to lightly spray my
things<00:00:54.410> with<00:00:55.410> each<00:00:55.739> paper<00:00:56.280> spray<00:01:01.129> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
things with each paper spray this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.609 
things with each paper spray this
actually<00:01:02.699> works<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.239> long<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.870> short<00:01:04.350> bangs

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
actually works with long or short bangs

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.969 
actually works with long or short bangs
so<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.090> depends<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.350> what

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
so it just depends on what you like what

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.750 
so it just depends on what you like what
I<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.450> want<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> start<00:01:09.930> off<00:01:10.380> with

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
I want to do is I want to start off with

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.940 
I want to do is I want to start off with
sections<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.479> actually<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.619> top

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
sections so I actually like to do top

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.550 
sections so I actually like to do top
sections<00:01:14.520> first<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.049> two<00:01:16.170> bottom

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
sections first and then do two bottom

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.920 
sections first and then do two bottom
sections<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.850> clips<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.360> clip<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.750> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
sections so I have clips to clip out of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.539 
sections so I have clips to clip out of
the<00:01:19.020> way<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.650> sometimes<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.310> don't<00:01:20.400> need

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the way but sometimes you don't need

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.940 
the way but sometimes you don't need
clips<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.390> don't<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.080> sections<00:01:22.650> it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
clips you don't have to do sections it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.980 
clips you don't have to do sections it
depends<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.030> choice<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.689> looks

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
depends on your choice it looks

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.590 
depends on your choice it looks
different<00:01:25.259> when<00:01:26.390> separating<00:01:27.390> them<00:01:27.570> into

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
different when separating them into

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660 
different when separating them into
sections<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.619> separating<00:01:29.220> them<00:01:29.490> in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
sections and not separating them in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.999 
sections and not separating them in
sections<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:30.990> I'm<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.829> I'm

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
sections so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.100 
sections so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.400> separate<00:01:32.790> my<00:01:32.850> top<00:01:33.210> section<00:01:34.130> like<00:01:35.130> so

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
going to separate my top section like so

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.030 
going to separate my top section like so
and<00:01:37.640> all<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:40.350> curl<00:01:40.680> my<00:01:40.710> bangs<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.600> fold<00:01:42.600> my

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
and all I do to curl my bangs is fold my

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.069 
and all I do to curl my bangs is fold my
hold<00:01:44.040> my<00:01:44.280> straightener<00:01:44.670> upside<00:01:45.540> down<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
hold my straightener upside down so the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.120 
hold my straightener upside down so the
other<00:01:46.560> way<00:01:47.240> flip<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.420> down<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:49.680> then<00:01:49.920> when<00:01:50.100> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
other way flip it down and then when I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.310 
other way flip it down and then when I
slide<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.759> through<00:01:50.790> I'm<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.840> twist<00:01:52.110> it

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
slide it through I'm going to twist it

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.490 
slide it through I'm going to twist it
upward<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.530> gets

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.590 

so<00:01:59.500> then<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.979> kind<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.460> just<00:02:00.700> clip<00:02:01.119> that<00:02:01.299> out<00:02:01.330> of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
so then I kind of just clip that out of

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.830 
so then I kind of just clip that out of
the<00:02:01.720> way<00:02:01.900> I<00:02:02.729> will<00:02:03.729> go<00:02:03.880> back<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.420> fix<00:02:04.690> it

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
the way I will go back to and fix it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.910 
the way I will go back to and fix it
later<00:02:04.990> if<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.320> need<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.010> then<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:07.090> start<00:02:07.920> from

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
later if I need to and then I start from

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.420 
later if I need to and then I start from
this<00:02:09.250> side<00:02:12.270> section<00:02:13.270> my<00:02:13.450> section<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:15.040> then<00:02:15.250> do

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
this side section my section and then do

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.290 
this side section my section and then do
the<00:02:15.610> same<00:02:16.709> clamp<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.890> down<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.730> slide<00:02:18.940> it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
the same clamp it down and slide it

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:29.150 
the same clamp it down and slide it
through<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.380> tip<00:02:20.770> just<00:02:21.010> curl<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.489> upwards

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.340 

to<00:02:30.160> have<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.519> less<00:02:30.790> curl<00:02:31.239> just<00:02:31.600> slide<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.170> all

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
to have it less curl just slide it all

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.810 
to have it less curl just slide it all
the<00:02:32.380> way<00:02:32.530> through<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:33.040> then<00:02:33.130> make<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.550> bigger

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
the way through and then make a bigger

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.960 
the way through and then make a bigger
loop<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.690> if<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.680> want<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.950> more<00:02:36.250> curl<00:02:36.640> than

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
loop and if you want it more curl than

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.460 
loop and if you want it more curl than
when<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.510> hit<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.959> end<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:39.040> curl<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.700> like

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
when you hit the end just curl it like

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.910 
when you hit the end just curl it like
like<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.580> can<00:02:42.760> curl<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.150> more<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.709> that

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
like that you can curl it more so that

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.509 
like that you can curl it more so that
it's<00:02:45.070> more<00:02:45.310> curl<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:46.959> just<00:02:47.470> play<00:02:48.100> around

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
it's more curl so I just play around

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.780 
it's more curl so I just play around
with<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.769> fix<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:51.010> if<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.519> need<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:54.550> then

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
with it and fix it if I need to and then

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.259 
with it and fix it if I need to and then
they<00:02:55.060> get<00:02:55.480> curl<00:02:55.810> things<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:57.730> turns<00:02:58.090> out

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
they get curl things it turns out

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.300 
they get curl things it turns out
differently<00:02:58.870> depending<00:02:59.080> on<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.769> length<00:03:00.010> of

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
differently depending on the length of

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.460 
differently depending on the length of
your<00:03:00.700> hair<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.330> length<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.720> your<00:03:01.840> bangs<00:03:02.140> and

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
your hair the length of your bangs and

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.039 
your hair the length of your bangs and
also<00:03:03.310> turns<00:03:03.579> out<00:03:03.730> differently<00:03:04.239> depending<00:03:04.510> on

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
also turns out differently depending on

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.990 
also turns out differently depending on
how<00:03:06.570> extreme<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.840> curl<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.260> if<00:03:08.739> you<00:03:09.340> curl<00:03:09.790> it

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
how extreme you curl it if you curl it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.199 
how extreme you curl it if you curl it
right<00:03:10.269> at<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.510> end<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:11.440> would<00:03:11.739> be<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.310> more

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
right at the end it would be a more

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.990 
right at the end it would be a more
dramatic<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.870> curl<00:03:14.170> if<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.709> curl<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.100> from

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
dramatic of a curl if you curl it from

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.660 
dramatic of a curl if you curl it from
from<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.170> root<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.680> end<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.940> this<00:03:20.670> it

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
from the root to the end like this it

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.580 
from the root to the end like this it
would<00:03:21.850> just<00:03:21.880> be<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.299> bigger<00:03:22.630> hole<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.440> can

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
would just be a bigger hole and you can

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.370 
would just be a bigger hole and you can
see<00:03:23.799> here<00:03:24.510> instead<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.570> just<00:03:25.720> having<00:03:26.170> it

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
see here instead of just having it

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.830 
see here instead of just having it
curled<00:03:26.650> at<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.010> end<00:03:27.190> then<00:03:27.970> I'm<00:03:28.120> going<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.540> call

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
curled at the end then I'm going to call

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.229 
curled at the end then I'm going to call
it<00:03:28.989> from<00:03:29.290> this<00:03:30.070> end<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:33.459> then<00:03:33.820> it<00:03:33.970> would<00:03:34.060> be

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
it from this end so and then it would be

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.360 
it from this end so and then it would be
a<00:03:34.269> bigger<00:03:34.660> pearl<00:03:37.530> see

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
a bigger pearl see

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.850 
a bigger pearl see
so<00:03:39.940> depends<00:03:40.360> on<00:03:40.540> what<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.930> like<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:41.500> depends

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
so depends on what you like it depends

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.490 
so depends on what you like it depends
on<00:03:41.950> your<00:03:42.069> preference<00:03:42.580> of<00:03:42.700> your<00:03:42.849> curl<00:03:43.170> also<00:03:44.170> I

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
on your preference of your curl also I

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.140 
on your preference of your curl also I
think<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.980> really<00:03:45.220> cute<00:03:45.459> way<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:45.640> wear<00:03:46.120> your

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
think a really cute way to wear your

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.030 
think a really cute way to wear your
bangs<00:03:46.540> when<00:03:46.750> you're<00:03:46.900> when<00:03:47.260> it's<00:03:47.410> curled<00:03:47.860> like

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
bangs when you're when it's curled like

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.270 
bangs when you're when it's curled like
so<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:49.150> can<00:03:49.420> grab<00:03:49.690> sections<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:50.709> actually

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
so you can grab sections and actually

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.750 
so you can grab sections and actually
