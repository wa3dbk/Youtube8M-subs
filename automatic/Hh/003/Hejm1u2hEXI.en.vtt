00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.309
 Hi, girls, I 'm here again 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.710
 and today I bring you a comparison between 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.300
 the lip paintings that I have the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.490
 paints lips have become very 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.410
 fashion and how are we in this fever of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.270
 the super intense colors I think that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 there is nothing that I deum a color more 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.080
 intense that a lipstick paint them 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.420
 I'm going to show three different brands that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.980
 I have different price ranges and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.689
 I will tell you what I like about a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.099
 more than the other 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.230
 I'm going to start with the last ones that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.309
 I showed me I bought these are these 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.239
 nights in liquid liquid file long werner 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.030
 surface lipsticks these cost 21 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.770
 dollars and they are the most expensive of those 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.250
 I have in the congresses super intense I 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.770
 I have this that is mercal nor extend them 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.350
 candy and this that is more of the baby and the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.020
 The baby's email is darker and the color 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.420
 it's more even, it looks a lot more 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.550
 intense with a single pass while 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.050
 this one has to apply I have a little left 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.000
 That 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.590
 and maybe sometimes you have to pass it again 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.290
 a little to fill in that you see the color 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.020
 more uniform but the colors can not 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.080
 be more intense I assure you that they are 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.210
 infarct colors I love both 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.830
 colors the truth that I like a lot and 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.080
 What I like most about these is the 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.060
 applicator because the applicator is very 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.220
 easy to use and fail-safe 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.210
 because with these beauties the problem 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.280
 that has 17 salts from the edge or you make a 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.710
 disaster to clean it you will pay 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.610
 because they really are so intense and so 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.890
 durable you're going to pay any 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.679
 mistake that you make with them these are from 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.780
 long lasting and the finish is not enameled 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.340
 It is a finish like a satin but 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.229
 many times I'm using it mate 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.020
 taking off the shine layer a bit 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.030
 before they are fixed and without being 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.710
 it took off the gloss layer a bit with a 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.780
 napkin and with that already 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.360
 totally Maltese and they also look very 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.710
 nice these the price seems like a 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.979
 little expensive 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.990
 they seem to me they really seem expensive and 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.810
 There are other products on the market 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.330
 similar that do not reach this price and 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.630
 I think that you face a little with 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.930
 this price but really when he grew up 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.239
 It is a project that is good and the quality 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.800
 fascinates you then then the price does not 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.200
 today it's a little bit but really for 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.300
 me is a little bit almost the next thing that I 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.190
 I'm going to show you are the listings 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.690
 obsessed make seconds 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.640
 mex these lists are from the old package 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.800
 now they have changed packaging but it is 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.840
 that these products really 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.700
 shopping once in your life unless you 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.340
 be a professional make-up artist and use them 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.440
 to death you will not have to buy another 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.900
 in your life and luck is that although it 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.630
 they separate a little you can mix them turn 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.280
 the and they become to unify the color and 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.930
 you re-use and kids 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.810
 true that they have like three or four 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.750
 years and they are intact as they apply 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.459
 with a brush you do not have to put the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.050
 hand or you have to apply it 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.400
 directly to the lip as the product 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.890
 it lasts longer because it does not come into contact 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.280
 with many bacteria 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.540
 what you are dirty or whatever but 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.720
 these as I say, it's worth 18 dollars and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.430
 you are going to use one more buy one and you 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.920
 will last the rest of your life these 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.260
 they have an incredible range of colors 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.990
 I told them but of your face they have 10 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.830
 the different ones and these I stopped telling 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:36.100
 when I went like 30 because they are so 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.350
 Many colors because they use them 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.670
 as paintings also to mix you 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.550
 Well, while own lipstick 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.860
 mixing with one another and so on then 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.550
 These come in finished matt finish 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.590
 metallic or finished the gloss and running 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.709
 What you do has a lot of ink 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.239
 finished own thousand colors and are one 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.130
 very good option for which we are 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.620
 addicted to lipstick and we like it 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.989
 mix our own colors and the 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.630
 more intense colors can not be 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.700
 then these would be the seconds by 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.060
 below those of your face that are 18 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.130
 dollars in intensity and between my 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.270
 favorites and finally I'm going to teach you 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.120
 the version 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.730
 cheapest of these that I have that is 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.070
 the teachers of Milan and that are the 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.070
 interests liquid colors 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.500
 these are very intense it is true what puts 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.800
 very intense but they will never be so 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.940
 intense I think like the insane ones of your 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.790
 face formulas start if the color 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.980
 sees very well and perhaps of the three are the 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.290
 less durable but they are also the most 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.420
 cheap I tell them the price are 6 with 49 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.270
 dollars in usa 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.490
 and these also come in a very wide range 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.500
 small that are the ones that I have seen are 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.090
 four colors only at least the 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.410
 page of milan and with which not only 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.480
 so 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.660
 these I would recommend because really 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.700
 they are very good products and the only thing 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.860
 yes let's compare it with this I think 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.720
 that will be a bit unfair because this is 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.480
 of the resumption this puts it that is of 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.550
 long duration but it is true that they are 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.650
 very similar products the consistency 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.660
 it is similar the smell also that they were 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.260
 like a little to paint not so much to 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.540
 lipstick and the applicator of these is 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.830
 very good it is also an applicator 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.810
 these as if it were a gloss and are a 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.540
 Failsafe also to apply 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.790
 these are easy to touch up when 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.410
 you're on your way out there on the street 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.570
 consejitos playing positions 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.490
 easily and you can also put 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.140
 mate are like satins but they also 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.940
 they can put mattes by passing a 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.820
 napkin with over before it 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.710
 totally caught but as I told you 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.750
 they will remove when you eat when you drink or what 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.060
 that will be removed and you will not have left 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.430
 a lot of color but you can apply 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.410
 many times if the color is always going to 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.130
 see very beautiful and very intense every time 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.310
 apply it and then there are other brands 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.410
 also how I have seen them 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.540
 I can put a link here below 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.070
 each of them but I do not have them 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.900
 and they can not comment because they still 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.360
 I do not have any but I'm going to see if the 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.340
 I get to complete the one of these 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.050
 products and I am absolutely a fan of 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.990
 the plane beltrán as I said no 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.180
 there is nothing that looks more intense than a 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.380
 lipstick and I'm a fan of 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.050
 the lipstick that looks like a 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.720
 kilometer away I love I am and 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.490
 they fascinate me then I'm really 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.080
 I would recommend these for the girls that 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.220
 like the intense color and also that 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.070
 have a little patience for 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.450
 apply because it's worth training 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.640
 your time succeed so they remain 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.919
 perfect by the line of the lips and 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.380
 so that you do not look a bit messy 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:46.169
 and if you have that patience to apply 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.030
 all calmly and precisely because 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:50.370
 I'm sure he will appreciate them very much 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.700
 How do I appreciate them and this girl is already 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.320
 this has been my comparative review of 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.760
 lip paintings I hope you have them 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.770
