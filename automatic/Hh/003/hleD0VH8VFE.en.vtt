boil a little bit and then what we need

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.190 
boil a little bit and then what we need
to<00:01:49.360> do<00:01:49.539> is<00:01:49.780> just<00:01:50.049> go<00:01:50.229> ahead<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.709> cover<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.679 
to do is just go ahead and cover it and
now<00:01:54.159> we<00:01:54.220> just<00:01:54.490> need<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:54.880> let<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.240> simmer<00:01:55.539> for

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
now we just need to let this simmer for

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.859 
now we just need to let this simmer for
about<00:01:56.080> 20<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.799> 25<00:01:57.369> minutes<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:58.090> that's<00:01:58.659> going

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
about 20 to 25 minutes and that's going

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.870 
about 20 to 25 minutes and that's going
to<00:01:58.959> cook<00:01:59.200> into<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.709> chorizo<00:01:59.950> so<00:02:00.429> long<00:02:00.640> with

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
to cook into the chorizo so long with

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.339 
to cook into the chorizo so long with
the<00:02:00.909> bay<00:02:01.179> leaf<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.630> it's<00:02:01.780> going<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:01.990> give<00:02:02.229> it

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
the bay leaf and it's going to give it

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:03.330 
the bay leaf and it's going to give it
that<00:02:02.500> nice<00:02:02.740> flavor

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
that nice flavor

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.149 
that nice flavor
and<00:02:03.490> this<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.209> how<00:02:04.420> we<00:02:04.479> cook<00:02:05.079> our<00:02:05.229> chorizo<00:02:05.890> in

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
and this is how we cook our chorizo in

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:15.730 
and this is how we cook our chorizo in
hard<00:02:06.490> apple<00:02:06.759> cider
