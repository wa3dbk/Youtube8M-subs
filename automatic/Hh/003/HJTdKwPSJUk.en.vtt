of the SNES classic now I know what
you're<00:00:47.050> thinking<00:00:47.499> but<00:00:47.920> dude<00:00:48.219> it's<00:00:48.789> on<00:00:49.030> an

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
you're thinking but dude it's on an

you're thinking but dude it's on an
8-bit<00:00:49.539> console<00:00:50.050> of<00:00:50.199> course<00:00:50.649> it's<00:00:50.859> not<00:00:50.979> going

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249 
8-bit console of course it's not going

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:54.000 
8-bit console of course it's not going
to<00:00:51.309> be<00:00:51.489> as<00:00:51.639> good<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:52.300> didn't<00:00:53.229> expect<00:00:53.679> this<00:00:53.799> to<00:00:53.859> be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
to be as good I didn't expect this to be

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.590 
to be as good I didn't expect this to be
as<00:00:54.280> good<00:00:54.549> as<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.819> original<00:00:54.850> Super<00:00:55.510> Nintendo

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
as good as the original Super Nintendo

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.259 
as good as the original Super Nintendo
version<00:00:56.170> but<00:00:56.799> I<00:00:56.829> did<00:00:57.190> expect<00:00:57.670> it<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:57.940> be<00:00:58.059> at

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
version but I did expect it to be at

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.079 
version but I did expect it to be at
least<00:00:58.510> decent<00:00:59.190> once<00:01:00.190> you<00:01:00.309> play<00:01:00.549> the<00:01:00.699> game<00:01:00.909> and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
least decent once you play the game and

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.950 
least decent once you play the game and
play<00:01:01.539> it<00:01:01.659> all<00:01:01.839> the<00:01:02.440> way<00:01:02.620> through<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.699> will<00:01:03.819> see

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
play it all the way through you will see

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.940 
play it all the way through you will see
everything<00:01:04.960> that's<00:01:05.110> wrong<00:01:05.409> with<00:01:05.470> this<00:01:05.740> game

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
everything that's wrong with this game

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.850 
everything that's wrong with this game
and<00:01:06.130> I<00:01:06.159> mean<00:01:06.369> everything<00:01:07.299> so<00:01:08.020> what<00:01:08.259> exactly<00:01:08.409> is

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
and I mean everything so what exactly is

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.410 
and I mean everything so what exactly is
wrong<00:01:09.009> with<00:01:09.520> this<00:01:09.640> game<00:01:09.909> well<00:01:10.860> let's<00:01:11.860> find<00:01:12.070> out

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
wrong with this game well let's find out

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.660 
wrong with this game well let's find out
this<00:01:13.420> game<00:01:13.750> has<00:01:14.079> a<00:01:14.320> lot<00:01:14.350> of<00:01:14.920> problems<00:01:15.399> that

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
this game has a lot of problems that

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.749 
this game has a lot of problems that
crippled<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.270> gameplay<00:01:16.750> in<00:01:16.990> such<00:01:17.680> a<00:01:17.710> bad<00:01:18.130> way

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
crippled the gameplay in such a bad way

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.870 
crippled the gameplay in such a bad way
first<00:01:19.689> off<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.469> controls<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.189> physics<00:01:21.640> feel

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
first off the controls and physics feel

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.840 
first off the controls and physics feel
very<00:01:22.630> stiff<00:01:23.109> when<00:01:23.979> it<00:01:24.070> comes<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.460> franchise

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
very stiff when it comes to a franchise

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.690 
very stiff when it comes to a franchise
like<00:01:25.270> Mario<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:26.020> has<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.380> lot<00:01:26.859> of<00:01:27.070> platforming

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
like Mario that has a lot of platforming

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.270 
like Mario that has a lot of platforming
and<00:01:27.820> jumping<00:01:28.299> not<00:01:28.990> having<00:01:29.439> smooth<00:01:29.710> controls

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
and jumping not having smooth controls

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.410 
and jumping not having smooth controls
can<00:01:30.520> be<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.729> serious<00:01:31.719> problem<00:01:31.929> for<00:01:32.500> example

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
can be a serious problem for example

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.940 
can be a serious problem for example
when<00:01:34.420> you're<00:01:34.539> going<00:01:34.840> up<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:35.109> hill<00:01:35.320> or<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.649> giant

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
when you're going up a hill or a giant

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.630 
when you're going up a hill or a giant
pipe<00:01:36.369> you<00:01:37.030> go<00:01:37.240> up<00:01:37.450> really<00:01:38.200> fast<00:01:38.530> but<00:01:39.340> when<00:01:39.520> you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
pipe you go up really fast but when you

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.719 
pipe you go up really fast but when you
go<00:01:39.820> down<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.420> go<00:01:40.780> really<00:01:41.020> slow<00:01:41.670> shouldn't<00:01:42.670> it

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
go down you go really slow shouldn't it

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.300 
go down you go really slow shouldn't it
be<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:42.939> other<00:01:43.090> way<00:01:43.359> around<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:44.799> problem

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
be the other way around this problem

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.120 
be the other way around this problem
isn't<00:01:45.460> too<00:01:45.820> bad<00:01:46.119> but<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.600> other<00:01:46.749> ones<00:01:47.049> oh<00:01:47.320> god

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
isn't too bad but the other ones oh god

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.480 
isn't too bad but the other ones oh god
oh<00:01:48.429> god<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.619> other<00:01:50.740> problems<00:01:51.310> are<00:01:51.399> gonna

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
oh god the other problems are gonna

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.039 
oh god the other problems are gonna
drive<00:01:51.939> you<00:01:52.170> batshit<00:01:53.170> insane<00:01:54.329> long<00:01:55.329> jumps<00:01:55.840> are

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
drive you batshit insane long jumps are

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.859 
drive you batshit insane long jumps are
virtually<00:01:56.710> impossible<00:01:57.219> to<00:01:57.789> do<00:01:57.969> thanks<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.689> the

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
virtually impossible to do thanks to the

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.499 
virtually impossible to do thanks to the
stiff<00:01:59.140> controls<00:01:59.679> and<00:01:59.920> physics<00:02:00.210> when<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.329> run

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
stiff controls and physics when you run

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.719 
stiff controls and physics when you run
really<00:02:01.840> fast<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.619> attempt<00:02:03.069> a<00:02:03.130> long<00:02:03.399> jump

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
really fast and attempt a long jump

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.120 
really fast and attempt a long jump
you'll<00:02:04.359> certainly<00:02:04.659> go<00:02:04.990> really<00:02:05.590> slow<00:02:05.890> and

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
you'll certainly go really slow and

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.490 
you'll certainly go really slow and
chances<00:02:06.909> are<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.810> won't<00:02:07.960> make<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.319> to<00:02:08.470> the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
chances are you won't make it to the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.220 
chances are you won't make it to the
other<00:02:08.710> side<00:02:08.910> am<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.000> gonna<00:02:10.150> make<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.540> am<00:02:10.990> I<00:02:11.050> gonna

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
other side am I gonna make it am I gonna

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.210 
other side am I gonna make it am I gonna
