00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.030
 hello to you the fact here you are 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.760
 probably already looked at this miniature 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.689
 which we played and so here it is all 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.820
 mechanism the idea is that how 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.640
 would have slept 4 strands let's include that 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.670
 I will give myself a scoreboard one here and so 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.879
 and let's see how it works that is 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.460
 I go here friend hands dennet I see that in 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.129
 chat it is written that it is set si4 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.220
 everything, that is , s4 is installed in this place 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.230
 now come here I take again in hand 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.820
 network dynamics like so here so that it 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.630
 I did not lie, that is, I have his guilt before 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.940
 shouldn't be putting it on for 1300 like 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.860
 we see now if i do the same 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.100
 with a button it's like a detonator that is 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.800
 did so and we see the fact that all of our 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.829
 places exploded to those left all 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.750
 four also don't forget that here 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.060
 there may be explosions that is under it 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.180
 it's not even possible so 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.040
 attention that do not put the construction site below 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.360
 there is an example of this bullshit 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.170
 now let's explain how she is 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.940
 working here we will come from the very beginning 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.670
 There is here he is definitely not here Throw that is 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.770
 I have a cleri tente who have exactly 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.900
 scoreboard 1 i mean others don't 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.520
 maybe that is from this I can give 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.340
 opportunity that is to give opportunity 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.369
 this player will perform that is all 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.860
 four or not that is all other people 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.790
 besides me now will not be able 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.799
 s4 he removes tense 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.750
 in fact he is trying to remove but not 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.890
 maybe because it can't cost him 0 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.439
 and that's how he understands what's in my 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.060
 the inventory is there and he sort of removes it 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.770
 from this comparator that signal 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.630
 when he gives a signal here he forgot 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.299
 block now blocked like 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.940
 that is, you cannot teleport the wizard 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:15.200
 that is, well, more precisely the head of the visor 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.020
 to me so to speak here and when we have this 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.060
 button more precisely kent we raise it 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.580
 doesn't exactly remove our dachshund kent 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.330
 the signal here is lost the torch light up 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.580
 lower the visor's head down 20 blocks 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.240
 down which cannot be carried which is not 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.480
 explodes 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.760
 here and then unlock us this 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.140
 block this block vvedenskogo generator 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.090
 and next to that is to begin 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.170
 teleport this head ie 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.090
 the last to me, that is, he will find this 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.140
 head and tell or partner and stones 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.210
 here actually and installation si4 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.130
 finished actually now stayed 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.950
 detonator detonator more complicated i.e. 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.290
 also the same with the button then 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.610
 there is if we have a button button no hands 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:09.890
 this torch lights up 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:11.980
 he slept no throw who are already lit 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.840
 that is, that everything is about to explode 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.340
 we put on it a taste of 0 seconds that is it 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.970
 explodes instantly instantly 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.600
 tell and immediately teleports this 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.030
 tventi 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.220
 to the visor that is to the first visor not 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.270
 the last one that is so the first one that is 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.290
 who was first and then it's head again 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.270
 vizar again this 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.459
 more precisely the first one this one itself 1 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.380
 it was full of this porting down because 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.450
 that to destroy it is really impossible and 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.230
 he does not teleport for peace and she 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.230
 destroyed 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.500
 just like the explosion of several 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.720
 places that is immediately immediately at 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.709
 us, that is, and if he removed the wizard, then 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.880
 have imported down a comparator like 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.980
 reads it from the command block and 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.110
 repeats this command again that is 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.510
 gives us a signal and we get here 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.910
 such a club generator is small to those 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.670
 pore until all the pigeons for the most accurate 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.220
 visors they are one body down and this 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.030
 means that all these points that is and 4 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.209
 they will explode 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.230
 in fact that 's all the card will be in 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.269
 description 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.609
 here this whole schematic you can for them 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.459
 sits and naturally you can download something 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:23.750
 there will also be in the folder with the map and here 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.800
 by the way I will become a unit that's all with you 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.800
 hack all bye
