00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.750
 halo i noticed that my 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.460
 video so i made video like 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.130
 to create a backend server and the 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.039
 many people have that problem 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.730
 at the end of the state a mistake red and 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.230
 I know that this error is here 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.400
 the system can drive the specified 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.170
 Do not find any press 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.390
 key or the 4 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.559
 Sometimes the mistake becomes so 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.010
 sometimes it's just like that 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.780
 again and I'll tell you now how to 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.910
 that can fix as I guaranteed 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.050
 not that it works but has many 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.910
 that helped 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.579
 and if now have this error then 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.829
 followed my instructions and first 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.710
 we have to see what you finne as what 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.620
 your computer will find version has 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.059
 or what you think he has provided 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.800
 and this goes to system control 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.910
 The system and security enjoyed it 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.910
 then also system 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:10.380
 and then should be here then should 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:16.229
 Here are what the type of system has 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.810
 you have and mine is 64 bit and yes 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.020
 if now completely demolished on 64 bit 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.400
 follow practical instructions and the 32nd 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.710
 should have bit then synonymous times 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.740
 be a bit different and so on 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.270
 mistakes that java blame and go to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.430
 here on system control then on 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.240
 Program then program and function 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.740
 and most of you 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.560
 probably be that we have one 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.149
 java 32 will have installed that 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.600
 not one hundred percent with the system 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.280
 is compatible and gives you here 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.690
 times java or so that's quite normal here 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.170
 at the functions the installed yes 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.460
 just times 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.460
 I'll skip the time now 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.729
 and if you then have java installed 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.400
 then my google goes and write you 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.620
 here, so that sega now which bit 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:21.959
 version you have to have all the 32 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:23.700
 install bit version of java and 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:30.209
 then download donald deer are like that 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:39.900
 rehabilitates that then the the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:42.830
 czech the description purely so wat 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.830
 me very briefly 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.960
 then you do that and then 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.960
 install you that tomorrow 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.549
 and you have skipped me again now 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.189
 explain why steadily to further the Sun 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.720
 and if you have a 32 bit system then 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.689
 you have to now in East Berlin with whether the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.909
 one that works and if it is 64 bit 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.220
 then you system is like that 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.859
 you go back a second the java 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.739
 64 enter and so if the 64 bit off 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.239
 there you have both bit version of java 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.859
 installed on your system 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.859
 Do not you want to go that way ? 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.329
 We also do that very fast 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.280
 so as I said if the versatile 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.920
 talented then you install once yes 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.280
 word saw 30 bit or 64 bit and if 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:46.810
 in 32 bit systems only the 32 bit 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:48.900
 version of java happen because I too 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.590
 take up 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:58.560
 OK 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:01.590
 and that's what it did and that too 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.050
 I'll skip it now 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.770
 show me that, too 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.010
 So two years are still installed 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.940
 show times 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.400
 I had 64 bit system and I got it 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.739
 So now first the 230 will be version 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.510
 java then counts the 64 bit version 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.510
 you both can not keep any of that 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.010
 at a stall her the install 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.460
 So you are not allowed to delete this otherwise 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:37.410
 do not work 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:38.940
 and yes and no longer even the fia 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.530
 that the vaart I found 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.970
 could 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.520
 and I hope that you too 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.410
 will be like this 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.640
 and yes thanks for watching if the 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.380
 you can have video suggestions 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.380
 write and japan
