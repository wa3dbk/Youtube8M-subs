00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.830
 hello I'm Laura red physiotherapist and 

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:07.540
 collaborator of online physiotherapy in 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.250
 this video I'm going to give you the keys to 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.250
 the strengthening of your pelvic floor 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.950
 let's learn how to make a 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.810
 pelvic floor training in a 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.430
 series of points and keys that I'm going to 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.040
 summarize so you do not have any doubt 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.349
 and you can start working your floor 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.199
 pelvic today before anything else we have 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.850
 to remember how it was located and 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.830
 I felt this musculature like you 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.480
 explained in other videos is 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.590
 is stepping on the bottom of 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.400
 our pelvis and it contracts and relaxes 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.010
 thinking that for example we want 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.750
 hold the urine stream or we want 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.350
 prevent a gas leaking with this 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.390
 contraction of the sphincters we are going to 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.730
 perform what is called an exercise 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.950
 that the voluntary contraction of 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.489
 pelvic floor I will teach you in this 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.140
 presentation how are we going to divide this 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.110
 work of our perineal musculature 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.810
 the keys to strengthening the 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.850
 pelvic floor in the first place and very 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.789
 important is to locate the musculature 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.140
 of the pelvic floor what I was telling you 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.860
 found at the bottom of the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.570
 pelvis and in an imaginary rhombus when 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.380
 we are sitting on a chair by 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.259
 example how am I now 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.229
 would be located between the pubic symphysis 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.759
 front between the coccyx from behind and the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.549
 bones on which sat us 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.070
 are the ischiums upholstering this 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.960
 kind of rhombus that make up bones 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.860
 of the pelvic floor is the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.590
 musculature 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.600
 secondly let's activate the core 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.180
 as I explained in another video the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.890
 transverse muscle of the abdomen works 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.350
 synergistically with the pelvic floor 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.960
 What this means then is say 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.540
 a friend of this musculature the muscle 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.820
 transverse of the abdomen that is located 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.320
 both sides of the iliac spines is 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.450
 say of these bones that we have here 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.210
 in the anterior part of our abdomen 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.140
 is going to activate when we make a 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.450
 exhale and let go of the air pursing 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.600
 the lips agree trying to bring 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.980
 navel inwards and upwards 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.110
 this is what we call activating the core 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.760
 so that when we activate in the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.370
 pelvic floor musculature not only 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.530
 we are working at that level but 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.800
 also working our abdomen has 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.110
 that work in a very important team 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.030
 the third point as a key to this 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.350
 muscle training is that 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.270
 choose a position where you 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.190
 find comfortable to start 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.680
 exercise the pelvic floor maybe 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.990
 you need to lie down or maybe you 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.360
 you will feel comfortable while sitting 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.880
 to try and start the way that most 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.800
 the more you like it and the more comfortable you feel 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.960
 probably lying down how are you going 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.850
 minimize the effect of gravity you 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.950
 you will feel more at ease you will be able to 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.290
 better isolate this musculature and 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.240
 It's probably easier for you to 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.030
 As you progress in your training 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.250
 You can change and perform the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.770
 kegel exercises in a sitting position 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.410
 or even stand little by little you'll go 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.360
 finding your position once 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.970
 choose that position we're going to try that 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.960
 throughout the exercise keep a 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.240
 postural correction 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.880
 that is, if I choose to do it lying on 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.920
 a surface we are going to try that the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.930
 pelvis is in neutral position as you 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.240
 explained in other videos that is to say that 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.160
 do not go forward or towards 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.700
 back but put it in a position 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.090
 Neutral is worth both lying and sitting 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.530
 try to maintain that correction 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.360
 auto long and do our column 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.239
 vertebral growth in this case towards 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.580
 the roof if you were lying growing 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.290
 along and if you perform it standing up 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.730
 you will also have to maintain that 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.730
 postural correction that I mention 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.540
 let's focus and what would be the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.830
 exercise of that in performing a 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.830
 contraction and elevation of the 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.110
 musculature always remember letting go 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.880
 the air exhaling do not hold the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.500
 not block breathing is not the 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:06.110
 exercise in freediving but releasing the air 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.110
 breathe and you inspire and us and when you let go 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.970
 we would perform the contraction 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.570
 you will progressively relax once 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.549
 that you do the contraction exhaling to the 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.860
 finish you will relax the musculature of 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.049
 your pelvic floor little by little do not go down 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.230
 blow take time also to relax 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.710
 and very important when you finish each 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.050
 contraction rest take your time and 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.470
 go for the next one also when 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.290
 finish a series take your time and 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.970
 start over these would be the keys 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.860
 the seven keys to make a 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.600
 exercise that the correctly and 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.520
 then let's move on to what would be the 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.680
 full plan a training plan 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.960
 that I propose to you so that you start 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.320
 exercise this musculature in which 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.690
 base this plan first of all make a 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.110
 contraction its maximum is to say if the 0 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.030
 to 10 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.400
 we have the intensity of the contraction 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.730
 I'm going to ask you to contract at a level 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.380
 of 8 is worth because because I want that what 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.660
 chalices well this musculature and not you 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.120
 help from any other musculature of 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.030
 around neither the adductors nor the 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.409
 buttocks or the recti of the abdomen by 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.689
 it comes a contraction that you can 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.610
 have in time without help from others 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.679
 muscles as I tell you in this 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.349
 next point the contraction of the soil 

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:24.939
 pelvic floor is the pelvic floor and the 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.309
 transverse of the abdomen in the case where 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.409
 ActiveMOS the core but exclusively 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:32.199
 the musculature of the pelvic floor nothing of 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.550
 parasitic contractions okay let's 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.610
 try to keep this contraction its 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.619
 maximum between three and ten seconds 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.110
 quiet if at first you can not stand 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:43.779
 more than 34 seconds quiet does not pass 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.699
 nothing will be gained in time what 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.679
 important is that as I told you when 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.689
 do the contraction just from this 

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:50.939
 musculature and do it keeping the 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:54.550
 keys that I mentioned previously 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:56.949
 little by little you will go from 4 to 5 to 6 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.219
 until you get your 10 seconds or 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:03.279
 even more important we are going to perform 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:05.619
 between 8 and 12 repetitions each time 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.869
 let's do a series of wanting this is what 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:10.209
 that we are going to call series between 8 and 12 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:13.749
 repetitions in a time of three ten 

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:16.089
 seconds as we said we're going to 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:18.849
 perform the exercises that the three 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:20.440
 times a day, we can start tomorrow 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.600
 at noon night 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.790
 and incorporate it into your routine in your routine 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.960
 daily it's good that you look for a moment 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.790
 where you know that you are not going to 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.020
 forget to make the vouchers there are people who 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.180
 you are comfortable doing exercises 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.340
 kegel sitting and can make them going to the 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.680
 I work on the bus in the subway or 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.680
 dante find before you sleep 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.930
 lying down you can start doing another 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.690
 series plus a total of three series a day 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.820
 ok look for that little bit for you create the 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.070
 habit is going to be much easier than 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.950
 do the exercises and associate it with 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.540
 a specific moment of the day and good 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.220
 this is all I wanted to tell you 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.130
 on the keys to strengthening 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.290
 of the pelvic floor I invite you to expand 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.530
 your information about this area of ​​your 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:04.300
 body and that you take care of your musculature 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.820
 visiting www point on firm ground 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.320

 videos like this to keep practicing 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.940
 exercises and have more information about 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.460
 the pelvic floor you can find more
