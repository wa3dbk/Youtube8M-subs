00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.540 
that I found out where it spawns the
most<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.129> if<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.910> look<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.270> map<00:00:54.420> on

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
most is if you look at your map on

map<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.689> want<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> find<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> most

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
map so if you want to find it the most

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.980 
map so if you want to find it the most
out<00:01:25.830> state<00:01:26.130> go<00:01:26.250> there<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.689> another

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
out state go there but there is another

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.899 
out state go there but there is another
spot<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.439> found<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.920> where<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.130> spawns<00:01:29.490> now

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
spot that I found to where it spawns now

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.940 
spot that I found to where it spawns now
this<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:31.079> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> opposite

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
this one it's kind of on the opposite

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.530 
this one it's kind of on the opposite
side<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:32.939> we<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.090> talked<00:01:33.420> about

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
side of the one we just talked about

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.289 
side of the one we just talked about
it's<00:01:33.869> kind<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.350> topper<00:01:34.860> left<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.060> map

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
it's kind of like topper left of the map

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.910 
it's kind of like topper left of the map
but<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.110> not<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> way<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> the

play I found it here once and actually
ran<00:01:53.159> into<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.399> couple<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.759> other<00:01:54.390> people<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
ran into a couple of other people in the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.649 
ran into a couple of other people in the
game<00:01:55.890> trying<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.250> go<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.360> hopped<00:01:57.540> in

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
game trying to go to it and I hopped in

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.149 
game trying to go to it and I hopped in
it<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:57.930> them<00:01:58.140> which<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.439> still<00:01:58.680> really<00:01:58.920> funny

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it with them which is still really funny

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.550 
it with them which is still really funny
this<00:01:59.729> couch<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.329> fit<00:02:00.509> up<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.630> four<00:02:00.840> people<00:02:01.320> in

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
this couch can fit up to four people in

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.859 
this couch can fit up to four people in
it<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.310> want<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.700> good<00:02:03.390> time<00:02:03.630> with

it so if you do want a good time with

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.940 
it so if you do want a good time with
your<00:02:04.020> friends<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.590> messing<00:02:04.920> around

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
your friends and just messing around

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.180 
your friends and just messing around
it's<00:02:05.610> definitely<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> great<00:02:06.210> way<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.509> do<00:02:06.930> that

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
it's definitely a great way to do that

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.279 
it's definitely a great way to do that
now<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.670> vehicle<00:02:08.910> even<00:02:09.539> because<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.259> a

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
now this vehicle even because it is a

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.199 
now this vehicle even because it is a
couch<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.830> not<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> very<00:02:11.430> strong<00:02:11.670> vehicle

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
couch it's not a very strong vehicle

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.430 
couch it's not a very strong vehicle
it's<00:02:12.450> very<00:02:12.690> fast

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it's very fast

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.930 
it's very fast
believe<00:02:13.680> it's<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> fastest<00:02:14.370> vehicle<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.820> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
believe it's the fastest vehicle in the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.840 
believe it's the fastest vehicle in the
game<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.200> not<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.680> strongest<00:02:17.280> vehicle

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
game but it is not the strongest vehicle

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.940 
game but it is not the strongest vehicle
so<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.060> will<00:02:18.300> die<00:02:18.480> pretty<00:02:18.750> quick<00:02:19.080> obviously

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
so you will die pretty quick obviously

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.680 
so you will die pretty quick obviously
you<00:02:20.040> don't<00:02:20.130> have<00:02:20.250> any<00:02:20.490> cover<00:02:20.820> around<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.480> to

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
you don't have any cover around you to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.930 
you don't have any cover around you to
take<00:02:22.110> some<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.440> shots<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.640> will<00:02:23.790> blow

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
take some of the shots so it will blow

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.460 
take some of the shots so it will blow
up<00:02:24.120> pretty<00:02:24.300> quick<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.780> kind<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.050> keep<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.260> in

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
up pretty quick so kind of keep that in

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.950 
up pretty quick so kind of keep that in
mind<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.090> believe<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.540> only<00:02:27.660> spawns

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
mind and it I believe it only spawns

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.080 
mind and it I believe it only spawns
once<00:02:28.320> per<00:02:28.560> game<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.890> if<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.700> get<00:02:29.880> at<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
once per game so if you get at the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.130 
once per game so if you get at the
beginning<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.480> game<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.930> blows<00:02:31.080> up

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
beginning of the game and it blows up

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.050 
beginning of the game and it blows up
you<00:02:31.530> kind<00:02:31.710> of<00:02:31.830> lost<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.190> until<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.640> next<00:02:32.850> time

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
you kind of lost it until the next time

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.240 
you kind of lost it until the next time
you<00:02:33.150> play<00:02:33.330> dustbowl<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.620> hopefully<00:02:35.130> this

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
you play dustbowl so hopefully this

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.770 
you play dustbowl so hopefully this
