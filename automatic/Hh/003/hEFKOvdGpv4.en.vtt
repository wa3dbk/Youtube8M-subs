exactly<00:03:42.910> what<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.050> boost<00:03:44.470> is<00:03:44.710> because

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
exactly what the boost is because

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.640 
exactly what the boost is because
obviously<00:03:45.400> rpms<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.750> can<00:03:46.870> have<00:03:47.050> high<00:03:47.290> boost

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
obviously rpms you can have high boost

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.790 
obviously rpms you can have high boost
low<00:03:48.340> rpm<00:03:48.880> or<00:03:49.240> you<00:03:49.300> can<00:03:49.450> have<00:03:49.690> high<00:03:50.050> rpm<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.680> low

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
low rpm or you can have high rpm and low

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.340 
low rpm or you can have high rpm and low
boost<00:03:51.070> so<00:03:51.370> but<00:03:52.330> what<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.600> do<00:03:52.720> want<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:53.020> see<00:03:53.200> is

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
boost so but what you do want to see is

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.950 
boost so but what you do want to see is
at<00:03:53.680> least<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.100> current<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:55.360> current<00:03:55.390> charge

should<00:04:05.890> be<00:04:06.010> enough<00:04:06.280> there's<00:04:07.240> sometimes<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.750> bit

specified<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.930> but<00:04:14.320> again<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.860> all<00:04:15.130> you're

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
specified it but again you all you're

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.789 
specified it but again you all you're
looking<00:04:15.460> for<00:04:15.610> is<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:16.480> similar<00:04:17.230> pattern<00:04:17.470> where

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
looking for is a similar pattern where

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.830 
looking for is a similar pattern where
the<00:04:17.920> two<00:04:18.100> will<00:04:18.250> match<00:04:18.580> and<00:04:18.910> I<00:04:19.510> didn't<00:04:19.720> get<00:04:19.810> a

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
the two will match and I didn't get a

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.700 
the two will match and I didn't get a
chance<00:04:20.080> to<00:04:20.230> data<00:04:21.040> log<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.520> before<00:04:22.710> the

chance to data log the before the

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
current charge obviously would have been

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.470 
current charge obviously would have been
less<00:04:25.600> because<00:04:26.020> of<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.230> boost<00:04:26.440> leak<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:28.120> the

less because of the boost leak and the

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.930 
less because of the boost leak and the

sucking in X amount of air but when it

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.870 
sucking in X amount of air but when it

when it was a comparing the kind of

when it was a comparing the kind of
boost<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.270> was<00:04:52.420> developing<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:53.170> guess<00:04:53.440> that's

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
boost it was developing I guess that's

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.510 
boost it was developing I guess that's
when<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:54.570> set<00:04:55.570> a<00:04:55.600> red<00:04:55.870> flag<00:04:56.170> and<00:04:56.530> said<00:04:56.800> hey

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
when it set a red flag and said hey

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.920 
when it set a red flag and said hey
there's<00:04:57.790> something<00:04:58.090> going<00:04:58.360> on<00:04:58.419> with<00:04:58.480> that<00:04:58.630> MAF

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
there's something going on with that MAF

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.370 
there's something going on with that MAF
sensor

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
sensor

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.450 
sensor
I'm<00:04:59.800> only<00:05:00.100> seeing<00:05:00.370> X<00:05:00.640> amount<00:05:00.880> of<00:05:01.060> booze

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
I'm only seeing X amount of booze

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.150 
I'm only seeing X amount of booze
yet<00:05:01.729> I'm<00:05:01.910> seeing<00:05:02.180> X<00:05:02.419> amount<00:05:02.720> of<00:05:02.900> air<00:05:03.889> being

yet I'm seeing X amount of air being

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.650 
yet I'm seeing X amount of air being
drawn<00:05:04.490> in<00:05:04.699> so<00:05:04.880> there's<00:05:05.060> got<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.300> be<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.419> map

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660

sensor problem had the leak being bigger

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.290 
sensor problem had the leak being bigger
it<00:05:09.350> would<00:05:09.530> have<00:05:09.620> said<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:09.860> boost<00:05:10.190> code<00:05:10.550> with

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
it would have said a boost code with

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.680 
it would have said a boost code with
specified<00:05:11.990> boost<00:05:12.370> just<00:05:13.370> were<00:05:13.910> they<00:05:14.090> current

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
specified boost just were they current

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.580 
specified boost just were they current
or<00:05:14.960> current<00:05:15.530> or<00:05:16.250> actual<00:05:16.880> boost<00:05:17.120> just<00:05:18.050> had<00:05:18.380> no

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
or current or actual boost just had no

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.510 
or current or actual boost just had no
way<00:05:18.949> of<00:05:18.979> matching<00:05:19.639> the<00:05:19.849> specified<00:05:20.750> boost<00:05:21.080> and

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
way of matching the specified boost and

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.070 
way of matching the specified boost and
it<00:05:22.520> was<00:05:22.699> it<00:05:22.849> would<00:05:23.000> have<00:05:23.030> been<00:05:23.240> way<00:05:23.660> too<00:05:23.690> low

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
it was it would have been way too low

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.450 
it was it would have been way too low
and<00:05:24.380> that's<00:05:24.530> when<00:05:24.740> it<00:05:24.860> would<00:05:25.099> have<00:05:25.220> said<00:05:25.430> a

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
and that's when it would have said a

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.480 
and that's when it would have said a
charge<00:05:25.880> pressure<00:05:26.210> deviation<00:05:26.900> code<00:05:27.490> rather

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
charge pressure deviation code rather

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.600 
charge pressure deviation code rather
than<00:05:28.669> a<00:05:28.819> map<00:05:29.090> sensor<00:05:29.330> code<00:05:29.919> anyways<00:05:30.919> this<00:05:31.400> is

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
than a map sensor code anyways this is

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.570 
than a map sensor code anyways this is
after<00:05:31.940> taping<00:05:32.150> it<00:05:32.360> up<00:05:32.509> and<00:05:32.750> you<00:05:32.840> can<00:05:32.990> see<00:05:33.580> it

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
after taping it up and you can see it

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.219 
after taping it up and you can see it
pretty<00:05:34.849> much<00:05:35.030> follows<00:05:35.539> what<00:05:35.780> it's<00:05:35.900> supposed

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
pretty much follows what it's supposed

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.219 
pretty much follows what it's supposed
to<00:05:36.349> and<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.940> code<00:05:38.120> did<00:05:38.360> not<00:05:38.509> come<00:05:38.720> back<00:05:38.900> as

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
to and the code did not come back as

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.650 
to and the code did not come back as
you'll<00:05:39.440> see<00:05:39.650> in<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:39.830> next<00:05:39.860> capture<00:05:40.639> where<00:05:41.630> I

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
you'll see in the next capture where I

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.240 
you'll see in the next capture where I
took<00:05:41.900> an<00:05:42.410> image<00:05:42.770> of<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:43.630> code<00:05:45.039> checking<00:05:46.039> for

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
took an image of the code checking for

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.400 
took an image of the code checking for
current<00:05:46.759> or<00:05:46.910> pending<00:05:47.270> codes<00:05:47.599> and<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.199> run

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
current or pending codes and the run

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.950 
current or pending codes and the run
story<00:05:48.889> so<00:05:49.550> next<00:05:49.849> week<00:05:50.000> it'll<00:05:50.210> come<00:05:50.270> back<00:05:50.419> and

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
story so next week it'll come back and

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.779 
story so next week it'll come back and
we'll<00:05:51.080> put<00:05:51.199> a<00:05:51.259> new<00:05:51.410> hose<00:05:51.620> in<00:05:51.860> it<00:05:52.009> and<00:05:52.340> she's

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
we'll put a new hose in it and she's

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.550 
we'll put a new hose in it and she's
good<00:05:53.030> to<00:05:53.120> go<00:05:53.150> I<00:05:53.539> could<00:05:53.930> have<00:05:54.020> probably<00:05:54.139> left

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
good to go I could have probably left

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.460 
good to go I could have probably left
like<00:05:54.800> this<00:05:55.009> as<00:05:55.190> well<00:05:55.370> but<00:05:55.639> that<00:05:56.270> tape<00:05:57.199> just

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
like this as well but that tape just

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.730 
like this as well but that tape just
won't<00:05:57.650> last<00:05:57.889> long<00:05:58.190> enough<00:05:58.419> engine<00:05:59.419> oil<00:06:00.020> or<00:06:00.530> any

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
won't last long enough engine oil or any

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.439 
won't last long enough engine oil or any
type<00:06:00.949> of<00:06:00.979> other<00:06:01.190> grease<00:06:01.699> will<00:06:01.940> get<00:06:02.090> on<00:06:02.210> there

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
type of other grease will get on there

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.219 
type of other grease will get on there
eventually<00:06:02.690> and<00:06:02.930> I'll<00:06:03.139> just<00:06:03.289> deteriorate<00:06:04.039> the

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
eventually and I'll just deteriorate the

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.649 
eventually and I'll just deteriorate the
the<00:06:06.229> tape<00:06:06.470> actually<00:06:07.220> even<00:06:07.460> the<00:06:07.580> PCB<00:06:08.210> oil<00:06:08.449> that

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 
the tape actually even the PCB oil that

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.409 
the tape actually even the PCB oil that
goes<00:06:08.870> through<00:06:09.110> the<00:06:09.259> hose<00:06:09.470> it'll<00:06:10.340> be<00:06:10.490> forced

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
goes through the hose it'll be forced

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.310 
goes through the hose it'll be forced
out<00:06:11.599> that<00:06:11.840> small<00:06:12.169> hole<00:06:12.440> and<00:06:12.770> it'll<00:06:13.009> eat<00:06:13.550> the

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
out that small hole and it'll eat the

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.779 
out that small hole and it'll eat the
electric<00:06:15.320> tape<00:06:15.530> from<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.889> inside<00:06:16.220> out<00:06:16.490> so

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
electric tape from the inside out so

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.240 
electric tape from the inside out so
it's<00:06:17.270> always<00:06:17.419> good<00:06:17.719> to<00:06:18.050> replace<00:06:18.830> it<00:06:19.039> with<00:06:19.219> a

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
it's always good to replace it with a

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.060 
it's always good to replace it with a
new<00:06:20.090> part<00:06:20.650> obviously<00:06:21.650> if<00:06:21.770> you're<00:06:21.919> in<00:06:21.979> the

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
new part obviously if you're in the

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.279 
new part obviously if you're in the
middle<00:06:22.219> of<00:06:22.400> nowhere<00:06:22.580> just<00:06:23.479> tape<00:06:23.690> it<00:06:23.870> up<00:06:24.020> and

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
middle of nowhere just tape it up and

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.439 
middle of nowhere just tape it up and
that'll<00:06:24.530> get<00:06:24.650> you<00:06:24.800> going<00:06:25.130> until<00:06:25.310> you<00:06:26.270> have<00:06:26.389> a

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
that'll get you going until you have a

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:35.159 
that'll get you going until you have a
time<00:06:26.690> to<00:06:26.810> replace<00:06:27.110> the<00:06:27.289> hose

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169
