00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello, good afternoon, girls 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.179
 today I have to protect not only one 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.849
 tip to you as if a piece in the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.850
 truth is not no tutorial just for 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.260
 show you how they are in the play with 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.150
 a technician that the elastic one that that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.529
 elastics in which it appears in my 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.189
 it was not mine 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.470
 is a shame and it will slight the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.210
 fabric having been here is a fabric there 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.989
 even in the limone mesh on the cover for you 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.899
 see the texture of it and I'll show 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.899
 for you are like where 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.630
 backstage 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.630
 he asked 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.930
 River 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.290
 I think you can only start to stay. 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.260
 quiet rural 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.260
 already doing research 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.439
 You little ones are seeing that I do not 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.799
 I'm passing thru here in the 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.200
 because in this case I'm going to make nine 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.880
 here seams here 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.819
 This for me I think I 'm doing. 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.819
 here i am doing 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.409
 so I'm passing here because otherwise 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.119
 will pass from a direction that will not give 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.390
 the right size so you will see that 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.390
 came from you which measure is the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.060
 right, we seem to be following the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.420
 to know how many centimeters he 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.470
 You're used to it and I already took it for you. 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.470
 remove the tissue 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.610
 we pull and without close with care 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.510
 give a stretch to your people with the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:41.750
 does it go back to pass is it need now is just 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.750
 start cadu we can take action 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.330
 An important tip I also want to pass on 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.480
 for you guys 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.460
 is that for here the bell at the top 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.280
 the other end is not one 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.930
 very large difference as the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:05.210
 people put it here at the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:07.350
 closure is we 'll put the tab 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.340
 first but we will not pursue 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.360
 seam 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.980
 from here we can resume 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.340
 so that we do here we 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.210
 will have a sense of how much is left over 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.340
 that when we are going to remain here 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:28.310
 work , you may observe that I 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.310
 I put the fabric in the mark of a room 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.920
 that in my life I want her to stay 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.540
 well together that maneuver does not want to 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.910
 well after a shock on the dollar after 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:45.170
 put here today I'm crazy the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.170
 Used right here 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.540
 O 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.069
 i 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.069
 free 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.469
 Look at people, how 's it going? 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.980
 and look at the works since you indicated me 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.460
 I did not know that the excess of 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:31.010
 sovereign blood that is out like this 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:34.520
 how is the fault normal to 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.520
 people look good and the ricardinho only 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:41.510
 passing two of the seams 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:45.580
 Then you'll have to open it up. 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.580
 put as you wish 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.680
 position in the machine 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.990
 You see that stretching here is criticizing. 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.330
 because it can not be totally and 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.430
 disclosed because as in the time of stretching 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.240
 this piece you will not get a 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.300
 year 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.720
 know to look tight or even 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.330
 cost father there I have to this branch 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.440
 know how much you want 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.450
 the case here of my midday round 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.410
 It's clear that this is not getting 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.410
 getting used to 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.050
 My pleasure, you are already showing a 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.620
 piece is finished 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.639
 OK 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:35.240
 and will be placed in kos and a cut 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:39.570
 malegre was not very different 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:43.920
 Taboado poorly and loses goal will come from 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.230
 correct side is thus without being close 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.510
 form 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:54.500
 taking important because in house 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.210
 Actually I even started said he had 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.380
 engine and guns I ended up getting one 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.950
 a little more man would be way 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:08.320
 direct but I want to do you well 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.320
 how do you put here 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:18.370
 Obina at the front, it's enough that you will 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:22.380
 usually put like it was mine 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.380
 You can sew that one male thread 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.140
 There are down here you will put 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:32.320
 usually as if it were there with a 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:35.110
 line is a statue of you 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:39.690
 the elastic is asked to visualize 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.690
 Very well, but then inside. 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:51.090
 it is usually placed with the future 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:53.840
 the bottom line is neither mystery nor 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.840
 easy 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:05.750
 Aztec is the technical language passes 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.750
 usually here is a boom girl chic 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:13.290
 you put 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:20.930
 I normally learn and fill as is 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:24.090
 can filled with line is not present 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:27.660
 Good. I hope I helped. 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:29.940
 this tip with this last thing is that it is 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:33.389
 the use of the aspect that we like 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.889
 clothes so even I hope 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:36.630
 could have helped 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:38.850
 any doubt you can put here in 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.630
 comments will my imagination imagine 

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.630
 pass
