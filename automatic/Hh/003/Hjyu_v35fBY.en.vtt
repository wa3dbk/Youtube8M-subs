00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.830
 Hi everyone, it's SLrMats! And we end up for a tutorial on pc, I 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.470
 in fact you explain: how to fix the absence of sound on Windows XP, Vista and 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.470
 Windows 7. 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.500
 So I do this video tutorial from a tutorial written by "how it works". 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.200
 So I wanted to explain it to you by video. 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:29.810
 We will start by checking the presence of audio controllers. 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.180
 To check the audio controllers you must first click on: "Start" and then 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.610
 right-click on "Computer" or "My Computer" for older computers, 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.160
 then choose properties. 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.070
 So now a window is displayed, so for Windows 7 you have to click all 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.710
 immediately on "Device Manager". 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.370
 For Windows XP you first have to click on "Hardware" then "Device Manager". 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.489
 Then another window is displayed, what we are going to see is the controllers 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.750
 audio, video, and game 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.650
 So let's look at whether there is any damage, on Vista and Seven, a triangle 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.970
 yellow appears in front of the wrongly installed peripheral against Xp it will be a point 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.990
 interrogation or exclamation. 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.780
 If in the device manager the name of the audio controller is called "peripheral" 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.420
 high definition audio "is missing a driver for the audio controller to be 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.430
 recognized correctly, for some version of Windows modified as Windows 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.880
 Xp Ultimate, Windows LCD, or Windows Gold, it is impossible to install correctly 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.080
 the audio device. 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.720
 Now we will check if our Windows audio service is started automatically, 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.270
 we have to do: Menu start then search "services" under Windows 7, for those who do not 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.930
 can not search, which do not have a search bar, you have it executed then you 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.490
 mark "% windir%". 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:09.759
 You make "entry", you go into "system32", then you search for "services.msc", so 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:29.060
 we'll go down faster, I have a little trouble finding it, but it's there do not you 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.019
 do not worry. 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:48.239
 There is a lot of files, it is here, so you start it, you click twice. 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:57.700
 Then we'll see in "Windows Audio", so we have to find it, if it's starting 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.700
 automatically. 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:06.859
 Then you get started then if it's not in automatic you made property then 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.939
 you put here automatic. 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.469
 Then ok. 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:16.569
 So do you check if the sound works after a reboot then we will do 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.189
 something else if it still does not work. 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:24.930
 So in case of improperly installed device we can sometimes go back to the previous version 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.879
 because the new version would not work with your computer. 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:36.809
 You just right click, then "properties", "driver", then "previous version", if 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:41.459
 your device is installed incorrectly, that is to say that there is a point of exlamation or 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:48.739
 a question mark on your device or a yellow triangle under Windows 7. 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.019
 You can also search on the websites of the most popular manufacturers, so 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.939
 I will put the sites in the description, then the drivers will be obligatorily there. 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:04.900
 If all that was well done but no device is installed incorrectly and you do not have 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.569
 still no sound on Windows. 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:14.129
 Go to the search bar then mark the word "sound", open the software "sound" then 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:20.010
 watch if the audio device with the green cross is chosen for audio playback, 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.780
 this to say a speaker. 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.570
 So I'm currently on the speaker phone. 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:33.220
 So you can also lose Windows sound because of a virus or a trojan, these are 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.341
 viruses that you can catch, so to get rid of them, go see 

00:04:37.341 --> 00:04:38.570
 the link put in the description. 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.510
 If really everything is done and you still have no sound under Windows. 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.850
 Go to the links indicated in the description only in "other prossibilities". 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.870
 So there are two links, we'll see that right away. 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.820
 So here we are on one of the sites proposed in the description, you simply need 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.070
 click on "start detection", so now you have to install the plugin 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.070
 for Windows. 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:15.040
 So you install it. 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:50.910
 Here we have to install the plugin, you just have to refresh the page then maconfig.com 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.840
 will do everything for you. 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.760
 So after you have more to watch the drivers available, so you should rather 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.730
 watch the drivers for the audio. 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.070
 So me for example I have one that I can update. 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.360
 So there it really does everything for you. 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.760
 It is rather great as a site, it avoids you to search on the sites of the builders. 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:26.110
 You can do that through the site "touslesdrivers.com", the link is in the description. 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:34.200
 If not you can download the software "AIDA64 Extreme Edition", I will put the 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.030
 link in the description, so it will do exactly the same as the links, that the pages 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.300
 webs, so you can download it, the link will be as I say in the description. 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.710
 Here we are at the end of this video solution, I hope it has served you, 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.210
 do not hesitate to ask me questions if you are lost and do not hesitate to like 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.550
 and share the video, on this stand well and see you next for new video 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.840
 ! Bye!
