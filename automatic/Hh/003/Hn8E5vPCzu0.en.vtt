00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello everyone, and the mayor is a new one 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.470
 release of developer responses on ground 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.710
 Techniques in general enjoy 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.740
 so let's start the first question 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.719
 Is the repair base option considered? 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.789
 the answer is most non-critical 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.220
 damage you can eliminate on the field 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.080
 combat is also currently partly 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.350
 the function is already available but in 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.840
 experimental mode second question 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.820
 can you please tell us worked 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.880
 spacious cards are conducted 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.000
 the answer is of course being conducted and the developers are already 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.530
 with might and main on them ride the third question 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.210
 can be more detail about the system 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.829
 destructible objects 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.280
 for example, why not use 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.289
 third-party decision answer destructible in 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.660
 work based on our current technology 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.430
 we can provide destructible 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.500
 most objects on the map 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.629
 but the question is how further they are 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.789
 behave over it and are underway 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.410
 work third-party technology we 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.649
 use just for their further 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.270
 shattered simulation fourth 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.339
 the question in the game is medium tanks 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.580
 ineffective not claimed as 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.229
 planning to solve this problem you answer 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.210
 probably meant some other 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.280
 the game 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.290
 the fifth question already had questions about 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.240
 destruction of houses and trees but here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.640
 I wonder if there will be a real 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.970
 funnels in the ground they are drawn at least 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.790
 from large bombs answer yes already answered 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.189
 funnels from hitting large bombs will 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.490
 really but when it will be implemented 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.650
 it's too early to say the sixth question as in 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.470
 the game reflects the number of crew members 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.110
 on different machines at someone 4 people in 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.360
 someone from 6 and so on answer 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.250
 number of crew members first 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.100
 the queue was assigned according to 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.210
 requirements of the equipment they are in reserve 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.670
 accordingly no longer means better 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.130
 crew member also disabled 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.049
 now performs its tasks less 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.329
 effectively 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.100
 The seventh question is to expect a card in 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.119
 an arcade measuring three kilometers 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.939
 the playing area is now 1 to 1 answer 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.270
 you have long been cards 3 on 3 more often 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.400
 read bt section 8 question when 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.390
 higher rank aircraft will appear 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.930
 1-3 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.870
 and bomba 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.849
 fat cheek response with the start of the third wave 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.329
 higher rank aviation 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.189
 the ninth question will be available either bt 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.099
 joint fighting three armies 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.599
 aviation tanks and ships an example of such 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.810
 cards can be represented as acute 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.670
 surrounded by sea answer let's be 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.069
 talk about really available at this 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.200
 moment of technology aviation ground equipment 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.000
 without fail to face in battles 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.159
 this is not enough for anyone now 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.829
 secret tenth question 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.980
 projectile velocity is realistic or is 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.079
 Any improvements in favor of gameplay 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.970
 the answer we try to find everywhere the most 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.159
 speed details and 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.739
 ballistics shells and use 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.010
 Specifically, the present data no 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.450
 there are no improvements for the sake of gameplay 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.569
 eleventh question to 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.879
 get on zbt entered the test will 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.609
 repeat such an event will it be possible 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.489
 get on zbt without buying a tank package 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.049
 no answer is possible 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.180
 continue to continue 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.169
 various contests with the ability 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.659
 win tank package and access to zbt 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:24.359
 12 question how much range tank 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.599
 projectile exists for server response 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.000
 depending on the caliber on average from 4 to 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.620
 10 kilometers 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.810
 thirteenth question what are the plans for 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.359
 status and damage display 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.819
 own tank for paper doll 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.489
 which is still very little informative 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.989
 answer yes interface mapping 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.209
 Damage will change toward 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.519
 graphic display of information 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.859
 the fourteenth question is whether 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.079
 Ferdinand and the Royal Tiger is accelerated 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.449
 cornering response as now if 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.829
 press turn tank worth two seconds 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:58.859
 three then starts a little bit 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.930
 turn the answer the main problem in 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.090
 Wrong gear selection 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.629
 under the improved behavior of the mechanical drive 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.220
 the last 15th question is underway 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.259
 whether developers considered option 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.629
 tank control with two 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:14.669
 joysticks for each joystick 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.579
 Yes, and the question of the leg of the tower would be easier 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:19.799
 I decided to answer if you now look at 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.200
 construction of the tank control, it is clear that 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.710
 there is a separate axis for each side 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.719
 brake 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.270
 as well as other management which 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:28.849
 will allow to operate the tank 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.740
 and closer to the present on this 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.389
 I hope everything turned out to be a video for 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.710
 you cognitive if he you 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.900
 liked it like that 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.470
 subscribe to the channel and see you in 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.470
 sight
