 genuine interest when I post 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.220
 makeup in instagram very often to me 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.650
 girls ask what shadows you have on 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.539
 eyes about something summed up the mucous eyes 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.850

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.440
 viewing and whites that always causes 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.480
 mansa questions this is a pencil from a marker 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.730
 cc about sisi either 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.590
 obsessive compass cosmetics like you 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.360
 it will be more convenient as far as I am 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.620
 I understand the Czech brand she told me 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.930
 tested on animals 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.879
 interest is written that one hundred percent she 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.110
 vegetarian this pencil in shade 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.899
 half fight 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.789
 as you see he is blue and he is matt 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.489
 absolutely i really really appreciate it 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.830
 what's in pencils what's in the shadows what's lipstick 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.960
 because it seems to me matte products 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.799
 It looks the most successful they look 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.970
 more expensive somehow and when and mate in 2 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.070
 photo with instagram makeup and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.110
 my mucosa is let down somehow out there 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.240
 blue pencil always occurs 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.490
 many questions what brand of pencil I 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 every time I answer well, that is, I don’t 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.240
 it's hard, I still decided to show how he 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.790
 This pencil looks like this 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.070
 I have already used it a lot because 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.540
 that he was probably somewhere before me here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.090
 I try to sharpen him as little as possible 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.280
 because I am making out only the mucous 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.110
 and if suddenly I need for that 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
 makeup was more interesting i'm bringing 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.820
 the bottom of the stack fish arrows inner 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.770
 corner it looks really very 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.500
 interesting video of such a stock then he is very 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.000
 bright 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.009
 as for his stamina, I can't 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.649
 make you happy that he keeps there 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.600
 seven or eight hours there is no its limit where 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.820
 then two and a half hours later brightness 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.820
 leaves and only this remains 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.770
 subdued pigment your connection with 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.090
 as if just acquiring pale 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.100
 pale blue tint 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.840
 I think it’s not a problem project by yourself 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.670
 correct because makeup looks 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.110
 really can't very effectively 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.190
 to diversify even the simplest 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.959
 everyday makeup 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.970
 the following products that me too 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.010
 very often ask what the eyeliner 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.130
 me for centuries I'm on dad for the second time 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.750
 eyeliner from mobile which is called 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.910
 studio lasting drama in none first 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.770
 shades of black to be honest it was 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.290
 love at first sight when first 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.750
 since I bought it, I already said that 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.820
 Permissible eyeliner from mac black track me 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.550
 I like it much less I already threw it 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.350
 away and I almost never use it 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.239
 I got this eyeliner for everyone 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.800
 parameters it is not smeared anywhere and 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.989
 it gives almost a matte effect 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.430
 as i like the previous beard though 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.560
 they scared me that she was in a half 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.720
 month it dries me more 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.459
 I held on for half a year almost to 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.890
 end and used the only thing that 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.709
 she really began to dry up a little 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.180
 I added a drop of doyle on there and she 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.980
 exhausting eyeliner turned 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.630
 glossy i don't like this effect 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.800
 so I basically had him 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.510
 I hope to throw in this submarine 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.459
 use to the end because 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.470
 indeed she is very cool very 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.060
 quality of reasonable money 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.920
 next tea me very often 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.680
 ask when i lay mine 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.100
 matte makeup what is it for those i am now 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.209
 actively use a palette of tart tart 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.620
 Oleg I did not review her so she 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.300
 if it will be interesting to you somehow 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.739
 separate review and compare it with 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.200
 with some other brands I'm with 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.760
 pleasure i will do in fact and not 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.160
 I know it is visible or not, but I therefore 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.989
 take a picture of what I have practically 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.610
 all the shadows are erased by the name because 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.330
 what i'm really actively using 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.400
 this palette 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.410
 and now when were graduation business 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.510
 I also used blooming 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.550
 because they are very very good 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.560
 qualities and also on this palette not 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.480
 saw no bad reviews if suddenly 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.519
 you will have the opportunity 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.250
 acquire and because at this 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.140
 moment if we talk specifically about the palette 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.150
 only with matte 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.190
 in shades it is probably one of the most 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.620
 best for today i will 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.840
 happen already leave here and as i have 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.870
 she said too causes mass 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.700
 questions when i guess the photos in 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.530
 instagram with any makeup and we are there 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.690
 Present lips of me girls very 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.610
 they often ask what kind of lipstick do I have 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.100
 on the lips in fact it is very very 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.680
 budget lipstick in pencil from f 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.470
 which I bought a year ago I do not get tired 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.780
 rejoice at this acquisition because 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.520
 she's really awesome i can't 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.560
 say again that lipstick has 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.479
 some transcendental endurance but so 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.160
 how am I the person who we are just to him 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.590
 a lot of fun there to take 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.600
 on the street, make up lips 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.729
 not paying attention especially but this 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.190
 such a daily option you persistence 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.840
 myself i think you don't need it because but 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.080
 no problem when you go for a walk 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.450
 I will help you and tint her lips 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.280
 she feels very nice on her lips 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.220
 has a sweet taste I don't know what 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.050
 there she added you know enough 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.539
 such a neutral flavor that is not 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.280
 pronounced perfume is very beautiful 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.139
 shade i will definitely leave here and 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.780
 also show how it looks on the lips 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.090
 she emphasizes no flaking 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.190
 what else I like is what's here 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.860
 bottom there is a sharpener if you suddenly 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.050
 blunt donut you want well and 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.200
 qualitatively circle the contour of the lips then you 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.510
 you can sharpen and boldly do it 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.820
 so when I post enough 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.870
 bright eye makeup i always use here 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.820
 this lipstick and the last thing 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.160
 causes a lot of questions 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.890
 it's a brow on how I repainted 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.540
 weeks and a half ago and made myself 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.070
 more such a brown shade not yet 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.430
 the master did not more brown 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.680
 shade 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.660
 what you probably see on camera 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.640
 yellow probably not red 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.770
 I have more hair care now 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.050
 brown hue rather than red i 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.850
 used this pencil here 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.740
 it is written that it is fair for brunettes 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.500
 saying I do not know for what it is brunettes 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.390
 It must be very red-haired this scourge 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.070
 I already ordered one cosmetic 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.080
 pencil and well he unfortunately 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.300
 ended because I am very intense 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.180
 I used it as I practically 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.700
 always paint your eyebrows hair color well 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.250
 not so it seems more harmonious and 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.050
 I'll show you what he looks like now. 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.370
 have right know so obvious 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:14.710
 i'm outside the obvious reddish patton but this 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.170
 I just needed it because 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.390
 I had red hair like this 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.400
 it looks just not really convenient for them 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.860
 make out eyebrows because he has 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.990
 canted shape like a boring tassel 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.620
 we usually make out the head of it 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:32.830
 keeps the brow and honest 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.990
 saying i wouldn't be looking for a replacement for him if 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.700
 I no longer needed such a clear red 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.010
 about that so girls are from the bottom of my heart 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.870
 recommend him too 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.790
 A lot of questions when I form check 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.580
 and if suddenly you have red then 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.220
 hair because for some reason for such 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.870
 red-haired type Ariel but maybe 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.060
 more muted red pencil and 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.790
 practically do not release in the mass market 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.070
 and now I am making out my eyebrows with 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.920
 eyebrow lipstick from anastasia beverly 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.050
 hills in dark brown is what 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.140
 fits me right now but if not 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.480
 layering that is to say in one layer are created 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.460
 precisely such brows which I want if 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.230
 take there already several layers then they 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.690
 become very dark and to whom 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.030
 hair color does not fit 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.860
 one layer now using this but again 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.080
 yet when I take that thing you're here 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.310
 also a lot of questions arise so 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.990
 that girls is the top 5 product 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.780
 which I wanted to show you today 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.030
 if you have products too 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.100
 using which you get some 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.770
 compliments for people asking you questions
