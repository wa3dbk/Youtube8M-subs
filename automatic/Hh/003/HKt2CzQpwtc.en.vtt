power down yeah i can't believe it's an

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880 
power down yeah i can't believe it's an
open<00:01:36.119> yeah<00:01:36.420> open<00:01:36.780> diff<00:01:36.960> comes<00:01:37.320> off<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> corner

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
open yeah open diff comes off the corner

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.179 
open yeah open diff comes off the corner
he's<00:01:38.100> right<00:01:38.689> it's<00:01:39.689> uh<00:01:40.110> first<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.829> all<00:01:40.920> when<00:01:41.130> you

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
he's right it's uh first of all when you

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.859 
he's right it's uh first of all when you
feel<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.400> much<00:01:41.729> power<00:01:41.939> after<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.600> know<00:01:42.689> i'm

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
feel that much power after you know i'm

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.719 
feel that much power after you know i'm
spending<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.890> spending<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> day<00:01:44.369> basically

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
spending it spending a day basically

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.550 
spending it spending a day basically
doing<00:01:44.909> momentum<00:01:45.450> training<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.079> here<00:01:46.110> right

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
doing momentum training out here right

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.960 
doing momentum training out here right
and<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.159> get<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> car<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.579> some<00:01:47.790> power

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and you get in a car with some power

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.719 
and you get in a car with some power
like<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.320> feel<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.070> must<00:01:50.549> be

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
like this and then you feel like must be

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.300 
like this and then you feel like must be
getting<00:01:50.970> wheel<00:01:51.149> spin<00:01:51.479> right<00:01:51.840> must<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.380> burning

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
getting wheel spin right must be burning

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.310 
getting wheel spin right must be burning
some<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.729> power<00:01:53.909> off<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.840> feels

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
some of that power off and it's it feels

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.410 
some of that power off and it's it feels
very<00:01:55.770> efficient<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> part<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.030> its<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> way

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
very efficient and part of its the way

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.630 
very efficient and part of its the way
that<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.750> builds<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.140> power<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:59.250> way<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.549> it

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that it builds the power the way that it

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.730 
that it builds the power the way that it
you<00:01:59.880> know<00:02:00.000> ramps<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.780> work<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.259> how<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.619> builds

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
you know ramps to work so how it builds

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.760 
you know ramps to work so how it builds
up<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.159> doesn't<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:03.930> doesn't<00:02:03.960> hit<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.740> hard

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
up it doesn't it doesn't hit so hard

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.560 
up it doesn't it doesn't hit so hard
that<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.430> doesn't<00:02:05.610> give<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.000> tires<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.299> chance

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
that it doesn't give the tires a chance

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.229 
that it doesn't give the tires a chance
right<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.429> another<00:02:08.429> part<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.849> obviously<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
right and another part is obviously the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.300 
right and another part is obviously the
suspension<00:02:09.780> i<00:02:09.869> think

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
suspension i think

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.339 
suspension i think
you<00:02:10.759> know<00:02:10.880> as<00:02:11.030> we<00:02:11.180> talked<00:02:11.420> about<00:02:11.510> sport<00:02:12.110> on<00:02:12.319> a

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
you know as we talked about sport on a

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.860 
you know as we talked about sport on a
track<00:02:12.620> like<00:02:12.770> this<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.130> has<00:02:13.280> some

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
track like this that has some

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.020 
track like this that has some
imperfections<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:15.319> pretty<00:02:15.709> pretty<00:02:16.580> amazing

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
imperfections is pretty pretty amazing

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.610 
imperfections is pretty pretty amazing
really<00:02:17.239> how<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.540> deals<00:02:17.660> with<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.959> high<00:02:18.170> speed

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
really how it deals with the high speed

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.710 
really how it deals with the high speed
bumps<00:02:19.130> right<00:02:19.340> through<00:02:19.670> ternate<00:02:20.030> just<00:02:20.450> soaks

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
bumps right through ternate just soaks

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.180 
bumps right through ternate just soaks
them<00:02:20.870> up<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.200> car<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:21.650> good<00:02:21.860> through<00:02:22.010> there

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
them up the car is so good through there

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.910 
them up the car is so good through there
yeah<00:02:22.489> oh<00:02:22.640> yeah<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.239> agree<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.110> I'm<00:02:24.349> I'm<00:02:24.739> ready
