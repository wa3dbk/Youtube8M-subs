 car because our endorsement came that was 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.310

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:42.090
 red with beige interiors 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.410

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.320
 the scratches went wrong 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.980
 You can see them and the clothes are beige 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.140

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.960
 patricia reclaimed auto end promised 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.030

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.060
 I have a piece of paper where they me 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.860
 signed I was going to pass that I would 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.600
 to fix the car that they were going to give me 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.320
 that the car was missing and there's the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.270
 little paper but something that to date 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.250
 they have done me with difficulty 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.890
 patricia shows us that letter 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.649
 commitment a few years ago had a 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.350
 cerebral infarction that left him with sequels 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.360
 you can move your left arm your doctor 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.720
 He recommended avoiding situations of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.850
 stress but for 17 months he wants 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.630
 that self-end fulfills his 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.149
 commitment to this that happened to me 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.159
 of a cerebral infarction I have to 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.869
 be quiet no problem no nothing but 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.210
 it seems that I must have problems and 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.399
 others since I got here with those of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.399
 self-financing I thought it was a 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.820
 company would be nice everything all fine but 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.179
 but not every month must pay eight thousand 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.280
 pesos from January 2012 until this month 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:04.679

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.780
 thousand pesos for specialists in 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.940
 right are frequent cases of 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.660
 abuse and informality of auto fin 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.400
 the main reason for complaints that arrive 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.800
 to our organization are basically 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.620

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.850
 The developer solicits the loan 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.710

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.770
 weeks they were going to be assigned to do the 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.260
