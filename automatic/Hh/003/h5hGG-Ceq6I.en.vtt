00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.759
 Hello everyone, Prime and today we are 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.809
 we will review 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:12.420
 the haze of the game starbound haze is gone 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.540
 I think yesterday on some sites not 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.150
 I remember someone threw a reference and this 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.779
 This haze shows the actual gameplay 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.720
 this wonderful game that everyone 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.779
 we are so waiting and it happened that let's 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.929
 somehow look at the game itself 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.090
 world in principle the game world is composed and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.739
 It made, in principle, as well as self 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.530
 promised the only thing on the block he 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.410
 Tyrael jumps because it is not as well 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.399
 for this should not be you see the world 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.809
 similar to the terrarium of the last 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.149
 understand why I say those who 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.270
 really 2 will not understand why it looks like also 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.039
 here we will attack several species 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.800
 naturally minerals into this 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.649
 I understand it by itself I donâ€™t know why but 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.180
 when i started shooting this video 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.070
 for some reason my jump phrase 2 became 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.119
 more to after all I am about 3 meters up 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.770
 but it does not matter as this in this 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.750
 dumping I have not done anything yet because 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.580
 that I just started my dad 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.590
 here the world is circumcised even nothing can 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.990
 will really do nothing 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.430
 tell you are already playing 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.650
 you cannot choose a character here 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.650
 only shown so to speak a few 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.230
 seconds of gameplay that's absolutely doing 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.480
 nothing here 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.480
 trees as you see when the wind stagger 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.230
 then all this decorates the whole game a little 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.650
 process 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.190
 trees here again represented in 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.450
 very nice graphics here 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:48.390
 pixel that's not bad in principle here 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.570
 but bad dna is very short in terms 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.300
 moreover, that the world is by the way softer 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.180
 very little cut out a little bit with 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.220
 finished game but there are nice pluses 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.290
 who changed surprised it of course 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.290
 as he walks as he descends from 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.850
 the stairs that is if someone played terraria 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.350
 I know that there is absolutely no animation 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.550
 but whoever has it back and forth 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.160
 walks and everything that is 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:19.290
 there is no animation as such here 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.450
 there is a little better but I read the interview 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.430
 from the developers they kind of said that 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.170
 he must and they rise in a jump 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.180
 like it was stupid does not beat and ok 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.340
 rises this information is lifting up 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.570
 should also be here too in Eden she 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.160
 not presented here either 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.040
 represented by no weapon 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.930
 nothing is just just the game world 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.660
 the world is pretty good though it is smoke flowers 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.170
 I see the reality of the stone some 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.430
 incomprehensible ore most likely that's what I 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.230
 I like it here so that it is yes 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.420
 you move the mouse that is the camera she 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.670
 goes for the mouse that is not just thats how 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.680
 spirals there can be fan cameras 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.630
 centered centered on the player 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.390
 and you can move it q different sides of it 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.740
 very important here also here 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.990
 hand animation present all that 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.060
 because terrorism share when fought 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.560
 that's why comparing it was erasing 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.090
 because firstly they are teaching 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.010
 show they really teachers well here now 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.290
 I do not see a total of not quite 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.790
 different in appearance but something looks like 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.160
 well tell more principle about 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.640
 this about this haze there is nothing to tell 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.890
 because the fence the game has not yet come out 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.480
 here secondly I will most likely 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.300
 shoot a review at starbound because 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.850
 Basically, the game I'm waiting for 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.530
 long ago now just nothing perry 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.360
 foundations just decided to show 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.400
 video is for those who have not even seen 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.230
 the first process itself gameplay 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.840
 also pretty interesting 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.870
 Well I think you looked at 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.810
 animation on graphics on 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.000
 Some elements turned out to be textures. 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.580
 who will be in the game anybody liked 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.180
 I just saw everything with you 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.909
 This did not include 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.299
 with you was to rule as always 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.099
