00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
and you have to talk about it and figure

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.750 
and you have to talk about it and figure
it<00:00:15.080> out<00:00:15.290> that's<00:00:15.800> kind<00:00:16.100> of<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:16.250> world<00:00:16.460> in<00:00:16.670> which

it out that's kind of the world in which

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.820 
it out that's kind of the world in which
we're<00:00:17.330> interested<00:00:17.990> in

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
we're interested in

we<00:00:40.710> always<00:00:40.860> say<00:00:41.130> we<00:00:41.250> don't<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:41.730> do

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
we always say we don't really do

we always say we don't really do
architecture<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.530> kind<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.739> do<00:00:43.829> almost<00:00:44.070> like

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
architecture we kind of do almost like

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.130 
architecture we kind of do almost like
kind<00:00:44.790> of<00:00:44.820> not<00:00:45.090> quite<00:00:45.360> architecture<00:00:46.050> or

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
kind of not quite architecture or

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.650 
kind of not quite architecture or
marginal<00:00:46.710> projects<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.970> we're<00:00:48.180> doing<00:00:48.420> things

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
marginal projects but we're doing things

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.799 
marginal projects but we're doing things
like<00:00:48.750> writing<00:00:49.379> software<00:00:50.040> we<00:00:50.640> make<00:00:50.850> movies<00:00:51.270> we

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
like writing software we make movies we

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.410 
like writing software we make movies we
design<00:00:52.199> art<00:00:52.590> installations<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.699> mean<00:00:54.059> everyone

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
design art installations I mean everyone

that<00:00:54.570> works<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:55.020> us<00:00:55.140> has<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> really<00:00:56.040> sort<00:00:56.220> of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that works with us has a really sort of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.799 
that works with us has a really sort of
different<00:00:56.580> background<00:00:57.030> not<00:00:57.300> everyone<00:00:57.660> is

different background not everyone is

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.540 
different background not everyone is
actually<00:00:58.230> studied<00:00:58.530> architecture<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.430> we've

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
actually studied architecture that we've

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.270 
actually studied architecture that we've
worked<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.780> more<00:01:00.960> stable<00:01:01.280> architecture

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
worked in the more stable architecture

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.369 
worked in the more stable architecture
type<00:01:02.730> office<00:01:03.150> but<00:01:03.540> we're<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:03.900> interested

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
type office but we're really interested

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.800 
type office but we're really interested
in<00:01:04.470> almost<00:01:05.280> looking<00:01:05.460> more<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
in almost looking more at it as a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.969 
in almost looking more at it as a
workshop<00:01:09.140> we<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.350> finished<00:01:10.740> an

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
workshop we just finished an

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.520 
workshop we just finished an
installation<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:11.909> MIT<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.960> list<00:01:13.140> gallery

installation at MIT the list gallery

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.710 
installation at MIT the list gallery
we've<00:01:14.250> been<00:01:14.369> working<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.729> artist<00:01:15.360> Tobias

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
we've been working with artist Tobias

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.170 
we've been working with artist Tobias
putri<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> couple<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.890> projects<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.030> that's

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
putri on a couple of projects so that's

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.430 
putri on a couple of projects so that's
one<00:01:18.330> thing<00:01:18.479> that's<00:01:18.539> just<00:01:18.869> been<00:01:19.050> built

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
one thing that's just been built

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.150 
one thing that's just been built
we<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.039> finished<00:01:20.220> also<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.030> summer<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.570> ps1

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
we just finished also the summer the ps1

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.330 
we just finished also the summer the ps1
afterparty

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
afterparty

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.060 
afterparty
the<00:01:23.550> young<00:01:23.729> architects<00:01:24.180> program<00:01:24.410> very<00:01:25.410> gazebo

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
the young architects program very gazebo

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.859 
the young architects program very gazebo
and<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:27.090> we're<00:01:27.179> also<00:01:27.270> working<00:01:27.539> on<00:01:27.690> an

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
and then we're also working on an

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.440 
and then we're also working on an
inflatable<00:01:28.140> factory<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.369> for<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> company

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
inflatable factory it's for a company

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.510 
inflatable factory it's for a company
that<00:01:30.899> makes<00:01:31.110> inflatables<00:01:31.830> and<00:01:32.039> it<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.369> an

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that makes inflatables and it is an

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.430 
that makes inflatables and it is an
inflatable<00:01:32.910> itself<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.660> they<00:01:33.780> wanted<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.170> make

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
inflatable itself so they wanted to make

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.650 
inflatable itself so they wanted to make
this<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:35.100> long<00:01:35.340> span<00:01:35.789> structure<00:01:36.479> that's

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
this really long span structure that's

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.420 
this really long span structure that's
all<00:01:36.840> air<00:01:37.110> inflated

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
all air inflated

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.620 
all air inflated
I<00:01:39.550> think<00:01:40.030> we've<00:01:40.120> got<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.300> really<00:01:40.510> interesting

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
I think we've got a really interesting

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.670 
I think we've got a really interesting
relationship<00:01:41.760> to<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:43.660> computer<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.380> we're

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
relationship to the computer and we're

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.200 
relationship to the computer and we're
the<00:01:44.800> generation<00:01:44.920> that's<00:01:45.490> right<00:01:45.730> at<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.000> cusp

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
the generation that's right at the cusp

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.730 
the generation that's right at the cusp
where<00:01:46.420> we<00:01:46.600> sort<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:46.870> did<00:01:47.050> everything<00:01:47.290> drawing

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
where we sort of did everything drawing

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.580 
where we sort of did everything drawing
by<00:01:47.950> hand<00:01:47.980> but<00:01:48.550> computers<00:01:49.060> were<00:01:49.330> really<00:01:50.050> coming

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
by hand but computers were really coming

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.110 
by hand but computers were really coming
and<00:01:50.800> so<00:01:50.860> we've<00:01:51.130> had<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.280> teach<00:01:51.580> ourselves

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
and so we've had to teach ourselves

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.210 
and so we've had to teach ourselves
actually<00:01:52.300> how<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.200> use<00:01:53.410> all<00:01:53.620> of<00:01:53.800> these<00:01:53.920> things

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
actually how to use all of these things

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.800 
actually how to use all of these things
when<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.760> think<00:01:54.910> about<00:01:54.940> computers<00:01:55.570> in

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
when you think about computers in

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.859 
when you think about computers in
architecture<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.350> tend<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.710> think<00:01:56.920> of<00:01:57.100> very

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
architecture you tend to think of very

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.690 
architecture you tend to think of very
glossy<00:01:58.890> curvy<00:02:00.119> blobby<00:02:01.119> things<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:03.520> were

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
glossy curvy blobby things and we were

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.160 
glossy curvy blobby things and we were
interested<00:02:04.150> in<00:02:04.210> thinking<00:02:04.479> about<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.840> digital

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
interested in thinking about the digital

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.580 
interested in thinking about the digital
and<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.320> much<00:02:05.470> more<00:02:05.710> let's<00:02:05.950> say<00:02:06.070> visceral<00:02:06.460> way

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
and a much more let's say visceral way

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.960 
and a much more let's say visceral way
so<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.830> computer<00:02:09.070> can<00:02:09.220> allow<00:02:09.520> for<00:02:09.789> let's

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
so that the computer can allow for let's

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.340 
so that the computer can allow for let's
say<00:02:10.090> not<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:10.630> idea<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.080> we're<00:02:11.230> working

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
say not this idea that we're working

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.110 
say not this idea that we're working
outside<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.220> real<00:02:12.459> world<00:02:12.730> with<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
outside of the real world with the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.280 
outside of the real world with the
reverse<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.780> computer<00:02:14.110> actually

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
reverse that the computer actually

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.650 
reverse that the computer actually
allows<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.890> bring<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:16.209> outside<00:02:16.239> world

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
allows you to bring in the outside world

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.870 
allows you to bring in the outside world
into<00:02:16.989> here<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.590> test<00:02:17.830> things<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.160> real<00:02:18.340> time<00:02:18.580> so

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
into here to test things in real time so

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.460 
into here to test things in real time so
you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.120> look<00:02:19.209> at<00:02:19.330> how<00:02:19.510> things<00:02:19.690> react<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.320> a

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
you can look at how things react in a

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.080 
you can look at how things react in a
physical<00:02:20.920> situation<00:02:21.070> like<00:02:21.760> right<00:02:21.970> now

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
physical situation like right now

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.520 
physical situation like right now
there's<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.390> lot<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.630> people<00:02:22.900> experimenting

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
there's a lot of people experimenting

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.610 
there's a lot of people experimenting
with<00:02:23.680> things<00:02:23.950> like<00:02:24.660> 3d<00:02:25.660> printing<00:02:26.170> buildings

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
with things like 3d printing buildings

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.900 
with things like 3d printing buildings
you<00:02:26.739> know<00:02:26.800> there's<00:02:26.980> 3d<00:02:27.250> printers<00:02:27.550> which<00:02:27.760> will

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
you know there's 3d printers which will

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.670 
you know there's 3d printers which will
make<00:02:28.090> small-scale<00:02:28.720> 3d<00:02:29.020> prints<00:02:29.290> but<00:02:29.410> there's

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
make small-scale 3d prints but there's

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.470 
make small-scale 3d prints but there's
an<00:02:30.190> idea<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.520> we<00:02:30.610> could<00:02:30.700> do<00:02:30.790> with<00:02:30.940> concrete

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
an idea that we could do with concrete

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.260 
an idea that we could do with concrete
or<00:02:31.690> polymers<00:02:32.200> at<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> larger<00:02:32.800> scale<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.340> start

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
or polymers at a larger scale and start

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.180 
or polymers at a larger scale and start
to<00:02:34.360> print<00:02:34.989> out<00:02:35.170> your<00:02:35.380> building<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.890> is

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
to print out your building so that is

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.690 
to print out your building so that is
very<00:02:36.459> cool<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:40.750> can<00:02:40.930> now<00:02:41.140> do<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:42.220> many<00:02:42.400> things

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
very cool we can now do so many things

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.120 
very cool we can now do so many things
like<00:02:43.030> we<00:02:43.390> can<00:02:43.540> sit<00:02:43.720> down<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.500> engineering

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
like we can sit down and do engineering

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.340 
like we can sit down and do engineering
or<00:02:45.580> we<00:02:45.820> can<00:02:45.970> do<00:02:46.120> all<00:02:46.360> our<00:02:46.390> own<00:02:46.540> graphic<00:02:47.019> design

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
or we can do all our own graphic design

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.840 
or we can do all our own graphic design
so<00:02:47.769> what<00:02:47.920> does<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.040> mean<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> future<00:02:48.700> for

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
so what does that mean in the future for

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.420 
so what does that mean in the future for
let's<00:02:49.030> say<00:02:49.209> professions<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.350> don't<00:02:50.980> have<00:02:51.220> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
let's say professions you don't have to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.009 
let's say professions you don't have to
specialize<00:02:51.910> anymore<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.570> think<00:02:52.810> for<00:02:52.959> us

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
specialize anymore and I think for us

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.330 
specialize anymore and I think for us
we're<00:02:53.410> interesting<00:02:53.739> this<00:02:53.799> idea<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.100> how<00:02:54.280> do

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
we're interesting this idea of how do

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.039 
we're interesting this idea of how do
you<00:02:54.400> work<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:54.820> let's<00:02:54.970> say<00:02:55.060> post<00:02:55.360> medium

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
you work in let's say post medium

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.170 
you work in let's say post medium
idea<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.739> architecture<00:02:57.340> where<00:02:57.820> you're<00:02:58.000> not

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
idea of architecture where you're not

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.600 
idea of architecture where you're not
having<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.840> declare<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.230> single<00:02:59.709> concept<00:03:00.489> of

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
having to declare a single concept of

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.680 
having to declare a single concept of
architecture<00:03:01.030> but<00:03:01.180> how<00:03:01.299> you<00:03:01.360> deal<00:03:01.660> with

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
architecture but how you deal with

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.870 
architecture but how you deal with
architecture<00:03:02.230> as<00:03:02.350> an<00:03:02.500> inclusive<00:03:02.890> thing<00:03:03.610> that

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
architecture as an inclusive thing that

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.550 
architecture as an inclusive thing that
you're<00:03:04.030> constantly<00:03:04.360> bringing<00:03:04.900> other<00:03:05.200> stuff

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
you're constantly bringing other stuff

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.110 
you're constantly bringing other stuff
into<00:03:05.739> it
