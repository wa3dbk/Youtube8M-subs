Turismo 5 gran turismo 5 prologue is I

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.860 
Turismo 5 gran turismo 5 prologue is I
mean<00:00:38.280> many<00:00:38.910> people<00:00:39.210> think<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.540> an<00:00:39.660> over

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
mean many people think it's an over

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.170 
mean many people think it's an over
glorified<00:00:39.989> demo<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.129> don't<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.090> like

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
glorified demo but I don't really like

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.819 
glorified demo but I don't really like
to<00:00:42.600> say<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.960> because<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.559> true

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
to say that because it's just not true

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.880 
to say that because it's just not true
it<00:00:44.370> contains<00:00:44.820> most<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> features<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it contains most of the features of a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.580 
it contains most of the features of a
finished<00:00:47.399> gran<00:00:47.670> turismo<00:00:48.030> 5<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:49.170> quite

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
finished gran turismo 5 but not quite

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.380 
finished gran turismo 5 but not quite
but<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.190> certainly<00:00:50.340> not<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> demo<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.210> mean

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
but it's certainly not a demo I mean

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.529 
but it's certainly not a demo I mean
it's<00:00:52.020> got<00:00:52.199> about<00:00:52.379> 70<00:00:52.980> cars<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:54.120> six

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
it's got about 70 cars there are six

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.959 
it's got about 70 cars there are six
tracks<00:00:55.190> there<00:00:56.190> are<00:00:56.309> quite<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> few<00:00:56.640> different

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
tracks there are quite a few different

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.540 
tracks there are quite a few different
alternate<00:00:57.600> routes<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.260> every<00:00:58.620> track<00:00:59.160> plus

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
alternate routes for every track plus

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.279 
alternate routes for every track plus
you<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.940> also<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.420> course<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.840> reverse

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you can also do of course the reverse

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.560 
you can also do of course the reverse
tracks<00:01:01.680> which<00:01:02.460> brings<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.820> total<00:01:03.149> close<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
tracks which brings a total close to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.270 
tracks which brings a total close to
around<00:01:03.719> 20<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> know<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
around 20 now I know that is like a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.730 
around 20 now I know that is like a
cop-out<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.630> say<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:07.020> are<00:01:07.170> six

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
cop-out so you can say there are six

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.300 
cop-out so you can say there are six
tracks<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:09.270> way<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.780> single<00:01:10.380> player<00:01:10.500> game<00:01:10.890> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
tracks the way the single player game is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.560 
tracks the way the single player game is
broken<00:01:11.520> down<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.880> mean<00:01:12.150> you've<00:01:12.240> got<00:01:12.270> your

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
broken down I mean you've got your

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.330 
broken down I mean you've got your
arcade<00:01:12.990> mode<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.799> know<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.130> just

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
arcade mode but you know that's just

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.620 
arcade mode but you know that's just
your<00:01:14.460> typical<00:01:14.580> arcade<00:01:15.060> mode<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.450> I'm<00:01:15.509> not

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
your typical arcade mode so I'm not

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.030 
your typical arcade mode so I'm not
going<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.200> delve<00:01:16.470> too<00:01:16.560> much<00:01:16.770> into

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
going to you know delve too much into

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.210 
going to you know delve too much into
that<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:18.060> main<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:19.350> main<00:01:19.380> bulk<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.040> game

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
that the main the main bulk of the game

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.399 
that the main the main bulk of the game
is<00:01:20.430> obviously<00:01:20.850> your<00:01:21.000> simulation<00:01:21.509> mode<00:01:21.630> which

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
is obviously your simulation mode which

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.670 
is obviously your simulation mode which
it's<00:01:23.340> broken<00:01:23.580> into<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.210> series<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.720> events<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it's broken into a series of events you

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.920 
it's broken into a series of events you
think<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.070> almost<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.939> license<00:01:27.659> test

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
think of it almost like the license test

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
think of it almost like the license test
of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.470> previous<00:01:28.950> Gran<00:01:29.189> Turismo<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
of the previous Gran Turismo so

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
of the previous Gran Turismo so
basically<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.020> start<00:01:31.079> off<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
basically you start off and you have the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.270 
basically you start off and you have the
event<00:01:32.610> Class<00:01:33.060> C<00:01:33.420> then<00:01:33.869> you've<00:01:34.020> got<00:01:34.200> Class<00:01:34.680> B

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
event Class C then you've got Class B

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.640 
event Class C then you've got Class B
Class<00:01:35.640> A<00:01:36.030> when<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> finish<00:01:37.079> those<00:01:37.259> three

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
Class A when you finish those three

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.100 
Class A when you finish those three
you've<00:01:37.799> got<00:01:37.979> class<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.750> let<00:01:39.750> me<00:01:39.840> tell<00:01:40.020> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
right now class s is insanely hard

you'll buy better cars which we use for
the<00:02:40.840> other<00:02:41.020> events<00:02:41.470> now<00:02:41.620> events<00:02:42.490> there's

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
the other events now events there's

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.980 
the other events now events there's
three<00:02:42.910> different<00:02:43.030> types<00:02:43.480> there's<00:02:43.870> your

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
three different types there's your

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.500 
three different types there's your
typical<00:02:44.260> race<00:02:44.590> events<00:02:45.100> then<00:02:45.460> there<00:02:45.850> are<00:02:45.880> time

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
typical race events then there are time

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.510 
typical race events then there are time
trial<00:02:46.840> events<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.440> then<00:02:47.650> there's<00:02:47.830> finally<00:02:48.280> I

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
trial events and then there's finally I

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.800 
trial events and then there's finally I
don't<00:02:49.000> wait<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.180> would<00:02:49.300> call<00:02:49.480> this<00:02:49.630> but

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
don't wait you would call this but

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.060 
don't wait you would call this but
basically<00:02:50.020> starting<00:02:50.380> last<00:02:50.560> place<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:50.980> your

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
basically starting last place and your

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.470 
basically starting last place and your
objective<00:02:51.490> is<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.760> get<00:02:51.850> into<00:02:52.090> first<00:02:52.300> place

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
objective is to get into first place

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.630 
objective is to get into first place
within<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.959> predetermined<00:02:53.350> amount<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.430> laps

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
within a predetermined amount of laps

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.960 
within a predetermined amount of laps
okay<00:02:55.500> that's<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.650> same<00:02:56.860> through<00:02:57.130> all<00:02:57.310> the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
okay that's the same through all the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.690 
okay that's the same through all the
different<00:02:58.480> classes<00:02:59.140> now<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.070> mean<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.370> can<00:03:00.550> get

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
different classes now I mean it can get

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.140 
different classes now I mean it can get
a<00:03:00.760> little<00:03:01.000> bit<00:03:01.180> repetitive<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.890> terms<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.430> the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
a little bit repetitive in terms of the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.970 
a little bit repetitive in terms of the
different<00:03:04.270> events<00:03:04.750> because<00:03:05.140> sometimes

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
different events because sometimes

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.140 
different events because sometimes
you'll<00:03:06.160> have<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.430> raise<00:03:06.610> them<00:03:06.790> over<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.060> over

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
you'll have to raise them over and over

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.520 
you'll have to raise them over and over
and<00:03:07.330> over<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.600> over<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:07.870> over<00:03:07.959> again<00:03:08.200> in

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
and over and over and over again in

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.550 
and over and over and over again in
order<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.459> get<00:03:09.910> enough<00:03:10.030> money<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.630> buy<00:03:10.810> better

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
order to get enough money to buy better

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.759 
order to get enough money to buy better
sports<00:03:12.010> cars<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.610> whatnot<00:03:12.760> but<00:03:13.600> it<00:03:13.989> depends

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
sports cars and whatnot but it depends

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.220 
sports cars and whatnot but it depends
if<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.550> know<00:03:15.820> your<00:03:16.060> cars<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:16.989> got<00:03:17.140> to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
if you know your cars and you got to

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.540 
if you know your cars and you got to
remember<00:03:17.320> this<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.680> Gran<00:03:17.830> Turismo<00:03:18.070> here<00:03:18.400> so

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
remember this is Gran Turismo here so

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.520 
remember this is Gran Turismo here so
it's<00:03:18.730> super<00:03:19.120> realistic<00:03:19.510> if<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.200> know<00:03:20.350> your

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
it's super realistic if you know your

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.640 
it's super realistic if you know your
cars<00:03:20.739> properly<00:03:21.430> enough<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:22.330> can<00:03:22.750> limit<00:03:23.620> the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
cars properly enough you can limit the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.770 
cars properly enough you can limit the
amount<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:24.070> races<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.580> you<00:03:24.760> do<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:25.630> for

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
amount of races that you do so for

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.729 
amount of races that you do so for
example<00:03:25.870> if<00:03:26.170> you're<00:03:26.290> going<00:03:26.500> out<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.650> you're

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
example if you're going out and you're

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.320 
example if you're going out and you're
buying<00:03:26.980> like<00:03:27.190> all<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.489> worst<00:03:27.670> cars<00:03:28.000> cuz<00:03:28.239> you

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
buying like all the worst cars cuz you

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
which was kind of kind of a letdown I

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.780 
which was kind of kind of a letdown I
mean<00:05:19.450> I<00:05:19.570> know<00:05:19.830> polyphony<00:05:20.830> Digital's<00:05:21.430> said

that they're going to have release a
patch<00:05:23.680> in<00:05:24.100> you<00:05:24.790> know<00:05:24.880> in<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.060> future<00:05:25.240> that'll

allow<00:05:26.020> car<00:05:26.560> damage<00:05:26.950> but<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.310> thing<00:05:27.460> is<00:05:27.490> it's

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
allow car damage but the thing is it's

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.340 
allow car damage but the thing is it's
not<00:05:28.270> in<00:05:28.390> there<00:05:28.540> now<00:05:28.720> and<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:29.110> doesn't<00:05:29.290> really

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
not in there now and it doesn't really

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.080 
not in there now and it doesn't really
make<00:05:29.560> any<00:05:29.620> sense<00:05:30.010> considering<00:05:30.490> quarters<00:05:31.000> a

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
make any sense considering quarters a

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.840 
make any sense considering quarters a
motorsport<00:05:31.990> has<00:05:32.500> had<00:05:32.770> it<00:05:32.919> in<00:05:33.010> there<00:05:33.280> for<00:05:33.820> the

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
motorsport has had it in there for the

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.080 
motorsport has had it in there for the
last<00:05:34.000> two<00:05:34.270> iterations<00:05:34.450> so<00:05:35.350> I<00:05:35.790> don't<00:05:36.790> know<00:05:36.850> it

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
last two iterations so I don't know it

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.250 
last two iterations so I don't know it
doesn't<00:05:37.360> really<00:05:37.480> make<00:05:37.600> any<00:05:37.660> sense<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.050> us<00:05:38.169> I

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
doesn't really make any sense to us I

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.330 
doesn't really make any sense to us I
mean<00:05:38.320> it<00:05:38.410> doesn't<00:05:38.620> really<00:05:38.710> break<00:05:39.010> the<00:05:39.160> game

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
mean it doesn't really break the game

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.300 
mean it doesn't really break the game
but<00:05:39.760> it's<00:05:39.940> it<00:05:40.180> is<00:05:40.540> kind<00:05:40.810> of<00:05:40.870> peculiar<00:05:41.230> now<00:05:42.130> this

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
but it's it is kind of peculiar now this

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
but it's it is kind of peculiar now this
is<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:42.520> moment<00:05:42.730> you've<00:05:42.910> all<00:05:43.060> been<00:05:43.120> waiting
