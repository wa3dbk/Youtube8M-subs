00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.670
 if a man like ron gilbert over 20 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.619
 years after monkey island 2 finally 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.570
 another adventure is published 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.520
 the expectations accordingly large 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.469
 after all , he is considered the inventor of the point 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.700
 and click adventures and if so 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.040
 man says the invented by him 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.870
 Control is actually boring that 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.210
 would go better then you believe him 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.070
 that too and that is the approach of the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.860
 cave an adventure that I as 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.379
 jump'n'run and in a 2d view 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.370
 we control three of seven selectable ones 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.780
 Characterized by the eponymous 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.719
 cave and solve puzzles 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.739
 by collecting items and the 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.280
 Special skills of our three heroes 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.800
 use 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.719
 That sounds like lost vikings now 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.469
 or trial has little in the reason 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.460
 to do with 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.379
 Here are no 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.400
 skill tasks no fights 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.590
 no time pressure 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.990
 the cave is a true sequencer 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.939
 according to each philosophy, it is not 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.740
 once possible to die should be one 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.270
 she will bite the characters in the grass 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 just a few steps back 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.500
 which does not exist is also 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.450
 an inventory let alone mouse 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.939
 commands control completely 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.500
 directly the three figures interact with 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.299
 the objects they reach 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.950
 can and can only do one at a time 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.869
 carry something around with you 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.030
 so that not marred sorted 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.560
 chaos degenerates are the individual puzzles 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.600
 kept relatively simple and for 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.549
 adventure professionals consistently easy 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.229
 However, you still have the hat on 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.240
 the designers pull out of these 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.460
 quite limited possibilities 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.649
 get rid of original puzzle ideas 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.119
 have required on the other side 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.890
 the handle with the objects after all 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.689
 a lot of running back and forth and 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.729
 Happen also because of the pretty 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.439
 hakeligen control we wonder if 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.049
 that should be really exciting now 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.640
 as for example the automatic running animation 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.649
 to watch from guybrush 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.000
 In modern adventures we can travel 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.969
 after all, mostly by one 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.009
 Double click on the exit to abbreviate the 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.720
 Cave would not be a Ron Gilbert game 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.430
 if it's not full of weird ideas 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.470
 would be an enthralling 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.569
 franchise like monkey island owns 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.220
 The game was not focused on it 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.470
 be content with little stories 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.230
 At the beginning we choose black humor 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.599
 each character 3 knight monk 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.220
 adventurer time traveler hillbilly the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.930
 Gemini and the scientist 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.030
 each have a special reason 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.160
 why you visit the cave and one 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.050
 gloomy prehistory in the course of 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.390
 gradually revealed 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.920
 none of these figures says during the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.780
 gameplay but only one word 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.310
 or is the bean interested in the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.129
 Pity traveling 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.110
 There was potential for funny dialogues here 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.819
 just give away the npcs bribe 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.099
 With wortwitz, above all, it will 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.870
 happened almost nonstop cave from which the 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.790
 her own consciousness is up 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.620
 extremely entertaining and cynical wise 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.330
 comments on what makes up for a lot 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.330
 but only in English 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.180
 In total, this is the result of a combination with 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.250
 the dense graphic style a dense 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.080
 atmosphere if we are the ridiculously big 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.000
 Cave explore the full secrets 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.980
 and, among other things, a lock 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.620
 a year market and a rocket base 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.480
 unfortunately we can live in one 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.590
 do not pass the whole cave 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.409
 visit at once 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.909
 the special abilities of the characters 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.920
 each allow access to one 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.720
 specific area in the cave of us 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.060
 without this game figure is denied 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.860
 For example, the hillbilly is missing 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.360
 we do not enter the fair and 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.319
 just travel on to the next one 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.870
 section of the cave 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.220
 So you have to watch everything from the cave 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.140
 the game at least three times 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.370
 be played through and per pass 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.599
 It should take about five hours 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.400
 estimate 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.900
 but ours does not close 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.700
 why the player is not free between 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.890
 can change all seven characters 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.370
 And everything goes well with a passage 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.140
 experience 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.610
 because the multiple by jumping the 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.709
 cave brings in any case already 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.510
 known and therefore boring passages 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.489
 finally have the 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.139
 Developers still have a local co-op mode 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.040
 but it integrates us for lack of 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.720
 splitscreen seems a little unnecessary 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.009
 Overall, Ron Gilbert has the cave 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.810
 a very pretty and funny 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.280
 delivered an atmospheric adventure 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.470
 but that's a lot of potential 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.030
 gives away the short playing time leaves 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.040
 thanks to the small price of around 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.860
 13 euros easy to get over 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.960
 the pc games still has at the time of the test 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.940
 no pc version had been available and 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.330
 Therefore forgives purely for the xbox 360 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.400
 version 79 percent will be a pc rating 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.380
 the next few days will follow 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.960
 games aktuell also awards only for 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.470
 the xbox 360 version 8 out of 10 possible 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.470
 points
