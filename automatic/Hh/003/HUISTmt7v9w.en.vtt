00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
we've tried to do that all year after a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.670 
we've tried to do that all year after a
tough<00:00:11.040> game<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:12.590> get<00:00:13.590> out<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:14.480> I<00:00:15.680> think

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
tough game and get out of here I think

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.170 
tough game and get out of here I think
it's<00:00:17.039> important<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.670> good<00:00:17.820> trait<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.060> have

it's important it's a good trait to have

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.540 
it's important it's a good trait to have

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
as a team and I thought we did a good

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.439 
as a team and I thought we did a good
job<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.789> bouncing<00:00:21.180> back<00:00:21.210> there<00:00:23.000> did<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.119> did<00:00:24.420> it

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
help when when Matt fought early on did

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.900 
help when when Matt fought early on did
that<00:00:28.109> kind<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.500> let<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.710> air<00:00:28.949> out<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.490> you

it's going to be different guise of

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.960

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
I think from from experience that that's
why<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.450> from<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
why it's going to be from here on in and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.789 
why it's going to be from here on in and
with<00:01:25.979> tight<00:01:26.189> games<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.470> no<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.650> going

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
with tight games like that no it's going

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
with tight games like that no it's going
to<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> different<00:01:29.970> guy<00:01:30.060> every<00:01:30.090> night<00:01:30.270> feel

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.420 
but you know again last night he was
solid<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.680> was<00:01:44.369> nice<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.700> him<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.939> get<00:01:45.060> that

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
solid and was nice for him to get that

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.520 
solid and was nice for him to get that
no<00:01:47.120> it's<00:01:47.330> always<00:01:47.540> nice<00:01:47.720> reward<00:01:48.080> for<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.320> goalie

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
no it's always nice reward for a goalie

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.040 
no it's always nice reward for a goalie
and<00:01:48.800> you<00:01:49.040> know<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.160> thought<00:01:49.690> even<00:01:50.690> all<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.900> guys

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
and you know I thought even all the guys

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.870 
and you know I thought even all the guys
were<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.860> know<00:01:51.890> really<00:01:52.130> going<00:01:52.460> hard<00:01:52.490> even

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
were you know really going hard even

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.970 
were you know really going hard even
late<00:01:53.450> in<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.630> game<00:01:53.780> when<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:54.680> know<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.860> got

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
late in the game when you know you got

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.960 
late in the game when you know you got
by<00:01:55.130> three<00:01:55.370> goals<00:01:55.550> you<00:01:55.730> don't<00:01:55.880> necessarily

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
by three goals you don't necessarily

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.670 
by three goals you don't necessarily
have<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.360> block<00:01:56.630> shots<00:01:56.660> or<00:01:57.140> make<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.620> know

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
have to block shots or make you know

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.160 
have to block shots or make you know
make<00:01:57.890> those<00:01:58.130> little<00:01:58.880> plays<00:01:59.600> but<00:01:59.870> guys<00:02:00.140> are

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
make those little plays but guys are

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.170 
make those little plays but guys are
really<00:02:00.410> going<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:01.250> little<00:02:01.490> bit<00:02:01.640> harder<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.060> get

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
really going a little bit harder to get

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:11.470 
really going a little bit harder to get
him<00:02:02.300> at<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:02.720> it's<00:02:03.290> fun<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.950> have<00:02:04.040> that<00:02:09.190> um<00:02:10.480> where

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
him at so it's fun to have that um where

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.020 
him at so it's fun to have that um where
I<00:02:11.800> think<00:02:12.800> we're<00:02:12.950> doing<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.490> lot<00:02:13.580> better<00:02:13.640> job

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
I think we're doing a lot better job

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.660 
I think we're doing a lot better job
being<00:02:14.810> more<00:02:15.050> consistent<00:02:15.380> but<00:02:15.740> I<00:02:16.190> think<00:02:16.490> that's

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
being more consistent but I think that's

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.620 
being more consistent but I think that's
the<00:02:16.790> big<00:02:16.940> part<00:02:17.209> is<00:02:17.330> being<00:02:17.570> consistent<00:02:19.630> that's

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
the big part is being consistent that's

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.290 
the big part is being consistent that's
you<00:02:21.050> know<00:02:21.110> that's<00:02:21.170> always<00:02:21.620> i<00:02:21.770> think<00:02:22.300> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
you know that's always i think the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.600 
you know that's always i think the
battlefront<00:02:23.870> team<00:02:24.140> but<00:02:24.380> for<00:02:24.590> us<00:02:24.739> i<00:02:24.890> think<00:02:25.160> you

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
battlefront team but for us i think you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.160 
battlefront team but for us i think you
know<00:02:25.640> that's<00:02:25.910> gonna<00:02:26.180> be<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.510> biggest<00:02:26.720> test<00:02:27.050> is

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
know that's gonna be the biggest test is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.479 
know that's gonna be the biggest test is
being<00:02:27.380> consistent<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.010> know<00:02:28.100> what<00:02:28.220> our<00:02:28.250> game

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
being consistent we know what our game

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:29.920 
being consistent we know what our game
looks<00:02:28.760> like<00:02:28.970> everyone<00:02:29.420> knows<00:02:29.570> what<00:02:29.720> they<00:02:29.840> have

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
looks like everyone knows what they have

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:41.830 
looks like everyone knows what they have
to<00:02:30.080> do<00:02:30.200> i<00:02:30.380> think<00:02:30.560> it's<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.739> matter<00:02:31.010> being<00:02:40.840> yeah

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
to do i think it's a matter being yeah

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.110 
to do i think it's a matter being yeah
well<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.440> know<00:02:42.470> what<00:02:42.680> were<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.520> know<00:02:43.640> down
