00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.370 
sparkling water or something I like that
a<00:01:31.780> lot

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
a lot

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.490 
a lot
with<00:01:32.530> so<00:01:33.100> many<00:01:33.490> health<00:01:33.790> benefits<00:01:34.360> so<00:01:34.810> great<00:01:35.020> so

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
with so many health benefits so great so

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.980 
with so many health benefits so great so
there<00:01:35.650> was<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.770> recent<00:01:36.040> study<00:01:36.400> with<00:01:36.990> 710

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
there was a recent study with 710

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.560 
there was a recent study with 710
college<00:01:38.380> kid<00:01:38.619> with<00:01:39.130> anxiety<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.030> they

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
college kid with anxiety and they

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.480 
college kid with anxiety and they
started<00:01:40.960> following<00:01:41.170> their<00:01:41.650> exercise<00:01:42.100> habits

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
started following their exercise habits

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.310 
started following their exercise habits
and<00:01:42.700> their<00:01:42.820> food<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.479> then<00:01:43.869> giving<00:01:44.200> them

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
and their food and then giving them

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.770 
and their food and then giving them
fermented<00:01:44.979> foods<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:46.210> conclusion<00:01:46.720> of

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
fermented foods and the conclusion of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.359 
fermented foods and the conclusion of
the<00:01:46.900> study<00:01:47.110> is<00:01:47.439> that<00:01:47.500> their<00:01:47.920> moods<00:01:48.189> were

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
the study is that their moods were

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.460 
the study is that their moods were
better<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.909> their<00:01:49.270> anxiety<00:01:49.840> was<00:01:50.020> infinitely

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
better and their anxiety was infinitely

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.140 
better and their anxiety was infinitely
better<00:01:50.710> after<00:01:51.130> regularly<00:01:51.610> consuming

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
better after regularly consuming

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.929 
better after regularly consuming
fermented<00:01:52.600> foods<00:01:52.950> because<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.340> helps<00:01:54.790> with

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
fermented foods because it helps with

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.609 
fermented foods because it helps with
the<00:01:55.060> neurotransmitter<00:01:55.840> production<00:01:56.049> in<00:01:56.530> the

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
the neurotransmitter production in the

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.130 
the neurotransmitter production in the
brain<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.790> all<00:01:58.060> begins<00:01:58.479> in<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.750> gut<00:01:58.960> we

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
brain so it all begins in the gut we

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.359 
brain so it all begins in the gut we
talked<00:01:59.350> about<00:01:59.500> that<00:01:59.770> on<00:01:59.890> the<00:01:59.979> show<00:02:00.130> all<00:02:00.340> the

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
talked about that on the show all the

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.940 
talked about that on the show all the
time<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:01.119> know<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.390> gut<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:02.350> connected<00:02:02.829> to

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
time you know the gut is connected to

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.590 
time you know the gut is connected to
the<00:02:03.070> brain<00:02:03.280> infinitely<00:02:04.030> we<00:02:04.210> keep<00:02:04.390> thinking

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
the brain infinitely we keep thinking

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.420 
the brain infinitely we keep thinking
well<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.140> know

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
well you know

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.800 
well you know
Coffee<00:02:05.640> will<00:02:05.880> do<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.150> trick<00:02:06.300> and<00:02:06.690> then

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
Coffee will do the trick and then

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.389 
Coffee will do the trick and then
sometimes<00:02:07.320> you've<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.560> overdone<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.280> and

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
sometimes you've just overdone it and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.620 
sometimes you've just overdone it and
then<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.789> got<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> send<00:02:09.179> yourself<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.600> other

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
then you got to send yourself the other

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.600 
then you got to send yourself the other
direction<00:02:10.050> at<00:02:10.259> some<00:02:10.410> point<00:02:10.679> right<00:02:10.830> especially

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
direction at some point right especially

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.520

one teaspoon a day you don't have to go

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.030 
one teaspoon a day you don't have to go
crazy<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.850> then<00:03:54.209> here<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.829> sheep's<00:03:55.829> milk
