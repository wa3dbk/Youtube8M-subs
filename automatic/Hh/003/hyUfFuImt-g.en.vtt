00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
that I wear a lot and then I absolutely

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.650 
that I wear a lot and then I absolutely
love<00:00:19.860> what<00:00:20.610> I<00:00:20.640> like<00:00:20.880> about<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.150> formula<00:00:21.510> it's

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
love what I like about this formula it's

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.240 
love what I like about this formula it's
almost<00:00:21.840> bomb<00:00:22.140> like<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.590> like<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.770> smooth

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
almost bomb like it's like a smooth

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.090 
almost bomb like it's like a smooth
creamy<00:00:25.970> glossy<00:00:27.440> lipstick<00:00:28.440> that<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.830> glides

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
creamy glossy lipstick that just glides

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.820 
creamy glossy lipstick that just glides
on<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.610> a<00:00:29.670> lot<00:00:29.820> less<00:00:30.000> heavy<00:00:30.360> than<00:00:30.780> kind<00:00:31.770> of

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
on it's a lot less heavy than kind of

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.010 
on it's a lot less heavy than kind of
when<00:00:32.129> I<00:00:32.160> think<00:00:32.430> lipstick<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.539> I<00:00:33.570> think<00:00:33.840> of

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
when I think lipstick what I think of

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.990 
when I think lipstick what I think of
but<00:00:34.260> even<00:00:34.530> though<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.770> kind<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.579> feels<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
but even though it kind of feels like a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.610 
but even though it kind of feels like a
bomb<00:00:36.210> when<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.420> put<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.050> has<00:00:37.200> more<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.560> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
bomb when you put it on it has more of a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
bomb when you put it on it has more of a
stability<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.280> lipstick<00:00:38.640> there<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.570> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
stability of lipstick there is a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.040 
stability of lipstick there is a
trade-off

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
trade-off

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.950 
trade-off
I<00:00:40.200> found<00:00:40.500> between<00:00:40.910> formulas<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:42.600> kind

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
I found between formulas that are kind

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.870 
I found between formulas that are kind
of<00:00:42.989> light<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.260> glossy<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.070> really<00:00:44.460> super

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
of light and glossy and really super

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.600 
of light and glossy and really super
natural<00:00:45.270> looking<00:00:45.540> and<00:00:46.100> don't<00:00:47.100> last<00:00:47.340> quite<00:00:47.489> as

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
natural looking and don't last quite as

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.450 
natural looking and don't last quite as
long<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.060> then<00:00:48.300> kind<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.720> heavier<00:00:49.460> lipsticks

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
long and then kind of heavier lipsticks

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
long and then kind of heavier lipsticks
that<00:00:50.670> really<00:00:51.210> last<00:00:51.450> but<00:00:51.870> maybe<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:53.010> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
that really last but maybe have more of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.479 
that really last but maybe have more of
a<00:00:53.160> lipstick<00:00:53.550> feel<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> them<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.489> this

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
a lipstick feel and look to them so this

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.889 
a lipstick feel and look to them so this
kind<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.850> goes<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:58.610> less<00:00:59.610> length<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.660> wear

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
kind of goes in the less length for wear

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.990 
kind of goes in the less length for wear
but<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.130> it<00:01:02.160> looks<00:01:02.610> while<00:01:02.820> it's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
but I just like how it looks while it's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.859 
but I just like how it looks while it's
on<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.079> great<00:01:04.320> color<00:01:04.530> payoff<00:01:05.869> really

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
on and of that great color payoff really

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.490 
on and of that great color payoff really
glossy<00:01:07.259> finish<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.420> just<00:01:09.420> very<00:01:09.990> flattering

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
glossy finish and just very flattering

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.890 
glossy finish and just very flattering
but<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.400> bit<00:01:11.520> more<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:12.299> sure<00:01:12.630> exactly

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
but a little bit more not sure exactly

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.230 
but a little bit more not sure exactly
cuz<00:01:13.170> they're<00:01:13.290> good<00:01:13.979> coverage<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:15.060> they're<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
cuz they're good coverage but they're a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.399 
cuz they're good coverage but they're a
lighter<00:01:15.630> formula<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:18.170> according<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> the
