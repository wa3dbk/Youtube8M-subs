00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.140
 hi everyone is welcome on and 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.990
 that it is so today I am you 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.699
 find for a video that is not that 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.169
 I have a lot of subscribers who would come 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.529
 see me on my channel for media 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:30.439
 I have a pony devos connemara by 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.969
 example the island and boots I do not know 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.770
 how much to feed him 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.360
 so here we are with this video 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.890
 I hope I see in enlightening 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.710
 some for humans in general 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.720
 calculate our food intake in 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.060
 calories so for horses there are 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.210
 another measure called ufc so 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.850
 cellulite and fodder even c ++ on 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.640
 everything she means it's so there 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.450
 For example, a kilo of barley is 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:04.339
 equal to 1 901 kilos of hay according to its 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.860
 quality equals 0.2 to 0.5 cfu 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.100
 and who still launder and false according to 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.439
 its quality is between 0.12 and 0.18 us 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.030
 and and who have oats it's about 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:20.539
 equal to 0.85 lc or a kilo of carrots 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.159
 is zero at the knee is enough so 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.109
 it does not seem like that but 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.840
 in addition to the assault ration and 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:30.889
 legs clips toys or clear it 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.539
 begins to feel and finally 1 kg of 

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.549
 straw because yes our horses eat 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.439
 also the flaw that we mixed with them in 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.010
 litter that's why horses 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:47.060
 who are on chips or on linen etc 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:50.640
 a little more forage in general 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.730
 so a payet shot of the gun at 0 0 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.400
 17th when you transfer all this is good 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.940
 nice but what are we doing 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.020
 help 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.270
 now I will give you a kind 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.140
 list of weights and needs 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.560
 of future civil servants 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.820
 cold so poincheval barÃ§a got more 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.620
 imposed here it is a horse to degrade 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.530
 So here they are, not a little horse 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:23.250
 300 kg ends it needs approximately 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.970
 of 3 us per day from 350 kg its 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:31.470
 third three toilets for 81 kg these 3 27 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.650
 June these 507 84 us c is from 600 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.010
 kg so here it starts to be buffered 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.560
 it's five classics a day finally 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.620
 to regulate the transit of hot water 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.230
 also need more 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.420
 like the barley of the buy in of the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.760
 good thing you can give them 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.500
 example less dry matter that the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.040
 helps maintain good mental hygiene 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.019
 because they want this guy 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.489
 no horse face in in 16 hours to 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.500
 to eat a day is therefore a forgiveness of 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.470
 the dry matter so all that is 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.180
 forage hay and straw in addition 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.659
 that fabrice acquired the most energy 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.730
 so a horse needs a day in 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.510
 function of his sex race and his 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:22.379
 state of work needs them from between 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:26.730
 zero 2.5 and 1.5 kg twice a day 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:30.000
 all slices weighing 100 kg 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.400
 bright or horse gold horse takes 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.920
 100 kg more he needs a 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.420
 so-called basin of 500 grams two 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.150
 once again under kilos dry according 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.760
 are detailed working so as a 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.650
 example horse riding my 500 kg which is 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.650
 with light work 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.769
 once in a while who tells us 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.099
 provides no rose and form 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.889
 daily 10 we need 3 kg 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.930
 hay daily 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.340
 so that's after it's up to you to 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.719
 compliment with either complements 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.019
 and that's where you can see them 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:06.030
 video of the hills disappointed here it is in 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.450
 the more I shake what has anyway 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.150
 better 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.349
 complimented with grass because 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.379
 that's the best for our 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:17.070
 chances and what allowed them to be here 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:19.169
 you eat a long time is that it makes 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.019
 good to hold the limoges season of the 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.800
 bad to see now I started m 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.310
 with a passion twice a day so 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.630
 here 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.449
 that's all for me then there is still 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.800
 other units that I did not talk about 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.889
 simply because I'm not 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.180
 really stalled it's the work 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.819
 I have preferred or speak about what I 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.650
 know for no mistake so if 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.240
 you want to know more about all 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.530
 these other companies like for example 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.300
 his face- offs there yesterday Jerome etc 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.099

 a lot of gray protests by a 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.539
 Lead is precisely energy values 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.539
 heat 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.689
