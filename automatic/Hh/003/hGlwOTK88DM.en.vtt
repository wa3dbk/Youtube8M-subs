00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
that one button only takes a split

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.200 
that one button only takes a split
second<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.280> helps<00:02:26.490> us<00:02:26.580> all<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.820> time<00:02:26.970> you

know yet every time I put out a video I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.630 
know yet every time I put out a video I
hope<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.740> nature<00:02:31.860> where<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.370> like

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
hope it is of the nature where it's like

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.130 
hope it is of the nature where it's like
if<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.910> never<00:02:33.120> saw<00:02:33.390> any<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.660> my<00:02:33.810> videos<00:02:33.840> before

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
if you never saw any of my videos before

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.660 
if you never saw any of my videos before
it<00:02:34.650> would<00:02:34.770> make<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.040> want<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.250> subscribe<00:02:35.460> like

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
it would make you want to subscribe like

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.730 
it would make you want to subscribe like
that's<00:02:36.000> what<00:02:36.180> I'm<00:02:36.270> going<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.590> don't

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
that's what I'm going for and I don't

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.110 
that's what I'm going for and I don't
think<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.920> hit<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.250> every<00:02:38.370> time<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:38.940> that's

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
think I hit it every time but that's

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.540 
think I hit it every time but that's
what<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.420> aim<00:02:39.630> for<00:02:39.660> every<00:02:40.140> single<00:02:40.410> time<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.770> and

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
what I aim for every single time and and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.100 
what I aim for every single time and and
that<00:02:41.700> means<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.360> know<00:02:42.480> things<00:02:42.930> aren't

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
that means that you know things aren't

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.600 
that means that you know things aren't
