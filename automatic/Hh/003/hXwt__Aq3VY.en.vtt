if<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.210> were<00:02:28.300> picking<00:02:28.480> every<00:02:28.840> day<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.920> can

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
if you were picking every day you can

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.430 
if you were picking every day you can
see<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.660> range<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:31.990> somewhere<00:02:32.290> around

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
see that the range is somewhere around

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.620 
see that the range is somewhere around
21<00:02:33.070> there's<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.460> second<00:02:33.820> if<00:02:34.210> I<00:02:34.300> were<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.510> make

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
21 there's a second if I were to make

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.380 
21 there's a second if I were to make
this<00:02:34.780> click<00:02:35.110> go<00:02:35.260> slower

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
this click go slower

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.940 
this click go slower
well<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.510> needle<00:02:37.780> now<00:02:37.930> reflects<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.680> slower

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
well the needle now reflects the slower

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.360 
well the needle now reflects the slower
pick<00:02:39.300> clicking<00:02:40.300> speed<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:41.170> say<00:02:41.530> 13<00:02:42.010> there's<00:02:42.250> a

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
pick clicking speed of say 13 there's a

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.490 
pick clicking speed of say 13 there's a
second<00:02:42.760> which<00:02:43.420> would<00:02:43.570> also<00:02:43.720> be<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:44.020> goal<00:02:44.290> for

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
second which would also be a goal for

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.840 
second which would also be a goal for
many<00:02:44.650> players<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.800> lower<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.190> click<00:02:48.400> goes<00:02:48.640> of

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
many players the lower the click goes of

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.750 
many players the lower the click goes of
course<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.330> lower<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.660> needle<00:02:49.900> will<00:02:50.020> go

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
course the lower of the needle will go

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.030 
course the lower of the needle will go
now<00:02:51.760> if<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.090> were<00:02:52.210> to<00:02:52.300> change<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.800> meter

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
now if I were to change the the meter

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.770 
now if I were to change the the meter
range<00:02:54.280> switch<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.850> will<00:02:54.940> see<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.210> meter<00:02:55.390> jump

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
range switch you will see the meter jump

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.770 
range switch you will see the meter jump
up<00:02:57.900> because<00:02:58.900> now<00:02:59.880> we<00:03:00.880> are<00:03:00.970> in<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.150> top<00:03:01.330> numbers

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
up because now we are in the top numbers

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.960 
up because now we are in the top numbers
so<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:02.140> can<00:03:02.320> sort<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.590> zoom<00:03:02.860> in<00:03:03.040> on<00:03:03.220> on<00:03:03.730> what's

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
so you can sort of zoom in on on what's

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.390 
so you can sort of zoom in on on what's
going<00:03:04.240> on<00:03:04.390> but<00:03:05.020> still<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.320> course<00:03:05.560> as<00:03:05.800> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
going on but still of course as the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.430 
going on but still of course as the
click<00:03:06.610> gets<00:03:06.820> faster<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.750> needle<00:03:07.990> gets<00:03:08.260> higher

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
click gets faster the needle gets higher

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.670 
click gets faster the needle gets higher
and<00:03:09.180> as<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.300> gets<00:03:10.420> slower<00:03:10.750> then<00:03:11.260> it'll<00:03:11.470> get

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
and as it gets slower then it'll get

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.130
