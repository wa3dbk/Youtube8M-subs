the new camera to be the u.s. 700d to be

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.000 
the new camera to be the u.s. 700d to be
a<00:00:35.070> beginner<00:00:35.550> camera<00:00:36.120> even<00:00:37.050> though<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.770> got

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
a beginner camera even though it's got

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.510 
a beginner camera even though it's got
an<00:00:38.160> 18<00:00:38.850> megapixel<00:00:39.410> sensor<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.590> same<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:41.309> pretty

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
an 18 megapixel sensor as same as pretty

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.430 
an 18 megapixel sensor as same as pretty
much<00:00:41.640> everything<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.270> I've<00:00:42.570> been<00:00:42.899> using<00:00:42.960> in

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
much everything that I've been using in

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.840 
much everything that I've been using in
the<00:00:43.680> Canon<00:00:44.550> 550d<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.739> saw<00:00:47.160> goes<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.550> goes<00:00:47.760> up

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the Canon 550d I I saw goes up goes up

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.380 
the Canon 550d I I saw goes up goes up
to<00:00:48.140> 12,000<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:50.250> got<00:00:50.370> cool<00:00:50.610> variable

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
to 12,000 and it's got cool variable

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.310 
to 12,000 and it's got cool variable
screen<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> back<00:00:52.550> however<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:54.140> me<00:00:55.140> it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
screen on the back however for me it

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.939 
screen on the back however for me it
just<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.949> seems<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:57.680> nothing's<00:00:58.680> really

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
just really seems like nothing's really

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.619 
just really seems like nothing's really
changed<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.789> think<00:01:00.059> they've<00:01:00.210> done<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> little

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
changed I think they've done a little

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.729 
changed I think they've done a little
bit<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.520> let's<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:02.940> actually<00:01:03.739> no

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
bit of the let's see if it's actually no

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.960 
bit of the let's see if it's actually no
it's<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.159> really<00:01:05.309> giving<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.670> anything

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
it's not really giving you anything

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.850 
it's not really giving you anything
pretty<00:01:06.420> much<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.659> these<00:01:07.170> features<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
pretty much all these features are the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.010 
pretty much all these features are the
same<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.159> all<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> cameras<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.119> there's

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
same in all the cameras and there's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.289 
same in all the cameras and there's
there's<00:01:10.650> loss<00:01:10.979> confusion<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.119> should

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
there's loss confusion but what I should

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.050 
there's loss confusion but what I should
come<00:01:12.450> out<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.229> EOS<00:01:13.890> kiss<00:01:14.340> x7<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
is it eos 700d very confusing different

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.740 
is it eos 700d very confusing different
names<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.820> different<00:01:26.880> countries<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.509> don't

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
names in different countries I don't

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.319 
names in different countries I don't
know<00:01:27.840> why<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.409> doing<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:30.000> me<00:01:30.090> what

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
know why it's doing that but for me what

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.560 
know why it's doing that but for me what
is<00:01:30.479> looking<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.990> pretty<00:01:31.409> much<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.680> same

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
is looking like is pretty much the same

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.249 
is looking like is pretty much the same
sensor<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> 550d<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.640> 500d<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> 500

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
sensor as in the 550d the 500d was a 500

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.770 
sensor as in the 550d the 500d was a 500
es<00:01:37.380> no<00:01:37.619> 550d<00:01:38.430> 600d<00:01:39.860> 650d<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.130> now<00:01:41.579> add<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.509> as

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
es no 550d 600d 650d and now add this as

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.649 
es no 550d 600d 650d and now add this as
well<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.250> kept<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.390> bringing

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
well so it's like the kept on bringing

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.020 
well so it's like the kept on bringing
out<00:01:45.869> new<00:01:45.930> cameras<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:47.130> exactly<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> same

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
out new cameras of exactly the same

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.380 
out new cameras of exactly the same
sensors<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:49.259> tiny<00:01:49.740> little<00:01:50.270> additions<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
sensors with tiny little additions to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.219 
sensors with tiny little additions to
the<00:01:51.840> either<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> auto<00:01:52.619> focusing<00:01:53.270> how<00:01:54.270> fast<00:01:54.930> it

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
the either the auto focusing how fast it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.889 
the either the auto focusing how fast it
processes<00:01:55.920> stuff<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.320> powerful<00:01:58.320> digit

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
processes stuff like the powerful digit

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.499 
processes stuff like the powerful digit

filters<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.399> pretty<00:02:05.610> much<00:02:05.700> playing

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
filters to it I just pretty much playing

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.479 
filters to it I just pretty much playing
around<00:02:06.210> with<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.810> firmware<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.890> what<00:02:08.459> I

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
around with the firmware in it so what I

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.969 
around with the firmware in it so what I
will<00:02:08.580> say<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.149> if<00:02:09.479> you're<00:02:09.599> one

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
will say is that if you're one

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.660 
will say is that if you're one
a camera<00:02:10.459> that<00:02:10.489> can<00:02:10.819> give<00:02:11.120> as<00:02:11.390> equally<00:02:12.110> good

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
a camera that can give as equally good

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.210 
a camera that can give as equally good
image<00:02:13.670> quality<00:02:13.840> yep<00:02:14.840> get<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.379> 550d<00:02:15.920> is

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
image quality yep get the 550d is

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.009 
image quality yep get the 550d is
probably<00:02:16.489> going<00:02:16.640> for<00:02:16.940> about<00:02:17.090> half<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.870> price

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
probably going for about half the price

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.210 
probably going for about half the price
