from arcview now in the event that you
don't<00:00:15.480> know<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> USB<00:00:16.619> display<00:00:17.100> adapter

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
don't know what a USB display adapter

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.640 
don't know what a USB display adapter
does<00:00:17.910> basically<00:00:18.270> what<00:00:18.600> that's<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.810> do<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.109> turn

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
does basically what that's to do is turn

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.130 
does basically what that's to do is turn
your<00:00:19.859> USB<00:00:20.279> port<00:00:20.609> into<00:00:21.090> an<00:00:21.270> extra<00:00:21.570> monitor<00:00:21.689> port

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
your USB port into an extra monitor port

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.560 
your USB port into an extra monitor port
so<00:00:22.800> basically<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.369> plug<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.240> USB<00:00:24.269> cable

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
so basically you plug in the USB cable

so basically you plug in the USB cable
is<00:00:24.869> your<00:00:24.960> computer<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.439> plug<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> other<00:00:25.859> end

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
is your computer you plug the other end

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.029 
is your computer you plug the other end
to<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.820> back<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.539> then<00:00:27.689> over<00:00:27.960> here

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
will also work on this unit so keep that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.370 
will also work on this unit so keep that
in<00:01:14.430> mind<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.970> will<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> full<00:01:15.689> 32<00:01:16.110> bits<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
in mind it will do a full 32 bits of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.249 
in mind it will do a full 32 bits of
color<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:17.220> 1680<00:01:17.729> x<00:01:17.880> 1050<00:01:18.270> everything<00:01:18.900> else<00:01:19.049> has

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
color at 1680 x 1050 everything else has

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.530 
color at 1680 x 1050 everything else has
got<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.500> 16<00:01:19.920> x<00:01:20.070> 12<00:01:20.369> or<00:01:20.549> smaller<00:01:21.150> for<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
got to be 16 x 12 or smaller for it to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.929 
got to be 16 x 12 or smaller for it to
work<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.439> basically<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:23.130> very<00:01:23.700> very

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
work but that's basically a very very

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.850 
work but that's basically a very very
large<00:01:24.119> percentage<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.570> mostly<00:01:24.869> monitors<00:01:25.350> on

graphs<00:01:34.740> they<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.520> these<00:01:35.640> graphs<00:01:35.909> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
graphs they have all these graphs and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.370 
graphs they have all these graphs and
they<00:01:36.150> need<00:01:36.299> molten<00:01:36.600> waters<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.020> need<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> see

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
they need molten waters to need to see

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.960 
they need molten waters to need to see
each<00:01:37.560> different<00:01:37.890> graph<00:01:38.159> at<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> same<00:01:38.700> time

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
each different graph at the same time

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.670 
each different graph at the same time
and<00:01:39.210> needs<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.570> live<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.170> they<00:01:40.259> usually<00:01:40.380> set

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and needs to be live so they usually set
