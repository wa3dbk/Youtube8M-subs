favorite<00:00:41.340> guy<00:00:41.489> i<00:00:41.520> believe<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.300> because<00:00:42.510> he

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
favorite guy i believe it was because he

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.459 
favorite guy i believe it was because he
carried<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.530> many<00:00:43.829> cans<00:00:44.510> but<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.989> some<00:00:46.170> reason

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
carried so many cans but for some reason

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.729 
carried so many cans but for some reason
in<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.649> game<00:00:46.890> they<00:00:47.100> nerfed<00:00:47.430> him<00:00:48.620> least<00:00:49.620> i

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
in this game they nerfed him least i

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.069 
in this game they nerfed him least i
believe<00:00:50.070> from<00:00:50.789> my<00:00:51.300> knowledge<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.930> he

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
believe from my knowledge that he

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.529 
believe from my knowledge that he
doesn't<00:00:52.350> carry<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.649> much<00:00:52.800> cans<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:54.000> he<00:00:54.210> used<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
doesn't carry as much cans as he used to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.040 
doesn't carry as much cans as he used to
so<00:00:55.260> we're<00:00:55.379> gonna<00:00:55.469> use<00:00:55.649> garam<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.670> one<00:01:00.050> go
