00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
shadow above it so you can see yet that

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.499 
shadow above it so you can see yet that
one<00:02:06.689> just<00:02:06.929> like<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.489> so<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.729> draw<00:02:08.910> try

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
to line up this line right here then you

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.150 
to line up this line right here then you
should<00:02:14.519> do<00:02:14.610> all<00:02:14.730> their<00:02:14.880> ear<00:02:15.950> phones<00:02:16.950> off<00:02:17.130> the
