00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.980
 hello friends welcome back to 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.880
 world today we are going to discuss some of the 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.849
 great mysteries of nature 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.310
 the deep blue hole this huge 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.430
 hole suddenly sinks into the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.529
 ocean when looking at it from the air its dense 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.119
 blue color denotes the presence of a 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.510
 great depth and darkness 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.280
 impenetrable especially in contrast to 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.809
 the water around you 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.360
 those divers who have ventured 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.730
 tens of meters in it have verified 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 that at those depths is scarce 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.290
 seriously the oxygen level and that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.949
 besides there is hardly life because of the lack 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.439
 of marine current despite that the 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.229
 place presents a very high interest 

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:57.030
 scientist since so far 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.269
 They have discovered dozens inside 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.129
 of fossils from a remote ancient east 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.549
 huge hole is in the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 Bahamas Felix in the mom is the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.380
 blue woman of greater depth about 400 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.560
 meters east of Belize has about 123 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.560
 meters 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.720
 stones that move alone 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.780
 in the well-known valley of death in 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.940
 us fifth a singular phenomenon is 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.440
 it's about the stones that appear to float 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.190
 over a vacant desert 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.740
 at some point he was a fan for decades 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.270
 Scientists have theorized 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.820
 plausible explanations about this 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.190
 anomaly where a stone of several 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.250
 kilos of weight is able to move 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.680
 several hundred meters on its own 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.380
 many believe that this movement should be 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.750
 to the strong wind but that does not explain that 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.550
 stones of different sizes and weights are 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.350
 move at a parallel pace and in 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.080
 different directions 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.590
 besides the physical calculations either 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.360
 support this theory because for some 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.429
 stones move you do not need 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.010
 speed movement from superrichs to 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.880
 hundreds of kilometers per hour the wind 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:20.060
 can move small stones but like 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.180
 moves some of several tens of kilos 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.340
 and the third and last great mystery of the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:33.260
 nature are the magmatic clouds the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.090
 mastodÃ³nticas oman matus clouds are a 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.739
 of the most curious formations and 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.890
 spectacular that can be found 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.110
 in the sky consists of a set of 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.360
 globules that are hanging from the part 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.239
 bottom of a storm cloud 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.519
 its formation occurs as a result 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.930
 of a process that I could write 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.610
 as a convention in the opposite direction 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.250
 during the storm in the currents of 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.030
 humid air rises to the limit of 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.069
 the troposphere at that level the descent 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.370
 of temperature is interrupted and the 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.860
 stabilized air that causes the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.090
 ascending cloud setmana horizontally 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.390
 the coolest air zone without clouds and 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.170
 good solid weak friends here ended 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.489
 this video 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.489
 I hope you liked it
