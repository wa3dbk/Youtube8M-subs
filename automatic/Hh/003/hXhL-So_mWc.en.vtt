00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:09.420
 the pool used for this video is 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:12.190
 the ultra facebook of 4.9 by 1.2 meters 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.470
 Your pool may vary slightly in 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.470
 The number of pieces of assembly depends 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.869
 of size check that you have all the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.849
 pieces listed in the manual do not start 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.740
 to assemble the pool if parts are missing 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.029
 call the consumer service of 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.939
 interest to receive the pieces 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.800
 missing it is very important that you place 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.150
 the pool on a flat surface 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.670
 to balance the water level 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.550
 the pool may not be stable if it 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.440
 tilt to one side make sure it is 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.070
 within reach of the hose and a 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.170
 outlet is type lcd or gfs and before 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.660
 to start filling it never transport 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.320
 the pool with water does not put the pool 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.510
 directly against your house 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.760
 imagine the movement of people 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.920
 around the pool and prevent the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.680
 electric cable of the purifier do 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.620
 that someone stumbles on some communities 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.180
 require it to be a fenced site see 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.180
 with the authorities of your locality 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.340
 before unfolding the pool clearance 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.110
 well the area so there are no objects 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.230
 that could perforate the pool when 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.270
 be in use 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.580
 the canvases on the floor offer a 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.420
 additional protection and should be extended 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.640
 carefully to cover the entire area 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.060
 Now we are ready to assemble the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.060
 swimming pool 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.100
 unwind the pool liner over 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.480
 the canvas make sure it is the side 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.850
 Right 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.770
 do not drag the pool on the ground 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.659
 since it could cause leaks 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.450
 find the perforations for 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.250
 connect the filter make sure they remain 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.500
 in front of the area where the 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.090
 purifier and check again that 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.200
 is within reach of the outlet is 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.180
 type r 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.730
 CD 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.950
 allow the liner to warm up with the 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.230
 sun to facilitate insertion of the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.750
 tubes carefully open the box that 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.580
 contains the legs and tubes since the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.860
 You can use to save them during 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.990
 the winter you have to assemble all the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.840
 horizontal tubes and joints in the shape of 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.700
 letter t before fixing the legs is 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.890
 You can start from anywhere but 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.230
 always working in the same direction 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.440
 slide a tube into the sleeve with 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.690
 the flat side up 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.990
 center the tube between the holes of the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.930
 sleeve 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.570
 push one end of the tube onto one of 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.430
 shaped joints letter t until 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.680
 the spring pin comes out to fasten 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.830
 the tube continue with the assembly of 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.930
 rest of the tubes and joints 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.510
 the last connection may be a bit 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.610
 difficult for greater ease lift the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.920
 last board and tube a few how many 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.569
 centimeters and insert the tube to 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.999
 lower the frame to the ground 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.579
 put a plug on the bottom of 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:58.530
 each leg slide each leg inside the 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.290
 restriction rope of the force fund 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.079
 connect the top of each leg to 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.329
 a board in the form of letter t while 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.969
 that aligns the bolts with spring up 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.409
 that they enter the holes 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.180
 check that all legs are 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.459
 inside the belt and rope 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.709
