litter to hibernate well bats have very
interesting<00:00:48.340> Anatomy<00:00:49.000> as<00:00:49.149> well<00:00:49.420> if<00:00:49.989> you<00:00:50.200> look

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
interesting Anatomy as well if you look

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.200 
interesting Anatomy as well if you look
at<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.560> skeleton<00:00:51.130> of<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.310> bad<00:00:51.520> it<00:00:51.730> actually<00:00:51.850> looks

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
at a skeleton of a bad it actually looks

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.840 
at a skeleton of a bad it actually looks
a<00:00:52.300> lot<00:00:52.450> like<00:00:52.660> a<00:00:52.720> human<00:00:53.110> skeleton<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:54.489> wings

the wing look a lot like a human hand
the<00:01:00.190> digits<00:01:00.610> are<00:01:00.730> elongated<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.630> fill<00:01:01.840> out<00:01:02.020> the

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:05.469 
the wing membrane echolocation is a very

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.420 
the wing membrane echolocation is a very
sophisticated<00:01:05.850> form<00:01:06.850> of<00:01:07.180> communication<00:01:08.430> more

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
sophisticated form of communication more

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.340 
sophisticated form of communication more
sophisticated<00:01:10.240> than<00:01:10.390> anything<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:10.960> humans

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
sophisticated than anything that humans

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.870 
sophisticated than anything that humans
have<00:01:11.530> come<00:01:11.709> up<00:01:11.859> with<00:01:12.069> in<00:01:12.549> order<00:01:12.789> to

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
have come up with in order to

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.059 
have come up with in order to
communicate<00:01:13.060> with<00:01:13.569> each<00:01:13.600> other<00:01:14.069> echolocation

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:15.069 
communicate with each other echolocation

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.989 
communicate with each other echolocation
is<00:01:15.520> basically<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.119> sound<00:01:16.569> that<00:01:16.749> the<00:01:17.319> animal

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:17.999 
is basically a sound that the animal

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:21.059 
is basically a sound that the animal
submits<00:01:18.999> into<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.539> atmosphere<00:01:19.719> and<00:01:20.380> it

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
submits into the atmosphere and it

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.730 
submits into the atmosphere and it
bounces<00:01:21.459> off<00:01:21.639> of<00:01:21.670> objects<00:01:22.359> including<00:01:23.079> insects

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
bounces off of objects including insects

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.499 
bounces off of objects including insects
and<00:01:24.009> other<00:01:24.069> food<00:01:24.459> items<00:01:24.639> that<00:01:25.090> these<00:01:25.270> bats

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
and other food items that these bats

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.449 
and other food items that these bats
were<00:01:25.749> feed<00:01:26.020> off<00:01:26.170> that's<00:01:26.499> how<00:01:26.679> bats<00:01:26.950> can<00:01:27.219> fly

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:27.459 
were feed off that's how bats can fly

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:29.580 
were feed off that's how bats can fly
around<00:01:27.609> the<00:01:27.819> night<00:01:28.060> sky<00:01:28.479> without<00:01:29.020> being<00:01:29.469> able

these Fisher caves formed by weathering

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.370 
these Fisher caves formed by weathering
so<00:02:14.100> basically<00:02:14.520> water<00:02:14.910> over<00:02:15.330> time<00:02:15.570> creeps

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
so basically water over time creeps

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.440 
so basically water over time creeps
through<00:02:16.590> small<00:02:16.950> fractures<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.820> rock<00:02:17.940> and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
through small fractures in the rock and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.860 
through small fractures in the rock and
as<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.840> freezes<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.590> expands<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:21.420> widens

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
as it freezes and expands it widens

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.050 
as it freezes and expands it widens
these<00:02:22.080> these<00:02:22.740> small<00:02:23.100> fissures<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> rock

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
these these small fissures in the rock

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.199 
these these small fissures in the rock
and<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.350> form<00:02:25.680> ceilings<00:02:26.370> as<00:02:26.490> high<00:02:26.640> as<00:02:26.700> 50

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
and it can form ceilings as high as 50
