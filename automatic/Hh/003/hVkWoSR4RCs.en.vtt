00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.639
 now all say what the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.740
 welcome this new grand video 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.410
 theft auto 5 in this opportunity I 'm going 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.300
 to show how to get or how to steal the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.939
 Hercules aircraft from the military base 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.849
 this is the big plane that can 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.680
 transport things then first thing 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.290
 what we have to do is play with 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.060
 franklin or with trevor since you have to 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.100
 use their special ability 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.350
 we can 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.080
 great little time before being 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.010
 detected in the military base the first thing 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.560
 what we have to do is obviously 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.079
 quickly get on the plane and try to 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.030
 get on it as fast as possible 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.089
 lose me that the military do not kill them 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.120
 very fast since there are times that they are 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.309
 they have too much aim and they kill us 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.370
 too easy then we have to give 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.469
 reverse and try to get to one of the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.379
 clues since as if it's a very airplane 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.750
 big does not need enough pretty 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.339
 space to take off 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.320
 unlike the jet which is a bit more 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.649
 short the space that we are for 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.649
 take off 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.790
 here touch try to avoid the cars of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.000
 the military since they treat us 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.000
 blow up the plane 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.080
 I'm going to fly low so that the military 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:26.800
 so that the jet that is the military base 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.800
 do not shoot us and come out victorious 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.830
 Here I show when the normal 10 cups 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.260
 that 6 pay for what he was talking about 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.360
 quite down with a certain height 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:54.890
 to detect and try to shoot 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.320
 in case the fear that crashes 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.750
 good to damage the plane for some 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.460
 reason the best thing is to save a game 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.490
 already known in the air from the cell 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.380
 and reload so when he returns 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.610
 to load the game have him in the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.610
 totally new airplane 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.920
 then already here once they have 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.040
 stolen the plane now I'm going to teach you 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.700
 how to transport vehicles or how 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.780
 transport things a lot of people say that 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.120
 it's a 130 it 's now airplane 130 ago but 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.150
 it really is not a 630 the plane does 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.830
 130 is a vehicle is an attack aircraft 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.280
 unlike the latter which is a hercules 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.190
 which is a transport plane in the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.830
 game is called titan have both has 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.140
 some relationship with Hercules then I 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.720
 I'm more sure that it's a Hercules but 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.940
 a 630 and also as I tell you already 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.980
 we are going to like things were transported 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.660
 in this plane the first thing we have to 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.810
 to do is obviously have our 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.180
 our plane stopped at a site in 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.740
 where none is attacking not the police 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.080
 obviously we must have already lost the 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.640
 police to be calm and the only thing 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.890
 what we have to do is go to the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.630
 back in the back there is the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.430
 compartment in the secrets and we the 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.830
 entry of what you want to transport 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.720
 we have to give them a little bit a few 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.270
 blows let's say the first one does not come out 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.940
 to be able to open this behavior 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.970
 this is to open very little but we have 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.650
 have to go back to the plane and a few 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.320
 backward movements forward 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.810
 until the gate opens by 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.060
 complete or at least be now what 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.850
 enough to upload them in it and 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.330
 that and that in this way is aggravated by 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.330
 full 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.239
 already one time 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.030
 let's open the gate what 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.280
 we can do is look for vehicles in 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.819
 this case I go by any vehicle that 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.819
 area 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.410
 although we already have the vehicle then 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.510
 what we do is upload it for the part 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.510
 from behind the plane 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.900
 then to close the gate what 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.580
 we have to do is simply move 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.500
 the plane again went ahead towards 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.780
 back to try that the door is 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.989
 closes 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.020
 and once the gate is half 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.090
 closed we got off the plane and what 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.100
 we have to continue to treat it let's say 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.930
 that manually 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.520
 there is a trick to use it that stops 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.850
 close the door forgiveness that is pretty 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.860
 funny is to throw them against her for 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.880
 do this what we have that is is 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.370
 jump and on bus press the button 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.500
 today playstation presses the button 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.960
 circle this will take a couple of tries 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.090
 but afterwards it will close there as not 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.340
 can see from wing the gate is 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.530
 totally closed and what we do is 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.050
 we can already fly on our plane with 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.290
 our burden an important thing is that 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.680
 have to keep in mind is that the 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.680
 Cars can not be transported 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.350
 they always end up destroyed after 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.009
 that one takes you from one place to another but 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:14.160
 that you can transport motorcycles or 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.430
 we can simply transport 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.490
 other kinds of things there do not have in 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.070
 the online is going to be this plane would be 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.550
 very funny you can leave your 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.409
 friends and transport them better said 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.159
 reach all your band 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:36.249
 already as I told you right now we are going to 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:37.360
 open the gate again and they're going to 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:39.999
 realize that the vehicle is 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.499
 destroyed then that's so that 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:43.839
 take into account both swim 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:46.300
 vehicle is rather motorcycles the 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:49.089
 motorcycles if they work if you can 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.089
 carry or not just stay 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:55.479
 disorganized around the gate 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:57.789
 but let's see that they are not totally 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.600
 destroyed also another vehicle 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:03.540
 you can take the ATV 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.720
 and also works here again has given 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.630
 the deal open the gate is a bit 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.500
 of practice let's say it does not always come out 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.420
 at first 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.200
 and when we have the vehicle the 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.009
 gate fully opens the tour of 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.770
 the destruction 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.930
 and so 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.919
 I hope you liked the video that 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:29.699
 try to teach it and I already say goodbye 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.699
 we see until the next 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:45.040
